# Babelbit Test-Data for Miners
For each competition your submission will be tested on validation data, in a similar format to the data contained in this repo. There are 20,000 challenge files, each containing 5 chunks of dialogue. As time goes on, we will provide more diverse test data, e.g. different domains (interview, chat, podcast, Q&A session, board meeting etc etc) and different languages, probably adding German within a few days.
