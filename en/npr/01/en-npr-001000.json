        "As you just heard, we were speaking with Sal Russo of the Tea Party Express.",
        "Of course they've gotten a lot of attention.",
        "Do you think the Tea Party represents the future of conservatism?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF OVERLAPPING VOICES)",
        "Then John Edwards lumped Clinton in with about the worst people he could think of.",
        "Well, I think it represents a moment, and I think that conservatism in my view has had a series of successive moments.",
        "Sal offered a historical view that is very widely shared, which is that the conservatism that we know today flows naturally from the conservatism of the late 1950s as articulated by William F.",
        "Buckley, Jr., a figure greatly admired by many conservatives.",
        "I would argue that it's somewhat different, that actually we've had a series of different conservatisms and that the Tea Party is only the most recent.",
        "And one reason this has come to mind recently is that I had the great pleasure of reading this fascinating exchange of letters between Barry Goldwater, the Arizona senator who is widely seen as a stalwart conservative, who really shaped modern conservatism in all kinds of ways, and George Romney, the father of current Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.",
        "And the debate they had was basically over whether or not the Republican Party should be an ideological party.",
        "Should it be a party that represents a clear set of shared principles, or should it be more of a coalition?",
        "Keep that questions - I want you to keep that in your mind, that question in your mind, and I want to hear the answer to it when we come back after a short break, and you're going to stay with us, Reihan.",
        "Reihan Salam is our guest.",
        "We're talking about what it means to be a conservative.",
        "And we'd love to hear from you.",
        "If you're a conservative, what does it mean to you?",

        "This is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I'm Lynn Neary.",
        "Ron Paul recently said if you're going to be conservative, you're supposed to follow the Constitution and always limit the power and the scope of the federal government.",
        "It's a theme we've seen played out throughout the Republican primaries.",
        "What and who is a real conservative?",
        "We want to hear from those of you who identify as conservatives.",
        "What does it mean to you to be conservative?",
        "800-989-8255 is the number, and the email address is talk@npr.org.",
        "Our guest is Reihan Salam.",
        "He writes for the Daily and the National Review, and he co-wrote the book \"\"Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.",
        "And as we went to the break, Reihan, you were posing a sort of interesting rhetorical question, which I'd like you to continue with that, if you could.",
        "Oh, of course.",
        "So there has been a tension for a long time within the Republican Party over whether the party should be a loose coalition, in which people disagree about a lot of issues, particularly about social issues, or whether or not it should be a very ideologically unified party, and in being ideologically unified exert more leverage on the broader political system.",
        "And I'd say that there's been a really big change, primarily driven, I would argue, by campaign finance regulations from the early '70s on towards being a more ideologically unified party, and that has brought some benefits, but it has also brought some significant costs to the Republican Party.",
        "What are the negatives of being too ideological, if you think it's gone in that direction?",
        "Well, again, I wouldn't say that it's a matter of being too ideological, but what I would say is that, well, the obvious cost is that it becomes far more difficult to be flexible once you are actually governing.",
        "So one of the things that George Romney, who was a governor of Michigan in the 1960s, warned against is that if you have parties that are very ideologically rigid, it's going to be very hard for them to reach compromises across the aisle.",
        "So back then you had parties that had very vague platforms, whereas now, more recently, as Americans have grown more educated, they want more consistency from their politicians.",
        "They want to know that, well, if you pledge to do X and Y on taxes, you will deliver X and Y once in office.",
        "But the truth is that legislative compromise is always a very messy process."

        "And sometimes you go into office with one set of assumptions, and then once you're actually at the negotiating table, you sometimes have to do things a little differently.",
        "Now, if your followers punish you for that kind of behavior, well, that means that you're not going to engage in that kind of compromising behavior, whether you're on the political left or the political right.",
        "And I would say that that poses a really big problem when you encounter new challenges, new circumstances, shocks to the system that you didn't necessarily anticipate when you were running for office rather than governing.",
        "All right, let's take a call now from Jim; he's in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.",
        "Hi, Jim.",
        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "And I am a conservative and have been since really before my college days, and I identify myself as a social conservative and a fiscal conservative.",
        "And part - you know, my main basis for that is the Bill of Rights in the Constitution and my faith, my personal Catholic faith.",
        "So those are the foundations for my conservatism.",
        "And would you say, Reihan, is that - would you say that that's fairly typical for somebody who would identify themselves as conservative?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that there are a lot of religiously devout Americans who embrace conservative views on social and on fiscal issues.",
        "And Jim, how is your belief, how does that translate into policy for you?",
        "Well, I would like to see the protection for the unborn and protection for the elderly that currently is - I see it as currently being severely undermined.",
        "And so I would like to see every person have a chance for life and liberty and the wonderful things that we have in this country."

        "All right, thank you so much for your call, Jim.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Now, so we're hearing from Jim that social issues are really important to him, and I would ask you, Reihan, as somebody who is looking towards creating the conservatism of the future, of being there - when you have the tension between social conservatives and fiscal conservatives, and some fiscal conservatives really do not agree with all the goals of social conservatism, how do you resolve that?",
        "She says she will turn up the heat on George Bush and the Republicans, but when the crucial vote came on stopping Bush, Cheney and the neocons on Iran, she voted with Bush and Cheney.",
        "They now manufacture these things.",
        "Well, I think that there's a fairly straightforward way.",
        "It's not something that's embraced by all conservatives.",
        "But I think one strategy is to say that, well, wait a second, a lot of these issues that are the most controversial issues in our country, as they relate to civil rights for gays and lesbians, as they relate to abortion laws, these were things that had traditionally been dealt with at the state and local level rather than be nationalized.",
        "And so that's one way a lot of conservatives reconcile this issue.",
        "They say, you know, let's shift those issues back to state governments, allow state governments to compete for citizens in terms of offering different mixes of social regulation and also economic regulation, and in that way allow all states to serve citizens better.",
        "All right, let me just read one more email to you before you have to go.",
        "This is from John(ph) in St. Louis, Missouri: I believe the true definition of conservatism is embodied in Nixon's Checkers speech.",
        "Though I will always consider myself conservative, that label today is worn by those who can only be described as extreme right-wing radicals and religious fundamentalists, hardly a textbook definition of the word conservative.",
        "Right there I think you've got a summary of some of the problems facing your movement, Reihan.",
        "Well, I guess I disagree.",
        "I think the folks who believe that, who take that perspective, have really been lost to the conservative movement for a very long time.",
        "My own suspicion is that on a lot of substantive policy issues, the party has actually moved to the center, yet that's very hard to see because a lot of folks tend to focus on the enthusiasm and energy of the Tea Party movement."

        "But if you look at issues relating to reforming health entitlements, if you look at the tax code, I actually think you see folks like Pat Toomey, the Pennsylvania senator and former head of the Club for Growth, saying, well, wait a second, you know, it actually might be sensible to compromise some of our views on these issues.",
        "Paul Ryan is someone who has embraced ideas that had been championed by Democrats in the late 1990s for how to get out of our entitlement mess.",
        "But the thing is that people hear this hard-edged, confrontational, ideological language, and they say, ah, well, these guys are right-wing lunatics, when in fact a lot of that's the prism through which the media presents these stories and also through which we hear things.",
        "So I think that it's more complicated than that.",
        "Well, Reihan, thanks so much for being with us today.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Reihan Salam co-wrote the book \"\"Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream,\"\" and he joined us from our bureau in New York.",
        "Well, as we've been hearing, the conservative identity has shifted over the years, and so to help put all this in context, we turn to Jack Pitney.",
        "He's a political scientist who writes about Republicans and conservatives, and he joins us from a studio in Claremont, California.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "So you know, I remember a time, and I'm dating myself by saying this, when, you know, I think conservatives were sort of considered somewhat to be on the fringe of American politics, and I'm thinking of, you know, the Barry Goldwater election, where he was so roundly trounced by Lyndon Johnson.",
        "He was really rejected at that time, and then gradually he moved in to become a much more powerful politician on the national scene, and conservatives in general became much more powerful.",
        "How did this transition occur from people being very skeptical, feeling like the conservatives were sort of fringe, to them being at the center of political power?",
        "The key figure here was Ronald Reagan because Reagan did two things that were extremely important.",
        "First, he presented a friendly face to conservatism.",
        "Whereas conservatives prior to Reagan were often very angry, Reagan was very cheerful, very optimistic, and people could relate to him on a human level."
