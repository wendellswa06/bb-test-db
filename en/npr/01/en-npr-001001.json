        "So Reagan put a friendly human face on conservatism.",
        "The second thing, of course, that Reagan did, and a lot of contemporary liberals emphasize this point, is that he could compromise when he had to.",
        "His first major act as governor of California was the largest tax increase in California history.",
        "Reagan also signed the most liberal abortion law in the United States up to that time.",
        "So Reagan, known historically as a hard-charging conservative, was actually a pragmatist when he had to be.",
        "Now, you, I think - you worked on the Hill in the 1980s when Reagan was president.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "That's correct.",
        "Yeah.",
        "OK, so what do you think of where things are moving now, where there seems to be this extremely hard-edged conservatism, very unwilling to compromise?",
        "I know that Sal Russo just said that wasn't the case, but it is the perception people have, that there's very little room for compromise with many of the conservatives in office and on the Hill today.",
        "What's your take on where things are at now in terms of conservatism?",
        "Well, during the 1980s, Reagan had to contend with a lot of dissent within his own party.",
        "In 1982 he supported a tax increase that Newt Gingrich at the time characterized as Ronald Reagan serving as the - serving as the coach for the welfare state, that he was going to score a touchdown for the welfare state.",
        "And since then we've seen something happen at both parties in Congress.",
        "The conservative Republicans have become more conservative; the liberal Democrats have become more liberal.",
        "During the 1980s, Reagan was able to win enactment of much of his policy through the support of conservative Southern Democrats.",
        "Well, those conservative Southern Democrats are largely absent.",
        "Conversely, a lot of the liberal Republicans who held a good deal of influence in the 1980s and 1990s are also gone.",
        "So part of the problem that you alluded to at the beginning of the program is that you have two parties with very little common ground.",
        "That's was where the compromises were reached in the 1980s, between the more conservative to moderate Democrats, the more liberal to moderate Republicans.",
        "That's what makes the compromise difficult to reach in the current Congress.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take a call now.",

        "I want less government.",
        "I want the government to be involved and to intervene only when that is constitutionally necessary.",
        "I think the civil rights movement is a good example of the government saying, we need to assert these rights because they exist in all people and are articulated in the Constitution.",
        "So that's where I come from in conservatism.",
        "On the social issues, they get in the way, it seems, of finding the common ground.",
        "And I'll tell you, my 98-year-old grandmother who's been a conservative and Republican since before women can vote, who drives and plays competitive bridge, is really getting disturbed by this polarization and lack of statesmanship in what are supposed to be the conservative movement.",
        "All right.",
        "Keith, thanks for that point.",
        "And I'm going to ask Jack Pitney to respond and to - I mean, when did, you know, the social issues become such a prominent part of the conservative movement.",
        "And is that where the tension within conservativism began, or was there always a tension within conservativism?",
        "There have always been tensions within conservatism.",
        "The tensions have involved policy, tensions have involved matters of strategy and tactics, where what we today consider to be the social issues came into play was in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",
        "This was the time when President Reagan was beginning to draw religious conservatives, particularly in the South, into the Republican Party in a way they hadn't been present before.",
        "So that's really the historical time in which issues such as abortion and gay rights became prominent in the party.",
        "Although an important distinction has to be made on social issues.",
        "Two different sets of issues here, abortion and gay rights.",
        "And they're taking very different paths.",
        "If you look at conservatives today, particularly among younger conservatives, I think you're seeing more acceptance of gay rights even among younger conservatives' support for gay marriage.",
        "Abortion is a very different story.",
        "A lot of conservatives care very much about abortion, and their position hasn't changed.",
        "And as we see in the current fight over the HHS rules, they're very willing to take a very public stand and fight very hard on that.",
        "So I think the abortion issue is on a very different track from the gay rights issue.",
        "Let me read this email to you and just get your reaction to it.",
        "Dear folks, I was a Republican all my life.",
        "That changed in 2008, when John McCain put Ms. Palin on the ticket, and the far right attacked the religion, citizenry and loyalty of Barack Obama.",
        "I knew the extreme had hijacked the party.",
        "I literally worked on the bus with Ronald Reagan in 1976 and '80.",
        "I knew and worked for Jack Kempt(ph) and had the pleasure - Kemp - and had the pleasure of working - knowing Senator Goldwater.",
        "And all of them knew how to govern, get things done, work with others, and more importantly, take on the extreme in their own party.",
        "I hear the Tea Party talk about big government and high taxes yet not a peep from them when President Bush passed the prescription drug benefit or President Bush bailed out Wall Street or the auto industry.",
        "Only after Obama was elected did they all get crazy.",
        "Well, the Tea Party movement, as we know it, didn't start until a couple of years ago.",
        "As far as the bailout goes, as far as the prescription drug benefit goes, actually, those were extremely controversial within the Republican Party.",
        "It took a lot of arm-twisting for Speaker Hastert to pass the prescription drug bill.",
        "And as far as the bailout goes, President Bush dealt with enormous pushback from Republicans within Capitol Hill and certainly from the grassroots.",
        "So on those two particular issues, Republicans have been very vocal and very active all along.",
        "As far as the 2008 election goes, there were some Republicans who supported President Obama.",
        "But if you look at the exit polls, you find that Barack Obama did not do noticeably better among Republicans than John Kerry had done four years earlier."

        "We could do so much better by phasing out every deduction in our tax code over four or five years, including the mortgage and personal deduction.",
        "And in that way, we could probably lower tax rates or at least even them up between corporate tax rates and personal tax rates in a much more sensible way.",
        "The tax code, by consensus, is just unwieldy right now.",
        "And the simplest thing we could do is start simplifying that tax code.",
        "As far as personal liberty, I believe (unintelligible) people should be self-governors, that they should govern themselves and they should be responsible to their actions.",
        "In that sense, I kind of lean towards Ron Paul, but I thought the best person in the whole race, including the Republicans, was former two-term governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico, who presented a very nice fiscal conservative platform, along with personal responsibility, including, like Ron Paul, legalizing most drugs and then holding people responsible for the use and the severity of regulations based on the harm to public health.",

        "The trouble for libertarians is that most voters aren't consistent when it comes to their political views.",
        "Conservatism favors strong government activity in certain areas, restricted government in others, and the converse is true of liberalism.",
        "It may not be the most logical and coherent form of philosophy, but that's - those are the poles along which American public opinion tends to fall.",
        "Libertarianism, which, again, has a very long tradition, just doesn't have the kind of popularity that people thought it might have.",
