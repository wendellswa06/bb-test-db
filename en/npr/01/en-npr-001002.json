        "Farai, what I think it does - certainly the meeting is not new.",
        "We have been reporting on this.",
        "I've been reporting on this meeting for quite some time.",
        "Ashcroft's recollection of what happened differs greatly from what others who were at the meeting recall.",
        "What I think these new series of notes from the FBI director does is that it adds to the body of evidence that's out there that contradicts or, to some extent, adds clarity to what Gonzales knew or didn't know about the meetings and indeed what he recollects about what happened.",
        "The sense is several legislators on the Hill are going to look at these new notes and say - and sort of renew their call for the attorney general to step down.",

        "But you can certainly expect the heat to continue.",

        "Right.",
        "…Ashcroft lying in a hospital bed.",
        "You have Gonzales allegedly harassing him.",
        "You have this program, the domestic surveillance still being very controversial.",
        "Gonzales caught up in the firing of federal prosecutors allegedly.",
        "Are you surprised with all of these that Gonzales is still hanging on?",
        "And secondly, that it was senior adviser Karl Rove who stepped down this week and that there's a new announcement by Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, that he's going to leave as well.",
        "Why do you think those gentlemen are stepping out while Gonzales continues to hang on, specifically in terms of the president making that decision?",
        "In the past, Clinton stuck to her frontrunner strategy, targeting President Bush and the Republicans rather than paying attention to which of her opponents was targeting her.",
        "That ended last night.",
        "(As Mother) Ralphie, Randy's got to go.",
        "Well, there are still - there's two big reasons why Gonzales is hanging on.",
        "One is personal loyalty.",
        "President Bush has shown repeatedly that personal loyalty means everything to him that's why he nominated Harriet Miers for the Supreme Court, which even shocked fellow Republicans.",
        "And the other thing is that the Justice Department, quite frankly, is in a state of disarray right now, Farai.",
        "The - to remove the attorney general at this point would cause even more chaos, and you've got confirmation hearings then the (unintelligible) process to worry about up on Capitol Hill.",
        "But many people have been urging - and I mean, President Bush's supporters and associates, that many have been urging him to nudge Gonzales on out of there and bring in somebody new even like, say, Sandra Day O'Connor, somebody who would be a figure that would bring people together right now, but he's not doing it."

        "So you think Gonzales is going to go the distance?",
        "It looks that way at this point.",
        "We certainly are seeing, as you mentioned, an exodus of key White House people largely because President Bush's biggest agenda items like Social Security reform and immigration have really -they're really dead in the water right now.",
        "He's moving into a strange kind of lame-duck period for the remainder of his term looks like where the big agenda items are overseas, the war in Iraq thing being central and the war on terror.",
        "Karl Rove that's not his specialty and he is gone off apparently to work on the Bush legacy and his own.",
        "Tony Snow, of course, has had his cancer problems to worry about.",
        "And there are - this is - right now, August is a good time for a lot of people both the White House and up on Capitol Hill to talk about leaving.",
        "All right.",
        "Clarence, we're going to turn now to a column that you wrote this week for the Chicago Tribune.",
        "It was in response to a study that says when a neighborhood becomes integrated, it causes stress for those who live there, at least for the short term.",
        "So briefly, what are some of the other things the study said?",
        "Well, the study, first of all, is by Robert Putnam, a Harvard professor, famous for a book called \"\"Bowling Alone\"\" that came out a few years ago and it talked about how civic engagement has been in decline in America over the last few decades.",
        "More people are bowling, but they're bowling alone, not in bowling leagues.",
        "And the same kind of thing can be seen in a lot of different aspects of civic life.",
        "The - his new study that stirs up as much controversy is a continuation of his research that looks at what factors lead to civic disengagement.",
        "And one big factor, much to his surprise, is diversity, racial and ethic diversity in a community, at least in the short term…",
        "Let me…",
        "…at least - yes?",
        "I'm sorry to jump in, but we only have a little bit of time.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "No, I think it's common sense.",
        "I think that's been the case for the last, you know, 50, 60 years when the integration people were moving into different neighborhoods.",
        "I also think there is a value in ethnic neighborhoods in preserving ethnic pockets in societies and cities.",
        "But I'm not surprised nor is it a shock that there is this tension.",
        "You know, I live in an integrated neighborhood and, you know, it's always an adjustment, but I think we're getting past it, and once you can get past that first year or so, it's fine.",
        "John, Miami is one of these places where racial and ethnic groups move around each other like tectonic plates in an earthquake.",
        "What do you see?",
        "Well, Farai, it seems clear to me, certainly, if you have a choice at least in my case, I would prefer to live in a diverse neighborhood.",
        "However, this surprise - this study does not surprise me a great deal when we think about why many of us move out to live in diverse neighborhoods.",
        "Sometimes it doesn't necessarily have as much to do with our neighbors as it has to do with the fact that we want our kids to go to better schools, we want better housing value, and things like that.",
        "So it doesn't - I mean, how many of us know who our neighbors are?",
        "I know some of my neighbors, but I certainly don't want to sit here and claim to know all of them.",
        "And I live in a diverse neighborhood.",
