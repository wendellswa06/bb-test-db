        "I've got ask you, Scott: Tell me something about Bob Clark, because Bob Clark was in some ways one of the most successful film directors in history.",
        "I mean, you don't think of him in the same breath as, you know, Federico Fellini or Alfred Hitchcock, but he not only did this film, which has a life way beyond what one would have expected of a holiday film in the early '80s, but also directed one of the - maybe to this day the top-grossing Canadian film of all time, which was \"\"Porky's,\"\" which I think of as a kind of warm-up for \"\"A Christmas Story.",
        "He didn't have as good a cast nor as good a story as he had in \"\"A Christmas Story,\"\" but, you know, he was actually later in his career nominated for a Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, and he also directed some perfectly dreadful, awful movies.",
        "What was he like to work with, and what's your appreciation of him as an artist?",
        "Bob was a one-of-a-kind kind of person.",
        "The things that he did, I mean, you go - before \"\"Porky's\"\" there was a film called \"\"Black Christmas\"\" that he did, which is a very, extremely low-budget horror picture.",
        "And right after he did that, as it came out, he had a meeting with a small director named John Carpenter.",
        "And John had seen \"\"Black Christmas\"\" and came up with this wacky idea to do a Halloween movie, and it just - the scheduling wasn't right for Bob, but he actually helped John Carpenter do some things to create \"\"Halloween.",
        "Wow."

        "Right, right, right.",
        "So I mean, again, just unbelievable.",
        "Now, \"\"A Christmas Story\"\" comes to be because of \"\"Porky's,\"\" because Bob had the pull at MGM, and they wanted to do \"\"Porky's II\"\" right away, and Bob said absolutely, no problem, right after I do \"\"Christmas Story.\"\" And they said, well, no, no, no, no, we want you do \"\"Porky's II.",
