        "I think it'll be longer than months because, for example, with Three Mile Island it was pretty evident that there was fuel damage, but it wasn't until almost four years later that a camera was dropped down into the reactor vessel that revealed - we really were able to determine just how bad that damage had been.",
        "All right.",

        "You bet.",
        "Thanks, Ira.",
        "And at Three Mile Island, they had talked - I think if I recall they were using robots to try to go where there was too much radiation.",
        "Are there other thoughts about here, or is it too early to even think that way?",
        "Well, I'm sure that the authorities are trying to use all the options they have available, including robots.",
        "But I'm not really on the ground.",
        "So I don't know what the extent of damage they have and what options they have in their quiver.",
        "But I'm sure every conceivable options is being considered as they try to deal with this disaster.",
        "Hey, Ira, it's Joe here.",
        "I just wanted to - there was one thing you said as we were starting out that kind of I wanted to clarify a bit, and that is this notion that the near-misses didn't result in accidents, and that was a lucky thing.",
        "I think lucky in the generic sense, but I've talked to a lot of plant engineers, and, I mean, they know that accidents or mistakes or unforeseen things will happen, and they feel that it's not luck that takes care of these problems so much as adequate planning.",
        "Now, what we've heard in this particular scenario is that nobody actually - they may have planned for an earthquake, and they may have planned for a tsunami, but it seems as if they may not have planned for an earthquake and tsunami of the magnitude that they were faced with.",
        "And so you would say, well, they were unlucky that their planning wasn't adequate, but I don't think it's always luck that, you know, prevents problems from occurring.",
        "These are things that engineers tell you they think about all the time, and when problems occur, and they're solved, they say, well, see, it worked; not, oh my goodness, we were lucky.",

        "Well, to some extent.",

        "That's all described in chapter nine of that book.",
        "No one in the United States or Japan did anything about that problem.",
        "So to say that, you know, we didn't anticipate this is not really true.",
        "The fact that we didn't react to the known problem is true, and Japan is paying a high price for allowing that known safety hazard to go unresolved.",
        "Charles Ferguson, what's your take on all of this?",
        "Well, yeah, I'm agreeing with a lot that Joe and Dave are saying.",
        "But I think another issue, and we might get into it a little bit later, I don't want to necessarily preempt, but a question of the plant design itself.",
        "Five of the six reactors at Fukushima Dai-ichi are of this boiling water reactor Mark One-type design, and concerns were raised as far back as 1972, one year after reactor unit one at the plant began operations, that that particular design had some serious design problems.",
        "And concerns were yet again raised throughout the 1970s and even into the 1980s.",
        "And I know Dave has done some work directly on that type of model plant, and we have 23 of similar type designs operating right now in the United States, roughly a quarter of our reactor fleet in the United States.",
        "Does anybody think that any - this kind of accident has the potential to happen in this country?",
        "This is Dave.",
        "I would say so.",
        "The primary challenge that was faced in Japan was the loss of power that lasted longer than anybody anticipated.",
        "If you look at studies that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has performed in this country as recently as 2004, our reactors, which have less battery capacity than Japan does, has a very high chance of getting into the same situation.",
        "The River Bend plant outside of Baton Rouge in Louisiana, according to the NRC, has an 87 percent chance of a station blackout.",
        "That's when you lose the normal connection to the grid, the connection to the emergency diesel generators, and the batteries are exhausted.",
        "There's an 87 percent chance that that scenario will lead to core - reactor core melt at the River Bend plant."

        "And if things were to stay the way they are, that's probably overly cautious, but of course we can't anticipate what's going to happen in the next days or week even.",
        "Nor can we anticipate which way the winds are going to blow, which is such an important component to the whole story.",
        "And we've been saved to a great extent right now by the fact that the winds have basically been offshore, blowing into the sea.",
        "Should the winds change, should the amount of radioactive material continue to increase, then they're probably not being overly cautious.",
