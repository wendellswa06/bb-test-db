        "Do you have any idea, given all of your experience and all your years of dealing with nuclear reactors and watching what's progressing here, can you give me what you think is the most likely endgame that's going to happen here?",
        "Let me start with you, Dave, and then we'll move through.",
        "Well, my hope is that they're able to get water back in by either the water cannons, the aerial drops from a helicopter or other means.",
        "Yesterday they were able to reestablish an electrical power line to the plant.",
        "So the hope would be that workers are able to get water back into the pools, which would reduce the radiation levels and allow workers to more freely move through the plant to take mitigative measures.",
        "If that fails, then the problems are - the next step is likely to start doing what Chernobyl did, was bring in sand and other materials to try to smother the situation and blanket the radiation so it doesn't go far and wide.",
        "Obviously the hope is for the former, but right now the latter can't be ruled out.",
        "And David?"

        "Well, in terms of the radiation doses to the population, if things stay roughly the way they are and don't get too much worse, we are looking at something a little worse than Three Mile Island but nothing like the other extreme, as a Chernobyl incident.",
        "And even if things get significantly worse, we are still very much on the scale of Three Mile Island and absolutely nowhere near a Chernobyl-type incident.",
        "So from the population standpoint, I think we will see a small increase in long-term cancer risks, but I stress it's very likely to be very small and maybe even not detectable in any type of studies we might do.",
        "That is different, of course, from the situation of the workers inside the nuclear power plants.",
        "There's little doubt that they are getting extremely high radiation doses, and the possibility of fatalities among those brave men is, I think, unfortunately quite high.",
        "Charles Ferguson, the fact that these rods are out in the open, and we've had a history of trying to find storage space, at least the Yucca Mountain, you know, the decades of Yucca Mountain and not going anywhere with them.",
        "Does it argue more now for trying to get them out of these pools, into some other drier, more safe place, not exposed to the elements?",
        "It does, Ira, and it's kind of ironic.",
        "Right after September 11th, I and others who were, you know, worried about the nuclear terrorism threat started to do analysis about nuclear power plant security.",
        "And Robert Alvarez and some colleagues did an excellent paper, I think, back around 2002, 2003, and it was peer-reviewed.",
        "And it prompted a study by the National Academy of Sciences looking at the vulnerability of the spent-nuclear fuel pools in the United States to terrorist attacks.",
        "So we were so focused on terrorist attack that nature hit us with this double whammy that now has raised new concerns about the vulnerability of spent-fuel pools that if they develop cracks and leaks and they're drained as we're apparently seeing in pool number four and perhaps in pool three that the spent fuel if it's hot enough could catch fire or the zirconium clouding the zircaloy material could catch fire.",
        "It burns very, very hot, and that could lead to a release of radioactive materials.",
        "So getting back to your point, I think, we need to do another reevaluation to try to move as soon as possible the oldest spent-fuel material out of those pools in the United States and other locations and store them in dry storage casts.",
        "This is being done in Germany.",
        "And the reason why it's not being done so much in the United States - it's being done to an extent in the United States but not to a large extent because of the additional cost.",
        "You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking this hour about nuclear energy, radiation and what's going on in Japan with Dave Lochbaum of Union of Concerned Scientists; David Brenner of Columbia University Medical Center; Charles Ferguson, president of the Federation of American Scientists."

        "Thank you for having me.",

        "There is some chance of a worker receiving radiation exposure, but when you balance that against these natural disasters or even possible terrorist attacks and a type of an accident that releases radioactive materials, then it does maybe tilt the balance toward moving this material to dry storage casts as quickly as possible.",
        "David Lochbaum, would you agree?",
        "Oh, entirely.",
        "That's probably the best thing we could do.",

        "Station blackout was 87 percent of all the things that could lead to reactor core meltdown.",

        "So what we said was that the NRC is a very capable regulator.",
        "They just need to be more consistently effective in that regard.",
        "If you look at over the years, the times you heard UCS whine sometimes that are more better voiced, but the times you've heard us whine about stuff it's not that we're arguing that the NRC has set the safety bar at too low a level.",
        "We generally think the NRC set the safety bar at the right level, but they're allowing one or more plants to limbo beneath that bar, rather than meet those regulations.",
        "Does it have anything to do with funding levels?",
        "I mean, you know, there are all these budgetary cut bills in Congress.",
