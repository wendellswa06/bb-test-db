        "But even in Japan, the way iodine gets into the human body is actually through dairy products.",
        "The radioactive iodine falls to the ground, the cows eat it with the grass.",
        "It gets concentrated in the milk.",
        "And if you drink the milk, you're going to get exposed.",
        "So the simple solution there is not to drink the milk, and the iodine pills are certainly not harmful in any way.",
        "But they shouldn't be considered any sort of panacea against radiation exposure because they're not.",
        "Dave Lochbaum, what - as we watch this develop over the next days and weeks, what would you like to see that's hopeful?",

        "Well, the good news would be for the workers to reestablish water or restore water in all six spent fuel pools, regain control of the cooling of that water and, at the same time or in parallel, reduce the temperature of the water in the three reactor cores - units one, two and three - to less than 212 degrees, less than blowing.",
        "That's not a perfectly safe condition, but that configuration will give workers as much margin as possible should more equipment fail or should aftershocks cause more damage.",
        "So that's - if they get to that configuration, I think, that would be a good sign.",
        "Should we expect to see more release of hydrogen?",
        "Where is that hydrogen coming from?",
        "The hydrogen is formed when the - by a chemical reaction between exposed fuel, whether it's in the spent fuel pool or in the reactor core, and the steam that's flowing by it that causes that chemical reaction that produces large amounts of hydrogen.",
        "Which doesn't normally occur.",
        "Some hydrogen is produced as water flows through the reactor core.",
        "The water molecules are disassociated into their oxygen and hydrogen constituents but in relatively small amounts and are handled through normal systems.",
        "It's when you get this chemical reaction of exposed fuel that you get tremendously larger quantities of hydrogen being formed.",
        "So if they can keep the fuel rods covered, we should not expect to see much more hydrogen.",
        "I hope not to see anymore of that.",
        "That's - we've seen enough of that.",
        "And that would be a sign that they are uncovered if we continue to see that hydrogen.",
        "That's a pretty - that plus the high radiation levels are pretty good signs that something is still uncovered that needs to be dealt with."
