        "You know, in the last decade or so, you've had half a billion people in India who are now below the age of 25.",
        "That is almost two times the population of the United States.",
        "Now, if you have so many young people, you have at the same time a lot of impatience, a lot of restlessness.",
        "And to me the most important thing was what happens when that hope does not move into reality.",
        "If you have so many young people and they are despairing, what does that mean?",
        "And so kind of my novel grew as a result of that.",

        "Le Maho and his team equipped some penguins with heart monitors and saw that when the rovers approached instead of humans, stress levels stayed low.",
        "When the rover is approaching, the increasing heart rate is about the same that bird has when another penguin is passing by.",
        "But the disguise has to be good."
