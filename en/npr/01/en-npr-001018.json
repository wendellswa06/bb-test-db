        "There're some things that they're discussing.",
        "One of them is, you may have noticed that when you buy a cell phone, it has to be approved by your carrier.",
        "So if I buy one from Verizon - say I'm going to switch, go to AT&T - I can't just do that.",
        "I actually have to go and get a new cell phone from AT&T.",
        "Well, the FCC with this new spectrum is considering making a rule that they have to let any device on their spectrum.",

        "And the other thing they're considering is allowing people to download any software they want onto their phone.",
        "Right now you probably notice that you can't download every bit of software that you want.",
        "The other thing - the other big thing they're talking about here is forcing whoever buys it to rent out portions of spectrum.",
        "So that would mean the possibility that some other carriers could come along and say we're going rent spectrum and start a new cell phone business.",
        "And consumer groups like this because it means there could be more competition, not just the big four: Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T and Sprint.",
        "Well, there are these four biggies who were set to bid on this spectrum and there could be others bidding on it.",
        "But then Google came in and said if you change these rules so that we can go in the direction that you've just kind of outlined, then we'll get in and we guarantee that we're going to bid more than four-and-a-half-billion dollars for some of this, and everything will be better for everybody.",
        "Google indeed, though, has an interest.",
        "There's a reason that they're getting behind the same positions as the consumer groups.",
        "Because for them, right, if your cell phone can download any software, you can go to Google, right?",
        "If your cell phone isn't blocked from going to specific places or your mobile device or your PDA, and if you look at your mobile device you will see it is blocked.",
        "There's a lot of things you can't download and can't get.",
        "But you will now have the option, if it's open, of going to Google, anywhere, anytime, any place, and they like that idea.",
        "The anti-Google position I've read from industry groups does make sense in a way, but only in a way that could be dreamed up by a Washington lobby group, I think.",
        "Essentially they argue that the potential huge savings for consumers being able to switch back and forth on plans might make the spectrum, in total, kind of less valuable.",
        "So the government - that is, taxpayers - might lose something along the way, despite the fact that consumers, the people who buy these phones, likely would be saving a lot.",
        "Can they actually make this argument with a straight face?",
        "Well, they can make this argument.",
        "For one thing, it is more valuable to them if they can hold onto complete control of the spectrum and they can decide what wireless devices you're going to use and what software you're going to download.",
        "It's more valuable to the taxpayer because they're willing to bid more on it and so therefore from the auction the taxpayers are going to make more money.",
        "So those are two of their big arguments.",
        "But aren't the taxpayers, the 240 million people, who owns cell phones, who are presumably going to get cheaper service because cell phones will be cheaper?",
        "Well, they say cell phones might not be cheaper because right now they subsidize the cost of a cell phone, so you would have to pay for the cell phone yourself.",
        "On the other hand, you could take it with you if you decide you don't like Verizon and you want to go to AT&T."
