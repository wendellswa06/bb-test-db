        "It's set in Mumbai, where Bollywood - basically, all the Bollywood films are made.",
        "So, that's what I was hearing, was that the ending of \"\"Slumdog Millionaire\"\" was sort of an homage to Bollywood?",

        "But Bollywood, by the way, is only about a third of what India produces.",
        "I mean, India, as you rightly said, produces the most films in the world, about 800 to 900 every year.",

        "Well, that's also right to say about Bollywood.",
        "You know, in Hollywood, in the Western world, when we think about films, we think of different genre films: There are comedies; there are dramas; there's occasionally musicals; there are lots of action films; there are horror films.",
        "A Bollywood, typical Bollywood film, has all these elements to them, definitely romances, definitely songs, so hence the musical; there's definitely drama; there's definitely comedy because the Indian audience, the basic Indian audience, they expect that, and so, Bollywood films normally are a concoction of all these different genres together, although things are changing slowly.",
        "I see.",
        "Well, yes, you were saying, so things are changing slowly, as in - I was suggesting in the beginning that there's more of an edgy quality or those are the films being made outside of Bollywood?",
        "In fact what's happening is - it's really interesting.",
        "In the last, say, 10 to 15 years as India's economy has been liberalized and cable television is exploding in India and, you know, now you get DVDs of practically every film that's made in the West, especially the American indie films, the European films, the Asian films, there's a whole group of young filmmakers in their 30s, some in their 40s, who grew up with a staple diet of Bollywood.",
        "But they've have also been watching non-Indian cinema.",
        "And what they're developing is this whole style of filmmaking - sometimes it'll be just an action film; sometimes it's a film that's looking at the underworld, the crimes situation in Bombay, for instance - but there is definitely an inspiration of Bollywood.",
        "Most of these films are still being made in Mumbai, Bombay.",
        "They'll have songs, but the characters don't necessarily break into songs and dances.",
        "So, it's a more realistic way of filmmaking, very exciting, and yet there are touches of Bollywood.",
