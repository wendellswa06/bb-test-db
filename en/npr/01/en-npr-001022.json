        "I wonder, Aseem Chhabra, I saw a film.",
        "I don't know - I'm going to try to describe it and you can tell me if it's Bollywood or not - but it was a film about a football player who was disgraced in a match between India and Pakistan, and he's then subsequently asked to become the coach of a women's team in India.",
        "Yeah, it wasn't a football; it was actually field hockey.",
        "Oh, field hockey, yes, that's right.",
        "Yes.",
        "So, you know that film, because - I mean, I actually started watching it because the person sitting next to me on an international flight was watching it, and I didn't really know anything about it, but I found it very captivating."

        "It's called \"\"Chak De India,\"\" and actually, the same actor I mentioned earlier, Shahrukh Khan, was in this film also.",
        "Now, that's an example of a film that's been made within the framework of Bollywood and yet it is a very different film.",
        "It does take up some realistic issues, and what I really liked about the film was that the women who acted, you know, who are part of the team, each one of them got a chance.",
        "Their personality, their characters, were very well-written, and so, the superstar in the film was Shahrukh Khan, who was the coach of the team; he doesn't sort of take over the whole film.",
        "Every supporting character gets a role, and it's a very inspiring movie that really changed the mood in India.",
        "People loved it.",
        "Well, I have to say, I found it very interesting.",
        "But as I - as you were talking, I realized it didn't feel like Bollywood and I guess I was right that it wasn't exactly Bollywood.",
        "Let's take another call now from Daryl in Sacramento, California.",
        "Hi, I'm not Indian-American, but I've been following Bollywood movies for the past few years, and you were asking earlier for favorite Bollywood movies.",
        "One of my favorites is a movie called \"\"Dhoom 2.",
        "Doom 2\"\"?",
        "It's spelled D-H-O-O-M.",
        "Oh, oh, I was thinking of the videogame, but OK.",
        "No, no, not the videogame, no. What I loved about \"\"Dhoom 2\"\" was that it had over-the-top action, had some broad comedy, had a great cops-and-robbers story, even though it was preposterous.",
        "It was a fun story.",
        "And it had great dance numbers and music, including a dance number with Aishwarya Rai-Bachan in this leather outfit.",
        "It was just incredible.",
        "And what I loved about it is that it just gives you a great mix of everything that's entertaining, and the actors looked like they're having a great time even though they knew it was a preposterous story.",
        "They didn't care, and they just were having a good time.",
        "I'm just wondering, Daryl, where did - and where were you able to get a hold of this movie?",
        "Oh, I went to see it in the theater...",
        "Oh."

        "Yes, Bollywood films, actually - practically every major Bollywood film that's made in India gets released in the U.S.",
        "and North America the same day, so whatever the Friday it opens.",
        "Now they open in theaters - I live in New York City, and there are a couple of theaters in New York City where Bollywood films run.",
        "It so happens that most of the people in the audience tend to be South Asians, I mean, Indian-Americans and the people from other South Asian countries and a trickling of other Americans who are interested in it.",
        "Major publications - the New York Times, LA Times, Boston Globe, Village Voice, Time Out New York - they all review Bollywood films now.",

        "OK.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Is there - I mean, I haven't looked, but do you know if Netflix or one of those other mail-order film companies, can you get the films that way, too?",
        "You can get Bollywood films on Netflix.",
        "In fact, Netflix has a very large collection of classics from the '40s and '50s, and that's probably one of the best if people want to start off by, - really, where you start and what films to catch, I mean, you can probably get a sampling of films from Netflix, yes.",

        "But \"\"Chak de India,\"\" the one you mentioned, the one about the field hockey, I think that's one of my favorite films.",
        "A few years ago in 2001, there was a film \"\"Lagaan,\"\" which was nominated for the Oscars in the best foreign-language film.",
        "It's almost a four-hour-long film about, again, it's about cricket.",
        "These villagers, they learn to play cricket against their British masters and very moving, inspiring story with lots of songs and dances.",
        "OK.",
        "Aseem Chhabra, we have to take a break, but we'll get to more of the Bollywood films you have to see in a moment and talk about those films and what those films tell us about India.",
        "And if you're a Bollywood film, what's your favorite?",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "So, I know this is an impossible question because, you know, everybody is going to have an idiosyncratic list, but where would you tell people to start if they wanted to get the five top films from Bollywood?"

        "They would go to \"\"Sholay,\"\" S-H-O-L-A-Y, \"\"Sholay,\"\" as a film, which has been one of the highest grossing films, and it has all the characteristic marks of what one would think of as a Bollywood film: melodrama, violence, sex and dance.",
        "So, that's where they should start.",
        "It's a little dated, in my opinion.",
        "So, one should come for a more contemporary version, that is the film, \"\"Satya,\"\" S-A-T-Y-A, or \"\"The Truth,\"\" which is a film that Danny Boyle was very much inspired by in making \"\"Slumdog Millionaire.\"\" But you know, Bollywood, apart from its mark of excess and extravaganza, is also something - that's also been a very strong strain there of films that deal with social realism.",
        "So, for that, I would suggest very much a film like \"\"Ankur,\"\" \"\"The Seedling,\"\" A-N-K-U-R, by the filmmaker Shyam Benegal.",
        "That starts for us the new wave in Indian cinema, a bit of a certain very fine sensibility, an eye for social observation and injustice.",
        "And so, that would be number three.",
        "And I would add to that a film like \"\"Phoolan Devi\"\" or \"\"The Bandit Queen,\"\" by Shekhar Gupta, which some people in the U.S.",
        "must have seen.",
        "And finally, for a film that actually in some ways reflects some of our diasporic(ph) identities and it also still has lots of songs and dance, a film like \"\"Monsoon Wedding\"\" by Mira Nair would be number five.",
        "Well, I think that's one that a lot of people in this country might be familiar with.",
        "Actually, as you were speaking...",
        "Yes.",
        "We got an email from Amit, who says, my favorite movie is \"\"Sholay,\"\" borrowed from \"\"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,\"\" and there are a lot of other movies like those that I enjoy.",
        "I like the movies from the '70s and '90s mainly because it had common man as the subject matter.",
        "But lately, Bollywood is showing movies where everyone is filthy rich and someone whom I can't connect with.",
        "But there are a lot of thought-provoking movies made in Bollywood than - I'm sorry, there's a lot of thought-provoking movies made in Bollywood than Hollywood.",
        "I guess she means more.",
        "I'm a staunch Marathi movie supporter and think some of the movies are better than Bollywood as well.",
        "True.",
        "I should point out that we are also - in addition to Amitava Kumar, we have with us on the program Aseem Chhabra, who is a columnist for the Mumbai Mirror.",
        "And Aseem Chhabra, what did you think of Amitava Kumar's list?",
        "Oh, that's a perfect wonderful list.",
        "And thank you, Amitava.",
        "Sure.",
        "I've seen his list before in Vanity Fair.",
        "But there's also, as I mentioned earlier, there's this whole interesting movement that's happening these days in Bollywood.",
        "There's a film that just came out about a month ago, less than a month ago.",
        "It's called \"\"Dev.D,\"\" so it's D-E-V and then the initial - just the letter D.",
        "It's a contemporary story, but it's based on an old classic novel called \"\"Devdas,\"\" which has been made into films in different languages in India a number of times.",
        "And it's a contemporary story about a lover who, sort of, because of mistakes he makes, this man is not able to, sort of, meet the woman of his dreams and marry her.",
        "And then there's a whole self-destruction that he goes through, drinking himself to death.",
        "In this case, he takes drugs because this is set in 2009.",
        "Very powerful, very well-made film, very - visually very striking film.",
        "Last year, there was a film called \"\"Oye Lucky!",
        "Lucky Oye!\"\" So, it's O-Y-E, lucky, oye, a story about a small-town, small-time crook, a thief, really, in a certain part of Delhi, which captures New Delhi's - sort of the Punjabi community.",
        "Again, a very realistic and a very fun way of looking at, you know, life in India, contemporary life in India, with a whole bunch of folksongs, with Punjabi folksongs, and yet it has tones of Bollywood."
