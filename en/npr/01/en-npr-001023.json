        "My thing about Bollywood - I am all Bollywood fan, and our friends, when we get together, we at least watch one movie.",
        "The best one that came out recently is \"\"Welcome to Sajjanpur.\"\" And it's a story about a letter writer, which is very much a (unintelligible), simple, plain story.",

        "As to, you know, the conservative apprehension about sexuality, I think it's high time we have that, because for a long, long time, Indian cinema, displaying and - laboring under Victorian codes of morality, would portray a certain coyness because when a couple needed to kiss, you had flowers coming in together, and that was - you know, the bodies were replaced by flowers touching each other.",
        "And I think it is - for a society to be able to see itself and to be able to see itself clearly on the screen, it's very important that there be violence and that there be the portrayal of sex in a way that is present on the streets and in the homes of our people.",

        "In these countries that valued in some ways the grammar of social realism, you had the appeal of these films.",
        "While the wilder films, with more songs and dances, the spectacular films, have not been that popular, or at least were not at that time, but now, they are a real focus of attention in the West.",

        "So, we've been talking a little bit about the kinds of changes that are going on in Bollywood, that it's basically entertainment.",
        "What do you have to say?",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, 90 percent of all Bollywood movies are basically escapist.",
        "That's the idea.",
        "People live tough lives and they like to spend their money going to the movie theater to get away from those realities.",
        "No one wants to go and see grim social realism very much.",
        "They want to go off and see an impossible fantasy world full of beautiful people dancing and having fun and action and romance and excitement, and that's the staple.",
        "But there is a small percentage of more ambitious films being made within the Bollywood mainstream; that is, they don't depart fundamentally from the idiom of Bollywood filmmaking, and they'll have long exposition(ph) and songs and all of that, but they'll tackle more serious themes.",
        "One of the questions that was asked of me was, you like Arial, but you like it a specific way.",
        "And I always say bold, definitely.",
        "My least favorite is anything that's too squirrely and swirling and busy.",
        "How are you?",
        "A few months ago, for example, was the release of an outstanding Bollywood film, perhaps, certainly, in my view, deserving of being in anyone's top five, a film called \"\"Taare Zameen Par,\"\" which is about dyslexia, but done in an amazing way.",
        "I mean, it's a movie that is very accessible, it's not either sort of hokey or grim, and at the same time, it tackles a serious subject that hadn't ever been tackled in an Indian movie before.",
        "That was one example.",
        "If one went back a couple of years, in a very different spirit, again, very much within the mainstream Bollywood tradition, but trying to do something special was a film called \"\"Lage Raho Munna Bhai.\"\" This is reprising a character who'd already had a big hit in a movie a couple of years earlier as a sort of gangster with a heart of gold.",
        "And this gangster in this movie essentially discovers Gandhi and values and principles of the Mahatma and lives by them, in the course of actually trying to achieve slightly nefarious ends.",
        "It's an extremely well-made, very funny film.",
        "I showed it to American friends who caught it instantly, said it actually does appeal beyond the borders of India.",
        "But it was a huge hit in India, and suddenly the expression \"\"Gandhigiri,\"\" sort of, you know, Gandhi's way of doing things, suddenly became commonly used in India because this film suddenly made it fashionable to think about what the Mahatma stood for again.",

        "No, that's fine.",
        "I'm just really saying that it's entirely possible for Bollywood to succeed the limits of escapism, making films that are both commercially accessible and popular and at the same time tackling more ambitious themes than Bollywood typically did during its heyday of the '70s and '80s.",

        "Yes, my favorite Bollywood film was \"\"Lagaan\"\" as well, and my husband is from Punjab, and I appreciated the history lesson that was in that movie, as well as the humor.",
        "Interesting, OK.",
        "Aseem Chhabra, there's been a debate - as Stacy was just saying, that there was a history lesson.",
        "There's been a debate in American films, historical films, about how accurate they ought to be.",

        "Kennedy, to be absolutely historically correct, or can you take license for dramatic purposes?",
        "What's the attitude, would you say, in Bollywood toward dramatic license?",
        "Well, \"\"Lagaan,\"\" the film which I had mentioned earlier, Stacy also mentioned, was complete fiction, although it's set during the British colonial period, say, about 100 years ago.",
        "There was a film that was released just last year, about the same time about a year ago; it was called \"\"Jodhaa Akbar.\"\" It's a story about Emperor Akbar and his wife Jodhabai, who was a Hindu Rajput princess.",
        "And there was a lot of debate in India; in fact, there were a lot of protests also, because some people belonging to the Rajput community actually said that Emperor Akbar never married a Hindu princess.",
        "And so, that debate has still continued, whether the director actually took the license and sort of extended his history to suit his dramatic needs, but it's a beautiful film.",
        "It's, again, about three hours and 45 minutes long.",
        "I mean, sometimes Bollywood Hindi-language films tend to be pretty long, but it has some great songs, great dramatic moments, and so, you can enjoy the film and get a taste of history of India, although it may not be the absolute perfect history as such.",

        "Lagaan\"\" is more of, sort of, classic mainstream Bollywood fare, and there is another film called \"\"Iqbal\"\" about a deaf-mute boy whose ambition is to play cricket for India and his struggles and travails and how he finally makes it.",
        "It's an extraordinary, inspiring film.",
        "It's an interesting thing that cricket is now coming into Bollywood in a big way, because they're trying to capitalize on the extraordinary passion that Indians have for that sport.",
