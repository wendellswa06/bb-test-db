        "One more nut on the Super Bowl.",
        "Ozy reminded us that this week - I can't believe this - it's been 10 years since the wardrobe malfunction with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl.",
        "It is hard to believe that it was 10 years ago.",
        "But there was a really interesting speech a couple of years ago by one of the co-founders of YouTube, who said that that event where Justin Timberlake seemed to rip off and expose part of the breast of Janet Jackson, not only did that turn out to produce the most searched term ever in Internet history at the time but, maybe more importantly, he said part of the inspiration for YouTube came from how popular that was and his recognition and his co-founder's recognition that many people wanted to be able to watch video again, over and over again on the Internet.",
        "And in fact, that might be a bigger audience than the audience that sees the original on classic standard television.",
        "Well, you know, we were joking a little bit about the halftime show kind of being like a multimillion-dollar bathroom break, which makes the natural transition to one more Ozy story.",
        "You have this piece about an interesting toilet that really could help save a lot of water.",
        "It's called SinkPositive.",
        "And a couple years ago, a young woman who was still in college at Wake Forest encountered an interesting kind of toilet that was a classic toilet underneath but on the top someone had put a true faucet.",
        "And the idea was that I wash my hands in the faucet, the water runs down, fills up the toilet, and that that's ultimately the water that's flushed.",
        "And it came out of a recognition that something like 30 percent of the wasted water in America, or about $5 billion worth of water, comes from us flushing clean water, which, when you think about, is kind of a little crazy.",
        "So she said, why don't we flush dirty water?",
        "Makes a ton of sense.",
        "And while she thought originally people were going to get excited about it for environmental reasons, it turns out that some people like it also for space reasons.",
        "In crowded cities where you have small apartments, some people like the idea of combining their sink and the toilet in an environmentally friendly way.",
        "Carlos Watson is the co-founder of the online magazine Ozy.",
        "You can explore all the stories we talked about at npr.org/newandnext.",
        "Carlos, thanks again.",
        "Arun, good to be with you.",
        "And go, Seahawks.",
        "That is possible.",
        "You know, the irony of this is that President Obama has likened himself to some policies of Ronald Reagan that - he did this during the campaign.",
        "And Ronald Reagan, though, in terms of unionism, although he was the former head of the Screen Actors Guild at one time in his career, was known for breaking the union, particularly the air-traffic controllers.",
        "So, there is sort of an irony in those two different positions, wouldn't you say, Marc, really briefly?"

        "Well, I would in that respect.",
        "But what Obama was talking about is that he - maybe he didn't intend it, or who knows, but he is kind of one of those transformational figures the way Reagan was.",
        "And remember, Reagan's big thing: Government is not the solution to the problem; government is the problem.",

        "So, let's get back to the topic of the stimulus for a moment, if we can, because the House passed a $900 billion rescue bill.",
        "But the Republicans, Callie, they were like, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Yeah, and I know a lot of people are characterizing this as a defeat for President Obama since he, you know, to many people's eyes, went out of his way to extend the olive branch, to bring in the Republicans, to talk to them, to explain his position, blah, blah, blah.",
        "But I don't see it that way.",
        "I actually see it as just a setback.",
        "He's laying the groundwork for a longer relationship.",
        "He is understanding that some of those people have ideological differences, and he is understanding that some of them just want to make political posturing, right now, important for them.",
        "They want to be on stage with that.",
        "But I'm reminded of Willie Jolley's statement that a setback is a setup for a comeback.",
        "So, I think he's coming back.",
        "That's an interesting point.",
        "And when he comes back, that I think he will be bringing all that he has done in working with those relationships, and I think eventually there will be some movement on their side."

        "Well, you know, Jenee, the president has made a great deal of his bipartisan attempts.",
        "Do you feel that there is a chance that he'll be able to cross the aisle and get both parties to work together?",
        "I do think so, especially with just the nature of the economy, and I know people on the right and on the left are expecting their politicians to come through for them and help them out.",
        "And I'm not surprised by what happened - tomorrow - I mean, what Callie said is definitely looking at ideology.",
        "And for the Republicans, they thought the package involved too much spending, and that's part of the Republican platform, you know, not as much spending and more tax cuts.",
        "And so, I guess they felt that Obama's stimulus package didn't bring that.",
        "Well, let's talk about Florida, Marc, where you are.",
        "Normally, that's a red state, although it's a red state that went for Obama this time.",
        "But the Republicans there, does this play well with them, when the party sort of stands on ideological ground blocking a stimulus package that is intended to help everybody, both Democrats and Republicans alike?",
        "Well, there's a split.",
        "If you're a Washington Republican, you're against this.",
        "If you are a state legislative Republican, including Republican Governor Charlie Crist, who might have been - was on McCain's short list to be vice president - you want the stimulus package.",
        "There is an ideological problem, though, in that states such as Florida, which are not allowed to deficit spend, are being told in the stimulus package, look, if you want money, you have to roll back the clock and spend as much health and education money as you spent in 2006 as you are now.",
        "We don't care if you've cut spending or spent your money wisely or, you know, been careful.",
        "And so, there's a little bit of conflict there, and the state is trying to cure that as an issue because Florida is saying, look, we're basically just out of money.",
        "Now, if you want us to raise taxes, well, we might have to do that, albeit probably be cigarette taxes.",
        "But you are seeing a split.",

        "For them to do over.",
        "Let's talk about the mortgage giant Freddie Mac announcing today that it's going to let homeowners and tenants stay in homes that are in foreclosure, at least for awhile.",
        "Fannie Mae did something similar earlier this month.",
        "The program is designed to let qualified tenants lease the foreclosed property from Freddie Mac to keep as many as 8,600 families with a roof over their heads.",
        "Does this sound like a good idea to you, Callie?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "And I don't care if it's a drop in the bucket.",
        "Somebody has got to start doing this.",
        "This is the root of the problem we're in right now, and so much of this discussion even about the stimulus package, everything, is still not going to those people who are struggling to keep their homes.",
        "So, anything right now that is - looks like it'll give people a reprieve, I think is a good thing.",
        "I would think that in Florida, Marc, that the home-foreclosure crisis has hit particularly hard...",
        "We're number two in home foreclosures.",
        "This is certainly welcome news.",
        "I guess the only thing is, what took so long?",
        "And the other thing is that this is purely pragmatic.",

        "At least give us something.",

        "Let's end that conversation with this: The theater of the absurd, which I think is a fair way of describing what's going on in the state of Illinois with the ouster of Rod Blagojevich, Jenee Darden, what do you say?",
