        "In 2003, June, Phil Kline, the attorney general, who is a vocal abortion opponent, issued a legal opinion, in which he said that all state health care professionals had to report any sexual activity by anyone under the age of 16 to state social services.",
        "Essentially, he said, all sex by anyone under 16 is abuse, and it's all to be reported.",
        "And that was read include a broad range of sexual activity, not just intercourse.",
        "Now, why did he do that?",
        "Well, I think that the answer is the same reason that he requested medical records of 90 women and girls who received late term abortions in Kansas.",
        "He said it was to protect their health, to investigate for evidence of child rape.",
        "His opponents say no, that's his cover, what he really wants to do is press and press and press on the privacy rights of women, making it harder and harder and harder for them to seek abortions at all."

        "If teenagers feel like they can't come forward and ask for basic medical services, or ask for basic medical opinions, they're not gonna come forward at all, and this violates the doctor/patient confidentiality agreement that they're supposed to have.",
        "And, as I understand it, this case has already gone up to the appeals court and back.",
        "What happened there?",
        "That's right.",
        "In 2004, the same district court judge who was hearing the case currently, issued a preliminary injunction, barring Kansas officials from enforcing the law as it was interpreted.",

        "They essentially said, no, go ahead and enforce this.",
        "By a 2 to 1 vote, the court of appeals said that the state's interest in investigating child sexual abuse, outweighs the minor's rights to privacy.",
        "Now, with the injunction out of the way, it's back to the district court to determine on the merits whether this interpretation of the reporting law violates the rights of the healthcare providers.",
        "And there was a hiccup in the proceedings on Tuesday, when one state official testified.",
        "What happened there?",
        "There was a strange moment, after two and half years, and, I think, a fairly widespread understanding of what the attorney general's interpretation of the law was.",
        "The state assistant attorney general, while questioning one of the witness, started to argue with her about whether this reporting law implicates all sexual activity, or just sexual intercourse.",
        "The assitant attorney general started to say, no, no, just sexual intercourse is at issue.",
        "And even the judge at some point became confused and said, I thought this was about behaviors far beyond sexual intercourse.",
        "So, now it's not even clear what we're fighting about, much less how we're gonna get to an answer.",
        "So, this case is being followed closely, at least by the news media.",

        "It's being watched very closely by other states.",

        "They're saying, hey, this is a really interesing and aggressive way to cut down the numbers of abortions being provided in the state.",
