        "Yeah, I mean we have the most married military we've ever had.",

        "So I really have no other perspective than a wartime marriage.",
        "And I'm one of an entire generation of military families with that experience.",
        "I don't know what a civilian marriage is like, and I certainly don't know what a military marriage without war is like.",
        "So it's difficult for me to make any kind of comparisons of what it would have been like with my marriage should it had not been a wartime marriage.",
        "So it's hard to say.",
        "And you're speaking of that marriage in the past tense.",
        "Yeah, unfortunately my husband and I are going through a divorce now, and I get asked all the time if it's because of war and deployments, and I just don't have the perspective to answer that.",
        "The only marriage I've ever known has been a wartime one.",
        "How much time did you spend apart?",
        "A lot.",
        "Like most people in the military in the past 10 years, we were separated not just by deployments but by moves and training and all that kind of stuff.",
        "But you would never hear me blame, you know, the military lifestyle or the deployments for what happened, and I think that's one of the things that we talk about too; there's a difference between excuses and context.",
        "Jacey Eckhart, is that also a factor in why people don't speak about this publicly, in that they are afraid they will be accused of criticizing the military life, making that connection that Kristina Kaufmann declined to make just now?",
        "I think that there are certain services in which silence is required, but for the most part I think what's interesting about what Kristina's saying is that she's talking about living her marriage in the military as an environment.",
        "She's not blaming anything about the military.",
        "And that's how most couples have to think of it, as this is the environment we live in, and it is rigorous.",
        "It's like living in Alaska.",
        "And so there are certain things you have to do in order to make that marriage work.",
        "And sometimes you get lucky, and those things work, and sometimes you don't."

        "Military spouses have been talking about military marriages and fidelity on public stages like Rebecca Sinclair, who took her story to the Opinion Page of the Washington Post and more private ones like online message boards and support groups and the toll that protracted and repeated deployments can take on a relationship, but adultery in the military is more than a personal problem.",

        "The issue of military service, military service is a sacrifice, but a marriage is a marriage that goes on well past that.",
        "And infidelity, it happens in the civilian sector as well as in the military, unfortunately, but the two are separate.",
        "They're separate.",
        "Does the length of that deployment - your wife must have been on the other side of some of those.",
        "Well yes and no. But, you know, I always tell folks that the concept that temporary duty or TDY or combat deployment, it's not Las Vegas.",
        "And people make mistakes, but there are plenty of others who, I mean literally don't leave their room if they're not executing the mission.",
        "And infidelity and the marriage, the concept of a military marriage, you might be in the military, but marriage, infidelity and the military, they're all three very separate things.",
        "And they're not as pervasive as a lot of folks might get the impression."

        "The military prosecutes adultery from time to time, but usually it's only part of a larger package.",
        "In other words, the military is typically angry at the individual for something else.",
        "For example, you might have a situation where there's an affair that comes to the attention of the management, and somebody says to the adulterer or adulteress look, you better knock it off.",
        "And the individual, you know, disregards that friendly warning.",
        "And then it turns out - then the management finds out the affair is still going on.",
        "That tends to get people quite annoyed.",
        "Similarly, if there's some other offense that's been committed, that might make lights and buzzers go off.",
        "But it's quite uncommon for what I'll call simple adultery to be the basis for a court martial.",
        "Would a case where someone was in the same chain of command, would that be - a senior - someone senior to another, would that be a simple adultery?",
        "Yes, and that would be definitely problematic.",
        "You know, I see the distinction you're drawing.",
        "Where you have one person in an affair with another person who works for him or her, that is the type of thing that would tend to have a bad effect on good order and discipline, and that is one of the features that adultery is charged under, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
        "either conduct that is prejudicial to good order and discipline, along the lines you indicated; or conduct of a nature to bring discredit on the service.",
        "So either one of those tests, if it's applicable, could trigger a prosecution.",
        "But it's entirely discretionary within the military justice system.",
        "And commanders have the discretion whether to bring charges or not.",
        "It's not like the civilian world, where a district attorney is in the picture.",
        "And even with the proviso that they only charge some, how common is it?",
        "It's very uncommon.",
        "I would be surprised if there were more than a dozen cases a year.",
        "I might add, by the way, that surprisingly, over 20 states in the union continue to criminalize adultery.",
        "So even though it sounds like kind of a hokey crime in the 21st century, it's still there on the books.",
        "And maybe it's like lightning striking to be prosecuted for it, but people do get prosecuted for it from time to time.",
        "And in the case of General Petraeus, he's of course retired, and at least according to what you read, began the affair after he was retired.",
        "Would the military still have jurisdiction?",
        "Yes, they still have jurisdiction because retired regulars, that is members of the regular Army or other branches of the armed services who are drawing pay as he is remain subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
        "However, I would say it's deeply, deeply unlikely that he would be prosecuted for conduct that occurred after he retired and went over to the CIA.",

        "But our understanding's always been and from my experience is that the Army doesn't - and military service doesn't so much - it doesn't help bad marriages by keeping you away, but it also doesn't, it doesn't break up good ones so much because the infidelity, if it's going to happen, eventually it's going to happen regardless, no matter where you are...",
