        "Some of the symptoms of both of those injuries are disinhibition and infidelity in that community, I think, is a problem.",
        "And again, you know, you don't want to make excuses for behavior, but there are some things that happen in war that change people, and that's not just the people who deploy.",

        "I mean, the mental health impacts on the family members I don't think that we really understand that yet among the spouses and the children.",

        "I remember someone gave me some little tea towels during one of my husband's deployments that said: sexually deprived for your freedom, which was cute and, you know - but these are, you know, these are challenges that, I think, those dealing with the wounds of war are even more vulnerable to these kind of challenges.",
        "And, Jacey Eckhart, she's - these are not individual silos that everybody experiences separately.",
        "These things all happen to everybody.",
        "Actually, one of the most interesting pieces of research that has come out is from the RAND Corporation, and they have looked at the difference between deployment and combat, and - because everybody who deploys is not in combat.",
        "And so when it comes to deployment, they say that it is kind of like having a child.",
        "It causes great stress in your relationship at first, but you overcome it.",
        "Combat has been shown to reduce marital satisfaction in a way that deployment does not.",
        "Interesting.",
        "There's also - we've been talking primarily about regulars, people in the regular armed forces.",
        "There are any number of National Guard and reserves who've been called up who don't necessarily live with their families on or near military bases.",
        "And that's another situation, without that kind of support network that some in the regular armed forces have come to understand."
