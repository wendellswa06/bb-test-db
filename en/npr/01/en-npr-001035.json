        "But your music is really important and really powerful, but it - you know, one of the things that it reminds me, whether it's Iraq or Sierra Leone, that there are many more casualties than people ever count in the war because my daughter's trauma did not come up until she had puberty.",
        "And it breaks my heart, but day after day, she reenacts the trauma that she experience in the war in Sierra Leone.",
        "So, you know, I really hope that you also remember the children that are out there in the Diaspora.",

        "Yes.",
        "But - but now, I'm blessed because I'm passing my experiences that I've got through the refugee camp and through the war in our country to the nation."
