        "Vander Plaats says that's good and bad.",
        "And the reason it's bad is that's a way for our base to divide its support quickly, which really weakens the impact that we probably could have in the process.",

        "If we go back 30 years, the National Security Agency was cited then for essentially spying on American citizens who were against the war in Vietnam.",
