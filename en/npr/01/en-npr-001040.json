        "I didn't know before I started this project that the Ninth Ward was the first neighborhood in the Deep South to integrate the schools.",
        "And that occurred in November of 1960.",
        "But in those years, it was not just a black neighborhood; it was poor neighborhood with all sorts of ethnicities.",
        "When the schools finally integrated, the day they integrated, thousands of whites boycott it.",
        "Whites formed mobs in the streets.",
        "But I also tell the story of those few white parents and white families who kept their children in school.",
        "Actually, I know radicals.",
        "Not that they want it necessarily civil rights to come, but there were some parents who wanted to keep their children in school and continued sending them, and in turn, they attracted the wrath of the mob, the ire of the mob.",
        "And I found those to be some of the more fascinating and sort of stunning ways in which you could see the civil rights movement dividing the white community against itself and dividing somewhat people within - inside within themselves, sort of psychological wars going on.",
        "When you think about this book that you wrote, what do you make of the attitudes of the white south today compared to the era that you write about?",
        "Well, it seems that everything has changed and nothing has changed.",
        "Some people's attitudes really deeply changed through the civil rights movement, and I tried to show that, but some didn't.",
        "And I also show the younger generation grappling with its heritage, with its segregationist upbringing and heritage.",
        "And wrestling with the fact that this is their history on the one hand, and yet on the other, growing up in a new world, growing up in a world where they aren't forced to discriminate against blacks, where there is equality under the law.",
        "And so, I tried to show this real tangle that exists in this ambiguous way that we've experienced both stunning change over the years, along with sobering continuity.",
        "And it all depends upon where you look and what layer of society you look at.",
        "Well, Jason, thank you.",
        "Thank you, Farai.",
        "I appreciate it.",

        "The Texas Rangers return from last year, looking for their first world championship.",
        "The Cardinals hope to win number 11.",
        "The Rangers cruised atop the American League West most of the season and dismissed Tampa and Detroit in the playoffs, while the Cardinals squeaked into the National League wild card berth and dumped the favored Phillies and Milwaukee's Brewers.",

        "There's two sides to the argument.",
        "The underlying rationale for the president's order, we're being told, is it was a legal opinion from the Justice Department that was similar in its argument to the now disavowed torture memo which had set out very limited definition of torture and was disavowed by the administration after it was revealed.",
        "Underlying those memos is the contention that the president has virtually unfettered power to conduct the war on terror once Congress gave him the green light.",
        "And so in a similar way, there's another memo that exists that makes that argument in terms of domestic surveillance.",
        "The argument from the civil liberties side and probably from a lot of legal experts as well will be that there's a specific federal statute that prohibits this kind of warrantless domestic surveillance and, the argument goes, the president cannot simply decide to overturn a law like this.",
