        "Yes, that is my position.",
        "And the wording changes from walls to barriers to fencing.",
        "And I think barriers work, and that's been proven, especially here in San Diego.",
        "You can come here, and you can see the places that are more secure due to the fact that we have barriers here.",
        "So I agree with that statement, and I think most Border Patrol agents know that that is a fact - that they do help and that they do work.",
        "What - are there any other measures that Border Patrol agents would like to see funded?",
        "Yes.",
        "And that's the thing - walls and barriers don't work on their own.",
        "They need boots on the ground.",
        "So we need increased staffing.",
        "We need radios that are up to date.",
        "We need the infrastructure as far as the roads to get to those barriers.",
        "So there's a lot of other things that need to be built as well as the barriers.",
        "And I think that's what sometimes we feel as though the focus goes away from because there's much more to this picture than just a, quote-unquote, \"\"wall.",
        "You could take one and look at him next to the other.",
        "You would say, what is the difference?",
        "Why have I chosen to designate this one with a name, Flurry, as you pointed out?",
        "And even Flurry seemed to understand.",
        "Flurry was saying to me, that's a lot of cognitive dissonance.",

        "I'm like, no, Flurry, you're going to make it, pal.",
        "Now, let me go out into the garage and find how many of your cousins' heads I've smashed with traps.",
        "You write about Maine with great ambivalence.",
        "Yes.",
        "I named the book \"\"Vacationland,\"\" which is of course something of a cruel joke because you would never go swimming in Maine 'cause the water is very cold and made of hate, and it wants to kill you.",
        "Maine is a place of rugged and harsh beauty, and it reminds you that the universe is large.",
        "You are small, and none of it cares whether you are here or not.",
        "And as you start to move into the second half of your life, Maine is a place where you - if you're morbidly inclined, it has a lot to offer you.",
        "(Laughter) And do you feel that in Maine, you can - you get a sense of your mortality in Maine, is what you're saying.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's there to confirm your mortality.",
        "Now, tell me, John Hodgman, as a - someone in his mustachioed 40s and father of at least one child who's reached adolescence - yes?",
        "Yes, that's true.",
        "My wife and I have two human children, one of whom is 15, the other of whom is 12.",
        "And not only do I have a moustache now, but I also have a beard.",
        "I'm sure your listeners can hear the horror of my beard through their radios.",
        "It is so untelegenic; it is anti-radiogenic as well."

        "I mean, on a gut level, it surprises me to say that the answer is yes.",
        "I think that we spend our 20s wondering what the future holds.",
        "We are worried we may not be talented, skilled, lucky or interesting enough to get there, and so we spend a lot of time telling ourselves stories about how interesting we are, often by buying things that make us feel interesting or borrowing gestures or poses.",
        "And then in our 30s, once the 20s have evaporated, we spend a lot of time telling our stories that we're still in our 20s; we're still a fighter; we're still relevant.",

        "And what is it now?",
        "Well, now, it's like a lot of other neighborhoods - it has become settled by people from the Muslim diaspora, shall I call it that, largely from North Africa and in the case of Finsbury Park, but also quite a heavy presence of people from Pakistan.",
        "And what's happened as a result of that is - well, two things.",
        "One in Finsbury Park, a famous mosque led by a man named Hamza, now in jail for inciting terrorism and murder and racial hatred.",
        "And through that mosque passed people like Richard Reid - and through his (unintelligible) take off our shoes at the airport now.",
        "And so are other people who've been responsible for very heinous crimes.",
        "And second - this is a related matter but it's separate though - the importing into Britain from tribal areas, really, of Pakistan, of things like arranged marriages, forced marriages, actually.",
        "Marriages often to people who are first cousins, leading to things like birth defects, honor killings, the imprisonment of women in their houses and the number of other things that are culturally very alarming.",
        "So do you think these things sort of worked together to make Finsbury Park a potential, you know, incubator of jihadists?",
        "Without the rhetoric and activity of Hamza, would the Pakistani immigration have had such an effect and vice versa?",
        "No.",
        "The answer is that the two things have to be considered separately.",
        "But that one does provide a context to the other.",
        "In other words, there've been some very upsetting findings from opinion polls of younger Muslims, particularly in Britain, who show that they not just want to impose Sharia law on the country, but in the meantime, on their own population, especially their own females.",
        "I say that advisory because I think they think of their women as in some sense their property.",
        "And their willingness to endorse the actions of murderers, of the kind that we saw fortunately aborted - were aborted last week."
