        "(Soundbite of cheering)",
        "Some thought that moment would signal more emphasis on the historic nature of her candidacy, but her voice and her strategy never changed that much.",
        "Now and then she mentioned that she could make history, and there's her occasional joke.",

        "This morning, we heard from the mayor of McAllen, Texas, Jim Darling, who said that the crisis on the border now with so many asylum seekers presenting themselves to border patrol agents is that you really need more people, and in part what you need is more social workers to process these claims and to, you know, work with people who in some cases are in dire circumstances.",
        "And you actually are a counselor yourself, and I wanted to ask if you think that that might be true.",
        "Yes, I do agree with that.",
        "And that's what I was saying - that big picture.",

        "The agents are due to get their paychecks this coming week on January 11, and it looks as though - I mean, if the talks continue as they have been, without any apparent progress, it looks as though you and fellow agents won't be getting paid.",
        "But, as essential personnel, they are expected to stay on the job.",
        "And I wanted to ask, you know, how is morale?",
        "Well, morale has definitely taken a hit.",
        "The guys and gals that I work with - they really - one, they appreciate the support, and they appreciate this topic being at the forefront of the discussion.",
        "But it is something that does weigh in the back of your mind because our guys and gals have families.",
        "They have bills to pay.",

        "Well, actually, the most important discussion we have in these days is, is there a European solution?",
        "Are we able to have a secure EU border, east border especially, where we decide at the border and so-called hotspots who is to be let in and who not?",

        "But we really do work hard on it to get one because otherwise, Schengen, the so-called Schengen Area, which means no borders within the European Union, that could be ended.",
        "You think that's a possibility, that the Schengen Agreement could dissolve, that the border controls in Europe would be re-implemented?",
        "Well, Sweden and Denmark started already again with controls at their borders.",

        "Do you share those concerns?",
        "My biggest concern is actually about integration of the people.",
        "So we already have from past decades parallel societies kind of who do not integrate with their own religions, their own language.",
        "And they're coming from countries where the equality of men and women, where the rights of minorities are not respected.",
        "And of course, after having - having been grown up there, they bring this with them to Germany.",
        "And if you want to integrate people from a totally different culture, you need time.",

        "Are you concerned about the rise of anti-Muslim attacks and demonstrations in Germany?",
        "Are migrant communities safe in Germany?",
        "Well, I think they are safe because we have a big majority in Germany who don't agree with any kind of hate.",
