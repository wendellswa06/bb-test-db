        "And a lot of people wish now that they paid more attention to these people who were from Muslim background, saying, look, take this seriously.",
        "It's going to become very nasty.",

        "It's just that some of our social polities are tended to empower people who speak and claim to represent the - see, on the basis of being an imam or a Muslim (unintelligible).",

        "They tend to enthrone these people probably rather more than they deserve.",
        "The article in Vanity Fair's called \"\"Londonistan Calling\"\" and the title's taken from a book called \"\"Londonistan,\"\" which criticizes multiculturalism as being destructive to British values.",
        "Do you agree with that?",
        "Well, I don't agree with Melanie Phillips' book altogether, no, as a matter of fact, but it isn't her title.",
        "The original term, Londonistan, which obviously began to stick now and circulate, comes from a French counterterrorism official who'd been monitoring extremists from French-speaking North Africa, Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia in particular.",
        "And had noticed an extraordinary number of them were able to take refuge in London as if they were seeking political asylum or as if they were human rights refugees, whereas in fact, they were extremely dangerous wanted criminals in their own countries.",

        "And maybe Western (audio gap) should be paying for meddling in areas that maybe we shouldn't have been meddling in.",
        "Well, no, I've got absolutely no patience with that interpretation at all and that's why I mentioned my old neighborhood, Finsbury Park.",

        "I mean, I'm not a Muslim or either, I'm not radical or whatever.",
        "But the thing is what made them radical?",
        "I mean, what have done to them in far centuries and I think you go to the core of it and find out what's make them and be, you know, talk to them and be in a dialogue so they will understand that you are now their enemies."
