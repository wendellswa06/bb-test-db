        "There really is the sense that she has been a pragmatic policymaker who pushes for very aspirational goals, but also realizes how important kind of real world realities are.",
        "Charles Warren represents aluminum makers and other companies that are regulated by the EPA.",
        "He agrees, McCarthy works hard to involve industries that will be effected by the agency's rules, making the process less adversarial.",
