        "First, on very high price is hydrocarbons and, secondly, on the very hostile physical environment it would create.",
        "So that's the first part.",
        "But the second part is to recognize the positive side of this kind of technological change.",
        "It would set off a really dynamic process of transition of discovery where the United States would be in the lead and it will be more energy secure.",
        "It'll be cleaner, quieter, safer and more biodiverse.",
        "So I think we have to recognize the enormous attraction of one route - the low carbon route - and the devastating consequences of the route, the high carbon route.",
        "Well, how much time do you estimate we have?",
        "We really have to turn this round within a decade.",
        "The emissions in the world, if we're to have any chance of really cutting back on these risks, we'll have to peak before 2020.",
        "But I think that if you look at the intentions that the countries of the world have expressed, and it's been remarkable in these last weeks and months as we've moved towards Copenhagen.",
        "You've had Japan with the new prime minister saying we will cut back by 25 percent on our emissions 1990 to 2020.",
        "You've had China setting its targets, India setting its targets, Brazil and Indonesia, strong targets for cutting deforestation, which is a very important source of emissions.",
        "And you had progress in the United States with the Waxman-Markey Bill moving through the House.",
        "Then you've had Lisa Jackson's announcement that the EPA will play its part, too.",
        "If you add all these up round the world, we're not so very far away from an agreement, which could see emissions peaking before 2020 as a world and going on down from there.",
        "I mean, given that the Copenhagen meeting won't produce a binding treaty, what are you hoping to see come out of it?",
        "We need two things fundamentally.",
        "We need agreements on these targets at the level of prime minister and president.",
        "The second thing is we have to find support from the developing world, particularly for Africa and vulnerable countries, particularly for stopping deforestation, particularly for promoting new technology, that financial support is required to help the developing world make their changes.",
        "Nicholas Stern is the chair of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics.",

        "Lawyers, judges and Governor Schwarzenegger all admit that most judges are still white and male, but they also say that it will take more than changing the appointment process.",
        "A statewide committee is looking at the reason why only four percent of the state's judges are black, with just six percent Hispanic and another 4.4 percent Asian.",
        "Education and interest were cited as possible reasons.",

        "He was 85.",
        "The caucus also lost a standing member just last month with the death of California Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald.",
        "That seat is set for a special election a few weeks from now and is in danger of being lost to the CBC because of a contentious race between two black candidates, including her daughter, who are expected to split the vote and open the door for a third candidate who is Latina.",
        "On top of that, the CBC is also caught in another battle over its upcoming presidential debate.",
        "Last week, a spokesman from New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson's office said he would not be participating in the September debates, which are co-sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus and Fox News.",
        "And then, shortly after, the spokesperson retracted the statement and said Richardson was still unsure about making an appearance.",
        "So far, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards have all decided not to participate in the debate.",
        "Edward is saying his reasoning is because Fox News, in his words, is a biased news operation.",
