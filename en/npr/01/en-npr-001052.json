        "Actually, the thing that makes the best response to that is to look at - ask the question, were there any problems before 2003 when these amendments went in?",
        "And there weren't any problems.",
        "In fact, before 2003, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms proactively would publish studies, saying here's - that one percent of the gun dealers nationwide are providing the guns that are used in 60 percent of the crimes.",
        "That is one of the statistics.",

        "When he got that job, had either of you ever heard of George Mason University?",
        "I had never heard of it, and to honest with you, after -- I was going to be a senior in high school and came here, worked out with my dad's players, and after the first workout there was actually a fight.",
