        "He said he'd just spoken with Justice Souter by phone, thanked him for his service.",

        "I will seek someone who understands that justice isn't about some abstract legal theory or footnote in a casebook.",
        "It is also about how our laws affect the daily realities of people's lives, whether they can make a living and care for their families, whether they feel safe in their homes and welcome in their own nation.",

        "I wish he'd mention the Constitution.",

        "But, you know, he was a gentleman and a scholar in the Supreme Court.",
        "And the conventional thing to say is it won't change the balance of the court because it's more or less a liberal vote…",
        "He was with the liberals (unintelligible).",
        "Yeah.",
        "But the two things to remember: First, Supreme Court justices tend to last 26 years.",
        "So it'll at least extend the liberal vote for another 26 years.",
        "And then the second thing I'm interested in is there's a conventional view that a lot of people want Obama to pick a liberal Scalia, someone with very clear views, very straightforward.",
        "I'd be - I'd guess, this is a guess, that he'd more pick a justice, a liberal Roberts, someone with more conciliatory views, more of a coalition builder."

        "Part of it is how much of a fight he wants to add to all his other fights, in terms of who he picks.",
        "What's fascinating is how the Specter business affects this, because Arlen Specter would have been the leading Republican questioner on that committee, and now he is a Democrat.",
        "The next person in line is Jeff Sessions, himself a very conservative Republican, who had his own unsuccessful confirmation fight.",
        "…solicitor general, used to be the dean of the Harvard Law School, would be a fascinating choice for this.",
        "I suspect Obama will pick somebody ever so slightly to the left of Souter, but won't look like it, and will get through confirmation.",
        "Well, which brings us to the story of Senator Specter, who says very plainly he counted the registration totals in Pennsylvania.",
        "He did some polling, he went around the state, and he figured out he's a Democrat now.",
        "And I heard from the Republican National Committee Chair Michael Steele, who was furious about this over the week.",

        "There are none left.",
        "He had 10 seats in Pennsylvania.",
        "There are only seven now.",
        "A party needs a certain number of moderates outside its areas of strength to form a majority.",
        "The Republicans are in danger of becoming a Southern regional conservative party with a few other outposts.",
        "And the very alibi they're using that Specter did this for self interested reasons, which he did, is just an admission of how much trouble the Republicans are in.",
        "The Republican party is too conservative for Specter to win a primary.",
        "Pennsylvania is so Democratic, that's where Specter wants to be.",
        "The president, though, when he was asked about this at his news conference, was quite philosophical.",
        "He said I think things are never as good as they seem for a party or as bad as they seem.",

        "Well, I think those mechanisms, you know, at face value seem very strong.",
        "I think that if he really has weight enough to get the banks to extend the credit once they have gotten the money rather than, you know, remodeling CEO offices and, you know, going on retreats, I think it'll be great.",
        "You know, we're seeing people with 700-plus credit scores that are traditionally just good credit people not being able to get credit to buy a new RV, and that has a huge impact on the RV industry as a whole.",
        "It's similar to automobile industry, is that if the retail customer can't get credit that doesn't, you know, provide a sell or a deal for RV dealer, once that happens the manufacturer doesn't get a reorder from us or an order out and then they hurt.",
        "So it's kind of a catastrophic effect when that one retail customer can't get funding.",
