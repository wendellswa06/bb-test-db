        "And he retired as a three-star admiral.",
        "OK.",
        "But you said he was appointed to the job in an acting capacity - the fact he's not been nominated, meaning the Senate has not confirmed him, passed on his appointment at all.",
        "And he's been there just since Aug. 16, I believe, which means he must have been wrestling with this whistleblower complaint almost the entire time he's been in the job.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "If that timeline all adds up, it's something that he actually walked right into.",
        "You know, by the time he received the whistleblower report, the inspector general of the intelligence community had already reviewed it and found it to be both credible and urgent.",
        "You know, Steve, at that point, by law, Maguire was really just supposed to be the messenger here and just pass the report on to Congress.",
        "He decided to seek legal counsel on this.",
        "And he referred the whistleblower's report to the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which in turn determined that it did not fall under Maguire's jurisdiction as DNI and that he did not need to send it on to Congress.",
        "And ever since, the whistleblower's controversy blew up.",
        "Maguire has come under enormous scrutiny, and many Democrats have been accusing him of covering up the report, protecting the administration.",
        "Now, we should note he has fiercely denied that, said he's always done his job with integrity.",
        "There was also a report that he'd threatened to resign.",
        "Did he?",
        "The Washington Post said - and they were basing this on current and former U.S.",
        "officials - that Maguire did threaten to resign if he was constrained in any way from testifying to Congress.",
        "And after that story appeared, Maguire quickly put out a very strong statement denying it.",
        "But the Post's editor, Marty Baron, says they stand by their story."
