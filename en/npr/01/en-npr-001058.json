        "So until those three things together come back, it's probably going to be a little bit of a tough road for these auto companies.",
        "The turning point we mentioned, the significance of that statistic, more cars in China than in North America.",
        "It just goes to show you that the Chinese market, which really kind of dragged along for most of the last 20 years, has pretty much come into its own.",
        "I wouldn't say that it's mature by any stretch of the imagination because it's still growing.",
        "And that is the place that all the world's carmakers are competing for the Chinese consumer.",
