        "If we're buying all oru hardware from China, could there not be stuff, Trojan horses and things inside the hardware they're sending us?",
        "Yeah, that's a really important concern.",
        "You know, we talk about the security of supply chains and the fact that, you know, China is the factory and the workshop of the world, especially on IT.",
        "You know, there could be a lot of back doors.",
        "And in fact this is a concern that prompted Australia to ban Huawei, which is the major telecommunications company, they build servers and routers, Internet infrastructure, they banned them from bidding on their high-speed backbone project.",
        "There also was a House report on Huawei, which recommended against dealing with either Huawei or ZTE for exactly these kinds of reasons.",
        "You know, but that kind of shows you that, you know, that concern can have a huge business impact for these corporations.",
        "So do they necessarily have an interest in getting involved?",
        "Plus, again, you know, I won't get into the technical details, but if you start thinking about, you know, if you put a bug in there, then actually being able to use it at a time and place of your choosing is going to be a really difficult proposition because supply chains are incredibly, incredibly complex.",
        "So being able to activate that logic bomb, if you will, and understanding where it is and understanding all of the other complex factors that go into its embeddedness in human and technical systems is a really, really hard thing.",
        "So, you know, it's a genuine concern, but again it's a technical possibility is probably a lot greater than its actual probability.",
        "Is there a high-tech fix to any of this snooping around?",
        "And in a statement to NPR, ICE said that this arrest was a targeted enforcement action following Maria's court appearance as the defendant on misdemeanor criminal charges, adding that this courtroom arrest policy is not new.",
        "To snooping around?",
        "No, I don't think there's a high-tech fix because, you know, if you -you know, the Mandiant report and, you know, plenty of other reports from MacAfee or Symantec which kind of walk you through similar information show you that the weaknesses are less technical and more in exploiting just human gullibility or, you know, people who let their guard down.",
        "Some of these phishing emails are incredibly sophisticated, right.",
        "I mean, if it comes from your boss, and it's talking about a project that you're working on, you're going to be very likely to open that file.",
        "Well, you've just installed a root kit onto your server, and now they can start moving laterally and, you know, compromising other pieces of the network.",
        "So that's how they can do it?",
        "You had something called \"\"spear phishing,\"\" which is even higher level than regular - P-H-I-S-H, phishing."

        "And you're like OK, that's interesting.",
        "You would open that up, bam, you get hit.",
        "So they made it very, very believable because they did the intelligence work on your background, which is now very easy to do because we have Twitter and Facebook, and people put all kinds of personal information that they can basically, you know, fake a contact.",
        "Yeah, that's why I don't open my NPR mail anymore.",

        "So is there - what do you see of the future here?",
        "Where is this headed?",
        "Well, I think that there's going to continue to be a lot of noise and friction in cyberspace.",
        "This isn't going to get fixed, but I think it's just going to be sort of the general level of background radiation that we will get used to.",
        "You know, when militaries go to war, there will be a cyber component, but people don't go to war because of cyberspace, you know, they just use it as one tool amongst many.",
        "So, you know, it's going to be a complex world, but I don't think it's necessarily going to be a more dangerous world.",
        "If you unplug for total security, can you have total security?",
        "Let's say you want to just unplug from the Internet and stay in-house.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, you know, the only reason that people can hack your computer is because you're connected to the network.",
        "So if you don't connect to anything, you can't do anything.",
        "But then it's not very useful.",
        "And this gets to the fundamental tradeoff in a lot of the policy that we're considering.",
        "If we get really scared about the threat, and we start imposing, you know, technology standards and, you know, all kinds of things that would impact the productivity of our information networks, then you're going to see kind of the great gifts of the information economy start to be whittled away."

        "This is a small, 80-passenger aircraft used for regional hops.",
        "He managed to take off from Sea-Tac Airport - a major airport.",

        "As you heard, the man was in contact with air traffic control.",
        "They were trying to get him to land.",

        "We don't know what motivated him to take the plane and do this.",
        "But during those communications with air traffic control, he did describe himself - and I'm quoting here - as \"\"a broken guy with a few screws loose.\"\" Those are his words.",
        "Could he fly a plane?",
        "Well, he knew enough to get the plane started, taxi it and get it airborne.",

        "As he does that, it appears he's about to crash into the water.",
        "And at the last minute, he pulls out of that dive and keeps flying.",
