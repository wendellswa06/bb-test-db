        "It seems like it's, you know, eons ago that we were talking about the iPhone 3 and 3G, things that are implicated in this case.",
        "But Carani thinks this decision is big news, because the patent Apple is infringing is something known as a Standard Essential Patent.",
        "Basically this is technology everyone in the industry has to use for the 3G network to work.",
        "So if we think about the way that you connect to the Internet, or the way that Smartphones communicate.",
        "It's really important that everyone in the industry agree one standard.",
        "If each one had a different shape then it would wreak great havoc.",
        "So when a company like Samsung has a patent on a technology like this, they're supposed to agree to license it to everyone for a fair and reasonable price.",
        "This case went to the International Trade Commission because Samsung and Apple couldn't agree on what fair and reasonable meant.",
        "Samsung wanted Apple to pay 2.4 percent of the cost of every iPhone and iPad sold.",
        "That's something close $10 a gadget to licenses its technology.",
        "But Samsung's patent was just one of thousands of these so-called Standards Essential Patents for the 3G network, all of which are necessary to make the it function.",
        "Apple argued...",
        "This particular contribution was .0000375 percent of the UTMS standard, was actually attributable to this particular patent.",
        "Carani feels if this ruling stands other owners of so-called Standard Essential Patents - and there are thousands and thousand of them - could become emboldened to sue.",

        "For example, in the past they used to look at from the time they came in contact with the applicant until they shipped off to basic training.",
        "In 2005 they changed that and included the full window of the period of their basic training.",
        "So, 2004 to 2005 is comparing an apple to an orange.",
