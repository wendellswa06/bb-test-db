        "And Kudlow was in his - on his podcast a couple of days ago, and he said, Trump comes at you like he's going to punch you in the teeth with these tariffs.",

        "Here's what he said.",

        "He comes out really hard and strong, scares everybody.",
        "Then he starts to pull back, withdraw.",
        "And Trump, if - he says if Trump is willing to use these tariffs just to get a better NAFTA deal, for instance, with Canada and Mexico - friends of Kudlow says that's something Kudlow can live with.",
        "He wants to keep NAFTA going, but he's willing to modernize it.",
        "But given that they don't necessarily see eye to eye on tariffs, what is the appeal of Kudlow for President Trump?",
        "As Trump said yesterday, he's known Kudlow for a long time.",
        "Kudlow worked for Ronald Reagan.",
        "He was once the top economist at Bear Stearns.",
        "He's a longtime television personality on CNBC.",
        "He's a New Yorker.",

        "Trump pointed this out yesterday.",
        "We know Trump values loyalty.",
        "And during the campaign, Trump used Larry Kudlow like the Good Housekeeping seal of approval.",
        "He would say Larry Kudlow likes my tax plan.",
        "Larry Kudlow probably helped him design the tax plan.",
        "But also, Kudlow is an enthusiastic supporter of every other part of Trump's economic agenda - the tax cuts and deregulation.",
        "He just differs with him on trade.",
        "So with all the other changes we're seeing this week like replacing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Mara, what's your takeaway from all these staff moves?",
        "Well, one takeaway is that it isn't as simple as just Trump wanting nationalists or people who agree with him.",
        "At first glance, it might appear that way.",
        "But Kudlow is - he's not a protectionist.",
        "So Trump likes a team of rivals.",
        "And as he said yesterday, I want divergent opinions.",
        "It's also in part about comfort level and chemistry.",
        "And he likes the debate that's happening inside the White House right now.",
        "You still have Peter Navarro and Bob Lighthizer and Wilbur Ross.",
        "They are on the more protectionist side.",
        "Yes.",
        "And I was told by an outside adviser to Trump that he's still trying to thread the needle on trade.",
        "He's still obsessed with the trade deficit.",
        "He still sees it like a score card and a zero-sum game, not as an indication of comparative advantage.",
        "But he doesn't want to hurt the stock market, and that's one of the reasons he wants someone like Larry Kudlow there with him."

        "That would mean China's leader Xi Jinping may not retire after the standard 10 years in power.",

        "NPR's Anthony Kuhn has been following the story and joins us now.",
        "Hi, Anthony.",
        "Hi, Sarah.",
        "So how long has China had term limits for its leaders, and why are they in place?",
        "Well, they haven't had the term limits for very long in the historical scheme of things.",
        "China's constitution has prescribed two five-year terms for president and vice president since 1982.",
        "And before that, Chinese leaders basically just ruled until they died - from, you know, centuries of emperors under imperial dynasties all the way up to China's late leader Deng Xiaoping, who ruled basically until his death in 1997.",
        "And so these limits are going to be taken out of the constitution.",
        "One thing to remember is that Xi Jinping is actually also head of the Communist Party and the military.",
        "And those two posts outrank the president, and they have no legal limits whatsoever.",
        "And what signs, if any, have there been that this was coming?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was kind of expected.",
        "Over the past five years, Xi Jinping has been amassing power in his own hands.",
        "He's been knocking out his political rivals in an anti-corruption campaign.",
        "And last year, China declared a new era under Xi Jinping's leadership, and they wrote his official ideology into the constitution.",
        "And that's not something every leader can do.",
        "So it suggested that he was ending previous arrangements.",
        "And according to recent tradition, they should've designated Xi's successor last year.",

        "And how much of a sense are we getting of why China's leaders are moving in this direction?",
        "Well, this was announced in state media on Sunday.",
        "And there's no explanation yet.",
        "What Xi's supporters are saying is that these are special times, and they demanded some special arrangements.",
        "They say that Xi Jinping has an ambitious agenda ahead of him to reform the country's economy and politics.",
        "And he has a lot of vested bureaucratic interests to overcome.",
        "And this is going to require some extra time, and it may require extra continuity, which will make the country more stable.",
        "Now, these changes to the constitution will actually have to be approved at a session of China's parliament in March.",
        "But that parliament has never voted down any piece of legislation that the party in government has put before it.",
        "So it's basically seen as a done deal.",
        "And finally, Anthony, how much concern are you hearing about this proposal?",
        "When I hear your new ideas, I'm reminded of that ad: Where's the beef?"

        "The Shia villages where much of the protests have been taking place are relatively easy to seal off.",

        "Not at all.",

        "However, because there was a large influx of foreign journalists, the story, which they really were anxious not to spill out, if you will, did spill out.",
        "And that was of this very strong police presence.",
        "The police themselves have been under fire for the excessive use of force, the excessive use of tear gas in these Shia villages.",
        "And there was little that was seen by foreign journalists that would suggest that the impunity with which the police have been treating protesters has changed at all.",
        "This despite a damning report last November by an independent commission that was, to be fair, set up by the king, examining the situation in Bahrain last year.",
        "And that report said that the police used excessive force, that there was torture and detention.",
        "Five people died in detention.",

        "One, John Timoney, from - formerly the Miami police chief.",

        "So they're not seeing on the ground any change.",

        "They know that, as you say, that both the Americans and the British are not pushing too hard in terms of other countries or other in the regions.",
