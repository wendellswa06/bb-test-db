        "What would be the closest precedent, if any, for such a task?",
        "Actually, this is an unprecedented situation.",
        "The closest thing might be the creation of a special inspectorate after the 1991 Gulf War, which was the United Nations Special Commission, which was sent in to disarm Iraq of its nuclear/biological/chemical weapons capabilities, as well as of delivery systems."
