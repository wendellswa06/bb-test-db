        "We proved that American politics still is in the hands of ordinary folks like you and across this country who believes that it wasn't about who raised the most money, but who raise the greatest hopes.",

        "Joining us now, the chairman of the Republican Party in New Hampshire.",
        "He is Fergus Cullen.",
        "He is with us from Concord.",
        "Fergus Cullen, what do you make of the results in Iowa?",
        "And how is that going to affect things in New Hampshire?",
        "Well, certainly Mike Huckabee's win on the Republican side gives him a huge push of media.",
        "And he's really lived off of earned media, freeing media coverage in New Hampshire to this point.",
        "In fact, that's really what his campaign has been mostly about here to this point.",
        "He's put more effort into Iowa than he has into New Hampshire.",
        "That's not a knock on Governor Huckabee.",
        "Certainly he's been leaving audiences with a favorable impression everywhere he's gone when he's been here.",
        "But there's also no question his organization is not as strong in New Hampshire as that of many of the other candidates.",
        "I actually also think what happened to the Democratic caucus matters in the New Hampshire Republican primary in this way.",
        "I think that Obama's win increases the likelihood of an independent voter pulling a Democratic ballot here.",
        "That could be harmful to John McCain, who certainly has been hoping to appeal to independents here as part of his push along with Republicans.",
        "How many people do you know in the state - how many important political people do you know who are working for Governor Huckabee?",
        "Well, it's about a dozen, I would say.",
        "A dozen?",
        "A dozen in the state?"

        "And the people he has are very high quality people.",
        "And here's why.",
        "If you signed up with Governor Huckabee six months ago, it is because you are convinced that you like him and that he was somebody that you wanted to support not because you thought he was going to win.",
        "So they really are conviction supporters.",
        "And those are always great people to have.",
        "No one signed up with Governor Huckabee six months ago because he was the frontrunner or they thought he was going to win.",
        "So the people he has are of very high quality.",
        "The challenge for him is that they're relatively few in number.",
        "As you look at the state today, the analysis that I have seen from the vote in Iowa says that Governor Huckabee won because he got a lot of evangelicals.",
        "That's not such a factor in New Hampshire, is it?",
        "People weren't scrupulously following the law.",

        "Okay.",

        "Well, discussion of it in China's state media is pretty heavily censored at the moment.",
        "But it's clear that people are worried because it runs counter to the trend of the past 40 years or so, which is basically China's reform era.",
        "And during that time, the problem of political succession has been seen as China's sort of Achilles heel.",
        "And leaders have tried to make the succession more institutionalized, more orderly and predictable.",
        "And term limits are a part of that.",

        "Just three weeks after getting a shellacking in the midterm elections, yesterday President Obama got a fat lip.",
        "The president played basketball Friday with some friends in the gym of the Fort McNair Army Base and reportedly took an elbow in the mouth from an opposing player who went up for a shot.",
        "It took 12 stitches to close the First Fat Lip, if you please.",
        "I'm not sure that Joe Frazier needed 12 stitches after the Thriller in Manila, though the White House stressed that a smaller filament was used, which increases the number of stitches but leaves a smaller scar.",
        "I wonder if having a larger scar wouldn't actually fortify President Obama's profile as he contends with Kim Jong-Il, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or Vladimir Putin.",
        "Imagine a president with a gnarly vivid scar telling the rulers of China: Nice country you got here, I'd hate something to happen to it if you didn't stop fooling around with the value of your currency, know what I mean?"

        "Among the hoopsters reportedly playing with President Obama were his nephew, Avery Robinson, a high school basketball star in Providence, Rhode Island; Reggie Love, the president's personal assistant, who played for Duke University's national championship team in 2001; and Education Secretary Arne Duncan, who played four years of pro basketball in Australia.",

        "And because she's not only a wife or a sister or a niece, but she is also a mother, when she bares children, boys, she then gets the chance to bring them up.",

        "And Judaic and Christian Theology stresses and emphasizes virginity as well, but in Islam it's not only taught, it's also enforced.",
        "Women have to stay inside their homes, they have to wait until their parents decide who they are going to marry, and if a woman loses her virginity before she's married, then she's shunned or she's killed.",
