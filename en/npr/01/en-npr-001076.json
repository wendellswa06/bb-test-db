        "In a piece for The New Yorker, staff writer John Cassidy examines why the economies of Muslim nations have tended to lag behind the West.",
        "He concludes - and I quote - \"\"The most immediate explanation involves not Islam, but predatory governance and colonialism.",

        "Thanks very much for inviting me on.",
        "Well, it's good to have you.",
        "So tell me, what is the argument that some scholars make when they look at Islam and say, that's it, that's what has limited economic growth?",
        "Well, the basic argument is that Islam itself is sort of antithetical to entrepreneurship and other forms of sort of capitalistic activity.",
        "The classic example is banking, because in Islam, paying interest on deposits is seen as a bad thing and is actually banned.",
        "Although a lot of countries and companies have found ways around that over the years.",
        "Exactly.",
        "But that's the sort of argument which has been made over the years.",
        "The sort of legacy of Islam has held back these countries from developing not just banks, but big companies, because there are also inheritance customs in Islamic countries, the sort of Western system of primogenitor, where the oldest son tends to accumulate most of the family wealth does not exist there.",
        "They have to split up most of the wealth equally among all the heirs.",
        "What that tends to do is - means that fortunes don't last for generations.",
        "They get split up, so you don't have the emergence of a sort of Rockefeller fortune or a Ford fortune.",
        "Companies and sort of wealthy people tend to only last for a shorter timeframe."

        "So there are the sort arguments that have been put forward over the years, claiming that, you know, Islam is in itself somehow intrinsically bad for economic growth.",
        "I don't actually agree with that, and most of my piece is taken up with providing alternative explanations for why the Middle East is being left behind.",
        "Well, and what are some of the alternative explanations that you've found?",
        "Well, there's a number of them.",
        "The main one is sort of historical.",
        "If you go back and look at the history of this region, what you find is actually they started out as a very entrepreneurial region.",
        "The original caliphate, which today is associated with, you know, Osama bin Laden and radical fundamentalism, actually was a great trading empire, which had trading routes all the way from the Atlantic and Spain to the Himalayas and Central Asia.",
        "The original Islamic partnerships which were put together to finance these trading routes were very modern for that day.",
        "And basically, Islam in those days, or the Islamic countries, were far more advanced than the West, which had fallen back into the Dark Ages.",
        "So you've got to say what changed between then and now, and I think a lot of it is to do with successive waves of colonialism in these countries.",
        "Back in the 15th, 16th centuries, they were overran by the Ottomans, the Turks, and the Ottomans were not very interested in economics at all.",
        "What they were interested in was war and military glory.",
        "And they basically used countries like Egypt for tax purposes, to raise revenues for the sultan and his armies.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Western liberals, especially European people who are engaged in this debate, can be divided into those who are engaging appeasement and who plead for the appeasement of radical Islam, and those who want to confront it.",
        "Now those who want to appease it say let's just indulge every whim of the radical Muslims.",
        "My own country has, the Netherlands has just brought out a report that Islam means peace and that terrorism is not something that can be linked to Islam, that kind of thing.",
        "This is the appeasement movement.",
        "This is also the establishment, and within the establishment there is a group of people who are saying no, let's confront this, and I see them as my allies and they are against multi-culturalism.",
        "They are reviewing ideas that were once thought to be good, and that was the idea of encouraging self-segregation as a root to integration.",
        "I think multi-culturalism was well-intended and it was based on trying not to be racist, but in practice it has become perversely racist.",
        "Islam sets us apart, you write.",
        "Islam sets us apart.",

        "If you accept the assertion that all knowledge is contained in the Holy Koran, and that everything that's in there is true, then that curbs your curiosity.",
        "It curbs your ability to learn, and I believe that that can be reformed by acknowledging that these verses are in there but by just reading them in their context, which was the seventh or eighth century and humanity has moved on.",
        "And what the radical Muslims are preaching is you have to follow the prophet Mohammed today in the 21st century, otherwise you're not a good Muslim and you will end up in hell.",
        "You don't have to throw away the tradition, you can respect it, but you can reform it by critically appraising the position of Mohammed as a moral guide today.",

        "What they left us behind was also destroyed with them.",
        "But in this technological age, where you can't destroy every copy of my book, or Submission, my film, then it makes it much easier for us living in the 21st century in Western countries to develop critical ideas of Islam and spread that.",
