        "Yes.",
        "...I just want to ask: Why is that, in the entire Middle East, the entire countries hire expatriates, you know, and then the expatriates' ratio is more than the local population and then the local people don't get jobs, and even if they are educated?",
        "Can you answer this question, sir?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that's a very good question.",
        "I mean, the fact that there are large expatriate communities in a lot of these countries and that the expatriate communities tend to do very well - for example, Egyptians in the U.S., Libyans in Britain, tend to do a lot better than the people back home.",
        "What that says to me is that there's nothing wrong with the sort of entrepreneurship and effort of the people intrinsically.",
        "They're - most of them are all still Muslims.",
        "It's problems in the economy themselves.",
        "And as I say, part of it's history.",
        "A lot of it is to do with the fact that - in some of these countries now, the jobs are sort of monopolized by the elites, and there just aren't enough jobs to go around, because there's been enormous population growth, as well.",
        "What has happened in places like Egypt and Tunisia and Sudan is infant mortality has fallen back a lot, which is a very good thing.",
        "A lot more babies survived than they used to do.",
        "But the fertility rate hasn't gone down.",
        "So you've had an enormous baby boom for the last 20 or 30 years.",
        "So the median age in Egypt is, I think, about 22 now.",
        "I think in Sudan or Yemen, it's about 19.",
        "At the same time, a lot of these countries have actually been building up their education systems, which is exactly what they should be doing.",
        "But what it means is you've got a lot of young, quite educated people who - when they graduate or drop out of college, can't find jobs.",
        "That's what we found in Egypt, for example.",
        "A lot of the people in Tahrir Square who led the revolution were, you know, quite educated.",
        "And it wasn't just a sort of old-style, you know, revolt of the peasantry who can't have - don't have enough food or whatever.",
        "That's the sort of classic French revolutionary model.",
        "Hmm.",
        "It was a fascinating observation in your article, John Cassidy, that unlike here in the U.S.",
        "or other Western countries, the unemployment rate actually increases with the level of educational instruction.",
        "I know, I mean, that's amazing.",
        "I mean, if you imagine the - you know, among sort of Ivy League graduates or, you know, California State - California education system state university graduates, if they had a higher unemployment rate than the general population, you know, there'd be uproar in the U.S., as well, because these people have very high expectations.",
        "They graduated from college expecting to do well in life.",
        "They are, after all, the elite of their country's educated elite.",

        "Well, I think there's two things.",
        "I mean, in the short run, it's very worrying, because these democratic governments - if they materialize in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, wherever - are going to be faced with big economic challenges.",
        "People are going to expect things to improve quickly, which they always do after a revolution.",
        "But it's going to be very difficult for the government to deliver in the short term, because they do have these problems.",
        "I mean, it's just very - if you got 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment among people in their 20s, even if you introduce pretty radical economic reforms and if you get more foreign investment, which they probably will, it's going to take a number of years for that to feed through into sort of increased living standards, increase opportunities.",
        "Every Wednesday, NPR's political editor Ken Rudin joins us for the latest on the presidential race and other political news.",
        "But at the same time, I'm actually reasonably optimistic in the long term that there's nothing wrong with these countries intrinsically if they take the right policy decisions and if they open up to - their countries to international trade.",
        "Tunisia actually provides a pretty good example of that.",
        "In the last 10 or 20 years, Tunisia has actually done pretty well economically by sort of integrating itself in with the European economy.",
        "A lot of these countries, remember, are just on the other side of the Mediterranean from the EU, so there's no reason why they couldn't have been producing goods for export to the EU.",
        "And Tunisia is doing that.",
        "In fact, in the recent last year or two, I found out while I was researching the piece, Airbus, the enormous European aircraft company, is open to plant or is building a plant in Tunisia, just south of Tunis.",
        "And Hewlett-Packard, the American computer company, is - has opened a calling center in Tunisia to deal with inquiries from other countries.",
        "You know, so some of these big foreign multinationals obviously are looking on Tunisia in very much the same way, a few years ago, they were looking on places like Ireland or India as potential sources of cheap labor and, you know, good places to locate.",
        "As long as the new Democratic regimes can guarantee some political stability and deal with the threat of sort of radical fundamentalism, which is a threat, I don't see any reason why they can't attract quite a lot of foreign investment and build up their economies.",

        "So far, Saudi Arabia has not erupted in the same kind of upheaval that we've seen elsewhere in the region.",
        "Well, what does that say to you about the economy?",
        "Are their economies better poised to transition into the 21st century and balancing the competing traditions of Islam we've been talking about and the need for a modern economy?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, you make a very good point.",

        "It's not a democracy.",
        "And the question is: How do you use the oil wells to develop the economy at large?",
        "That has proved very difficult for lots of countries, because what tends to happen is the governments tend to skim off as much of the oil revenues for the royal family and for the - or for the president and his friends as they can.",
        "That's exactly what we've seen in Egypt - sorry, in Libya, and it's also true to a lesser extent in Saudi Arabia.",
        "Saudi Arabia, basically, the royal family takes quite a lot of the wealth, and then the rest of it is used to finance a very large welfare state, basically, buying off the rest of the population, saying, you don't need democracy.",
        "Look, we're using all these oil wells to give you a generous - what amounts to a generous welfare system.",
        "The problem with that is, if that doesn't build up for their industries.",
        "And when the oil runs out, you know, these countries are going to be in very poor shape.",
        "It's not as if they developed high-technology industries or exporting industries to take the place of oil once it runs out.",
        "All right.",

        "Hi, yes.",
        "I studied in Cairo at AUC for a couple of years, for a master's degree.",
        "And what I found in Egypt specifically was a lot of the problems economically had to do with a lot of monopolization of the companies there.",
        "Gamal Mubarak, for example, was the only one with a license to sell BMWs in the country.",
        "And there's other people within the regime that were able to monopolize on industry.",
        "And I know that that hurt the - hurt private industry a lot in the country."

        "What do you make of that, John Cassidy?",

        "I mean, Mubarak is a classic example because, you know, when he came to power, he didn't seem be from that tradition.",

        "The military - the senior generals basically have their own private economy, too.",
        "Now, it seems to me once you have a democracy, you know, you can tackle that.",
        "The military itself is probably going to be reluctant to give up some of its economic prerequisites.",
        "But the, you know, the Mubarak family and its extended sort of hangers-on, I mean, they will presumably all either leave the country or, even if they stay, their sort of, you know, monopolies will be taken away from them - at least I hope they are.",

        "Well, I mean, the common lesson I try to draw in my piece, and I think it's a justified one, is that you can't reduce economics to religion.",
        "Religion does play a role - and obviously a big role in society and a large role in these Islamic societies.",
