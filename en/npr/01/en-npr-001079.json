        "You know, just as Barbara mentioned, we just have a stronger presence in the industry.",
        "I think half of the feed lots I do business in, the females are driving the feed trucks.",

        "And I think we as women, that healthy food for our families is important, and I think that's why there's more women out there starting to look at - even if it is just backyard gardening - because it's important to give their family healthy food.",

        "In fact, you mentioned your grandparents - my grandparents made it through the Depression because they could produce their own food.",
        "And then the excess they produced above and beyond what their own needs, they could barter for gasoline and, you know, rations and that type of thing.",

        "It's interesting.",
        "In the letter that he wrote to his parents - your grandparents - I guess, he says that, you know, I wrote you letters from a prisoner-of-war camp and I'm sorry to say you never got them.",

        "Probably.",

        "Their combined labors killed 250,000 people in 24 hours and destroyed all of Dresden - possibly the world's most beautiful city, then he adds, but not me.",
        "And that little phrase, but not me, he uses repeatedly through this letter to his parents.",

        "He had a strong belief that involving yourself in artistic pursuits like this was a way to educate yourself and a way to grow as a person.",
        "He, you know, he didn't think that these drawings would amount to much, but he said that wasn't the point.",
        "And not the point.",
        "Did he draw them first - where did - how did he use them?"
