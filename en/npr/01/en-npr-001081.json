        "He was.",
        "He had a few gripes, and one was the New Yorker not publishing him.",
        "And he finally got - he wrote a poem about Joe Heller which did get published and he was very, very happy with that.",
        "We had a contest saying which one of us could get a letter to the editor published in The New York Times.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, the Norwegians have things to say about the Swedes which Kurt had repeated and he thought that that also hadn't helped his chances.",
        "Did he have any theory why, you know, he wasn't taken seriously by, you know, whoever runs The New Yorker, whoever else who he thought didn't take him seriously?",
        "He thought…",
        "He thought that there were two kinds of writers - one is who was responding to their tradition and had new literary forms and could more or less do things on command.",
        "And he saw himself more or less as somebody who was mud-wrestling with ideas.",
        "And he did not - and he was trying to tell the truth and he worked very, very hard at it, but he did not relate to literature as the history of literature and he didn't see himself fitting in.",
        "And so, he really feels that that's the way - that's part of the reason that the literary establishment or people with degrees in English and stuff, didn't think he was a serious writer, but he was the most serious writer I ever knew."

        "But I had done some research into spring break myself a few years ago and I had some sort of bigger ideas that went beyond the statistics.",
        "Well, just looking at the statistics, 74 percent believed women used drinking as an excuse for outrageous behavior, 83 percent had friends who drank the majority of nights on spring break, 12 percent felt forced or pressured into sex.",

        "And I have to say, given my experience - I did go down to Cancun, not as a student, as a reporter a couple of years ago, and I - this is not scientific, but my observations would tell me that 10 alcoholic drinks per day clearly mean per day.",
        "And we probably aren't even going into the nighttime there with those counts.",
        "But, yeah, just to answer your question, when I was asked by a magazine to go down to Cancun and kind of come up with some sort of big existential reason that women are doing this and what I came away with after interviewing a lot of people - men and women - was that getting drunk and behaving in an overtly sexual way sort of imitating porn stars, there are lots of games and activities that I couldn't really describe in the Los Angeles Times, and I won't go into great detail into here.",
        "But participating in these games and sort of parading oneself as hot has become a measure of preparation for adulthood.",
