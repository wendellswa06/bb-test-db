        "What were you going after with this study?",
        "What did you want to find out?",
        "So the first question we're interested is what do people think is the wealth distribution in the U.S.",
        "And we basically asked them to say how much do you think of the wealth is owned by the top 20 percent, the next 20, the next 20.",
        "And what we found was that people dramatically underestimated how much wealth the wealthy have, but also dramatically overestimated how much money the poor have.",
        "And the second question we're interested in was if you gave people the right to design the distribution of wealth in the U.S., how would it look like?",
        "You know, we often think about distribution of wealth in the question of efficiency, of the economy and what will motivate people.",
        "And we wanted to just ask if you just gave people the right to say, what would you think is a just society, how would people draw that distribution.",
        "Now, you showed people three pie charts, I understand.",
        "And those charts showed the distribution of income in different countries.",
        "But you didn't give it away.",
        "You didn't tell them which countries they were looking at.",
        "That's right.",
        "So - and we actually have a very equal distribution, which doesn't exist anywhere.",
        "We had the distribution of the U.S., and then we had a distribution that was based on Sweden, but we actually made it even more equal than Sweden itself.",
        "And we say, which of those would you like to live in?",
        "Americans, you found, prefer Sweden, the way it looked in that pie chart.",
        "Yes.",
        "So 92 percent of Americans prefer the distribution of the U.S.",
        "that is much more equal than what we have right now.",
        "But perhaps the most interesting and also most optimistic part of the study was that when we broke the sample by Republicans and Democrats, there were differences there, but they were actually quite small.",
        "So, for example, if the average was 92 percent preferred the Swedish distribution; for Democrats, it was 93 percent; and for Republicans, it was 90 and a half percent.",
        "So there's a difference.",
        "But it seems to me that when we go kind of underline and we ask people about the true ideology, Americans are much more equal than we think and the differences between the different parties are smaller than we think.",
        "Well, what about income levels of the people who were responding, looking at these pie charts, what would low-income people see and what would rich people see?",
        "Similar to the Republicans and Democrats, there were differences.",
        "The wealthy basically wanted slightly more unequal distribution.",
        "The poor wanted slightly more equal distribution.",
        "But the fact is that the differences between them were, again, very, very small."

        "The way that, you know, the pop culture has sort of presenting itself visually has a lot to do with pornography.",
