        "And so I think part of the spring-break phenomenon is that kids really feel like they have the ability to go on spring break and to experiment with all the things that they feel like they're going to be judged about if they do back home.",
        "And so there is that perception that if you go down on spring break, you can really cut loose and anything goes because nobody is going to judge you for it.",

        "I mean, my impression - and, again, these are just, you know, these are my observations and I didn't interview every single person on those beaches, but my feeling was that college, you know, sort of represented 80 percent of this kind of party, you know, atmosphere and, you know, the - you could get 300 percent down on spring break.",
        "But the colleges and universities that tend to be most represented on vacations like these are party schools anyway, typically, you know.",
        "Certainly, when I was in college, no one I knew went on this kind of spring break, it just wasn't part of the culture.",
        "So - but, yeah, I mean, maybe, you know, there might be a sort of - maybe there are schools with, and I'm just speculating, maybe there are religious sort of components that are coming into play here, I don't know.",
        "But I'll have to think about that one.",
        "This caller raised something I - that's new to me.",
