        "Well, 1964 was a time of great turbulent in Southeast Asia.",
        "For 300 years, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, have existed on the colonial rule.",
        "Now, they are independent, and people are finding that both on a national and a personal level, freedom is actually something that's very hard to do with.",
        "Now, the book takes place during a movement that was being pushed by the Indonesian leader at the time, Sukarno, with the name George Orwell could not have invented, and it was called guided democracy.",
        "What was it all about?",
        "It was eventually Sukarno's pushed to make Indonesia into a cohesive nation.",
        "By 1964, the wheels are slightly coming off this rather rickety bandwagon, and Sukarno's losing grip on the situation and things are tumbling into disarray, and was sliding very swiftly into civil war.",
        "As you described in the book, during this period, he begins a purge of communists and of any remnants of Dutch colonialism.",
        "Caught in the middle of your story, of your novel, is a 16-year-old named Adam.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He's orphaned.",
        "He was abandoned very early on in life.",
        "He gets adopted by a Dutchman who spent most of his life in Indonesia who - of course, as Indonesia teaches on the brink of civil turmoil, he's adoptive father has taken away.",
        "And so Adam finds himself orphaned yet again.",
        "And so, he has to face, like his country, questions of identity, questions of where he's from, where he's going to, who his family really is.",
        "And so the novel is really about how he finds his father and therefore how he finds himself.",
        "What - one of the main characters in the book who is part of a major plot twist, he's name is Din.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He is a student and a revolutionary.",
        "I mean, he sees Malaysia as the ultimately enemy.",
        "He wants to destroy any remnants of what he describes as neo-imperialism.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "Din doesn't really belong to any of the main political groups.",
        "He becomes seriously radicalized.",
        "And in fact, in that way, he released a precursor to a lot of what's going on in Indonesia now.",
        "As it were in the '60s, the great radicalizing element was communism.",
        "Today, it's much more likely to be Islam.",
        "But I think that there a lot of similarities to be drawn.",
        "I think when large numbers of young people, young men in particular become disillusioned and have no hope, they will turn to whatever is out there that will radicalize them."

        "Your descriptions of Jakarta, the city of Jakarta in the mid-1960s are incredibly evocative.",
        "Obviously, you weren't around at that time to witness because you're a young man.",
        "No.",
        "But, I mean, you described the incense smell in the alleyways, the blocked drain pipes, the cooking sounds.",

        "I did.",
        "I've spent a lot of time in Jakarta over the years.",
        "I visited ever since I was about 9 or 10 and continued to do so.",
        "And although Jakarta has obviously changed a lot in one way, I think, the atmosphere of the street hasn't.",
        "For me, coming from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Jakarta is always felt incredibly crowded, very grimy, very dusty and quite dangerous and mysterious at the same time.",
        "And so what I did was just to capture that element that I've always felt and just transposed that into a 1960 setting.",
        "Tash Aw, you were born in Taiwan.",

        "It's hard not to draw some comparisons between you and the character Adam, who, you know, of course, as a boy who's drawn from all of these different worlds.",
        "Were you, sort of, thinking about those things when you were writing this story?",
        "It's never something I think subconsciously.",
        "I mean, there's never a day when I wake up thinking, goodness, I have a very fragment cultural (unintelligible).",
        "But, of course, as you say, inevitably, one's upbringing, one's cultural DNA filtered into one's work.",
        "And I guess, for that reason, a lot of my characters are looking to find out who they are.",
        "All of them are looking to try and discern a notion of home where they belong.",
        "So I guess, in that way, my own life does have certain parallels with my characters' lives.",

        "How much do you believe there's any credence in, perhaps a better job of marketing could have been done here?",
        "I can't even testify to say that the way it was marketed is \"\"wrong\"\" or not.",
        "I felt like if it didn't appeal to the masses, that I was confident that word of mouth--movies like Thank You For Smoking, which opened in a very limited release got a huge word of mouth from its audiences, which were primarily white America.",
        "And white America, when they go see a film that's not marketed really wide or whatever, they hear about it.",
        "And they tell each other, and they go.",
        "When you think about what some of the other movies have made, that certainly are less significant on the idea of trying to showcase a positive experience for blacks, is it the idea that perhaps those of us who pushed this aren't getting it?",
        "Perhaps we're missing the idea that maybe, maybe the audience doesn't want to see that?",

        "It really was very much a love story.",
