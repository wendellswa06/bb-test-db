        "No, no, no, delegate votes, obviously, you have to have that to win a nomination.",
        "But what if you don't have the most popular votes is some question about whether the superdelegates should go to somebody who is trailing in the popular vote.",
        "The question is - did I make it more confusing?",
        "The question is who is the last person to get more popular votes during the primaries but not win his party's nomination?",
        "Okay.",
        "The last time a nominee of a major political party got the nomination with the most without…",
        "Without winning the most popular votes in the primary.",
        "Okay.",

        "E-mail is talk@npr.org.",
        "But getting back to the popular votes we were recounting, just yesterday.",
        "After that, will it take a miracle to deny John McCain the Republican nomination?",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think all the demands or the request of Mike Huckabee to drop out of this, no reason he should drop out of it because there are a lot of conservatives who needed a vehicle to express their disenchantment, shall I say, with John McCain, and Mike Huckabee is that vehicle.",
        "I think, mathematically, it's very possible or if not likely that John McCain could have it wrapped up by March 4th, when four states including Texas and Ohio have their primaries.",
        "But, you know, there's no reason he should drop out before them but, I think, it's pretty close.",
        "And does this - does Huckabee's continued campaign continue to divide the party?",
        "Well, it's like saying that maybe Clinton or Obama should drop out because that's dividing the party and certainly the party is divided on Clinton or Obama.",
        "But again, I think, you know, there's no reason they should be a coronation, the purpose of the primary season is to, you know, sort out differences or try to campaign to address who had supported opponents' concerns."

        "On the Democratic side yesterday, Senator Obama not only swept the three primary elections, they were not close.",

        "But it almost reminds me of Rudy Giuliani that, you know, he was just waiting for some miracle to happen in Florida, hoping that by doing nothing until then, until Florida, suddenly the voter will see that he's the right guy for the nomination.",
        "I'm not saying Hillary Clinton is doing that but after looking at what happened yesterday and certainly over the weekend, that's eight in a row.",

        "Yeah.",
        "That's quite a bit of money.",

        "Well, losing your campaign manager and your deputy campaign manager, Ken Rudin, doesn't make you look like a confident campaigner?",
        "No.",
        "That's true.",
        "And if you'll listen to - look at some of the blogs out there, the fact that the campaign manager was a Latina, Patti Solis Doyle, there are a lot of Hispanic groups who are very upset about that and if - I mean, I don't know how much important - how important the fact that Doyle is Latina but given the fact that Hillary Clinton wants to do very well in Texas with a sizeable Hispanic population.",
        "There are a lot of groups upset about that, so obviously, it doesn't give a good signal.",
        "On the earlier point though, it's not that she donated the $5 million, she loaned her campaign $5 million and since that gesture, she has, you know, recovered that loan with the contributions, but so has Barack Obama.",
        "It was not a good sign both the loan and the staff shakeup.",
        "It shows that they saw it clearly a bunch of unease in the Clinton campaign.",
        "And another thing that happened today, David Wilhelm is Bill Clinton's campaign manager in 1992, (unintelligible) the chairman of the DNC, he endorsed Barack Obama today.",
        "Hi.",
        "I have two quick questions.",
        "When they color the maps in and show the states by a candidate, they color Michigan and Florida as Clinton, are they counting those delegates in her delegate votes?",
        "No, not yet because the Democratic Party, when those two states move their primaries up beyond the date that's stipulated by the Democratic Party, is that your delegates will not count, so the delegates are not added to her total.",
        "Okay.",
        "That's good.",
        "And then what happens to the candidates - the delegates that are already committed for Edwards and Richardson, et cetera?",
        "Ken Rudin?",
        "Well, they're free to do - vote anyway they want.",
        "Both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have met with John Edwards hoping for endorsement the last couple of days.",
        "I'm not sure what endorsements mean at this point but they are free to vote whoever they want to or they can remain uncommitted."

        "Julian Bonds has said that there's no way you can disenfranchise those delegations - important states, Michigan and Florida at the convention.",
        "But Al Sharpton said that seating them would be in violation of the DNC rules.",
        "The states knew that if they move up their primaries to January, they would forfeit delegates.",
        "They did it anyway.",
        "Now, Hillary Clinton is saying look, we have to seat these delegates.",
        "And Barack Obama said, wait a second, that would be changing the rules.",
        "Now, the other thing interesting is those states try to move up ahead of Super Tuesday so that there would be really important and relevant in choosing the president - the presidential nominees.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "Mr. Gilchrest, a Republican, lost to a more conservative Republican.",
        "Yeah, while it's interesting how we have two potentially Democratic and Republican nominees and Barack Obama and John McCain have always talked about reaching across the aisle, and yet we saw in these two primaries, Wayne Gilchrest, one of only two Republicans in the House who voted to have a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S.",
        "forces from Iraq.",

        "On the other side, Albert Wynn, African-American congressman who had initially voted for the war in Iraq, initially supported, but of course, he has since becoming an opponent, John Edwards who is also a black ran against the fact that she felt that Albert Wynn was almost like Bush-like to willing to vote for the Republicans and so she - so just as Wayne Gilchrest fell to a challenge from his right, Albert Wynn fell to a challenge from his left.",
        "And what does it say about the party's - we're talking about the possibilities sort of post-partisan politics in Washington after the 2008 elections, yet the parties seem to be becoming more polarized.",
        "Well, yes and no, I mean, we also saw last week in Super Tuesday, the Illinois had congressional primaries and they were a bunch of like Dan Lipinski, a Democratic congressman who - the left liberal blocs were out to get him because, you know, they thought he was insufficiently liberal and he did fine.",
        "So I think, each district has its own thing but these two congressmen did fall to the ideological superior candidates.",

        "That is the correct answer.",
        "In 1972, Hubert Humphrey had the most votes but it was George McGovern with the most delegates.",

        "He failed.",
        "McGovern got the nomination on the first ballot.",
        "And there has been a lot of speculation that could happen this time around that, though, it's a very close race, maybe the candidates who got the most popular votes in the primaries, well, might lose because of the Democratic superdelegates - and they're an awful lot of them, Ken.",
        "Right.",
        "There are 796 of them, at least, not including Florida and Michigan.",
        "Donna Brazile, who's the member of the Democratic National Committee, said she would resign her party post if the superdelegates decided this nomination especially at a time when both Obama and Clinton are evenly matched, both at a time when voters are deciding between the two of them.",

        "Now, once upon a time, these superdelegates - well, they do have a role and they were created in 1984 - the grownups for the Democratic Party.",
