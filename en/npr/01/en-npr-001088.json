        "Well, I think superdelegates will have a role to play in the event of unforeseen circumstances and national emergency, and also personal experience in dealing with the principles because not every voter gets the chance to work closely with these people as some of us have.",
        "But I think, in general, superdelegates will follow the popular will.",
        "Connecticut's a good indication.",
        "You saw the week before the Connecticut primary which Barack Obama carried.",
        "You virtually the entire Democratic delegation swing to Barack Obama.",
        "Well, Mrs. - Senator Clinton supporters have pointed out the state of Massachusetts where you have, of course, senators Kerry and Kennedy, supporters of Barack Obama, the governor, Deval Patrick supporter Barack Obama.",
        "Yet that state went decisively for Senator Clinton.",
        "But we proud House members stay much better in touch with our district…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Senators and governors of - if you look at the congressional delegation of Massachusetts, you saw a much better, more telling indicator of how Massachusetts really voted.",
        "Jim(ph) in Campbell, California, e-mails…",
        "(Reading) If superdelegates were to defy the will of the voters of the Democratic Party particularly after Obama's incredible surge in momentum, I and, I suspect, many others, would be very angry indeed.",
        "I suspect I would become thoroughly disenchanted with the party and would either for McCain or a third-party candidate.",
        "And that's one thing that, again, that Donna Brazile was talking about.",
        "Exactly right.",
        "This is the greatest groundswell that I've seen or heard of, you know, since John F.",
        "Kennedy days, the crowds that Barack is attracting.",
        "For example, the caller from Idaho earlier, he polled 14,000 people in Idaho.",
        "What other living Democrat could do that?",
        "I'm not sure the Rolling Stones could do that.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "Okay.",
        "I feel very strongly that the media is focusing too much on the small picture such who's winning the number of states.",
        "For example, Idaho as opposed to the role of the superdelegates, which is to focus on who can actually win in November?",
        "I agree with what your speaker is saying, the speaker from Tennessee that we should be looking ahead and that the superdelegates should be voting their conscience.",
        "However, if their looking at the numbers, it's very unlikely no matter which Democrat won in the primaries in states such as Idaho that Idaho is going to go Democratic when it comes to the Electoral College.",
        "On the other hand, states such as New York, California, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which are very important swing states, the superdelegates need to focus on who will win those states in November.",
        "The popular vote is really irrelevant unless we win in November.",
        "And I'll ask Congressman Cooper to respond, but to point out that those states you just mentioned, Pat, they're not swing states.",
        "If they're not in the Democratic column, the candidate doesn't have a chance, but anyway, Congressman Cooper?",
        "Wait a minute.",

        "But do you really think it's important who were winning the states that when it comes to the Electoral College, the Democrats have no chance because those are lot of those states are the ones that are giving Obama his so-called momentum.",
        "Yeah, but they're also states like Mississippi that a Democrat hasn't won in decades that Barack Obama could conceivably carry for the first time in modern history.",
        "So don't just write off all the unusual states because Barack has a reach that no previous Democratic candidate has had.",

        "Ken?",

        "We already had a primary and we won it.",

        "The last, I heard, the possibility is that they will seat these delegations but they'll divide them up 50-50 between Obama and Clinton.",
        "So ultimately, they won't decide - they won't have a decisive role in deciding who's the nominee is but will be seated, they will not be disenfranchised.",
        "Would that be a workable solution, do you think, Congressman?"
