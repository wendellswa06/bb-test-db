        "He was an OK guitar player, but he had the brass to get up there with James Brown and BB King and got - you know, hang with these guys, perform with BB in clubs and he didn't really need the talent, he had the mojo.",
        "He loved the eyes of the public upon him, and he redefined the role of the political operative as a rock star.",
        "And this was a career that came onto him early.",
        "He got a job as - well, I guess as an intern to Strom Thurmond.",
        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "You know, but he was doing politics back in high school.",
        "He created a phony candidate and ran this guy for head of the school and won.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That was his first election you know, back then, and it fascinates me how some people just have power over other people and here's this guy, he's a guitar-picking rascal from South Carolina with a small school education going up against these big operatives from Harvard and Yale and beating these guys and putting Reagan, George Bush in power.",
        "He was a mentor to W and to Karl Rove and you know, his latest tactics before he died may have crippled the Clinton presidency.",
        "So, how does one guy get that much power?",
        "I wanted to find out.",
        "And so where did you go to find out?",

        "And so, I didn't want to make another kind of liberal documentary.",

        "How you reached them out with 10 point plans but with emotional appeals to their fear, to their resentment of elites, and Atwater as a southerner, really understood that stuff.",
        "You know this wasn't something that he gleaned from his study of demographics though, Lee Atwater also worked harder than anybody else and that was another part of his secret, but this was something that he seemed to know right from his gut.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And you know, we haven't had a Democratic president in the last 50 years that wasn't a southerner.",
        "So there's really something there, and this southern sense of resentment at the northerners coming in here, telling us what to do.",
        "Lee got that and he understood the ways that that resentment in the words of his acolyte, Tucker Eskew, who is now a senior adviser to McCain-Palin, that resentment became the future of the Republican Party.",

        "It's most unfortunate that his public legacy is hung up entirely on his political career because as a musician, Lee was very intimate with and loved black southern music deeply.",
        "There's no denying that.",
        "He certainly had enormous appreciation for not just the music but for the musicians.",
        "Without question.",
        "He, of course, had the reputation of being anti-black because of the Willie Horton issue and the (unintelligible) political positions.",

        "That's fascinating.",
        "This, of course, in reference to the famous Willie Horton ad.",
        "And actually, the famous Willie Horton ad was not Lee Atwater's creation.",

        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "And he's searching for meaning and redemption in his life.",

        "We see him as a classic American figure.",
        "And in this time where our country is experiencing crisis, they're worried about the future, all of a sudden, the spin that's being put down on us - it's not enough anymore.",
        "And we find ourselves seeking the truth right now, and we're at a crossroads just like Atwater was.",
        "Although, I'll tell you, you know we really uncovered a much more complex story about Atwater's so-called redemption than the media has reported.",
        "And what is that?",
        "Well, you know, Lee helped teach the Republican Party how to talk about race in a subtle way, how to use subliminal tactics that they couldn't really be called out on in public.",
        "And in \"\"Boogie Man,\"\" you know we looked at this supposedly non-racist official Bush campaign ad and Sam Donaldson and Ishmael Reed talk about it, and point to this incredible, powerful messaging where there's a bunch of white convicts.",
        "The only guy that actually looks up at the camera is black.",
        "So it's this message, here is the guy to be afraid of.",
        "And you see that in this race now against Obama.",
        "There are subliminal tactics being used, where you know they make Obama look like a pedophile or there was the Wolf in the Woods ad where they say Obama will destroy her you know.",
        "And this black man - he will destroy the white woman.",
        "It's playing on ancient fears, but it's done incredibly subtly and subliminally, so it's very hard.",
        "And you see when Obama even tried to talk about race, they accused him of playing the race card, which is it's a tactic that Democrats haven't learned how to fight.",
        "And he used the same tactics in terms of responding to it.",
        "He would say, for example, asked about some of the same kinds of things that he did when he worked for Strom Thurmond and he said, wait a minute.",
        "We weren't talking about race, we're talking about states' rights."

        "We have to use coded language like \"\"welfare queen,\"\" where you know - we see right now in America this incredible corporate welfare of 700 billion dollars going as Wall Street tightens.",
        "However, we can't blame it on black people with this coded language, and there's coded language of all types that the Democrats don't know how to respond to.",
        "For instance, \"\"Country First.\"\" That's basically going Democrat traitors, and Lee Atwater understood the power of these emotional messages where you would take the flag away from the Democrats.",
        "You would take away patriotism.",
        "You would take away any connection with a common man, and he basically turned the party of FDR and John Kennedy into the party of arugula.",

        "That's my comment.",
        "Well, I'm not sure that that's what Stefan was saying, but anyway.",
        "And no, thank you for your call and I believe, you know, \"\"Boogie Man\"\" is must-see viewing for America - simply because it really examines that white privilege, and it really looks at what the caller was saying that black people have been a convenient scapegoat for all the ills of America.",
        "We project them on to the African-American community, and I was shocked when I looked back at this campaign.",
        "Even moments that we think we know, such as George Bush's inaugural speech in 1989 is filled with the most vile, race-baiting rhetoric which stigmatizes black communities, and I really agree with the caller that the media needs to do a much better job of reporting on this.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Jeff.",
        "We're talking with Stefan Forbes, the director of \"\"Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story,\"\" and you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "I wanted also to follow up just on the tactic of the Willie Horton ad, including the coded one that you mentioned that was ran - put together by Lee Atwater and run by the Republican campaign in which he was - you could see a direct line from there to the push polling that was done against John McCain by the George W.",
        "Bush campaign in South Carolina in 2000, and the direct line from there to the swift boats of 2004.",
        "Sure.",
        "And you know the shocking thing is that the Democrats haven't figured out a way to come back against the stuff, and you see every time the Republican Party's been in a jam, whether it was Ronald Reagan in the South Carolina primary back in 1980.",
        "We uncovered this incredible story where Lee Atwater blamed his opponent, John Connelly, of bribing black ministers to get their vote.",
        "Connelly spent 10 million dollars to get one delegate.",
        "He was crushed, and Lee bailed out Ronald Reagan, and he went on to win the presidency.",
        "When these guys get in a jam, they go back to the well of these tactics, and their opponents haven't figured out a way to combat them yet.",
        "I mean people blame Mike Dukakis for not fighting back in '88.",
        "Gordon fought back in 2000, and Kerry certainly didn't do much of a job of rebutting those attacks, and he wasn't helped by the media which took weeks.",
        "And so, you know, Atwater created this world where spin is king and the media is content to simply report both sides of the story without reporting what the truth is."
