        "And Sam Donaldson talks in a movie about how these operatives convinced the press that their job is just to cover these smears, to report it as if it's a horse race, and not a battle of truth versus lies.",

        "And the answer for that is, well, you have to look at the permitting process.",
        "You have to look at how difficult and expensive it is.",

        "You have limited exploration and development that has been done on looking for oil and gas reserves in this country.",
        "And then you have fewer refineries because of environmental regulation that has just been over the top for the past three decades.",
        "How big a factor would it be for the president to defer putting any more gas into the strategic petroleum reserve through the summer into the fall?",
        "It is the right step.",
        "It's the right time for him to do that.",
        "He does need to make that available for consumer needs.",
        "There again, what we get into is capacity and refining capacity and being able to move that to the marketplace.",
        "You know, we have to look at two things.",
        "The price at the pump, and then the market pricing of a barrel of oil.",
