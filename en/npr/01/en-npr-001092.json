        "Usually networks and studios get involved in those.",
        "They've made them on their own, independent-style, Sundance-style, bringing it here to the festival, hoping to sell it in what I think is a first of a 10-episode TV series trying to get distribution the way a lot of indie films come into this festival and try to get distribution.",
        "So the model really is changing.",
        "And I think filmmakers are really starting to focus on that."
