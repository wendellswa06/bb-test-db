        "They'd also require people who want to sign up for coverage during so-called special enrollment periods to first prove they qualify because of a life change like losing a job or getting divorced.",

        "The special enrollment period is a real problem in the market.",
        "Her research shows that people who buy insurance during special enrollment period spend a disproportionate amount of money on health care.",
        "The HHS proposal makes other changes to help insurers, too.",
        "It allows them to increase deductibles and co-payments, and it says insurance companies can demand consumers pay off any missed premiums before they get a new policy.",
        "In total, I think that the rule is helpful for insurers but probably not enough to change any given health plan's mind about how to approach the exchange markets.",
        "So Humana is unlikely to rethink its decision because of these changes.",
        "While HHS is working to stabilize Obamacare as Congress debates its fate, the IRS is relaxing its plans to enforce the ACA tax penalty.",
        "The agency says it's responding to President Trump's executive order directing it to ease the burden of the health care law.",
        "Pearson says that could lead healthy people to drop their health plans.",
        "In total, I actually think that the exchange market is going to shrink in size dramatically as a result of both the rule and the IRS move.",

        "Autor says he's not registered with any political party, but he says if Trump really wants to help the people in the Rust Belt, people left behind, this is not easy.",
        "And he needs to reach out beyond traditional Republican economists because he says they mostly focus on cutting taxes and regulation.",
        "Yes, I mean the irony is that, you know, if the Trump administration were looking for expertise in policy to improve the living conditions and working conditions of less-affluent Americans, they would look to a lot of Democratic and left-of-center scholars.",
        "So Autor says it might be a moon shot, but if Trump can draw from the best ideas on the left and the right, then you might see a really effective mix of policies - tax credits for the working class that conservatives support, help with education and health care costs - more traditionally liberal ideas.",
