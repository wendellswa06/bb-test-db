        "That's what you're trained to do in acting school, is to play a three-dimensional human being, and it was very attractive to me.",

        "What you see on television is often the result of either a one shot, where they show you one of the two men without the other, and you don't really have a sense of how close anyone else might be to him.",
        "And then there is the two shot, the split screen, where you can actually watch the reactions on the faces of the candidate who isn't speaking.",
        "And that is a fairly interesting and sometimes devastating way to watch a debate.",
        "I think everyone recalls who saw the 2000 debates between George Bush and Al Gore that, if you listened on radio or watched strictly the one shots, you got one impression, but if you saw the split screen, you saw Al Gore rolling his eyes and looking heavenward and making a lot of other gestures that people thought were disrespectful and maybe a little bush league.",
        "That hurt in that particular case Al Gore more than it hurt George Bush.",
        "So in the debate last night, a lot of the two shots - a lot of those split screens showed John McCain looking angry, showed him looking very irritated, showed him looking upset and staring over at what appeared to be the next head just inches away, even though the two were seated on opposite sides of a rather large table.",
        "When it comes down to issues, at this point, many people have already made up their minds based on either personality or issues.",
        "But did either of these two men strike out and forge new territory based on issues?"

        "There was the use of the phrase class warfare by John McCain in reference to the phrase share the wealth, which was used by Barack Obama in a conversation with a now famous plumber in Ohio who has been referred to repeatedly as Joe the plumber, although, as it turns out, his actually name is Sam Wurzelbacher and not the name John McCain gave for him last night.",
