        "Well, this train originated in Spring Valley, N.Y., and it was heading into Hoboken station, like you said, at high speeds.",
        "We don't quite know how fast it was going, but it was certainly fast enough that it hit the barrier and didn't stop until it hit the wall to the waiting room.",
        "This area of the train station is known as sort of an open concourse.",
        "There's a flower cart, coffee cart, a newspaper stand, and presumably there were hundreds of people waiting to get on that train in the morning.",

        "And we were on the periphery.",

        "And the journey isn't always going to be nice and smooth.",
        "And so I think it's the fact that I fell in love with the work that got me through, too, and not the celebrity.",
        "If I fell in love with the celebrity and the bank, I'd be pretty miserable even right about now, because I've been unemployed for quite a few months.",
        "But I wanted to master something and do it well.",

        "That's also something.",
        "Interestingly enough, Ben Bernanke, when he was running the economics department at Princeton, was one of the first people to kind of realize that this is something that hasn't been really understood by economists, and so had started hiring a few smart, young economists there who look at bubbles."
