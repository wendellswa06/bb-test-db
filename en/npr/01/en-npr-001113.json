        "It's a group of about 150 people who get together for an hour and a half every Wednesday, and we go through about 30 different topics of conversation.",
        "Rice came and spoke for about 20 minutes, took 20 minutes of questions, and people walked out of that room saying two things.",
        "One, that she gave a very good explanation of what the administration has been doing, it's trying to do, and where they have had successes and failures, much better than the president does.",
        "And second, that she'd be a good president herself.",
        "And obviously, since the president job is, on the Republican side is, going to McCain, the vice presidency is the obvious option.",
        "Is she a conservative of the stripe that you would like?",
        "How do you - I mean, Senator McCain has taken the heat from some conservatives for being not what they want.",
        "How do you view Rice's politics?",
        "Rice has certainly made her mark as a foreign policy expert and strategist, and - in the mold of Ronald Reagan, and peace through strength.",
        "Certainly, she has written a great deal on the Second Amendment.",
        "Her belief that that was critically important to the civil rights movement in the South when she was growing up.",
        "And having worked with the folks at Stanford, she understands low taxes and economic growth, and certainly, free trade and economic development.",
        "I want to play something for both of you.",
        "Yesterday, I asked a couple of our political experts what they thought of a possible McCain-Rice ticket and here's what Democratic strategist Donna Brazile had to say about Rice making a bid for the vice presidential slot.",
        "(Soundbite of interview)",
        "That's a really good question.",
        "I'm sure people have thought about that.",
        "And then we just heard people screaming in the first car that they were trapped.",
        "They couldn't get out.",
        "And they managed to get us off, and once we got off, we saw that entire structure had collapsed into the front of the train car.",
        "It was quite a scene here.",
        "Most of the people are gone now.",
        "They've been rerouted to hospitals or back with their family."

        "They don't know what happened.",

        "It cost NASA a boatload of money to send equipment to Mars, which is why when the space agency chooses the instruments to send on a rover mission, it chooses ones it expects will yield the most valuable scientific data.",
        "NPR science correspondent Joe Palca began to wonder if cool ever trumps science when he learned about a plan to send a helicopter drone to Mars.",
        "It might not quite make it to one of my big ideas, but it sure is a cool idea.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "Imagine you put a camera on the helicopter.",
        "It lifts off.",

        "NASA scientist Matthew Golombek says, yes, the atmosphere on Mars is pretty thin.",

        "And as a serious scientist, his first reason for wanting a helicopter drone on a Mars rover mission isn't poetic or cool.",
        "It's scientific.",
        "The rover spends a fair amount of time wandering around, looking for the good stuff to go analyze.",
        "And the idea for the helicopter is if you could get that beforehand, then the rover wouldn't need to wander around.",
        "It would know exactly where to go.",
        "Where are the best outcrops?",
        "Where are the key relations that you want to study?",
        "The helicopter drone Golombek wants to send to Mars is a pretty simple affair.",
        "It has two 3-foot long rotor blades that rotate in opposite directions for stability.",
        "Below the rotors are a couple of boxes about the size of tissue boxes that hold the drone's electronics.",
        "Mounted on the outside of this is a small camera that takes pictures.",
        "And that's it.",
        "The whole thing weighs just a bit more than 2 pounds.",
        "And to keep costs down, Golombek says they've tried to use off-the-shelf parts.",
        "What we had for our initial concept was a GoPro camera, I mean, literally right out of the box (laughter).",
        "Well, I guess it's good to know your GoPro will work on Mars if you're going there on vacation.",
        "As I said, Golombek is a serious guy, but that doesn't mean he's immune to a kind of magical feeling that comes from working on the team that's running the Mars rover Opportunity, a rover that's been roving for almost 12 years now.",
        "We have a presence on Mars, a continuous presence on Mars with a bunch of people that are Martians.",
        "I'm a Martian.",
        "I'm on Mars.",
        "And it may be not me personally, but my brain is there with the rover.",
        "And Golombek says pictures from a helicopter flying above a rover rolling across Mars will only reinforce that feeling of being there.",
        "And in a sense, that's humanity being on another planet, first small step."
