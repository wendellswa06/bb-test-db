        "Well, one thing, Farai, she doesn't hedge.",
        "This is not a woman who hedges.",
        "She is a very resolute public person, and she's very resolute private person.",
        "And so she's not one who's going to calculate and figure out, you know, how do I strategize about this?",
        "One of the most amazing things about Rice, and one of the biggest surprises, to me, in doing the book and spending two and a half years researching her life and talking to her and her friends and family, and her critics, obviously, was the fact that Rice has actually never strategized to get any of the jobs she had since she failed at her first choice for career, which was being a concert pianist.",
        "Now, what's extraordinary, and I'm not at all surprised actually that Donna Brazile would say - would pooh-pooh the idea, because if Rice is recruited, and if George W.",
        "Bush, especially, were to go to her, and say I'd like for you to join John McCain on the ticket, as Rice's stepmom, who's her closest living relative, says to - both her natural parents are gone - as her stepmom says, Rice has a hard - Condoleezza has a hard time saying no to that man.",
        "Do you think that, from what you know, the president might, at some point, request her to step in to that role, or at least consider it?",
        "Well, she'd be formidable.",
        "I think there's no question that, you know, the Democrats would be in a lot more trouble, I think, if she was on that ticket, just because - not because Rice particularly brings stuff that McCain doesn't have.",
        "She's been in executive branch.",
        "But you know, he has plenty of foreign policy experience.",
        "But she's a woman and an African-American in a year in which the Democrats are going to have one or the other at the top of their ticket, and potentially, although unlikely, both on their ticket.",
        "So Rice brings all that.",
        "Plus no one would deny she's qualified, as Hillary Clinton likes to say, to be president tomorrow.",
        "She's had eight years in this White House.",
        "She's had four years in Washington before that.",
        "She's incredibly capable, and as Grover Norquist said, she's more articulate and better at saying what the administration has been trying to do than the president himself.",
        "So she would be an extraordinary candidate.",
        "I don't think the president would go and ask unless John McCain decided that's what he wanted.",
        "And if - and John McCain will only decided that, I think, once he sees what does he really need?",
        "Who's his Democratic opponent?",
        "And what does he really need a vice president to accomplish?",
        "Does he need to shore up his social conservative base?",
        "In which case, obviously, Rice would not be someone.",
        "Does he need to shore up his conservative fiscal base?",
        "Well, Grover Norquist is someone who comes from that side of the party, and I think he said very clearly that Rice would be an asset in that case.",
        "Grover, let me to go some of this buzz.",
        "According to the Washington Post, political analyst Dan Senor really helped ignite the buzz.",
        "And he went on \"\"This Week,\"\" and after he did, he got a bunch of messages and was quoted in the Post saying, \"\"About half of those emails were from people saying, is it true?",
        "How can I help?",
        "Where can I sign up?",
        "Like, I'm the call center for the Draft Condi Movement.",

        "Is there really a Draft Condi Movement?",
        "Is there that kind of a buzz around this?",
        "Well, first of all, there has been one for a couple of years.",
        "I don't know how serious it is, but I see them at Republican and conservative events.",
        "They've got lots of buttons.",
        "There's also a broad sense of support for her as not somebody that John McCain has to pick, but that she would certainly be one of five or six people that would complement him well, that could seriously run a campaign.",
        "That wouldn't have a Dan Quayle moment or a Spiro Agnew moment, where that - where the establishment press says, and what were you thinking?",
        "So I think that she brings many, many assets, and as pointed out, it's my hope that McCain will do a series of personnel announcements, such as, here's who will help me pick judges.",
        "Senator Gramm of Texas would be my Secretary of Treasury.",
        "That would - and handle - answer the questions that some economic conservatives have, some social conservatives have, on policy, because personnel is policy.",
        "If McCain does that, and I think it makes sense, I think he will, then the vice presidency can be a more well-rounded person that doesn't have to fit, you know, a square peg into a round hole to get some particular voting bloc, but can actually be someone that appeals to the whole country.",
        "This is for both of you, and I'll start with you, Grover.",
        "Do you think that Condoleezza Rice would either have or add crossover appeal for swing voters?",
        "Democrats who might want to vote for someone else or Independents?",
        "I do, and it's for the following reasons.",
        "One of the successes that Obama had was that he came across as a post-racial guy, not, Jesse Jackson, not Al Sharpton, not nursing grievances.",
        "And people wanted to put racial antagonisms behind them in voting for a candidate who's post-racial, in that sense, makes a lot of Independents and other Americans feel good about themselves.",
        "Condi would add that to the Republican ticket.",
        "There might be advantages to your soul.",
        "I think by the time they got you strapped to the table they don't care what you say, you're going to go.",
        "Now, Marcus, I'm going to throw the same question to you, with the added, you know, question of whether or not she would attract black voters.",
        "So swing voters, crossover voters and black voters?",
        "Any?",
        "None?",
        "All?",
        "I think definitely some swing voters and some crossover voters.",
        "I think all the people who might be, say, right-thinking Democrats, who believe that they'd like to help make history in November.",
        "If Rice is on that ticket, the Republican ticket, and without Rice, let's admit, there will probably not be a woman or a person of color on that ticket if it's not her.",
        "So if Rice is on that ticket, those right-thinking Democrats and those progressive-thinking Democrats can say, well, I can still make history and vote for the Republicans, if, for some reason, they are uncomfortable with the Democratic nominee.",
        "And there are obviously many reasons to be uncomfortable with them."

        "It will bring some black voters.",
        "I think it will probably bring older black voters.",
        "Because in going around the country and talking about Rice to African-Americans, what I found is there's a real division there.",
        "Most African-Americans are divided amongst themselves, against themselves, about how they feel about Condoleezza Rice.",
        "They admire her strength.",
        "They don't admire the administration she has been a part of and they think that she's often been cold, and some would even go as far as saying she has lied publicly.",

        "But without a doubt, I think some older African-Americans would vote for her.",
        "One thing that, you know, that the Republicans would probably - it would be an amazing election if this were to happen, it'd be kind of a, you know, the dream election for us in the media.",
        "One thing the Republicans would probably exploit is the fact that Rice's ancestors were slaves in this country, as well as slave owners, much as Barack Obama has said of his wife Michelle.",
        "Rice and Michelle Obama both are descended from American slaves.",
        "Barack Obama may be African-American - is African-American.",
        "However, he is not descended from those who were slaves in this country, and most of us African-Americans are.",
        "So that is actually a tribute that Rice has, in the fact that Rice actually grew up in segregated Birmingham, Alabama.",
        "You know, there was no darker time in our racial history, since slaves were freed, than that time.",
        "And she came out of the time, and so I think that is really powerful.",
