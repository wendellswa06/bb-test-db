        "And this latest report, as you mentioned, focuses on how the federal system deals with cocaine.",
        "And it talks about these disparities between very harsh sentences for crack cocaine and more lenient sentences for powder cocaine and whether or not these disparate ways of treating powder versus crack cocaine make sense.",
        "And the Sentencing Commission basically said it does not make sense and that Congress needs to make changes.",
        "So Jesselyn, I'm going to you.",
        "How do you interpret this recommendation?",
        "I think that the recommendation, or the report, is basically an updating of several reports that the Sentencing Commission has done from 1995 to 2002, all of which have not justified the 100-to-one disparity between crack and powder cocaine.",
        "So what the Sentencing Commission also did on May 1st was to take another step forward and to send up an amendment to Congress that would make the sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine more consistent with the five-year mandatory minimum statute.",
        "And that was definitely a first step in the right direction.",
        "But even the Sentencing Commission - and many others around the country - acknowledge it's a very small and modest step.",
        "What really needs to happen is that Congress needs to act to eliminate the disparity between crack and powder cocaine.",
        "Timothy, what is your organization, the Cato Institute's position on this?",
        "Your libertarian, that's - first of all, very briefly, please, describe what a libertarian is and also what's your interpretation of this is.",

        "How did you go about trying to change that, bring the rate down?",
        "Well, the state, like other states at the same time, as Stephanie was saying earlier, in 1996, when welfare reform happened, there was, for the first time, a provision that linked public dependency, long-term public dependency to teen pregnancy.",
        "And it was researched at the time that said 50 percent of women on public assistance had, at one time, been teenage mothers.",
        "So there was an opportunity for states to have funding that allowed us to mobilize and do programs that could reach large enough populations to begin to affect the race and to begin to have a statistic trend going in the right direction for the first time in a very long time.",
        "So let's tick through a few of the different things that people have suggested will help decrease pregnancy.",
        "Tell me what you think of them empowering young women, teaching them to just say no.",
        "Well, I think just saying no sounds very good but, really, it's a very complex issue.",
        "So I think empowerment certainly is one of the things that we seek to do but it's not about just saying no. It's really empowering young people to have a sense of a future that they are motivated to avoid anything that will distract them from achieving their goals."
