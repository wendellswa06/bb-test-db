        "Later the city of, Winston-Salem in North Carolina offered a financial settlement, and an apology to Hunt.",
        "Is that kind of apology good for everyone?",
        "Absolutely, no doubt about it.",
        "That kind of apology is good.",
        "Number one because it was followed by an act of contrition which was monetary, number one.",
        "And number two, it is good for people to see that the system can acknowledge that it made an error.",
        "That gives better confidence in the system.",
        "Some judges don't think that, but I really do.",
        "Once it's clear you messed up, to say mea culpa means that we have looked at what we've done, we do not believe we are right just because we are the final word, and that allows for growth, it allows for better systems, it allows for, you know, judges to rethink what they do, to be more willing to reopen cases.",
        "So that kind of apology I think does benefit public faith, in a system that they're required to rely on.",
        "Very quickly, what can we learn from how the justice system treats apology?"
