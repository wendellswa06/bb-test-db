        "Well, no. I mean, that would be - pretty much our definition of an infinite universe is you'd head in one direction for a long time, you never come back to the other side.",
        "In fact, scientists frequently look for evidence of a finite mist of the universe by looking out in one direction, for example, at the radiation left over from the big bang and they look for a pattern.",
        "And it would be amazing if they saw the same pattern on the other side of the sky that would indicate that we had already seen the universe wrapping around.",

        "My hometown of Baltimore is portrayed in \"\"The Wire,\"\" a very popular show, and it's basically about drug dealers and cops, and all the other people who come into contact with drug dealers.",
        "So say that you have someone who is of legal age, 18 or over, they start running crack cocaine on the street, they're arrested for possession or sales.",
        "First offense, what's going to happen to someone like that, and what could change in terms of the policies overall?",
        "In terms of the federal system, if they get caught up in the federal system, if you have as little as five grams of crack cocaine, they could get a five - they will get a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, very little leeway.",
        "Sometimes, there is some leeway if you're a first-time offender, but you have to fulfill several other criteria to be able to benefit from that.",
        "So for a very little amount of drugs and for that amount of drugs you really could be a user versus, really, a dealer.",
        "And so, again, as Tim says, this war on drugs is really focused on the wrong area.",
        "We should be using federal resources to stop the flow of drugs into the country.",
        "The way we do that is have the federal government focus not on the people that you see portrayed in \"\"The Wire,\"\" the street-level dealers, but to have the federal government focus on people who are importing the tons and tons of drugs in the country.",
        "When you think about what works in terms of stopping people from using drugs and from selling drugs, do either of you - and I'm going to go to Jesselyn first and then to Timothy - do either of you have any solutions or any new approaches that you think work?",
        "Well, I think one thing that we have to really deal with and grapple with is the fact that oftentimes people, particularly in urban communities, or even not in urban communities - sell drugs as a source of economics or as a way of making money.",
        "And so, if there are not opportunities in their communities to have jobs, to support their families, then oftentimes they turn to selling drugs.",
        "That's one thing we need to deal with.",
        "We need to make sure people have the opportunities, as well as the educational opportunities to be able to qualify for decent jobs, so that they can support their families.",
        "Timothy, we have to be brief, we're almost out of time.",
        "Your thoughts.",
        "Well, again, I don't think the criminal justice system is the answer.",
        "I mean, the dirty secret when it comes to the drug war is that when a family member or a friend of a politician has a drug problem, that person - they don't call the police and to get that person over to jail.",
        "They try to get that person who has a drug problem into a treatment facility like the Betty Ford Clinic.",
