        "We want the serious leader but we also want someone that can, you know, take a breath and have fun with the team.",
        "And those are typically our best leaders.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's - well, you know, it seems strange at first to think of the universe getting bigger, and if we really believe that there's dark energy and if it is, let's say, constant, so that every time you create a new cubic centimeter of space, you create more dark energy.",
        "Isn't that a problem?",
        "Physicists are very comfortable with the idea of different forms of energy, and we've never had a problem with energy changing from one form to another.",
        "Now, on one side of the ledger can be positive forms of energy, and dark energy would even be included in that."

        "But on the other side of the ledger, physicists keep track of sort of debts or deficits, and one of our forms of that is potential energy.",

        "Right.",

        "I mean, it is possible.",
        "I like to give, as an example, sort of a non-intuitive answer to this to students in my undergraduate class.",
        "Imagine a two-dimensional universe that just lives on the surface of a balloon, and it could be ants who live on the surface of the balloon.",
        "And imagine every day, the balloon gets a little bit bigger, and so they notice that their - the surface area gets bigger, but it isn't obvious where it comes from.",
        "And the reason it isn't obvious is because the ants can't understand curvature.",
        "They can't understand that their two-dimensional universe bends in the third dimension.",
        "And so it is possible for our universe still to have some curvature and so - although we can't picture four spatial dimensions, we would understand by math or by analogy it could be this way.",
        "Alternatively, there's nothing wrong with something that's infinite getting bigger.",
        "As my father used to like to joke with me: What's bigger than infinity?",
        "Infinity plus one.",
        "So even though the universe can be infinite, it can also still be locally expanding so that every location is still getting bigger."
