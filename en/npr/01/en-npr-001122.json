        "Yeah.",
        "I've always wondered about gravity.",
        "I once heard (technical difficulties) turned out to be salts.",
        "But I once heard that gravity has an immediate effect on the - on everything around it.",
        "For example, as the sun were to suddenly disappear, the Earth would immediately fall out of its orbit.",
        "But I later found out that that's not quite true, that gravity does have a finite speed.",
        "And I was wondering if you could expound on how gravity actually has an effect and how soon.",
        "And if also that would lead into potentially - are there any theories out there besides, you know, creating a wormhole or whatnot for faster-than-light communications?",
        "OK.",
        "Lots of things to think about.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, right, there are a number of things in there.",
        "But, again, I also like to, one - so as the caller pointed out, under Newton theory of gravity, that just depended on the inverse square of the separation between objects, if you - if the sun wiggled, the Earth should wiggle immediately.",
        "And even Newton was bothered by this, kind of realized that he shouldn't be able to communicate so instantaneously.",
        "Now, when Einstein replaced Newton's theory of gravity with general relativity, he described space as warped or bent by heavy objects.",
        "So when you - so picture the sheet of rubber with a kind depression in it where the sun would sit, as indicating its gravity.",
        "So if you move the sun, you could imagine moving this warped location such that a sort of wave or waves would be sent out, indicating the change in the warp.",
        "And we call those waves gravity waves.",
        "And it turns out that they cannot travel any faster but just about the speed of light.",
        "And, again, we haven't quite found the direct confirmation of these gravity waves we would like.",
        "We've been building gravity wave telescopes for a number of years looking for the largest of them, and we're still looking for those.",
        "But the theory works so well in so many other areas that we've been able to test.",
        "I'm not aware of other mechanisms besides the wormhole trick that one could take a shortcut along this membrane or sheet of rubber to go back in time.",
        "I'm not even sure if that's legal...",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "...not in - in all of the states.",
        "But what about the spooky action at a distance, you know, the entanglement that can go?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well - so physicists do like to argue about that, and I'm sure it would sound a little like \"\"Inside Baseball\"\" to many of the listeners, but it's, you know, it's the general idea that the outcome of one event is directly caused by or connected to the outcome of another.",

        "Yeah.",
        "But, you know, the same thing has always been true, actually, at the macro level.",
        "You know if I take two cards, one's a queen and one's a king and I put one in an envelope and don't show it to either of us and I put the other in another envelope, don't show it to either of us and we go miles apart, and at a certain pre-defined time, we might flip over each of our cards.",
        "So I flip over my card and by seeing my card, I instantly know what your card says.",
        "But that never really bothered people, I think, before.",
        "I guess quantum mechanics takes it to another level or adds some fairly mysterious-sounding words to it.",
        "So, Darren Newman(ph) tweeted us and has a question for you and that is: If everything in the universe is expanding, does that mean that we and every other object are expanding, too?",
        "Oh, that's a great question or - as a colleague of mine had asked me similarly about this, well, if everything is getting bigger, would we even notice?",
        "I mean, you know, the room's getting bigger, I'm getting bigger, but it's all relative.",
        "Well, that is actually not quite the way we think it works.",
        "The expansion and even the dark energy repulsion that causes things to speed up is an incredibly weak force.",
        "So we don't really see it until we look across the vast separations between galaxies.",
        "We're joined now by Dr. Thomas Kerr.",
        "He's the lead scientist there.",
        "Dr. Kerr, could you start out by describing your center.",
        "How does the program work?",
        "Now, for most objects here on Earth or even in the solar system, there is a reason that those objects are bound together.",
        "It may be the electromagnetic force that binds molecules together.",
        "It could be the gravitational force that keeps you on the Earth.",
        "And that force, that energy is so much greater than dark energy, for example, that we would not see things get bigger.",
        "In fact, it would be a little like if you were holding hands with another ice skater on an ice rink and somebody started expanding the ice.",
        "As long as you held hands tightly, your feet would slide across the expansion so you would remain bound and at the same distance.",
        "That's - from the size of these forces, that's what we believe would happen, and does happen in the universe.",
        "Let's go to Jim(ph) in Washington, D.C.",
        "Hi, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Jim.",
        "Hi.",
        "The physicists hypothesize that there have been more than one big bang, and we just can't understand that there have been more than one because we're in the middle of one.",
        "This is true that - the first part particularly - that many cosmologists believe that there have been either more than one big bang or that there are - there is more than one universe that formed from the big bang.",
        "There's a process in the early universe known as inflation, which once it gets started inflating the universe and other universes, it's almost hard to get it to stop.",
        "It's not quite clear how or why it does stop.",
        "And so there may be many universes that are separated from each other.",
        "It's very difficult for science to actually prove the existence of them.",
        "A universe pretty much defines the region in which you can communicate and have causal connections.",
        "And so, our best chance would be if we ever developed a theory, and maybe string theory would be an example of that, that we were able to test so many areas, and then there was this last prediction left over that many universes would form, then we might get confidence in that.",
        "But, at this point, it's very speculative."
