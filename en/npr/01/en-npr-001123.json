        "But while one is waiting to answer that question, what we typically do is look at - well, is the site having an impact on the behaviors that lead to HIV infection?",
        "So in our case, we studied whether the site was having a impact on syringe sharing rates.",
        "And what we found was people who use the site on a frequent basis are 70 percent less likely to report syringe sharing than those who do not.",
        "It seems that you could very well argue that by allowing users to come in and inject these drugs without any fear of being thrown into jail is really enabling their addictions.",
        "We now have data on this showing that there's actually been a 33 percent increase in the rate of detoxification program use since the site opened.",
        "So the advantage of the injection facility is, is that it provides an opportunity to have a more sustained contact with people and provide them with referrals to appropriate services.",
        "When they use this facility, it's very different than when they inject in public.",
        "When they inject in public, they inject very quickly, they inject all the drugs they have on them, so that they get them in them before they have run into the police.",
        "In the facility, they are actually able to the things that help reduce the risk of overdose.",
        "I'm curious how the law enforcement in Vancouver feels about all of this.",
        "I would imagine that it might drive them somewhat crazy, the drug enforcement officers, knowing that there are people using drugs and there's no repercussion for it.",
        "Certainly there are initially was some opposition to this type of initiative.",
        "What we do know is that a number of police officers are actually referring people to the site, and most recently when we had to apply for an extension of the facility, the chief of the Vancouver police wrote a letter supporting the extension."
