        "Yeah, Dorsey sees the nastiness on there.",
        "And when I spoke with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey just a few weeks ago, he said that the company is rethinking the very core of the product - the way it displays everything from follower counts to the like button - to try to think about the kinds of behaviors, good and bad, that the site itself incentivizes.",
        "But you're right.",
        "This is the sort of thing that lawmakers are beginning to demand companies, like Twitter and its peers like Facebook and Google, begin to take seriously.",
        "And if they don't, they face the threat of regulation.",

        "intelligence about Russian interference in the elections.",
        "Mr. Trump subsequent invitation to Putin to visit Washington has raised still more questions about why he seems to have such an affinity for the Russian leader.",
        "To try to answer that question, we've called Tim O'Brien, author of \"\"TrumpNation: The Art Of Being The Donald.\"\" He has reported on Donald Trump for years, and we should note was sued by Donald Trump for libel.",
        "A judge dismissed that lawsuit.",

        "So let me just first get your reaction to last week's events.",
        "What stood out to you?",
        "O'BRIEN: I think the first thing that stood out to me, Michel, was that there was absolutely nothing new in what he was saying at that conference.",
        "He's been saying exculpatory things for Vladimir Putin's behalf for the better part of a year, at least.",
        "He has tried to explain away the Russian government's attempt to sabotage the 2016 election for the better part of a year, and he's denied that he and his political team played any role in any of that.",
        "And I think the key difference in that conference was he was saying it on global television, in front of a global audience, and Vladimir Putin was standing right next to him while he slagged the U.S.",
        "law enforcement and intelligence communities."

        "So there is one explanation for this.",
        "And that explanation is that Donald Trump simply can't tolerate the notion that anyone had anything to do with his victory but him.",
        "So let's just set that aside and ask the other side of the question, which is, does President Trump have some sort of affinity for Russia, and, if so why?",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, there's no question that Donald Trump has an affinity for autocrats.",
        "I think he likes the idea that you can assume power and exercise power in an unfettered and completely unconstrained way.",
        "And I think that explains the kind of fascination he has for Xi, in China, for Kim, to a certain extent in North Korea, and certainly, certainly for Vladimir Putin.",
        "So that's one motivation perhaps a psychological dynamic, if you will.",
        "But you also mentioned his business dealings.",
        "Now, you wrote a piece in Bloomberg this week calling on President Trump to release his tax returns.",
        "Now, we should say that because of his lawsuit against you some years ago, you were able to see his tax returns.",
        "Now, you can't talk about them under court order, but why did you write that piece?",
        "I mean, what do you think the tax returns would tell us about the president's relationship to Russia?",
        "O'BRIEN: I think this touches on a moment at the end of the press conference on Monday in Helsinki when a reporter with the Associated Press directly asked Vladimir Putin and Trump about whether or not Russia had compromising information on the president - and Trump looked down at his lectern and sort of shook his head and smirked, and Putin chuckled.",
        "And then he went on to say well you know we have thousands and thousands of business people who come through when we simply don't have the time to collect information on all of them.",
        "This is a nonissue and you should just forget about it.",
        "But the reality is I don't think we should forget about that because the president has had business intersections with people with organized crime ties, with Russian business people who have been career criminals, with organized crime ties as recently as just a few years ago.",
        "And I think the question we should - we need to ask ourselves as citizens and observers is this, does the Russian government, or cutouts, or representatives for the Russian government have any financial leverage over the president because of possible financial relationships he had with them over the years?",
        "And in that context, the president's tax returns touch on very central national security and public interest questions.",
        "Cynthia, thanks very much for the call, and good luck with your studies.",
        "Thanks so much, all right, bye-bye.",
        "I'm sure they have tested this quite a bit on the new ingredients and what impact it has on consumers' perceptions of the taste changes.",
        "I'm sure of this.",
        "And that's the real question.",
        "As long as they have done their research and find that there's no effect that - no way that they're affecting the taste of this product or the expectations of this product, they'll be OK.",
        "But, Bob, you know, even if these products do taste the same, and you can't tell the difference between a walnut and a pecan, I wonder, though, if there's a difference in nutritional value.",
        "So are these new products less healthy than the older ones?",
        "These companies insist they're not sacrificing quality or nutritional value at all.",
        "In the case of substituting walnuts for pecans, for example, walnuts actually have more protein and less fat and calories.",
        "On the other hand, the journal reports that Hershey is substituting vegetable oil for part of the cocoa butter it traditionally uses in some of its chocolates, and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association points out that lowers the overall health benefit that cocoa butter has been shown to provide in reducing inflammation and lowering blood pressure."
