        "O'BRIEN: Well, I mean, the president is routinely less than candid, to put it politely, about a lot of his business dealings and his statements.",
        "What I'm talking about is in the public record.",
        "The president has, throughout the week, gotten quite a lot of criticism including from traditional allies in the conservative media who are normally very deferential to him and yet he's now gone ahead and invited Vladimir Putin to Washington.",
        "Why do you think that he's doubled down so to speak?",
        "O'BRIEN: When people look at what appear to be to us these catastrophic behavior where he just keeps doing things that he is criticized for or things that upset his advisers, I think at a very basic level one of the reasons President Trump does whatever he wants to do is that he's been insulated his whole life from the consequences of his own mistakes.",
        "When he was a young man, he grew up in a wealthy family.",
        "He later became a celebrity, and now he's the president of the United States.",
        "And each of those locations in his life have allowed him to have padding around bad behavior, mistakes, ill-considered actions that most other people in life learn from.",
        "We all make mistakes.",
        "We try to address them and grow through them.",
        "He really hasn't.",
        "He's very much stuck in his own reality, and he does what he wants to do.",
        "And he has clearly decided that he wants to forge a closer relationship with Vladimir Putin despite what everyone around him, including his own staff is saying.",
        "That's Tim O'Brien, author of \"\"TrumpNation: The Art Of Being The Donald.\"\" He's executive editor of Bloomberg Opinion, and he was kind of to join us from our studios in New York.",
        "Tim O'Brien, thank you so much for speaking with us.",
        "O'BRIEN: Thank you, Michel.",
        "Up next, Flora Lichtman, our digital media producer, is here and - with our Video Pick of the Week.",

        "Right.",
        "That's one.",

        "Let's start with the lights that we see in fireworks.",
        "Is it fair to say it's just a chemical reaction that's causing these lights?",
        "These are all combustion reactions that release energy in the form of light, in the form of sound, and of course in the form of heat.",
        "And so, yes, they're all highly combustible materials.",
        "And that's why, you know, listening to the visitors that you had, Ira, on your program, I really enjoyed everything they say.",
        "And as you know, I'm a strong advocate of experimentation, hands-on, minds-on.",
        "But I like to leave the fireworks to the professionals.",
        "I like to watch the fireworks and I like to be sure that everything is done safely.",
        "The colors that are produced are due to different chemicals.",
        "There are salts that are put into stars, which are small clay or dough-like lumps or cubes about three to four centimeters in diameter.",
        "They are then lifted up to the sky, and when they explode they give off energy in the form of light.",
        "So, red is due to strontium.",
        "Orange is due to calcium - it's calcium salts, strontium salts.",
        "Yellow is ordinary table salt.",
        "The green color that we see is from barium chloride.",
        "The beautiful blue is copper compounds, copper chloride specifically.",
        "And what's actually going on in these compounds when you heat them?"

        "So the heat excites the electrons that are in the metal ions and puts them into a higher, so-called excited state.",
        "And when they fall back, then they emit energy, and this energy happens to be in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, and so we get to see it and enjoy it.",
        "Okay.",
        "So one thing that's always really puzzled me when I go to fireworks displays has been how they create these elaborate shapes.",
        "Like, how does - how do you make Mickey Mouse out of these chemicals?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Very, very good question.",
        "You know, and this is why I say the professionals are really, really very artistic at doing this.",
        "And everything is choreographed so well so that the specific explosions, as they take place, the specific combustion reactions, as they take place, they produce these different shapes as they cascade down.",
        "And it's all done very, very artistically by the professionals who pack them so that the combustion process, the explosive process takes place in sequence and creates the visual effect that we all enjoy.",
        "So the packing is translated into sort of timing of when these compounds are ignited?",
        "Well, he told reporters he thinks it's going to happen.",
        "Trump says he thinks it'll be a success.",
        "And he was asked to define that.",
        "He says it means North Korea getting rid of its nuclear weapons.",
        "As you say, there is still some uncertainty, though, including when and where this meeting might take place.",
        "They're looking at a number of possible locations, including Singapore.",
        "But the president is also weighing a spot along the Demilitarized Zone where the leaders of North and South Korea held their own historic meeting just last week.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "There's something that I like about it because you're there.",
        "You're actually there where if things work out, there's a great celebration to be had.",
        "Now, once again, Trump cautioned that if things don't work out either at the meeting or in the run up to it, he's willing to walk away.",
        "But he pointed to encouraging signals coming from Kim and said the North Korean leader has lived up to his commitments for, quote, \"\"a long period of time.\"\" In fact, it was just about two months ago that Kim first agreed to suspend nuclear tests during this period of negotiation."

        "What does that mean for the Iran nuclear deal itself?",
        "Netanyahu was a longtime critic of the Iran nuclear deal.",
        "And he said today he thinks Trump will, quote, \"\"do the right thing\"\" by dropping out of that agreement later this month.",
        "Trump did not tip his hand about the decision he's facing on May 12, but he repeated his argument that the Obama-era deal doesn't go far enough in reining in Iran's behavior.",

        "At the same time, Trump says he is open to negotiating a more comprehensive agreement.",
        "That's something he talked about last week with leaders of France and Germany.",
        "The president held this news conference after a meeting with the president of Nigeria.",
        "Did they discuss some of the vulgar and disparaging comments that Trump reportedly made back in January?",
        "And that was about African countries and Haiti.",
        "Well, Trump says that didn't come up, although he kind of repeated the same sentiment in somewhat more diplomatic language today, saying there are countries that are very tough to live in.",

        "No.",
        "That suggestion had come up last week when the Supreme Court was weighing arguments about the travel ban.",
