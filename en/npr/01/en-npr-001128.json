        "A friend of mine said that, you know, we tend to think of slavery in terms of the loss of black bodies.",
        "But, you know, we don't really stop so much to think about the loss of potential, of black greatness, of black genius.",

        "And this is really the crux of what starts to eat at him - is that this man made this great gesture of helping him be free, and yet he really has this sense that though this man thought of himself as an abolitionist and, you know, a great crusader for good in the world, that he didn't actually recognize the humanity of Washington.",
        "Why does this feel like a relevant story to you in 2018?",
        "I think we're still dealing with obviously a lot of the themes and concerns that come up in the book - things like racial injustice, racial inequality, the idea that some lives are more worthy than other lives.",
        "But also this idea of people kind of being galvanized to do something in the world.",

        "But, of course, I know that this exists.",
        "To me, that's quite shocking because, I mean, how can one watch, say, videos of police officers gunning down unarmed citizens - how can anybody watch those videos and still contend that there is not a problem and that we have racial equality and fairness?",
        "This is baffling to me.",
        "I feel that there's been regression, that there's been steps backwards in terms of people wanting to understand each other's experience and really being open to it.",
        "And I think one of the things that novels can do is to bring a reader into the character's experience - especially a character who is nothing like them.",
        "You know, we're dealing here with a boy in 1830s Barbados who's a slave.",
