        "Brian Morris says all forms of human trafficking, whether for labor or sex, are severely underreported in West Virginia.",
        "He's with the Department of Homeland Security, and he's co-chairing a state task force that's trying to figure out how common human trafficking is.",
        "Most of what I see is familial trafficking, which is where the parents tend to prostitute their children out.",
        "And the reason that they do that is we are increasingly facing a drug epidemic in this state.",
        "Morris says human trafficking is defined as the use of force, fraud or coercion to obtain some type of labor or commercial sex act.",

        "I have to say that - I began my practice as a family physician and that's how I became an abortion provider as well.",
        "It makes sense as a family physician that you see patients of all ages and throughout their reproductive health care continuum.",
        "And it was clear to me that I needed to help women who wanted to have babies have healthy babies, and I needed to help women who didn't want to have babies not have those babies.",

        "And it's been very interesting when I've had the opportunity to actually speak one-on-one to someone who calls himself pro-life, and have a very quiet, reasonable discussion and hear them lay out the situation, which is that for them it's a religious and moral wrong to have an abortion, engage in abortion, take care of abortion patients, for instance.",
        "But at the end of the sentence, the ones that I've had the conversation with, who would define themselves as pro-life, said, but I would never harm someone who is providing abortions.",

        "And I appreciate what residents have to go through to try to find that kind of training program.",

        "No one takes this decision lightly.",
        "I have - you'd think that in 30,000 women who needed abortions, I would have met one who meets the description that is so, I think, meanly placed on women, that they haven't thought about what they're doing, that it isn't a very moving experience.",
        "This does not mean that women are terminally depressed for the rest of their days because of having an abortion procedure, but everyone is sad about what it means to have an abortion.",
