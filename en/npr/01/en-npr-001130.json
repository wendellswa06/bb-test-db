        "You know, she wasn't able - she had difficulties with that pregnancy, but now she has two children that are healthy because she went ahead and had that late-term abortion.",

        "You know, the medical care is there, and it's needed, you know.",

        "But I have some very dear friends who are very articulate speakers who right now have been temporarily silenced, at least.",
        "And so it has a very chilling, frightening effect, and we all deal with that fear in different ways, and we might deal with that fear in different ways depending on where we are in our lives.",
        "So I understand their fear, and I also understand that for me, it's vital to always speak my truths and that if I have fear, so be it, but I have to speak the truth."
