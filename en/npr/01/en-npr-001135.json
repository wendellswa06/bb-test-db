        "He was a lot more of a shy person, but he loved power, though, and that was - that became obvious.",
        "How did you know that he loved power?",
        "You could tell it by the way he loved to put people on the spot and how he loved to tell people that this is what God wants you to go do and this mighty powerful thing here, and how they would just kiss up to him and say, oh, whatever you say, whatever you say, Warren, I'll go do it and they just were shaking in their boots.",

        "Did you pray and feel that he was the true leader of this fundamentalist church?",
        "Well, I did pray but I had a lot of question about whether he was a good leader or a good person at all, because of the some of the things that he did here, how he would do some of these things that were so un-Christian-like.",
        "We were taught to be Christian-like here and so when Warren started to do things that weren't Christian-like, like it's okay to hate somebody, it's okay to have nothing to do with somebody, well, this wasn't what I was taught when I was growing up here.",
        "I was taught we're supposed to love everybody and we're supposed to help everybody and not judge anybody.",
        "Now, a lot of the rest of the world judges Warren Jeffs because of his belief in plural marriage and polygamy.",
