        "This new round of sanctions doesn't have international support.",
        "I think by definition, the sanctions regime is going to be leakier.",
        "By leakier, Vaez means easier to get around than previous sanctions were because they did have a lot of other countries behind them.",
        "But Vaez also adds it will definitely cause pain, this sanctions regime that's unilaterally being done by the U.S.",

        "I see.",
        "So more important to look at the corporate decisions, not necessarily what politicians are saying in these European countries.",
        "Let me just ask you, Peter, about this moment because doesn't this hard-line position on Iran help Iran's major rival in the region, Saudi Arabia?",
