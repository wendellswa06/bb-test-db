        "I think he says it because people who are sexual abuse survivors don't feel that the church is doing anything to change the systemic problems or own up to that massive cover-ups, and I think that frustrates them and pains them greatly."

        "I don't think it changes it all.",

        "Why wouldn't a nuclear North Korea behave like, say, a nuclear China, which was described as a fanatical, irrational state when it first was going nuclear and now accepts the logic of deterrence?",
        "Because North Korea's behavior over time has been very different from that.",
        "And so if you think it's going to settle down to what Deng Xiaoping's China or Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union did, which was in possession of nuclear weapons but not threatening to use them every day - although I remind you in the Cold War there were some rough patches like the Cuban missile crisis.",

        "I would prefer not to be on that course.",
        "But if, in fact, that's your view of North Korea, could you imagine the North Koreans going for a deal that was, say, freezing the nuclear weapons program in exchange for lifting sanctions?",
        "Do you think that they would be normal enough to accept the logic of that kind of diplomacy and adhere to it?",
        "There have been short periods in the last 25 years when I've been associated with defense policy with respect to North Korea where that kind of diplomacy has succeeded for a period of time.",
        "That may be what our secretary of state and secretary of defense are trying to accomplish today.",
        "I obviously can't speak for the team that's in there now.",
        "But the way you do it, Robert, is not to wait until North Korea does something and then punish them with sanctions.",
        "That's important to do.",
        "It's satisfying to do.",
        "But you've got to get out in front of the decision and say to North Korea, no more missile tests.",

        "Or do those options just seem unrealistic when they're presented at - when they're put on the table?",
        "Well, the essence of deterrence on the Korean Peninsula means that if North Korea starts a war on the Korean Peninsula they need to know and should know with certainty that the consequence will be the destruction of the North Korean armed forces and the destruction of the North Korean regime.",
        "I am confident that that would be the outcome.",
        "I believe not only could South Korea be defended, but the North Korean regime could be eliminated.",
