        "And Mr. Ward says, `We should ask network executives why they won't tap young people of color to help make their shows look like the rest of the world.'",

        "The concern in this area of terrorism is that the radical sort of jihadist madrassas back up the perception that places like Afghanistan are breeding grounds for terrorists who are obsessed with the notion of destroying infidels.",
        "Now it seemed to be okay in the ‘80s when it was the Soviet war and the Soviets were the infidels.",

        "Well, he...",
