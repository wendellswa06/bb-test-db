        "Now one more thing on Clinton I wanted to say.",
        "What was really jarring to me is not so much that Condoleezza Rice has now been designated to be the pit bull for the administration.",
        "But what was jarring for me is the passion that Clinton had for wanting to kill bin Laden.",
        "We contracted with people to kill him, he says.",
        "I got closer to killing him than anybody else has gotten since.",
        "That's kind of scary, but I guess that's the real world out there and we have to be aware of that.",
        "Well, E.R., you mentioned that intelligence report, and actually Democrats are now calling for the release of another part of that report, which has been labeled as a draft, which means that it doesn't have to be released publicly.",
        "So we may actually get even more information on what's going on now.",
        "But I know that folks want to jump in on one more topic.",
        "This is a special request.",
        "Oprah launched her new network Oprah and Friends this week.",
        "Her famous best friend Gayle King and Ms. O had talked about Oprah's humble beginnings in Mississippi, particularly her mother's hope that she'd end up cleaning white people's houses because they give away nice clothes.",
        "This is something that Oprah's mother said to her.",
        "Now, Oprah also noted, this is on her radio network, she has all these white people that she employs and that in fact there's only one black person on the staff.",
        "So now instead of getting hand-me-downs from white folks, she is giving jobs to white folks.",
        "What do you make of this statement, E.R.? I mean how are we supposed to interpret this?",
        "I don't know.",
        "It seems rather silly to me.",
        "I'm sure she has more than one black person on her staff, so I don't quite know what that means either.",
        "But to me, her saying that is kind of as silly as George Allen, who keeps putting his silver foot in his mouth, to borrow a phrase, when it comes to race and how hung up we all are, whether we're black, white or otherwise.",
        "So I don't know what message Oprah's really trying to send by saying she basically hires just white people.",
        "John, you know, there is definitely been some criticism of Oprah, although she is an amazing businesswoman and TV host, some criticism that she is not supportive enough of fledgling black talent or businesspeople.",
        "I'm not going to make a judgment on that.",
        "But what's this statement about, what's this debate about?",
        "I really, you know, there would - one would have to sit down with Oprah and talk to her about these things.",
        "I don't know.",
        "It seems to me that really the looming implication here is is Oprah some kind of self-hating racist?",
        "Does Oprah not like black people, especially now that she's climbed so high?",
        "And you have to judge the person.",
        "Sammy Davis, Jr. back in the day, his office was so white that, as black power came in, it had to be gently suggested to him that he bring in a black person for some color.",
        "And Sammy Davis, Jr., and love him though we all do, did have a kind of a love affair with white people and often was given to saying that he wanted to be white.",
        "Oprah is not that type."

        "So everybody has a story about Oprah.",
        "The self-esteem attacks that she suffered, some of the abuse that she suffered, the feelings that she may have had in college that made her give one school $20 million and her alma mater pennies.",
        "People talk about these things and it's sad, but you can't get into the mind of Oprah.",
        "And Oprah is going to do what she wants to do because she's a queen.",
        "Some say turnabout is fair play.",
        "Maybe so, if you're lording over, like, a white cleaning staff, or a white cooking staff or a wait staff or cleaners and the like.",

        "But it's Oprah's right - love her or utterly fail in your darndest attempt to leave her - to do what she wants to do.",
        "She owes that queendom, and she runs it like she wants to.",
        "E.R., very quickly.",
        "Oprah has made her fortune because she reaches out not just to a black audience but to a multiracial one.",

        "Secondly, something--I don't know what it was, but something did happen at this party.",
        "We're not quite sure what it is, but it's been obvious from the start that the lacrosse team was sticking by a well-designed and extremely well executed code of silence.",
        "That is, save that sadistic e-mail that came out--that was sent by one of the team members, claiming that he wanted to hire more strippers, but instead of having them get naked, he would cut and skin the Bs.",
        "Now, I don't know what the next step could or should be.",
        "I shudder to think that a young woman could actually have been sexually assaulted in any way whatsoever and some person or persons could get away with it.",
        "Tara, some people are already starting to raise comparisons to Tawana Brawley and to the question of whether or not this young woman was lying.",
        "How do we begin--you know, those of us who have no firsthand knowledge of this--begin to assess a case like this?",
        "Well, this is unfortunate from all aspects, whether she was actually raped or wasn't; because the long-term implications of it being--the racial implications, what's going on in Durham, N.C.",
        "as far as there is--it's an interesting dynamic down there between Duke University and the lower income areas of Duke--I mean, of Durham.",
        "It's brought up--it's stirred up a whole lot of emotions, both racially and from a socioeconomic perspective that, I think, is really unfortunate.",
        "The irony of this is that April is actually Sexual Assault Awareness Month, and we just discussed this last week on a program about what this does for victims who are legitimately raped and how difficult it is to come forward because of the sexual history, because of what happens.",
        "Victims get raped--raked through the coals, and in a situation like this, with this victim, unfortunately, her character and her past behaviors were brought up.",
        "She had been in trouble with the law before.",
        "She actually served jail time, and that started to dig into her credibility early on.",
        "And when you're dealing with a situation like Duke, where you have individuals with money who have access to great defense lawyers, they were chipping away at the credibility of this victim from the very beginning; and it really undermines the legitimate sexual assault cases that take place on campuses all the time.",
        "So, I think this is an unfortunate incident.",
