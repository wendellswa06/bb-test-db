        "Mr. Trump subsequent invitation to Putin to visit Washington has raised still more questions about why he seems to have such an affinity for the Russian leader.",
        "To try to answer that question, we've called Tim O'Brien, author of \"\"TrumpNation: The Art Of Being The Donald.\"\" He has reported on Donald Trump for years, and we should note was sued by Donald Trump for libel.",

        "O'BRIEN: I think the first thing that stood out to me, Michel, was that there was absolutely nothing new in what he was saying at that conference.",
        "He's been saying exculpatory things for Vladimir Putin's behalf for the better part of a year, at least.",
        "He has tried to explain away the Russian government's attempt to sabotage the 2016 election for the better part of a year, and he's denied that he and his political team played any role in any of that.",
        "And I think the key difference in that conference was he was saying it on global television, in front of a global audience, and Vladimir Putin was standing right next to him while he slagged the U.S.",
        "law enforcement and intelligence communities.",
        "So there is one explanation for this.",
        "And that explanation is that Donald Trump simply can't tolerate the notion that anyone had anything to do with his victory but him.",
        "So let's just set that aside and ask the other side of the question, which is, does President Trump have some sort of affinity for Russia, and, if so why?"

        "And I think that explains the kind of fascination he has for Xi, in China, for Kim, to a certain extent in North Korea, and certainly, certainly for Vladimir Putin.",

        "Now, we should say that because of his lawsuit against you some years ago, you were able to see his tax returns.",
        "Now, you can't talk about them under court order, but why did you write that piece?",
        "I mean, what do you think the tax returns would tell us about the president's relationship to Russia?",
        "O'BRIEN: I think this touches on a moment at the end of the press conference on Monday in Helsinki when a reporter with the Associated Press directly asked Vladimir Putin and Trump about whether or not Russia had compromising information on the president - and Trump looked down at his lectern and sort of shook his head and smirked, and Putin chuckled.",
        "And then he went on to say well you know we have thousands and thousands of business people who come through when we simply don't have the time to collect information on all of them.",
        "This is a nonissue and you should just forget about it.",
        "But the reality is I don't think we should forget about that because the president has had business intersections with people with organized crime ties, with Russian business people who have been career criminals, with organized crime ties as recently as just a few years ago.",
        "And I think the question we should - we need to ask ourselves as citizens and observers is this, does the Russian government, or cutouts, or representatives for the Russian government have any financial leverage over the president because of possible financial relationships he had with them over the years?",
        "And in that context, the president's tax returns touch on very central national security and public interest questions.",

        "But no health insurance.",
        "Then one day, Buyer was talking with a friend who asked if his son had a health insurance through the family for the college.",
        "I ended up pulling up my bill.",
        "And I looked, and I couldn't tell by the bill whether I was paying for the health services and health coverage for my son at school or not.",
        "So he called the school, and officials told him yes.",
        "He was paying for health insurance for his son, about $1,100 a semester, $2,200 a year.",
        "Then I said well I have insurance on my son as a parent, so do I need to pay you $1,100?",
        "And they indicated no. I could get a waiver.",
        "I would have to prove to them that I had health insurance on him, and at that point they would waive that charge off my tuition."

        "But more than that, he's bothered that the health insurance fee is literally buried in the overall college bill.",
        "They make the assumption that you're going to accept their health coverage, and they just included it in the overall tuition cost.",
        "In fact, most colleges don't take private health insurance.",
        "And just like some doctors who don't take insurance, students then who have private health insurance have to pay cash up front at school clinic, then go back to their parent's insurance company and hope the company will reimburse them.",
        "Dr. Brian Liang directs the Institute of Health Law Studies at California Western School of Law.",
        "Liang says less than one-quarter of those college health clinic fees ever get reimbursed by private insurers.",
        "He says that's because reimbursements are difficult to file for, and most parents don't have the time or sophistication to do it.",
        "Liang says things have to change on college campuses.",
        "You have to change with the times.",
        "And schools that are kind of hold tightly to the good old days or bad old days, depending or you're the provider or the student - well, we don't do that, we don't accept private health insurance - really are not looking to ensure the best approach to their students.",

        "But some colleges are starting to find ways to deal with that complexity.",
        "They're hiring outside consultants to handle their claims.",

        "O'BRIEN: When people look at what appear to be to us these catastrophic behavior where he just keeps doing things that he is criticized for or things that upset his advisers, I think at a very basic level one of the reasons President Trump does whatever he wants to do is that he's been insulated his whole life from the consequences of his own mistakes.",
