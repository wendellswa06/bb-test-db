        "So this suspect was identified as a 72-year-old man, Joseph James DeAngelo.",
        "What can you tell us about him?",
        "Well, we know that he was a police officer in Exeter, Calif., which is down by Fresno.",
        "He was there for three years, from 1973 to '76, and then went to Auburn from '76 to '79 before he was thrown off the force for shoplifting a couple of items from a local store and prosecuted in Sacramento and lost a job.",
        "After that, he just sort of disappeared.",
        "And investigators from 10 counties have been working on this case for years.",
        "What finally led to this arrest?",
        "Well, DNA evidence.",
        "The question is, where did the DNA evidence come from?",
        "The district attorney's office and the sheriff's department is not letting us know, but they are saying that, in some way, a DNA link was identified between the suspect in the case and an unknown member of the public, who also shared various components of DNA with a bunch of other people - several dozen people.",
        "And so the sheriff's department then had to take that information, whittle out the people that couldn't possibly be suspects, and then zero in on people who could be suspects, which is how they ended up at Mr. DeAngelo's door.",
        "And how did the arrest go down?",
        "Do you know the details?",
        "Well, according to Sacramento Sheriff Scott Jones, they were concerned that the suspect might have some sort of escape plan in place, and so they waited for him to come out of his house.",
        "Staked out his house for, I believe, five days."
