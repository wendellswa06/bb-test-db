        "Rudy Giuliani has always been a big fan of George Bush's war in Iraq.",
        "Yet, when Giuliani had the chance to actually do something about the war, he went AWOL.",
        "After skipping important meetings of the Iraq Study Group, he quit and gave speeches for money.",
        "Republican voters should ask Giuliani, where were you when it counted?",
        "Rudy Giuliani, a betrayal of trust.",
        "And, that's, of course, the second accusation of betrayal by MoveOn.org in just a couple of weeks.",
        "Well, right.",
        "It started up, actually, with their first - with their full-page ad last week during the General Petraeus hearing.",
        "And, basically, it was a picture of General David Petraeus saying: General Petraeus, does he betray us?",
        "Now, to me, you know, what a lot of Republicans have been talking about is that how - the Democrats should disassociate themselves from this kind of smear tactic, that betrayal sounded like treason, and, of course, you know, Senator McCarthy-esque to many Republicans, and if the GOP was loudly(ph) lambasted for what they did to Max Cleland during the 2002 Senate race (unintelligible).",
        "The Vietnam vet who was in a wheelchair and accused of a lot of things.",
        "They compared him to Osama bin Laden in indirect ways.",
        "I mean, if that was reprehensible, why wouldn't talking about a respected general being betraying us - why wouldn't that be just as reprehensible?",
        "And so for a while I thought the Republicans had the upper hand on that.",
        "But, again, anyway, so Rudy Giuliani ran a full-page ad attacking MoveOn.",
        "And then MoveOn responded with what seems to be a fairly accurate description of what Rudy Giuliani did when he was supposed to have been a member of the Iraq Study Group.",
        "He didn't go to the meetings.",
        "And these conflicts, he said, was really just fundraising exercises.",
        "But he also said he didn't want to politicize the Iraq Study Group as he was contemplating a run for president.",
        "Therefore, decided - that's why he decided not to attend the meeting.",
        "That's true.",
        "But then he was also told that if you don't attend the meeting, you have to quit.",
        "So there was little - some amount of time there when there was a controversy on both sides.",
        "Well, speaking of Rudy Giuliani, he is among several candidates who will be attending the conference on Friday of the National Rifle Association's convention.",
        "Andrew Arulanandam is the director of public affairs at the NRA.",
        "And he joins us now on the line from his office in Virginia.",

        "Our endorsement process is fairly comprehensive.",

        "We also depend on feedback from any of our volunteers.",
