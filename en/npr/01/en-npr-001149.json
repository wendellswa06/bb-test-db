        "Over and over again, he wrote, Americans have reinvented Lincoln in order to reinvent ourselves.",
        "The Abraham Lincoln we see in Skip Gates' latest PBS special is a deeply flawed, complicated man.",
        "The two-hour program, \"\"Looking for Lincoln,\"\" begins airing tonight on PBS stations.",
        "Is Abraham Lincoln your hero?",
        "Why, or why not?",

        "You can join the conversation on our Web site, too.",
        "Just go to npr.org and click on Talk of the Nation.",
        "Here's an email from Christopher in Cork, Ireland: According to Howard Zinn in his \"\"People's History of the United States,\"\" Lincoln continually offered to the Confederate states to drop the emancipation issue if they would only come back into the Union.",
        "He made these offers in several speeches as late as 1863.",
        "The man is a myth, is he not?",
        "No, he made these gestures of concession until 1863.",
        "But after that, he said that there was no going back.",
        "Lincoln really did want to abolish the institution of slavery, but he wanted nothing more than keeping the Union together.",
        "And for - you have to remember, there were all these people dying around Lincoln.",
        "Remember when he gave the Gettysburg Address?",
        "The stench of death, reporters said, was in their nostrils.",
        "He could - there were still unburied bodies, piles of limbs around.",
        "It was horrible.",
        "And Lincoln had to live with - just think in our most recent war, we have just under 5,000 American deaths.",
        "There were 623,000 American deaths during the Civil War, and Abraham Lincoln had to think about that every day.",
        "And so, you said that Lincoln was deeply flawed; I would say that he was deeply human, that he was deeply complicated, and what far too many historians have done is to reduce his complexity, to shave off his humanity and turn him into a marbleized myth, as it were.",
        "And I think - my favorite scene in the film, other than interviewing the Sons of the Confederacy...",
        "That was pretty good.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "My favorite scene was in Kyle Westbrook's high school history class at Walter Payton School in Chicago, a class of graduating seniors and they were ethnically mixed, and they had been studying Lincoln in his true dimensions all semester.",
        "And I filmed there, and I asked them if this diminished their regard for Abraham Lincoln.",
        "And they said, it made them like Lincoln better, because they can imagine being Lincoln since he was so fully and richly human.",
        "And I like that interpretation, and I think that's where I ended up in the end.",
        "But it was a fraught process for me.",
        "DAY TO DAY returns in a moment.",
        "I'm Madeleine Brand.",
        "You know what's so interesting, Skip, in listening to you talk?",
        "The problem is not your understanding of what was possible for Lincoln; the problem is the infatuation, the myth, that Lincoln was presented in the first place to you.",
        "That's not Lincoln's fault.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It's not Lincoln's fault that he got mythologized.",
        "He was a human being.",
        "He wouldn't have wanted to be mythologized.",
        "And I think to just bring him down now to the human being with his strengths and his weaknesses, if you could feel that, as well as you're saying it..."

        "That was a turning point for me.",
        "I was so upset, so disappointed.",
        "Again, you know, you would think that a scholar would know all these about Abraham Lincoln.",
        "I just hadn't thought about Abraham Lincoln that much since Lerone Bennett; I encountered that essay when I was 18 years old, but I didn't have the scholarly apparatus to judge that.",
        "And then, my dear friend, unfortunately deceased, George Fredrickson, the great historian from Stanford, gave the Du Bois lectures at Harvard and he - the lectures were about Lincoln and race.",
        "So, I had to think about that.",
        "But plunging myself into this series really forced me to deal with, A, our understanding of Lincoln and, b, the historians who have created are understandings of Lincoln.",
        "And what Doris - the gift that Doris gave me in that conversation in her study that day was that I had my anger, my concern, was misdirecting.",
        "I was feeling very angry at Abraham Lincoln.",
        "How could you used the N-word, you know?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "How could you embrace colonization?",
        "When really I should've been upset with the people who had, what, excluded this aspect of Lincoln's politics, his character, his personality, from their often very detailed and otherwise full accounts of who Lincoln was.",
        "And I think that it embarrassed them; It embarrassed some of the greatest scholars in American history to write about Lincoln in all of his complexity.",

        "And by Easter Sunday, in pulpits throughout the North he is being deified; he is being called the American Christ, compared with Christ, so that the myth making actually began the weekend of assassination, but...",
        "So, it began almost instantly.",
        "It began almost instantly.",
        "But there have been many, many Lincolns.",

        "And ultimately, perhaps, it's Lincoln the Unknown.",
        "Lincoln's myth is so capacious that each generation for Americans has been able to find its own image reflected in the mirror of Abraham Lincoln.",
        "So, in a way, all these Lincolns are a little bit true and - but none is adequate, none is complete.",
        "And as I said to Neal...",
        "All those versions aside so that we would - and then as a culture, we began to focused on just one version, which is the kind of iconic hero of the Civil War."

        "I think it makes him more special to understand how far he came, how difficult it was, the depth of his melancholia, the depth of his depression, his doubt, his angst, his ambivalence about blacks, all of that, his difficulties with his wife, all of that makes him a much richer historical figure than the one-dimensional, mythic, transcendent subject that we were raised on.",

        "But I'm also reminded of something I recently learned, another irony that makes me still love the Statue of Liberty in the same way that I still love Lincoln knowing what I know now about what Dr. Gates has told us today.",
        "The Statue of Liberty was dedicated by Calvin Coolidge in 1924 in the very same year that he signed a bill restricting immigration and keeping out many of the people that the Statue of Liberty stands as an emblem for inviting in.",

        "I think that they, as Dr. Gates has said, they gain in richness when you look at them more closely and learn the broader truth in which they're set, because we're all human and the United States is flawed and Lincoln was flawed, and that's something that we should all really just value, is how complex we are as humans and as a nation.",

        "Mario Cuomo.",

        "And perhaps there is something to that, but I think it's much better to tell the story in a 21st-century way in all of its complexity.",
        "Just given what you were just talking about, it seems to me, watching your film the other night, that what you came away with was an appreciation not for Lincoln's opinions or his positions upon being elected president, but for his capacity for growth.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I think that few of us have a genuine capacity to confront our own weaknesses in thought and feeling and master them, overcome them, and change.",

        "He's very secure in the center, surrounds himself of people on the left and the right, slightly left of center, slight right of center, and he holds the middle ground.",
        "And I think the American people were quite ready for a president like that.",
        "I know I was."
