        "We're talking with Henry Louis Gates Jr. His two-hour PBS documentary, \"\"Looking for Lincoln,\"\" begins to air tonight on many public television stations around the country.",
        "He's the director of the W.E.B.",
        "Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research at Harvard University, and you're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And I have to say that the most embarrassing single moment in my scholastic career was in fifth grade - and it was very embarrassing, which why I remember it so clearly - the teacher stood up in class and said, why did Abraham Lincoln continue to pursue and fight the Civil War?",
        "And every student in that class, including me, stood up and said, to free the slaves.",
        "And he kept going no, no, and none of us could come up with the right answer.",
        "As you pointed out, his goal in the Civil War was not to free the slaves.",
        "That was an issue that he used to his benefit, at the moment it could be used to his benefit.",
        "The issue was to preserve the Union.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Lincoln didn't think that the president, that the executive, had the power unilaterally to free the slaves, and that's why the Emancipation Proclamation reads like a legal brief because, in effect, it is.",
        "He thought that the only way that he could free the slaves was through War Powers Act, was through the fact that you could confiscate the enemy's property.",
        "And literally, under Southern law or under American law, really, the slaves were property, of course, and they were the property of the enemy after the South seceded.",
        "And that was the grounds.",
        "That's why he said he couldn't free the slaves in the border states, but the real reason is that if he freed the slaves in the border states, they would have fled the Union and joined the South, and he couldn't lose Kentucky; he couldn't lose Maryland; he certainly would have lost the war.",
        "And that reminds me of how moving it was for me to go to the Sons of the Confederacy, and how humorous, in a way.",
        "I asked the officers, very subtle men, who run the Sons of the Confederacy, how they felt about Abraham Lincoln.",
        "And they said they thought he was the biggest war criminal in history, that he should be tried posthumously for war crimes of the Nuremberg Conventions, and that he should be chiseled off Mount Rushmore.",
        "And I knew that there was more than one Lincoln confronting me as I went about making this film.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Let's get one last caller.",
        "This is Gary, Gary with us from Wilmington, North Carolina.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes, I was - first, I was very stunned when I first heard about the possibility of Lincoln being a racist.",
        "But then I start to think a little deeper, and what I came was a comparison to the late Malcolm X.",
        "And what I mean by that is, well, what if I were white?",
        "And sometimes history works in reverse for some people.",
        "But what if I would have known or been introduced to Malcolm in his last days of his life as he made the pilgrimage to Mecca and, you know, found out that, you know, all people were equal and that he should love his brother no matter what color he is?",
        "You know, if I'd been introduced to that Malcolm X, then I would have thought that Malcolm was - never had a racial tension or hate for white people in his body.",
        "Right.",
        "And you know - but we know the full story of Malcolm and that he did have distain or dislike for whites early on just because he hadn't evolved, just like Lincoln had evolved in - had natural biases for himself early on and he had this pressure around him with slavery that was something that was very common.",
        "To go against that makes him even a greater man to have reached the level to know that it was not just and it was not right, just as Malcolm, later in his life, had, you know, found that his beliefs were not right and not just, but he evolved to come to the understanding that it was about equality for all people.",
        "Chow is the host of the popular call-in show, Rush Hour, on Chinese language station KAZN.",
        "In the past couple of weeks, Chow has devoted three segments to immigration.",
        "She says the majority of her callers are impressed by the Latino protestors.",
        "They really admire them.",
        "They can organize this kind of a huge protest, and we don't have this kind of ability to do that.",
        "In certain ways, the Chinese-Americans, they just want to make money, have a better life, not really participate with political issues."

        "Absolutely.",
        "The beauty of the autobiography of Malcolm X is this arc, this amazing transformation from the depths of despair, life of crime, imprisoned, then he becomes a Muslim, a member of the nation of Islam, he hates white people, he calls the white man a devil, and then he repudiates those attitudes, becomes an Orthodox Muslim, makes the hajj or the pilgrimage to Mecca, and announces that he can embrace people of all colors, all religions, all ethnicities.",
        "It's beautiful, and in effect, that is the way Abraham Lincoln was moving vis-a-vis black people.",
        "A man, who - deeply ambivalent about racial equality and its impossibility, ends his life defending the right of black men to vote.",
        "That's a remarkable story, and it's a story that should be told.",
