        "Right.",
        "All right, Nell, let's turn to you for a moment and we'll just continue the discussion about the satellites for a second.",
        "Could they have shot this - could this have happened - could they have gone ahead and tried shooting down the satellite if the space shuttle Atlantis (unintelligible) space?",
        "I think everyone feels better that Atlantis is down home probably the astronauts and their families do.",
        "I mean, the concern is that if the shuttle was coming down at the same time that they were trying some experimental test, you could have debris or who knows what.",
        "This is not the kind of thing that you would sort of willingly go out to do.",
        "It's not the ideal set of circumstances, so, but that point has sort of (unintelligible) to this stage, the shuttle is back home, the astronauts are safe and so now the military can do whatever it wants do tonight assuming the weather cooperates with them.",
        "Well, remind us what - how long was - first of all, how long was Atlantis in space?",
        "It was about a two-week mission.",
        "It was up at the International Space Station and it was basically there to deliver this huge laboratory built by the European Space Agency.",
        "It's basically Europe's biggest contribution to the International Space Station.",
        "And so they went up there, did some space walks and installed this new module and then left a new crew member whose going to stay for a few months and then they came back home.",
        "What were the highlights of the mission?",
        "Well the highlights of the mission were just installing this new laboratory, which Europe has been really waiting for, I think, two decades, and it was a big moment for Europe to really feel like they're invested in the space station as a full partner.",
        "Another interesting highlight was one astronaut, Hans Schlegel, suffered an illness of some kind and was unable to do his first spacewalk.",
        "That was just sort of something that was interesting because everyone wants to know what's wrong with him, and NASA didn't really give out many details except to say that it was not life threatening and not contagious.",
        "And he then recovered in time to do his second space walk that was scheduled.",
        "So it was a, you know, sort of action-packed mission and they achieved the objectives they went to do and came home.",
        "I'm always struck now by how routine these, you know, the missions now seem for the space shuttles, that we're just - we've gotten so used to them.",
        "I don't know if NASA have used them a routine.",
        "I think that there's always little things that come up.",
        "In the last mission there was some sort of unexpected repairs that were made and that sort of thing.",
        "So it always - they always plan things out very carefully and then life happens and they change their plans and see if they can accomplish what they set out to despite any setbacks."

        "All right, we have a couple of e-mails here about the satellite.",
        "Will a satellite takedown be visible to anyone in the U.S.? That's from Jeff(ph) who wants to know.",
        "I talked to an amateur astronomer up in Canada who says he's got a group of about 20 friends who tracks spy satellites.",
        "He said the average age is (unintelligible) 60, women are welcome but so far, it's just a bunch of guys, but they seem to have a lot of fun.",
        "He says that no one's going to be able to see it when it's hit, for sure, because it looks like that's just - it's not - it will be - it's, for instance, if it's daylight out and you can't really see it.",
        "But he says, on subsequent passes, you might be able to see debris in that spot or you might be able to see that it's not there - again, not very exciting if you haven't been watching in the past.",
        "But some stuff should be visible through binoculars.",
        "I'm not sure exactly what parts of the United States -where and when - because the satellite has…",
        "But if you have a heavily decent telescope, will you…",

        "They're going to try and shoot this thing down just before it enters the atmosphere, so that you don't get a lot of long-lived debris - a lot of space junk staying up there in orbit.",
        "And so they say a lot of the debris will fall out in the first days or hours even and they expect most of it to be gone, you know, certainly within a month.",
        "Wouldn't it be more cost effective to just turn the thing and fire it out into space on its own?",
        "If they had control over it, they would do all kind - they would use it as a spy satellite first.",
        "Second, when it was done, they could direct it into the ocean which is usually what they do when these things are at the end of their lifetime.",
        "But they just - as soon as this thing went into orbit, they lost contact with it, so they have no way of telling it to do anything, and that's why they're going to try and shoot it down.",
        "NASA has a whole office that tracks orbital debris.",
        "And I know that certainly this office has investigated various different kinds of technologies people have proposed.",
        "The thing is, I don't know if you've ever seen any imagery of the earth and sort of surrounded by the space junk, by the orbital debris.",
        "There's just so much of it, you know?",
        "And the question is, you know, you can imagine technologies that would go and sort of sweep out areas of the sky or things like that.",
        "But you have to look at some things and say, well, how cost-effective would this be, you know, how well could you control what happened to the debris?",
        "So that's definitely something that people are interested in and people are investigating.",
        "But I don't know personally of any missions to try to bring down - to try to clean up the space junk in the way that that person is proposing…",
        "And also remember that like space - it's called space for a reason (unintelligible) because it's mostly space.",
        "I mean, it's hard to get hit by a piece of space junk.",
        "It's not like the, you know, a space station is being bombarded by it.",
        "So it's not just there for the picking, you know?",
        "It's a huge, huge area that the stuff is spread out over in.",
        "So just, you know how hard it is to travel around in space, you'd have to, you know, you'd have to go and gather all these pieces.",
        "It's very difficult.",
        "All right, let's turn to a lunar eclipse now.",
        "There is going to be a lunar eclipse tonight.",
        "How frequent are these eclipses?",
        "How big a deal is this, Nell?",
        "Well, it's a total eclipse of the moon.",
        "And lunar eclipses are not that rare.",
        "I believe there were two total lunar eclipses last year.",
        "But this is going to be the last one until December of 2010.",
        "So give it your best shot.",
        "Stay up late.",
        "Go outside.",
        "Take a look.",
        "It supposed to start being eclipsed around 8:40, 8:45 Eastern time, but the sort of key cool time will be about 10 o'clock Eastern time lasting about 15 minutes and that's when the moon is going to be sort of fully in the shadow of the Earth and it looks all eerie and cool.",
        "And where will you be able to see it?",
        "What…",
        "Across the United States.",
        "If you're not under cloud cover, which is the big issue this year.",
        "Earlier today, I was looking at the Weather Channel, sort of map of cloud cover and you could see a picture of the U.S.",
        "and it was just not looking very good for a lot of places.",

        "I - maybe my memory is faulty but is there ever a chance that you would just not see anything?",
        "Hmm.",
        "I mean, my understanding is that the moon is typically an orange to a red-y color and maybe a turquoise color.",
        "And the reason for that is that sort of indirect light is passing through the earth's atmosphere and that's what's causing the different colors you see and the reason that's it's hard to predict the color is that is that it's hard to predict what the earth's atmosphere is going to be exactly like at any given time.",
        "But I personally can't think of an explanation for what you're saying - you've observed.",
        "Can you, David?",
        "You didn't see the moon the whole night or you mean when it was eclipse, you saw nothing?",
        "No, I mean, when it was at it - when it was at its major eclipse, we didn't see anything.",
        "And it was a phenomenal experience to be away from light and truly not be able…",

        "I mean, it's just begged for explanation.",
