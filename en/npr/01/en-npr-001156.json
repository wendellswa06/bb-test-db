        "And they were waiting for the body.",

        "Well, President Rafael Correa has said that it's going to take billions and billions of dollars and that really this initial disaster relief effort is just the tip of the iceberg.",
        "Again, when so many buildings and towns like this are damaged, it'll be a lot of money.",

        "You know, it's just been a very emotional time listening to the evidence that was presented and knowing that an entire half of this courtroom was filled with family members of the victims and two of the survivors of this attack.",
        "So people have really been wrestling with exactly what happened in the basement of that church, and that has been a very difficult thing for people to have to sit through.",
