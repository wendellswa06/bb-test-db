        "Sure.",
        "One is that there's evidence that some of the bridge pieces were corroded.",

        "These agents would be aggressive in corroding the steel - practically rusting it.",
        "Right.",
        "Another factor is fatigue cracking.",

        "But for the particular I-35W bridge, this is really attributed to the old welding technique that was used at the time.",
        "Right.",
        "A third factor might be the change in design or the usage over the years.",
        "There were guardrails added along the 40-year use of the bridge, which may have added some weight to the structure.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The fourth factor might be the construction that was going on at the time.",
        "They were basically repaving the surface.",

        "They are using cutting-edge technology in construction.",
        "One of the differences - main difference is that they are using concrete as the main material instead of steel.",
        "Not that concrete is a better material, but they're using - they're planning to use a very new construction technology which is typically called the segmental box bridge construction.",
        "This means that the bridge would be composed of prefabricated pieces, which will be put together one by one, starting from the shore and building towards the river.",

        "And you might say it's even been perfected.",
        "That's not to say there aren't potential problems.",
        "There have been examples of problems with the bridges settling while under construction or being unbalanced.",
        "This kind of procedure usually requires some kind of balance toward the shore ends for what's going over the water.",
        "There are also advances in bridge construction in the steel arena, too.",
        "There are bridges that are called cable-stayed bridges which are very popular and are often bridges that fall into the category of signature bridges, meaning that they give a distinctive character to the community in which - with which they're associated.",

        "It's called the Penobscot Narrows and Observatory.",
        "It's not only a bridge, but it also has an observatory at the top one of the towers.",
        "That bridge is a combination of concrete and steel in that the concrete roadway is held up by very visible steel cables, unlike the cables that will be hidden in the Minneapolis design.",
        "Furthermore, in the bridge in Maine, the cables are being attached by a new patented process that actually enables individual strands of the cables to be monitored and if necessary removed.",
        "This means that if any corrosion does develop in individual strands that can be corrected by replacing those cables.",
        "Or one has also has the ability to experiment with a real, live, living bridge that might, for example, admit new materials into the cables and see how they perform under real conditions, not laboratory conditions.",

        "The engineers who work for the state transportation agency first proposed a shorter bridge then after reviewing erosion decided to build - to propose a longer bridge that would avoid the high erosion area for the roadway that came off the bridge.",
        "At that point, the politicians - certain local politicians got involved and raised objections and now were back with a short bridge again.",
        "What role does politics play in bridge design?",
        "And when people are thinking about bridge designs are they only looking at the next 10 or 20 years planning frame or are they looking at what could happen over the next 50 to 75, because if we take that more long-term perspective, at least on Hatteras they're proposing a short bridge, the roadway that it ends at is going to be in the ocean.",

        "The bridge was being built because there was another bridge right beside it now that was a historic bridge.",
        "It's called the Waldo-Hancock Bridge.",
        "It was a suspension bridge designed and built by David Steinman back in the 1930s.",
        "And the community had come to really love this bridge.",
        "It felt it was their bridge.",
        "However, and this is where maintenance and - excuse me, inspection is so important.",
        "During a routine inspection of the cables of that suspension bridge, it was found that there was a great deal of corrosion.",
        "And as a result, it was necessary to restrict traffic and it became evident that if there was going to be a bridge at that location, they were going to have to build a new one very, very quickly.",
        "But, of course, political opposition of various kinds can often sidetrack the process as we're seeing potentially going to happen in Minneapolis.",
        "So, the Maine Department of Transportation played a key role in really brokering the situation between the political elements and the engineering elements and talked about this observatory.",
        "It was motivated by the existence of observatory at the top of the Washington Monument.",
        "The towers of this bridge are modeled after those of the Washington Monument and that's done because the - some of the stone in the Washington Monument came from a local quarry.",
        "Right.",
        "But, anyway, by promising the people that there would be this observatory, which would be considered a unique feature and also a potential tourist attraction, the oppositions to the bridge became less and less.",
        "And right now, the bridge is open.",
        "It's gotten rave reviews; the observatory has gotten rave reviews.",
        "The old bridge, rusting bridge, sits beside and its fate is still undetermined.",
        "There are those who would like to save it as a historical feature, but that's going to be very costly.",
        "So politics, again, is going to play an important role because it's very unlikely that the money to preserve that bridge and restore it, would come from anywhere but tax money.",
