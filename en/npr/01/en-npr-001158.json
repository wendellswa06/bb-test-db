        "A different steel?",
        "Mr. Hermmann, what's the difference?",
        "They've engineered a type of steel that they call weathering steel and it actually develops a layer of rust patina on the outside that seals the steel in.",
        "And in the correct environment in terms of dry - wetting and drying, it will actually protect the bridge instead of paint."
