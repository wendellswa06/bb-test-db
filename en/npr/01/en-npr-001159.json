        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Leaking means rust and corrosion and deterioration.",

        "I guess if the joints are clogged, then they - the bridge pushes against the shoreline or whatever it's holding it on the shore instead of just expanding itself in mid span.",

        "Right.",

        "If the icing agents get down onto the steel structure, they can accelerate rusting.",

        "We should really be putting money into maintenance of bridges because that will prolong their lives.",
        "One of the problems with the way we fund our repairs and - for bridges is that the federal government doesn't compensate for maintenance.",

        "The pre-inspection evaluation, the actual inspection ratings and condition evaluation should be performed by licensed professional engineers, experienced in bridge design and inspection.",
        "They need to have the expertise to know the load paths, the critical members, the fatigue-prone details, and past potential areas of distress in a particular type of structure being inspected.",

        "In urban bridges, it goes to one in three, instead of one on four structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.",
        "And if you look at over the years, yes, we've been bringing down a number of deficient bridges.",
        "But if you look at the last couple of years, that rate of reduction is decreasing.",
        "So we're either leveling off or stopping our improvement in reducing the number of deficient bridges in the United States.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Henry, do municipalities get this?",
        "Do they understand this or they just throw up their hand and say, we don't have enough money, you know?",
