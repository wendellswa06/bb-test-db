        "Rich Miner, are we going to have to see - to create all the various little programs that you can put on a cell phone, are we going to have to see a new kind of cell phone out there?",
        "Not so much, actually.",
        "It turns out the cell phones that are starting to ship today basically have the computational power that your desktop PC had only about three years ago.",
        "So we're seeing that mobile phones of today, and certainly tomorrow, have more than enough power to run powerful Internet application, games and lots of other services.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Are we going to see, though, the Apple model of the touch screen, do you think?",
        "Certainly, you'll see touch screens continuing to involve.",
        "Apple has done a brilliant job with the iPhone.",
        "We have touch support in our platform.",
        "And I think one of the problems that you have on the mobile phone is that it's a small screen typically with a small keyboard.",
        "So there are lots of innovations happening to try and figure out how do you give somebody a high-fidelity experience, the ability to input data when you're constrained with these small screens and small input devices.",
        "And some of the touch work that Apple has pioneered is certainly helping in that area.",
        "And I think you'll see other innovations.",
        "So where's the money to be made here?",
        "Rich, I know that Google makes its money on ads on the Google pages, on lots of advertising, but a cell phone has such a small screen to it.",
        "Is there any going to be room for advertising?",
        "Is that the business model you're seeking here?",
        "We'll that's certainly the primary business that Google is in.",
        "And you were right, there's certainly a lot of more phones out there than - our TV is as close to twice as many phones out there is there are TVs.",
        "So there's a lot of phones, about a billion per year.",
        "The ability to put ads on the smaller screens is a challenge.",
        "Google has some very successful mobile applications.",
        "We have a great mobile maps application and mobile G-mail application.",
        "And initially, we didn't try and put ads into those apps because we wanted to make a great experience for the users.",
        "But we do think as the screen resolution gets higher and as we continue to improve the user experience, we'll be able to insert ads.",
        "We just want to make sure that when we do insert ads, that their meaningful and helpful to the user, that the user welcomes those ads, that they are in the right context.",
        "And we think if we can do that successfully, then we won't have problems with the business model.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that's why we've invested in this platform to which we're open-sourcing, which means we're not going to charge for it, none of our partners charge for that software platform, so that we can just help get a better base level of software that we can innovate on, but of course anybody else can innovate on top of as well."

        "Mark McCluskey, what about the voice over IP where you can, basically, have a free phone call through your computer and companies that support it like Skype.",
        "Are we seeing the end of them?",
        "I don't think we're seeing the end of them at all.",
        "I think what we might actually be seeing is those moving more and more into the mobile space as well so that, you know, you are able to move beyond the carriers charging you per minutes of voice calls.",
        "So instead of the sort of complicated fee structures that you get into that, it's easy to imagine a future not too long from now when the networks are capable of doing it, where I pay a flat fee for month for all the IP traffic I can generate and do all my calling over IP instead of over-the-voice cellular network.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mark, it occurs to me that on the Sprint network, it wouldn't take very much to take an iPod touch, which is essentially an iPhone without the phone part, add a microphone back in, add voice over IP.",
        "And on the Sprint network, you would have an iPhone that was completely released from the bonds of AT&T.",
        "Most of my research here at Harvard has been showing that a mother and a baby imitate each other and become successful imitating each other's rhythms and their behaviors by six to eight weeks of age.",
        "So imitation, which then leads into modeling, is something that children are just built with.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Now, describe the cartoon that you drew.",
        "Yeah, you know, and I think that, you know, I come in a lot of this from the consumer's perspective.",
        "And that's what excites me about these innovations and about companies like Google, trying to break the business model.",
        "As you were talking about, Ira, the business of cell phones, in a way, I think, constructed in the United States, especially, has not been very advantageous to consumers and has tended to stifle innovation in hardware and software.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It's been an unfortunate and a lousy situation.",
        "And so I think any move towards scenarios like that where, yeah, you could have together something pretty quickly that sort of let's you make all your calls from a modified iPod touch using Skype, and you're rocking and rolling without being locked in to AT&T or Apple's sort of world in that way."
