        "You know it's - I think with all of this boil down to is the network and the bandwidth and the ability to get the content to people, where they want it, when they want it and how they want it.",
        "And, you know, historically both the cell carriers and you mentioned cable and you know I think that they have a lot in common.",
        "And that is they've controlled these delivery mechanisms, and that's given them control over things.",
        "And that's lead to this business model where they want to lock you in for a couple of years and make sure that they have the revenue streams going, you know?",
        "As there more competitions with things like the 700 megahertz spectrum and with Sprint making this move towards the more open network and with, you know and in the TV realm with satellite becoming a bigger and bigger deal in pushing out more satellites to get more bandwidths going.",
        "You know, competition always benefits the consumer and we've not really had a lot of them in this industry for a long time.",
        "And I just - our stat is that 18 percent of the American population have watched a full-length TV show where movie on their computer.",
        "So I think what you're starting to see is as the computers enter the living room and as the, again, even TV platforms like phone platforms start to become smarter more open and Internet connected, then absolutely I think that openness is what causes people to rethink their business models and find ways to embrace openness as opposed to fight it.",
        "Rich Miner, do you see yourself as the champions of the consumer?",
        "You know, absolutely, I sort of, you know, division that we're following is one that I had - since I was working for mobile phone company myself several years ago.",
        "And very much, you know, our goal is really to drive innovation and drive choice for consumers.",
        "We don't think that we should do that independent of our partners, which are you know mobile phone carriers and handset manufacturers.",
        "But we think we can help elevate the view of the user and help educate people and bring people into a world, where you now have companies like Sprint, talking about and embracing openness where you wouldn't have heard that a few years ago.",
        "Steve Cherry.",
        "You know, it's interesting that you would connect the cell phone and the cable questions.",
        "First of all, the Federal Communications Commission Chairman Martin indicated that it wants to sort of end this bundling of cable channels, these plans.",
        "But more importantly, as the shift that we're also talking about in just consumer behavior.",
        "They just want to watch programs when they want to watch them.",
        "Some people what to wait and just buy a DVD that has the entire season and then just watch the entire season at a row.",
        "The common thread here is the Internet protocol.",
        "It's what makes networks like Sprint different from every network, and it's what's going to make cable different once these networks are basically IP networks, and you're just delivering content as data.",
        "Then, consumers do what they want because application builders can make applications that they think consumers want.",
        "And people will pick and choose what they want and do what they want.",
        "And, really, the cable companies and the cell phone carriers have a limited ability to stop that trend.",
        "We'll see how well that works out.",

        "Well, that same mobile phone outfitted with a small built-in computer chip can also pinpoint exactly where you are, and it can send that location to the nearest taxi, to a potential date in the bar next door, or to Starbucks, which then might e-mail you with a coupon for a venti latte.",
        "The technology already exists.",
        "It combines wireless technology with GPS, the Global Positioning Satellite System.",
        "But until recently most wireless companies shied away from it out of fears over privacy.",
        "Now some are betting that customers will be more excited about the benefits than the worry about who might know where they are.",
        "And with wireless phone carriers soon to be required by law to use technology like GPS to report your location when you dial 911, more and more phones will be equipped with this mapping technology.",
