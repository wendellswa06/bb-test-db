        "He said it was just a real gift.",
        "So they were generous with us as parents, as well.",
        "I think we learned this after 9/11, we went to New York every week afterward - we'd come from Boston - but we went down there and parents were absolutely knocked for a loop.",
        "They didn't know what to tell their children.",
