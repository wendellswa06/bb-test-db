        "I mean, we had better hope that other parents are doing as good a job as we're trying to do, because our children - older teens are very influenced by their friends.",
        "And one of the things we do at home, if, you know - those of us who are trying to be thoughtful about it - is we try to model great friendship behavior and great relationship behavior.",
        "And it doesn't mean that you pick your children's friends, but it means that you -one thing I like about having your friends and their kids over to drink wine is that your kids are seeing that you have friends.",

        "Yes, that's true.",
        "Of course you can talk to witnesses, but the problem here is the judge had a very clear and specific order that said there should be no communication of these transcripts, of what had gone on earlier, or communication between witnesses and any kind of coaching of the witnesses themselves.",
        "Now, I understand some of these witnesses were prosecution witnesses, but some of them were also defense witnesses.",
