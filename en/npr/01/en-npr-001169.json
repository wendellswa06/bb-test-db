        "This is precisely why Boost Mobile, which is one of the two companies that announced new services last month, has a long checklist of questions you should ask before you add a particular person to your list of people who will know where your location is.",
        "An example that Verizon Wireless offered to me when I spoke with them about why they did not yet offer this location tracking service was a similar sort of case.",
