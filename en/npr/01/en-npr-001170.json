        "At the moment, that's true.",
        "Mostly, it's because the GPS implementation is - I would use the word fragmented.",
        "By that I mean, different carriers, and different devices - all use different methods to expose the GPS information to a developer.",
        "So, as a developer, I would have to write a slightly different program for one phone and because there's so many different phones out there, I'd end up with, you know, 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 different versions of Naggie and it becomes a fairly difficult problem to manage.",
        "Randall Stross, let me ask you, isn't that a problem for the FCC?",

        "I mean this is - uses of this technology by government.",
        "You could get annoyed by, you know, coupons from Starbucks.",
        "Government is where you start getting into real concerns.",
        "The FCC seems to be very uncomfortable with the whole mass of issues that have been posed by the advent of GPS technology.",
        "And one of the things the industry association has been pressing the FCC for is clearer rules about keeping logs, protecting user's privacy, because the industry, surprisingly, is urging more regulation upon itself rather than less because they understand that people are very nervous about privacy information - the retention of data about their whereabouts.",
        "And they want to be able to tell people the government has made it very clear that this data will never be misused.",
        "I wonder Andrew Zimmer, as you listen to that, are you among those who want careful regulation to this?",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "I think having regulation and having standards, not only protects the consumers, but it also means that for people who want to make software for GPS or any location based service - it's that much easier for us to do.",
        "We know that we can write the application and it will work the same way on all handheld.",
        "So I'm definitely all for it.",
        "And on your system would it be easy for hackers to access this information and download the laundry list?",
        "It's extremely difficult.",
        "That's actually one of the reasons that we built the first version with Blackberry is because their security is very good.",
        "You'd have to go through a very long authentication process as a developer and their security is so good, in fact, that a lot of government employees use Blackberries.",
        "And I wonder at this point, are you anticipating that your children will be heirs to the Naggie fortune?",
        "I'm keeping my fingers crossed.",
        "But I'm keeping my day job at the same time."

        "Now, I have subscriptions to all kinds of different blogs, and publications, and the kinds, and company things.",
        "I think in the same way, I'd like to be able to choose very carefully what I get - what information gets pushed to my cell phone, location based.",
        "And it…",
        "(Unintelligible) but only if I have a lot of control over what is - who has the information and what's being sent to me.",
        "And that strikes me, Randall Stross, as somebody wanting opt-in as opposed to automatic access to everybody.",
        "Right.",
        "And that is what the carriers are initially offering is opt-in only.",
        "I wanted to add a comment about the problem of security and the risk of databases being hacked.",
        "I think the best way to reassure people that there is no danger of such a thing coming to pass, is a very simple solution, which is not permitting the carriers to retain location data.",
        "It should be treated as a very transit form of data.",
        "Maybe just sitting on the servers for just a few minutes and then, being automatically purged.",
        "That's the best protection."
