        "Right.",

        "And I think that's a bad idea.",
        "And the fact remains though that mobile telephones themselves are - part of their functions is to be a tracking device?",
        "Well, it's a tracking device so the phone company can do a very good thing, which is to put you in the right cell and find your phone so they can send you a call, and that's what customers want.",
        "But I don't think most customers realize by getting a cell phone that they've changed their life, so they're carrying a tracking device, it's beeping somehow into a database wherever they go in life.",
        "And as a society, I think, like your show today, is helping people think through, gee, having that kind of location database on everywhere I've ever been.",
        "That's quite a surprise.",
        "Does the law say anything about this?",
        "It said a little tiny bit about it.",
        "It says that the companies can't sell this information under some FCC rules, at least unless they've given you an opt-out choice.",
        "But those rules were written before location information was really something the law was thinking about.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And in terms of the law, Randall Stross, what do you understand what it says?",
        "Well, the law does require carriers to build in the technology that gives them the ability to find you for - if you place a 911 call, but it does say you have to explicitly give your permission for that location information to be used for any other purpose.",
        "And is there a gray area on what permission consists of?"

        "What if the phone - like I have TomTom on my phone, for example, which is a way in which you can get directions and use it as a car navigation device.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, what if only the phone itself knows what your location is?",

        "Randall Stross, is that a difference without a distinction?",
        "Well, that's why one can use something like Google Maps for mobile phones right now without being concerned that the information's being shared with others.",
        "So you can, as you suggest, application by application, choose those kinds of uses that do not involve sharing your location information.",
        "But ultimately it's the nature of the cellular technology that the carrier does have to know where your phone is at all times.",

        "Most of us have one today.",
        "And cell phones have this tracking built in.",

        "And so sometimes you see government people saying, well, there's no laws against it, so we should be able to go ahead and get this data.",
