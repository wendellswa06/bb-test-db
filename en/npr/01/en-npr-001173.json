        "Back in the early half of the last century, he says, downtown was the place to be.",
        "There were big bank buildings, ornate theaters and fancy department stores.",
        "I used to get my hair cut at the Broadway.",
        "I had a horse.",
        "They had little horses, merry-go-round horses for the kids to sit on when they were getting their hair cut.",
        "We're standing on the corner of Fourth and Spring Street, where trolleys know as Red Cars once ferried people in and out of downtown.",
        "But in the '50s, Westwater says, automobiles became more popular, and the Red Cars disappeared.",
        "It wasn't long after that LA became known what it's best known as today, a sprawling metropolis filled with freeways and clogged with traffic.",
        "Businesses started moving away from downtown for more modern facilities in tonier areas like LA's West Side.",
        "Gradually all the--every building in Spring Street became abandoned, literally abandoned; the upper floors just closed.",
        "By the early 1990s, downtown LA looked like a ghost town.",
        "Some areas became known as the city's Skid Row.",
        "Carol Schatz is president of the Central City Association.",
        "She says over the years there were several attempts to revitalize downtown as a commercial hub, but they were all unsuccessful.",

        "It happened 11 years ago when he had a heart attack and went without oxygen for a few minutes.",
        "He was just 55 years old.",
        "He's lived in nursing homes ever since.",
        "His daughter says that at the nursing homes, there were activities for her dad - bingo was a favorite - and the family could take him on outings.",
        "But when you're in a hospital, you can't just come and go as you please.",
        "So Anderson's just been sitting in his bed for the past nine months.",

        "The home's legal representatives wouldn't comment, but in a recent court document, they say that Bruce Anderson was combative - a danger to the staff and other residents.",
        "And that would have been a legal reason to discharge him.",
        "But Norwood Pines never tried to do that in the nearly four years Anderson lived there.",
        "So Sara Anderson was shocked when Norwood Pines wouldn't take him back.",
        "She appealed to the state.",
        "They held a hearing, and she won.",
        "Norwood Pines was ordered to readmit her father.",
        "They still refused.",
        "And that's how it usually goes, says Tony Chicotel of the California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.",
        "We have lots of cases where the state has found that it's appropriate for the residents to return, but then they don't do anything afterward.",
        "That's why his organization has joined with Bruce Anderson and two other nursing home residents in suing the state of California.",
        "They want a federal judge to make the state enforce its own rulings.",
        "One reason that doesn't happen, says Chicotel, is that the department that holds the hearings isn't allowed to sanction nursing homes.",
        "That's up to a completely different department."

        "And second, they're difficult to manage.",

        "A lot of individuals - residents and their families - if they're told, you have to find another home, just accept, you know, what the people in authority tell them and don't think that they have any choices.",
        "They may not know that they have rights to challenge that eviction.",
        "California officials wouldn't comment because of the lawsuit.",
        "But in their motion to dismiss it, they argued nursing home residents already have plenty of options for defending their rights.",
        "Deborah Pacyna agrees.",
        "She's the director of public affairs for the California Association of Health Facilities, which represents nursing homes.",
        "They can complain to the Department of Public Health.",
        "The department can then investigate.",
        "They can impose daily fines, force the facility to put in a plan of correction.",
        "So in our view, there are plenty of regulations on the books.",
        "But California's Department of Public Health rarely uses them.",
        "State records show that on average, just enough 11 nursing homes are fined each year for wrongly discharging a resident, and the average amount of the fines is around $2,000."

        "Now there's a group of senators, this group of 12--that's, you know, six on each side--that's in the midst of negotiations, even as we speak, Alex, trying to work out a deal where the filibuster rule could remain in place, but there could be an agreement that certain judicial nominees would not be filibustered and allowed to come to the floor for a vote where a 50-vote majority could simply declare them a winner of a seat on a federal bench.",

        "He said earlier in this conversation that he was right about everything and that he really felt that Coleman was being cavalier with the idea of justice.",
