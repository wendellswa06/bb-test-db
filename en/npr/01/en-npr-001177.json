        "But what it does is they'll have seven or eight Congressional hearing in Washington and around the country - in July and August - and basically what it does, it gives opponents of immigration a chance to, you know, get further enflamed and hold these hearings - because they watched what happened to Brian Bilbray, the Republican Congressman, San Diego, California 50th District, last month.",
