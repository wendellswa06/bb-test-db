        "Thank you for inviting me.",
        "And as you looked at basic politics, you know, the issues of the legislation aside.",
        "If you have Republicans holding up the Voting Rights bill in Congress, and a lot of African-Americans upset - newly upset with Republicans after Katrina; the immigration bill, which if the Republicans were hoping to make inroads amongst the Hispanic community - these are the two largest minority groups in America, what's happening to the Republican coalition.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's an extraordinary position you had not that long ago.",
        "Republicans thinking about making major advances amongst Hispanics, major advance amongst African-Americans.",
        "Indeed, they did make big advances in the 2004 election amongst Hispanics.",
        "And it that's Ken Melman concentrated very heavily just after the 2004 election on wooing black voters.",
        "He saw them as a potential voting block that could shift at least a little bit...",
        "On values issues.",
        "...on values issues, absolutely.",
        "And what you saw really with Katrina, I think, was the end any possibility of making a big advance amongst African-Americans.",
        "And now, again, exactly the same thing with Hispanics.",
        "And I think the card that the Republicans - particularly the Republicans in the House are playing, might be a short-term victory for them.",
        "I think there's a lot of real worry about the breakdown of law and order, people coming illegally across the border.",
        "But, as a long-term strategy, it's really, really dangerous.",
        "And do you see this, as many have said, as a play basically for the Republicans base, as they see eroding support in those numbers, amongst Republicans they say, we need these people first.",
        "Ken Rudin is a political junkie in the truest and best sense of the word.",

        "Well, I think the White House is very nervous about that sort of strategy, because Karl Rove has been particularly keen on expanding the Republican Party and bringing in Hispanic voters.",
        "But, yes, amongst the Congressional Republicans they're playing to their base, and their base is very preoccupied by the issue of law an order, of a broken border, of people coming across illegally.",
        "And I think it's the illegal argument which we'll keep hearing over and over again.",
        "And so that's why we have seen, just in the past little bit, a gay rights amendment to the United States Constitution, which stood a zero chance of being approved.",
        "And I guess we're going to see another attempt to have a Constitutional amendment on flag burning.",
        "Absolutely, bringing up the base.",
        "Although, I think that Mrs. Clinton is not in favor of Constitutional amendment, but she's certainly playing both sides on the value issue of flag burning.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "I mean, obviously, the president could not have had somebody like that formulating a 2006 and 2008 election strategy.",
        "But having said that, the fact that he's, you know, he's apparently off the hook in this Valerie Plame investigation.",

        "He probably is responsible, if no one else is, for the Republicans holding Congress as long as they have.",
        "They've held it since 1995.",

        "We'll see, but I think nobody does it better than Karl Rove.",

        "It depends which poll you look at.",
        "He went down a long way in the polls.",
        "He started to go back up in the polls.",
        "So he may become an asset if he gets over 40, he may be an asset.",
        "The bases - the large chunk of the base of the party that really likes this man, and it's always the case that the president has a sort of star power and a fundraising power.",
        "He hasn't lost his ability to raise money from Republican donors.",
        "So I think he's probably still an asset.",

        "Though, I'd say the disappointment is greater with regards to the Republican Congress than with Bush himself.",
        "The two biggest splits are on immigration, where the base is generally much more protectionist and much more anxious to build a fence and close the border than either the administration or the Congressional Republicans.",
        "And then, the other big issue is earmarks and pork, where there's a tremendous amount of anger that Republicans have turned into big spenders after the fashion of Democrats in very short order...",

        "There is a sentiment you see on a lot of the Republican blogs of basically just sitting out the Congressional elections, thinking that if the Republicans lose and the Democrats take over the House or the Senate, that maybe it'll convince the Republicans they have to get serious."
