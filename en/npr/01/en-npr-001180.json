        "And while the Democrats insist no, impeachment is not in our agenda, but all the hearings that have been held up from being held with Republican control will happen if the Democrats take over the House.",

        "Well, it's not a question, but I am somebody who usually always votes conservative.",
        "And my father's 91; he's always voted conservative.",

        "He never held them accountable."

        "In central Illinois that I represent, that won't be that big a hot button issue.",
        "It may be the war.",
        "The answer is, that in these elections, a national issue could turn out to be a local issue, but trying to nationalize this on one or two things I think will not work.",
        "You know, still, people consider their congressman sort of the mayor of their district.",
        "And they're as concerned about traffic congestion and they're as concerned about roads and they're as concerned about potholes as maybe some people on the border states are about immigration.",

        "One of the races in which Democrats seem to have a shot is in your home state, Illinois, the 6th District, where Democrat Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq war veteran is vying for what's currently a Republican-held seat.",
        "As you look at that race, do you think that's going to be, you know, a bellwether?",
        "I think that the Tammy Duckworth race is the poster child race for or against the war.",
        "Tammy Duckworth is a war hero, she's a double amputee, she's never run for Congress, she doesn't live in that district, but Rahm Emmanuel, who's also from Illinois, the D, triple C chair, and the Democrats are going all out to have money funneled into that district; she's got over a million dollars.",
        "And it's an open seat; it's been held by a Republican for a long time, but it is the poster child for the war.",
        "And if she wins, people are going to say, you know, it was about the war.",
        "If she loses, people are going to say it was about other local issues.",
        "If she wins, Congressman, if she wins, do you see the possibility of the Democrats taking the House or you don't see the 15 seats going down?",
        "I don't see at this point the 15 seats.",
        "But, you know, I've listened to people like Charlie Cook and others who analyze these races district by district, and as they analyze them district by district, the Democrats are going to lose some, we're going to lose some, we'll probably end up with 230, excuse me, 222, 223 members.",
        "And, you know, that's 10 less than we have now because we have 232.",
        "I believe we'll be the majority party.",
        "Well, we're not going to be the majority party of 232 members.",
        "We're not going to be the majority party in the Senate with 55 Senators.",
        "We'll probably end up with maybe 52.",
        "If you look at the analysis, district by district, and there is there's no political tsunami, which is what the Democrats would like, I think we'll be in the majority.",
        "As looking a little bit further down the road, some of the things - the immigration bill is being put out for a hearings that could delay it until after the election.",
        "This is not going to endear a lot of Republicans to the Hispanics in their districts.",
        "There is continued disappointment among the African-American community post-Katrina and now the Voting Rights bill has been held up while Republican concerns are addressed in the House of Representatives.",
        "Down the road, these minority groups are going to be key to Republican prospects.",
        "Well, in some districts they will be.",
        "But let's face it; these hearings on immigration are a way to kill the bill.",
        "It's a great disappointment to me, because I'm one of those who believes we ought to have a comprehensive bill.",
        "I mean, I voted for border security, I support border security, but we have to account for 12 million people that live in this country.",
        "And to put off these issues I think will be some source of irritation to Hispanic voters or to African-American voters, in the case of the Voting Rights.",
        "But for the vast majority of Republicans, it's not going to have a great deal of influence on whether they win or lose, because many of their districts are districts where immigration is a lot more important than some of these issues where they, you know, are not going to swing a district.",

        "The fact that he said that several months ago I think was a recognition and a wakeup call for all of us that we need to make sure that things are okay in our district.",
        "And I think that was not the case in 94.",
        "Plus, the other thing is, in 94 we had a whole other agenda, the contract with America.",

        "They don't even know what their five points are at this point.",

        "Maybe on issues like immigration and other things, he won't be so welcome.",
