        "I think Tom Reynolds and our Republican organization that funds these races will try and take care of at least 35 incumbents and then maybe try and pick up another 12.",
        "And, as I said, I believe a year from right now, we'll be the majority party in the House with about, you know, hopefully maybe 223, 224 members and the Senate I think will be at 52 or 53.",
        "That's my guess right now.",
        "Congressman LaHood, we hope to have you back on after the election and see how your addition works out.",
        "Any time, thank you very much.",
        "Ray LaHood, a Republican from Illinois, and he joined us today by phone from his office here in Washington, D.C.",
        "We're going to take a short break and when we come back, we'll take a couple of more calls about the Republican prospects, their tactics for this coming mid-term elections, with Ken Rudin, Adrian Wooldridge and Glenn Reynolds.",

        "I'm a Republican, not a (unintelligible) Republican, more of a centralist Republican and I'm in Dan Quail's former district, so we're a red part of a red state out here.",
        "And one of the things I remember when I watched George Bush debate Al Gore that really stuck with me were a couple of comments.",
        "One was that he said he was not a nation-builder, and this was in the context of a question about our deployment of troops to Haiti.",
        "And that really resonated with me.",
        "I thought that, you know, it was a good idea to use the military appropriately, but not to string the military out and get it involved in missions that were -you know, problems that were really beyond the capabilities of the military.",

        "Adrian Wooldridge, let me ask you a broader question and that is, the whole idea of Karl Rove as he came in, he saw this as a transformational opportunity, the chance to build a Republican majority that would endure past this administration, indeed, stretch out for the foreseeable future.",
        "Do you see as the president, the Republican-led congress or so, unpopular at the moment, and, of course, all of this really hinging, much of it on the war in Iraq and spending, as we hear on the Republican side as well, do you see that changing?",
        "Well, I think that what is interesting about the current situation I think is, given all the problems with the Republicans, the fact that they betrayed their base on key questions such as spending, the fact that the war has gone not as it might have been intended to go.",
        "The interesting thing is how we still presume, I think, that Republicans will just about hold on and I think that most people think if there were a match-up, let's say between John McCain and Hillary Clinton, John McCain would win in a walk.",

        "That's a pretty solid Republican area.",
        "So I see that this is still the stronger of the two parties and even having played its cards very badly or having been unlucky or having made major miscalculations, however you want to look at it, they ought to be weaker than they are now.",

        "Not giving - I mean, Republicans all along the question was, how do you get out of Iraq, how do you win in Iraq, how do you win in the war on terror, and yet all the (unintelligible) seems to be on the Democrats and their internal goings-on."
