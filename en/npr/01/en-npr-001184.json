        "Well, it was interesting.",
        "I mean, he spoke very specifically about his own performance enhancing drug use going back to 2000, using some hard-core steroids.",
        "And then when baseball started testing for steroids, he continued to use human growth hormone, which is banned by Major League Baseball, but baseball does not use a test for it - which puts basically everybody on an honor system.",
        "And, clearly, there are dishonorable people in the game.",
        "And Jason also talked about the distribution of amphetamines and steroids and how they get around baseball.",
        "And in that sense, that's where he started to name names.",
        "They asked him, do you know of other people who do use steroids and amphetamines, and in fact, he did give names to the investigators.",
        "Those names were redacted, blacked out, from the documents that have been made public, but well - it's just seems to be a matter of time before they become public knowledge.",
        "Well, I would have to agree with that, you know, as we've seen with the BALCO case.",
        "And really, in most high-profile court cases.",
        "Those redactions tend not to last very long.",
        "I mean, there's all sorts of people who have access to that information, and the word does seem to get out.",
        "I don't think this will be any different, and I think those names, in time, will get out.",
        "When you talk about amphetamine use, Major League Baseball just started testing for amphetamines this year.",
        "And according to Jason Grimsley, in the clubhouse last year there were coffee pots labeled leaded and unleaded, not referring to caffeine.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "I mean, you know what you were getting, and the high-test stuff had amphetamines in it.",
        "And it's interesting in that he also gives some insight into how they get into Major League clubhouses, these illegal amphetamines.",
        "He mentions how a lot of the Latin American ballplayers have easy access to them from their winter homes and bring them in, in the bundles.",
        "And also, players who play in southern California are able to cross the border to Mexico and bring them in in great numbers.",
        "And also, he mentions a representative from an equipment company who sells bats and gloves, who has access to the clubhouse, who also traffics in amphetamines.",
        "So it's really a very interesting window into how these actually wind up physically into Major League clubhouses and passed among players.",
        "There are several interesting aspects to this, one of which - we hear always about steroids and baseball when we hear, you know, the rumors about Barry Bonds and Mark McGuire, and Sammy Sosa, and more than rumors about Rafael Palmeiro.",
        "And more than rumors about Jason Giambi, as well.",
        "And yet, Jason Grimsley's a pitcher.",
        "He is a pitcher, and you know, that's something a lot of people missed early on, but certainly should be up to speed by now, because - of all the people who have tested positive by the major leagues and the miner leagues since they started testing - nearly half of them have been pitchers.",
        "This has been going on for awhile.",
        "One of the great effects of steroids, and people kind of missed the boat on this, is the muscle recovery aspect.",
        "It's not so much about getting your biceps big so you can hit the ball 500 feet.",
        "It's to be able to bounce back after you pitch three, four, five times a week as these relief pitchers do, and have your muscles recover.",
        "It also enables you to work out harder, so you're able to withstand the grind of pitching in 162-game season."

        "Well, that's right.",
        "I mean, and it could be a case where he had been using before.",
        "I know, when I wrote about steroids in baseball back in 2002, I wrote about how people were supplementing their steroid use with the use of human growth hormone.",

        "Cancer was an extremely complicated process that needed to be described in hundreds, if not thousands, of different ways.",
        "Then scientists started glimpsing what they thought were simplifying principles.",
        "The first idea - which helped spur the government's war on cancer - was that viruses were the prime drivers of human cancers.",
        "That proved not to be the case.",

        "The thought, at least in the early 1980s, was that there were a small number of these mutant cancer-causing oncogenes, and therefore that one could understand a whole disparate group of cancers simply by studying these mutant genes that seemed to be present in many of them.",
        "And this gave the notion, the illusion over the ensuing years, that we would be able to understand the laws of cancer formation the way we understand, with some simplicity, the laws of physics, for example.",
        "But as scientists delved into cancer genes, Weinberg says the simplicity - the unifying principles - gradually evaporated.",
        "Over the last 10 to 15 years we began to accumulate once again an overwhelming mass of information that cancer is indeed a highly complex process, and that attempts at distilling it down to a small number of simple processes may not really work that easily.",
        "And so we are once again caught in this quandary: How can we understand this complexity in terms of a small number of underlying basic principles?",

        "Between everybody that has cancer today, to everybody that's probably ever had cancer since the beginning of humankind, has had different molecular alterations in this disease.",
        "So you could say that every case of cancer is a unique disease.",

        "Pathways are something like assembly lines within the cells - the chemical steps that keep the cells alive and functioning.",

        "And so it's made for a much more cost-efficient and time-efficient process, and you really are seeing a lot of drugs appear now to treat different cancers.",

        "Only rarely can a single drug block a single pathway and, by so doing, stop a cancer.",
