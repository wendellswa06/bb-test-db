        "Sometimes I feel like I'm not smart enough to be Muslim.",

        "I don't have time to do all this homework that's needed to be Muslim.",
        "That's from the podcast #GoodMuslimBadMuslim.",
        "Iranian-American comedian Zahra Noorbakhsh and Bengali-American writer Taz Ahmed find humor in things like that pressure they feel to be experts on global politics.",
        "They also discuss current events, share stories about marriage and dating and awkward ask-a-Muslim moments.",
        "Taz Ahmed says the podcast was born out of recurring discussions about just what it means to be a good Muslim.",
        "In the Muslim community, we're looked at as the bad Muslims because, you know, Zahra drinks.",
        "I go to punk shows.",
        "Externally, in the mainstream American community, we're looked at as, you know, bad Muslims just by default of being brown skinned and being Muslim, and so we kind of are in this gray zone.",
        "Then even to complicate matters even further then, many times, because I identify myself as a pork-eating, alcohol-drinking, premarital-sex-having Muslim, then I'll have audience members who say, oh, you're the good kind of Muslim.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "Right.",
        "Because to them...",
        "That sounds great.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think - I mean, we're always thinking about how people are labeled as being bad or good.",

        "And now it seems with testing, there are several players - many, many, perhaps many players - who, you know, don't want to run the risk of fouling up a steroid test and have dropped some of that, but have kept the use of human growth hormone.",
        "Because this is the gigantic loophole in the testing program that baseball and the Player's Association have really, you know, slapped themselves on the back in great glee on how they have such a strong testing program.",
        "They have banned human growth hormone, but they refuse to use the blood test that the Olympics use to test for the human growth hormones, so people are free to use human growth hormone in baseball without being caught -at least as far as a test goes.",
        "And Jason Grimsley got caught by a federal investigation.",
        "And, of course, as you say, a test for human growth hormone involves a blood test taking blood from a player, which the unions say - and correctly -is a lot more invasive.",
        "Yet, it is done in the Olympics.",
        "But to be fair, it's not just baseball.",
        "Human growth hormone is also banned in football, but they don't test for it, either.",
        "That's right.",
        "There have been people who suggest that the tests that the Olympics use are not entirely reliable.",
        "The Olympics - it was used in Athens, it was used in Torino - there were no positive tests for that.",
        "A lot of people in Major League Baseball are skeptical as to the reliability of those tests.",
        "There's also a problem with just getting the substances needed to test for it with a blood test.",
        "There's just not enough in the world to conduct so many thousands of samples as you would have to do in Major League Baseball.",
        "You're talking about 1,200 players who would be tested, you know, a couple of times a year at least.",
        "So, baseball and the union have said they're going to and they have - they've given a lab in California this directive, to try to come up with a urine-based HGH test.",
        "Now, most of the medical people will tell you we are many years away from getting near that.",
        "So I don't see that on the horizon anytime soon.",
        "Now, another aspect of Jason Grimsley being involved in this - this pitcher pitched for a lot of teams, and a lot of pretty prominent teams: Baltimore when they were pretty good, the New York Yankees during their great run of victories in the late '90s, Cleveland when they had a very good team, too, Kansas City - they weren't so good, but anyway.",
        "He's got a lot of stories to tell.",
        "He does.",
        "There are probably a lot of teammates out there who are sweating right now because of what Jason knows and what he has already told people - at least the investigator.",
        "You know, it's interesting.",
        "Jason Grimsley was a guy who was really your prototypical journeyman relief pitcher, kicked around many different organizations.",
        "In fact, was in the minor leagues when he turned 31 years old.",
        "And after that point, and he - at least according to what he told the investigator - around 2000, he began using steroids.",
        "He has since made something along the lines of $9 million in Major League Baseball.",
        "And this was a guy whose career was on the brink of being finished at the age of 31.",
        "He's not 38 years old.",
        "So, clearly, his career has benefited from his - what he has admitted to in terms of performance enhancing drugs."

        "And one final point: in terms of being finished, the BALCO investigation, we all know they got the founder of the BALCO Labs in the Bay Area and Barry Bonds' trainer as well.",

        "They're both now out on probation.",
        "But it does not look as if this investigation is done.",
        "No, clearly, it's not.",
        "This is the same agent who was at the forefront of the BALCO investigation and collecting a lot of information about Barry Bonds in particular through that investigation.",
        "Now, it's not difficult to imagine that this same agent is trying to connect some dots between Jason Grimsley and either BALCO or Barry Bonds.",
        "It, to me, it would be an incredible, just coincidence if in fact he's not trying to connect some dots here.",
        "But this is, as you mentioned, an on-going investigation, and I suspect this is not the last that we've heard from these federal agents.",
        "And Barry Bonds, of course, still reportedly under investigation for perjury in his testimony to the Grand Jury where he said he took what he thought was flax oil, which may have turned out later to be steroids.",
        "That's correct.",
        "His claim has always been that whatever he took, he took unknowingly if in fact they were steroids, mentioning that he thought one was an arthritic balm for his knees, and the other, as you mentioned, was flax seed oil that he took under the tongue.",
        "And he said, according to the Grand Jury testimony uncovered by the San Francisco Chronicle, that he had no idea what he was putting into his body.",
