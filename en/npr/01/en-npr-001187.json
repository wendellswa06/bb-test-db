        "I think it's been a little bit worse simply because we've got the run-up to the elections, and the Taliban have pretty much admitted that they can't disrupt the elections, and I don't think they're going to try, but I think they are going to try to grab headlines by--at least in their own words--trying to kill as many Americans as they can in the run-up to the election.",

        "The reefs disappear, but we don't think it was an extinction of reef corals.",
        "Rather, it was the reef corals being outcompeted by other kinds of organisms during, you know, this much warmer period of Earth history.",
        "Algae that didn't mind the heat and acidity may simply have taken over the reefs, and left them flat and boring ecosystems.",

        "That would lead to a major change in the cycling of many elements on the planet, such as nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and so on.",
        "Those nutrient cycles don't just affect what happens in the ocean.",
        "They affect life on land in surprising and unpredictable ways, as gases flow from the sea into the air.",
        "For example, it was during this ancient hot spell that grasses spread across the Earth and, along with that, the grazing animals that depend on them.",
        "It's hard to believe that a horse could be the size of a Chihuahua.",
        "But horses started out about that size, and evolved to be - because of the rise of grasses - the animals that we commonly associate them to be today, large animals.",
        "In short, it was a time of upheaval, with both winners and losers.",
        "The wildcard now is that these changes are happening so fast, it's likely to be harder for species to adapt or evolve.",
        "And Dick Norris at Scripps says that the pace and severity of the change depends on how long we continue to burn fossil fuels and allow all that carbon dioxide to flood into the air and the ocean."
