        "Well, for Iran, it is a huge deal.",
        "I mean, Iran has been barred from selling oil in much of the world because of these sanctions tied to its nuclear program.",
        "Now, it was still allowed to sell oil in some parts of Asia.",
        "But, for the most part, it's been gone from the market.",
        "It's really lost a lot of its market share.",
        "You saw oil production just fall by a million barrels a day over time.",
        "After this weekend, it can go out in the world.",
        "And it can basically sell wherever it wants to.",
        "And it has the chance to become a major exporter again.",
        "Now, of course, I mean, it's been a few years now since Iran has been able to sell to the West.",
        "And they're beginning again with a whole different world, right?",
        "I mean, since the sanctions were imposed, prices have come down a lot.",
        "Does that make it tougher on them to make money off all this?",
        "That is a big question.",
        "I mean, when the sanctions were imposed in 2012, oil was selling for $109 a barrel, and now it's below $30 a barrel.",
        "So we're seeing - we're seeing that have an impact everywhere in the oil business.",
        "I mean, there are companies pulling back on production, you know, because the price is just too low.",
        "You're seeing countries like Saudi Arabia having to cut spending because they're seeing their oil revenues fall.",
        "There's been an increase in bankruptcies all over the oil business.",
        "There is just too much supply out there.",
        "You know, a lot of the countries that might be in line to buy Iran's oil - countries like India, which is near Iran - aren't sounding all that interested in buying a lot more oil.",
        "Well - and, Jim, just technically speaking, I mean, how quickly can Iran start pumping out a lot more oil and getting these exports going again to the West?",
        "You know, it's not really clear.",
        "I mean, Iran has said it wants to limit how much it produces at first so that it doesn't have a really dramatic effect on prices.",
        "The fact is that Iran's oil industry really needs a lot of investment to get back online.",
        "And they're hoping to lure some of the big Western oil companies back into the country.",
        "But it still faces other sanctions.",
        "I mean, the U.S.",
        "government still has sanctions that are going to limit the kinds of financial transactions that companies can do with Iran, so that's a problem, and it will slow Iran's return to the markets.",
        "And real briefly, Jim, you mentioned that they don't want to go to quickly to have an effect on prices.",
        "Has there been an effect on prices with this announcement of sanctions being lifted?",
        "Yeah, we have seen prices come down.",
        "But they have been coming down for a lot of reasons, a lot of that having to do with the slowdown in the global economy.",
        "It's kind of hard to separate out the impact of these sanctions being lifted from the other causes.",
        "You know, it's certainly true that the markets have been anticipating this for a while.",
        "And Iran's return to the markets has already been priced in to some extent, which is not to say this isn't a really big deal.",
        "It is.",
        "I mean, Iran has the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.",
        "So that's a big deal.",
        "All right.",
        "That's NPR's Jim Zarroli, speaking to us from New York.",
        "Jim, thanks a lot."

        "The fight was over a mural Rivera was painting for the newly built Rockefeller Center in New York City.",
        "In the end, the mural was destroyed and the men never settled their differences.",
        "But as NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from Mexico City, daughters of the two men have teamed up to leave the past behind and preserve their father's legacies and the art both men loved.",
        "It was the spring of 1932.",
        "Nelson Rockefeller, 23 at the time, was already a prolific collector of Mexican art.",
        "He hired Diego Rivera, some 20 years his senior, to paint a mural for the lobby of the new building bearing his family's name.",
        "Sketches were drawn and approved.",
        "It was to be a 63-foot mural of the worker at the crossroads of industry, science and the competing political ideologies of the time - capitalism and communism.",
        "When reporters leaked that Rivera had added the image of Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, the battle began, one that's been recounted in numerous books and in the 1999 movie \"\"Cradle Will Rock,\"\" starring Ruben Blades as Diego Rivera and John Cusack as Nelson Rockefeller.",
        "The impression I get from talking to Afghans both here and in the country has been that they're pretty positive about the future.",
        "They're not giddily optimistic, but I think they're realistically positive.",
        "They generally will tell you that things are better today than they were yesterday, and they'll be better tomorrow than they were today.",
        "What do you see are the problems in holding elections coming up this fall?",
        "Violence certainly would be one of them.",
        "No, I think violence is going to be less of a problem than the overall control of the areas in the outer regions.",

        "The problem in a lot of cases is what some of the Americans call white areas.",

        "There's no control.",
        "You know, it's really hard to do away with the poppy production because you've got to come up with a substitute.",
        "You can't put defoliant on the poppies or you've already made new insurgents because they have nothing else to grow."
