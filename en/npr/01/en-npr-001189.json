        "The impasse over that language now threatens to delay other Senate business, including the confirmation of a new attorney general.",
        "And with us now to talk about the stalemate is NPR's congressional correspondent, Ailsa Chang.",
        "Ailsa, first tell us briefly what this anti-trafficking bill would do, apart from the language about abortion.",
        "The bill's very straightforward.",
        "It would create a victims' restitution fund which would be paid for with fines imposed on people convicted of trafficking crimes, such as someone who paid to have sex with children.",
        "And it's one of those few bills everyone expected to sail through the Senate with wide bipartisan support.",
        "The measure was unanimously approved by the judiciary committee last month, and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid helped get it to the floor this month.",
        "And then all of the bipartisan harmony that we were talking about came to a screeching halt a couple of weeks ago over the language that Democrats apparently didn't see in the bill that has to do with abortion.",
        "That's right.",
        "There was a provision in the bill that would prevent any money in this fund from being used to pay for abortions.",
        "Basically, now the conflict is this.",
        "Republicans are saying, this language was in the bill since mid-January, since the bill was introduced, so it's your fault, Democrats, for not seeing it this entire time.",
        "Democrats are contending, you guys never brought this language to our attention when we specifically asked for a summary of changes between this bill and last year's version.",
        "Last year's version did not have the abortion language.",
        "So does this mean Democrats are admitting that they actually didn't read the bill?",
        "They are.",
        "I mean, this whole fiasco has highlighted a common truth we hear around Capitol Hill, and that is lawmakers seldom read bills from beginning to end.",
        "They rely on staffers to distill, summarize, flag issues of concern because many of these bills are really, really long.",
        "For instance, last year's spending bill was 1,600 pages long.",
        "Now, of course, this human trafficking bill was only 68 pages.",
        "But staffers say the abortion language was not obvious because what this bill actually says is that the victims' fund is subject to all the limitations detailed in last December's spending bill.",
        "That's the 1,600 page bill I just mentioned, and it was in that spending bill that you will find the abortion language.",
        "It's a provision called the Hyde Amendment.",
        "You see it in a lot of appropriations bills.",
        "And what it does is it bars taxpayer money from being used for abortions, except in cases of rape or incest or if the mother's life is at risk.",
        "But what Democrats pointed out is that this victims' fund is not taxpayer money.",
        "It's fines collected from people who violated the law."

        "It's just, like, a bad job prospect.",
        "And so he's sort of compelled to do it, but you can see he doesn't want to.",

        "I think, eventually, he's going to want to separate the Republican Congress from the Republican nominee and have as much disunity and mental distinction in the minds of voters as possible.",
        "This - oh, could I just say quickly, I think that this is a real bind Trump is putting a lot of Republicans because, for months and months, Republicans talked about how unacceptable Trump was as a candidate.",

        "And when they don't, Trump goes after them as he went after Susana Martinez this week, which I think was really quite surprising - except that it's Trump - because it did him absolutely no good.",
        "It's not going to speed up her endorsement, and, oh, by the way, Donald Trump's going after another woman politician.",
        "You know, another thing Ryan talks about is that, you know, rather than the bitterness and the anxiety, this campaign should focus on the issues.",
        "He put out - you know, he talked about putting out his Confident America agenda this week about the economy, taxes, healthcare, poverty.",
        "But, you know, people are responding to the anxiety on the campaign trail and not necessarily talking about the issues.",
        "Is that going to hurt Ryan?",
        "Well, it's the issues in the issues.",
        "I mean, Ryan is a great and a good political leader.",
        "He still has a bit of the problem that, frankly, a lot of the Republican establishment has, which is he cut his teeth at a place called Empower America, which was a very Reaganite think tank in the 1980s and '90s, I guess.",
        "And - but his ideology is still, very reasonably, traditional Reaganite.",
        "And that's what Trump just slaughtered.",
        "And so if Ryan's going to really answer Trump, he has to be post-Reaganite, frankly, the way Trump is, but hopefully in a different flavor.",
        "And of course, today, President Obama became the first sitting U.S.",
        "president to visit Hiroshima.",
        "He laid a wreath there.",
        "He gave a very moving speech calling for a moral revolution.",
