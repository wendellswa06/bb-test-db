        "And we should emphasize, his biggest donations here are not directly to a presidential campaign; they're to one of these independent groups that is, in theory, independent of the campaigns.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "To a superPAC - that's where these big contributions are going.",
        "They couldn't go to the presidential campaigns themselves.",
        "Since January, Adelson has put more than $10 million into the superPAC backing Newt Gingrich.",
        "And that money is what has kept the Gingrich campaign alive.",
        "So this is a guy worth $25 billion.",
        "He's got some to spare.",
        "He's put some into the presidential campaign.",
        "Why is he so interested in Newt Gingrich's campaign?",
        "He sees Gingrich as the guy who can get what he wants - what Adelson wants for Israel.",
        "And for Adelson, Israel is a personal cause.",

        "The Taliban were meant to agree that they - to commit that they wouldn't allow foreign militant groups to plot terror attacks in Afghanistan and that they would sit with other Afghans to chart out a political future for the country.",
        "And that was set for September 23, that meeting.",
        "But now that doesn't look like it will happen either.",
        "Well, I mean, doesn't look like that's going to happen, but sounds like they were also meant to meet with President Trump earlier.",
        "Is that right?",
        "It's a remarkable and unconfirmed detail.",
        "The Taliban said that they'd actually been invited to meet President Trump at the end of August.",
        "But they'd refused on the basis that they wanted to sign an agreement first.",
        "And that's what led us to this meeting that was meant to happen on Sunday.",
        "I mean, we should say the idea of hosting the Taliban on U.S.",
        "soil is kind of stunning and totally unprecedented.",
        "Right?",
        "It's absolutely unprecedented.",
        "And it was met with criticism even among those in the president's party.",
        "And a handful of Republican members of Congress did speak out over the weekend.",
        "And they were incredibly critical of the idea of hosting the Taliban.",
        "This would have also been shocking for Afghans.",
        "Consider the national security forces, who were tasked with keeping the country together once foreign forces leave.",
        "More than 45,000 of them were killed over the past five years, largely at the hands of the Taliban.",
        "And it's hard to imagine how they would have perceived the president of the United States feting the very people who'd been out killing them.",
        "Well - so what happens now?",
        "I mean, the U.S.",
        "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that the Taliban has failed to live up to commitments they had made.",
        "I mean, is that why these talks have broken down?",
        "Well, so Pompeo's referring to the last Thursday bombing in Kabul that killed 12 people, including the American servicemen.",
        "But there was no commitment that we know of for the Taliban to halt attacks during the negotiations.",
        "In fact, there were deadlier attacks by the Taliban during this period, but they largely killed Afghan civilians.",
        "And those attacks had even seemed to have stepped up as the talks were winding down.",
        "And that could have been for leverage or for optics - to show their people that they had kicked out the Americans.",
        "But there was also growing political pressure on the - on President Trump by people like Senator Lindsey Graham and former ambassadors who'd served in Kabul, warning them that this deal risked igniting a total civil war.",
        "Wow.",
        "OK.",
        "That's NPR's Diaa Hadid in Pakistan covering these negotiations that have been called off by President Trump for now that were supposed to happen, it sounds like, in Camp David over the weekend."

        "We've heard payouts could run as high as $10 billion to $12 billion.",
        "But in this latest round of talks, state attorneys general demanded that the Sacklers commit to paying roughly $4.5 billion out of their own personal fortunes as part of the compensation.",

        "I mean, what happens to them here?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So there's a legal argument being made by some states that the Sacklers effectively stripped billions of dollars out of Purdue Pharma over the years, and now they want to claw some of that money back.",
