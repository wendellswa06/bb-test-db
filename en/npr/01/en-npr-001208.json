        "Cynthia, let me start with you.",
        "The political peril of declaring this over before it's over.",
        "Well, there is no doubt that there will be fights along the way.",
        "But I think I find myself in very, very rare agreement with Rush Limbaugh on this one.",
        "Culturally, it's over.",
        "Politically is another matter.",
        "There is still substantial resistance in the Republican Party, particularly among older voters.",
        "Huckabee is saying that social conservatives will just leave and form a third party if Republican leaders continue to insist that Republicans should soften their harsh rhetoric toward gay marriage and gay rights.",
        "And there are several states that still have on their books laws opposing gay marriage.",
        "In 2004 - Georgia was one.",
        "And, David, I want to - let me jump in here, Cynthia.",
        "I want to ask David this question.",
        "He brought up something this week about what should we make of people who oppose gay marriage.",
        "You say is opposing gay marriage now the moral equivalent of opposing the Civil Rights Act, stain and career ender.",
        "Yeah, I don't think it should be.",
        "You know, the institution of marriage as man and a woman has been around for thousands of years.",
        "And for people who are skeptical of changing that, I think they have the right to be granted some legitimacy.",
        "I do think, though, that conservatives are turning around, especially young conservatives.",
        "And conservatives will continue to turn around, which is why I do think the tide is sort of irreversible.",
        "A lot of the talk this week has been about freedom of choice.",
        "This isn't about freedom of choice.",
        "It's about marriage.",
        "Marriage is all about obligation.",
        "And I think the reason why the country, left and right, are shifting so much on this issue, it's an acknowledgement gay people exist, they should be obliged the way the rest of us are and should be embedded in an institution which carries certain obligations.",
        "So there's a pretty strong conservative argument, as well, for this, which is why I think the tide is reasonably irreversible.",
        "In listening to the arguments this week, Cynthia, did you hear anything in the court from the justices' comments that gave you a better understanding of their thinking on gay marriage or about the relationships on the court itself?",
        "Well, what we saw in the subsequent 25 years was a tremendous spike in the attractiveness of coming to the United States for many immigrants, and as a result, that whole balance broke down.",
        "Now will it break down again?",
        "It's possible.",
        "There are large global economic factors that suggest that perhaps we would not see that kind of spike in future flows.",
        "But as you suggest, you're not going to get conservative Republican senators on board unless there's an awful lot of that muscle to make sure that this isn't another 1986 kind of compromise.",
        "And if you look at that 17-page summary that you mentioned a moment ago, Celeste, it goes on for pages and pages before it gets to anything about legalization, and all of the early stuff is about border security.",
        "Yeah, and lots of numbers we don't necessarily have to get into right now.",
        "But let me bring this back to you, Alan, because there are also - once we finally do get to, you know, legal status, there are all kinds of different timelines for different people.",
        "There's a different timeline if you're an agricultural worker as opposed to somebody who's in computing and may want to go to Microsoft, as opposed to if you are what's called a DREAMer, a child who was brought here by your parents."

        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Five minutes, Alan.",
        "It's - you laid out some of the basics there.",
        "I mean, the ones who are going to be able to be legalized the most quickly are, like you said, the DREAMers, the kids who were brought here as children.",
        "There's always been sort of more of a moral argument with them, that, you know, they weren't the ones that made the decision to come here.",
        "So they're going to have a much quicker path to their green cards.",
        "Agricultural workers, you know, there are estimates right now that up to 50 percent of the field labor in this country is done by unauthorized immigrants.",
        "So if, you know, tomorrow you were to say OK, everybody's got to check the immigration status of your workers, the agriculture industry would just be crippled.",
        "So they're allowing - and this is all - and even this, it gets into a sort of a sliding scale.",
        "The more hours you've put in over the past few years, the quicker you'll be able to get your residency...",
        "And a green card.",

        "Your question, Kevin?",
        "Yeah, I'm a computer programmer, and so I was very curious about if there's - since there was the focus on illegal immigration, if there was changes to the H1-B program as part of this bill, also.",
        "Good question.",
        "Kevin from - from Kevin in Buffalo, New York.",
        "Alan, what's the answer there?",
        "Kevin, there are huge changes.",
        "The H1-B visas he's referring to, those go primarily to college-educated foreigners in the so-called STEM fields: science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
        "Currently the cap on that that the U.S.",
        "puts is 85,000 visas a year.",
        "Silicon Valley, a lot of companies like that, have been arguing against that, trying to raise that cap for years.",
        "This bill would raise that eventually up to 205,000.",
        "Beyond that, there are other changes to the legal immigration system that heavily favor people with master's degrees, people who display extraordinary ability in certain areas like science, physics, entertainment in some cases, but a lot that really are targeted for that high-tech sector.",
        "There's also a lot of - there are increases for lower-skilled jobs and like we talked about for agricultural.",
        "But this has been one of the big, one of the big components of this.",
        "Republicans, both sides have agreed that they need to bring in more of this foreign labor in the high-tech fields, and this definitely represents that.",

        "citizen.",
        "My parents still live in Jamaica, and as it is right now, I could file for them to come to the States, and they'd be I guess green card holders (unintelligible) and stuff but not the kind of jobs, you say, engineering or science but really clerical jobs or, you know, stuff like that.",
        "So my parents are concerned that, you know, with this new immigration law, maybe I won't be able to file for them and bring them over to the States."

        "I believe that it does.",
        "It gives them an opportunity to apply.",
        "But as Alan was saying earlier, there are still a lot of restrictions applying to that, and there is still a certain time period that has to be observed.",
        "But part of the idea here is that family reunification would be honored and that family reunification would be a value that the Republicans who are signing on to this bill would be able to advertise in talking about what they have done for the Hispanic community, not only Hispanics but all forms of immigrants, all immigrants from all different countries.",
        "And Ron, another thing that appears to be trying to appeal to conservatives of any stripe in Congress is the fact that they're trying to put real emphasis on, as Alan was mentioning, people with high education, people with a lot of skills but also people who are entrepreneurs that may want to start a business and employ Americans, right?",
        "That is correct, and people who have studied and gotten those degrees in sciences and technology, mathematics, at American universities would also have an advantage here.",
        "About 40 percent of the employment-based visas would be allocated to professionals who have advanced degrees and work in the United States in the sciences, arts and professions, and that includes people who do have medical degrees from foreign schools.",

        "Hi, Celeste.",
        "So let's talk about the challenges at the Arizona border.",
        "What do things look like if you take a drive along the border there?",
        "Well, and we can actually broaden it out from Arizona along the whole southwest border.",
        "I mean, if you take a drive - in populated areas, there are tall fences, which range anywhere from, gee, triple fencing near the San Diego line to some vehicle barriers out in some desert areas.",
        "But when you get close to the cities, you have fencing, which has frankly proven effective in Nogales, San Diego, El Paso, in terms of cutting down on illegal crossing.",
        "When you get farther out in the desert, there are no fences.",
        "Yeah, I was in Arizona for a long period of time.",
        "There's also a lot of skepticism about some of these fences and border security, that it's impossible to really secure the entire border.",
        "What's the reaction, do you think, of voters there to the idea of billions of dollars of more drones, more fencing, more officers?",
        "Well, I can't really speak to what the reaction is going to be to voters.",
        "It depends on who goes to the polls.",
        "You can almost see in this 17-page document, you can almost sense who wrote what.",
        "But so let's go - if you go to the top of it, as you pointed out and as Alan pointed out, the first part of this is what they're calling the comprehensive southern border security strategy, and then separately the southern border fencing strategy.",
        "And what it demands is first that the border patrol figure out who's crossing and then that within five years it catch 90 percent of those people crossing.",
        "And I don't know people who have been out there who think that fencing is going to accomplish that.",
        "So what you've got now, and there's been a greatly increased dependence on aerial surveillance: drones, there's some technology that's been used in Afghanistan which now indicates that they're catching - this is only tested so far, this is not in broad use - that they're catching about 50 percent of those crossing.",
        "So you're looking at more - this sort of really says you're looking at more of the same.",
        "So let me take this to you, Ron.",
        "All of this discussion of security, including in some cases very complicated and difficult paths to citizenship, they're, I assume, meant to avoid that term of amnesty, that there's no idea that we're just going to hand citizenship over to people.",
        "Is that going to make this easier to pass?"
