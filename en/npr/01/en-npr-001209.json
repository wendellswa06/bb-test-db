        "There does not seem to be the kind of resistance to this law that we have seen in recent years.",
        "You know, in the second term of George W.",
        "Bush, John McCain and a number of his allies brought a comprehensive immigration overhaul bill to the floor of the Senate, and the president was ready to sign it, and they could not pass it in Congress because of this term amnesty that was so widely disseminated and believed that essentially all that was being done was to allow everyone who is in the country illegally to simply become legal and eventually perhaps become a citizen.",
        "Even the idea of legalization without a path to citizenship was considered to be so controversial or so offensive to many Americans, who said why are they being rewarded for breaking our laws, this rule-of-law notion and a no great nation has ever remained great failing to control its own borders.",
        "Those kinds of arguments were quite dispositive in the Senate of the second term of George W.",
        "Bush.",
        "And that law was not passed.",
        "That became a campaign issue, to some degree, in 2008 but particularly in 2012.",
        "If you go back to the debates among the Republican candidates in 2012, there was a great deal of competition among several of them to be the most anti-legalization, the most anti-illegal immigration among the candidates, and of course Mitt Romney famously made a reference to telling people that they could self-deport.",
        "That came back to hurt him in the fall, when he got less than 30 percent of the vote among Latinos, less than 30 percent of the vote among Asian-Americans.",
        "And those two groups together were 13 percent of the overall vote, and that was more than enough to tip the result to Barack Obama.",
        "So Republicans have kind of gotten religion on this recently.",
        "They are much more willing to talk about a comprehensive immigration overhaul.",
        "And there have not been any threats that I am aware of of a filibuster against this bill that the Gang of Eight are bringing forward this week in the Senate.",
        "Now you'll note that there have been threats about a filibuster on the gun law, and while those were initially overcome, we are not sure that the later efforts at a filibuster against that bill will not be successful.",
        "So it's really quite a stark contrast between the way they're treating the gun law and the way they're treating the immigration proposals.",
        "Well, we have a whole lot of questions from our listeners.",
        "You can call us with your questions at 800-989-8255.",
        "Let's try to answer some of this.",
        "This is Sean(ph) in Louisville, Kentucky.",
        "Sean, what's your question?",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "I just had a quick question about how contingent this pathway to citizenship is upon the border security.",
        "Like for example in 10 years, let's say whoever's overseeing this border security says that the border's not secure enough, is there any safeguard these people who are already on this path have to continuing down that path in a reasonable time, or is it really just up to kind of the political whims of Congress at the time to determine whether the border is secure enough to allow them to become citizens?",
        "That's a good question, thank you Sean in Kentucky.",
        "Alan?",
        "Very good question, and this has been one of the toughest things that they've had to negotiate.",
        "How you measure whether the border is secure, as Ted was talking about, has been a very difficult thing.",
        "They've worked on this for years.",
        "Homeland Security has tried to devise a new metric for several years.",
        "Now, it's very difficult."

        "No hard measurement in security?",
        "In security, exactly.",
        "What they do is they establish goals.",
        "As Ted was saying, they have to monitor - they have to be able to monitor 100 percent of the border and intercept...",
        "In the high-risk areas.",
        "No, actually monitor 100 percent of the entire border and intercept 90 percent of people trying to cross in these high-risk sectors like Tucson.",
        "That's a high mark.",
        "It's a very high mark, but what happens is if Homeland Security doesn't reach that mark, in five years, a border security commission is established, and that is comprised of the four border-state governors, political appointees from both parties.",
        "They are given an additional $2 billion to try to rectify the problem.",
        "They have to develop a strategy, implement the strategy, and as long as some other things are brought online like a federal eVerify program to ensure that all businesses are checking new employees for their immigration status, and an entry-exit visa program is established, if all these things are just put in place, they can go forward on the road to getting their green cards.",
        "All right, well, let's take a question here.",
        "It's all very interesting.",
        "But there are so many ifs and variables here, it's hard to know what we're getting answers to.",
        "Brian(ph) in Denver, Colorado, has a question.",
        "Brian, what's your question?",
        "My question is this: My wife is a U.K.",
        "national, and it took us over two years to go through the legal green card process, and it was obvious to me that the Immigration Department is completely understaffed.",
        "And in fact they've subbed out a lot of that.",
        "Is there any funding in this bill to increase the number of employees who will actually be processing all this paperwork and all this bureaucratic effort that needs to happen for all of these pieces to come together?",

        "I can't really answer that question directly.",
        "I do believe that the sequestration process, for example, is showing us the vulnerabilities of a lot of federal agencies, and that is almost surely going to include the federal agencies that are asked to administer anything under this particular bill.",
        "Sequestration is probably going to be with us more or less indefinitely, parts of it at least, not only past this September, but the kinds of decreases in federal capability in a lot of these agencies and departments is probably going to be a rolling phenomenon going forward, beyond this fiscal year.",
        "So if it is already difficult for some of these agencies to handle some of the cases, such as the caller cites, it's hard to imagine it getting much better.",
        "You'll notice that most of the funding in this bill is going to things that are directly related to border security, not to smoothing or easing the process of taking care of the people who are applying for green cards or other steps along the process of status in this bill.",

        "I did note that there's going to be coordination asked between the Department of Homeland Security, the Social Security Administration and the Labor Department for all these employer verification items.",

        "OK.",

        "What happened to that proposal giving preference to people who are in STEM services, in STEM areas?",
        "Well, there's going to be some preference for people in STEM areas.",
        "But the caller is correct that the interests of some of the big tech companies are being served here, perhaps more than the interests of some of the workers they're interested in hiring.",
        "I think the presumption is that the opportunity to be here and to work for some of those big tech companies should be sufficient from their standpoint.",
        "Plus, they're not really the lobbying force that the big tech companies are.",
        "The big corporations that have used technology to push forward the frontiers of science and all the things that we can do with computers today have a rather large, growing and effective presence in Washington."
