        "The people who have it, there's 45 million of them, really, really love it.",
        "The problem is that what they really, really love about it makes it really, really expensive.",
        "And so it's really not fiscally sustainable.",
        "But I went to New York to talk to one of those people who really, really, really love it.",
        "Her name is Audrey Bernfield.",
        "And we took a little walk around her neighborhood in Chelsea on Manhattan's West Side.",
        "There are a lot of little shops.",
        "There's a very nice jewelry store, and a very funny fabric store and a wonderful paella restaurant.",
        "Bernfield is from Chicago by way of Maryland, California and Boston.",
        "She says New York is by far the easiest to get around.",
        "I do a lot of walking.",
        "And I think that that's what I like about New York is it's a wonderful walking city.",
        "And it's a healthy place to live.",
        "I read somewhere that we live five years longer.",
        "To see the 71-year-old Bernfield charging up and down the street, you'd never know she's actually a two-time cancer survivor.",
        "But back upstairs in her cozy, new condo, she's as upbeat about her medical situation as she is about her new hometown."

        "In 1994, I had breast cancer, and then I was free and clear until about three years ago when I got a recurrence on the same side.",
        "And then it metastasized to bones, but it's very much under control.",
        "I feel I have the kind of physicians who said this is a chronic disease and we're dealing with it, and if one thing doesn't work, another does.",
        "And I feel very confident that they're going to take care of me.",
        "Another thing Bernfield says works for her is her Medicare insurance coverage.",
        "Sometimes, it even provides more coverage than she realized.",
        "I had a prescription to get a new prosthesis because I had a mastectomy.",
        "And the woman said, but you're also entitled to six bras.",
        "I said excuse me?",
        "She said, you're entitled to six bras with this.",
        "But I said, who needs six bras?",
        "So now I have a brown one and a red one and white one.",
        "Bernfield's life hasn't been without its challenges.",
        "After she married her high school sweetheart and moved to Maryland, she wanted to study international affairs at a local university.",
        "But they told me that I wouldn't get accepted as a full-time graduate student because that place was saved for men.",
        "Bernfield left the admissions office in tears but she didn't give up.",
        "She eventually rose to become the head of undergraduate advising at Stanford University, and later helped students at Harvard Medical School design research projects.",
        "After her husband died in 2002, she waited a year before deciding to move to New York.",
        "That's where her grandchildren live.",
        "One thing that made her moving decision easier is the fact that her Medicare coverage follows her, no matter where in the country she goes.",
        "But now that she's in New York, family is not the only thing in Bernfield's life.",
        "She spends a lot of time volunteering for a women's group.",
        "Among other things, she counsels women about their own health care.",
        "I like to talk to people about how to talk to their doctor.",
        "And especially with Medicare, sometimes, doctors don't take it.",
        "That's when the problem comes.",
        "Bernfield found her own doctors the old-fashioned way.",
        "She called a friend.",
        "Then she referred me to somebody who was fabulous, who then referred me to the next doctor.",
        "You know, so all of the people that I go to know each other and collaborate and take care of me.",
        "And unfortunately, I've needed a lot of different services and it's worked perfectly.",

        "The conservatives seemed to hold together as a bloc resisting gay marriage, and that includes Chief Justice Roberts.",
        "He surprised me a little bit.",
        "And as usual Anthony Kennedy seemed to be right in the middle.",

        "If a court strikes down a law because the administration decides not to defend it, then the administration has the power to destroy and void every law simply by not defending it.",
        "And that's an extreme expansion of executive power.",

        "Shame on us if we've forgotten.",
        "Now this week, this is part of a big push by the White House to make this feel like a front-burner issue.",

        "The political tides have shifted back.",
        "So they feel pressure the other way.",
        "And so framing this issue in a way that could make those red state people feel comfortable was the key, and that was not successfully done.",

        "But are these threats against the assault weapons ban really, rather than the universal background checks, which have more support?",
        "Right.",
        "And I do think if we can get the background checks, if we can get some laws on the gun trafficking, and if we get some things to control the areas where crime and murder is at its highest, those few areas around the country, then there's still hope to salvage something that will make some tangential difference on the homicide rate.",
