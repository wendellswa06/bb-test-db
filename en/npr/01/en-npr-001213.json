        "Ron Rice is a city councilman from the ward where the murders took place.",
        "In the days and weeks following the murders, he and Mayor Booker announced a dizzying number of programs.",
        "Booker persuaded a local foundation to fund $3.2 million worth of surveillance cameras.",
        "They improved recreation facilities for youth, boosted services for ex-cons and spent more on policing.",
        "Booker held press conferences almost daily.",
        "We have nothing short but the goal here in Newark, which is to rid our streets of illegal guns and the resulting gun violence in the city of Newark.",
        "It paid off.",
        "Murders are down by nearly 60 percent since Booker took office.",
        "And this March, the city had its first murder-free month since 1966.",
        "Crime rates have been falling in large cities all over the Western world.",
        "But Todd Clear, dean of the Rutgers University School of Criminal Justice in Newark, says smaller poor Rust Belt cities haven't been able to replicate that success.",
        "That makes Newark's turnaround even more remarkable.",
        "We always used to map crimes by putting little colored pins in the wall.",
        "But now we look at crime, really, we try to identify the people surrounding that place and identify how we can get the people who live there to become involved in solving the crime-related problems.",
        "Clear says it's a combination of good policing and community outreach that's working in Newark.",
        "Even a simple painting project is part of this mix.",
        "At an elementary school on a recent Saturday, Towanda McEachern(ph) and her organization, Supporting our Sisters, are painting murals in the gym.",
        "We may look at it as just painting the gym, or just painting the school.",
        "The more kids in here, that's the less kids out there on the streets.",
        "And in addition to that, they get an opportunity to do something for somebody else other than themselves.",
        "It's not that community service is anything new here, but this is the first time in many years that local organizations, city agencies and the police are working together.",
        "The 59 percent support Booker received yesterday shows he's still distrusted by many Newarkers.",
        "He's often criticized as a carpetbagger from the suburbs who spends too much time outside the city hobnobbing with the rich and powerful.",
        "But now, Booker has another four years in office, and as he pledged in the days after the 2007 murders, Newark is no longer defined by the violent crime that had held back its promise.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Nancy Solomon."

        "I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives, in the lives of the American people.",
        "I think it's time that we joined a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern pluralistic society.",

        "Good morning, Renee.",
        "Throughout our history, a politician's faith and how it influences his politics has been a thorny issue, mostly for the politician himself or herself.",
        "Why have you chosen this moment to wade into this issue?",
        "Well, I think there's an interesting opportunity right now, Renee, partly because you're starting to see changes in leadership within the evangelical community.",
        "You know, the traditional fire and brimstone leaders, the Jerry Falwells and the Pat Robertsons, are starting to give way to leaders like Rick Warren or TD Jakes, who, you know, still have conservative views when it comes to certain social issues, but are also opening up to issues like environmentalism or Darfur, the AIDS crisis in Africa.",
        "And part of what I've wanted to make sure of is that those of us who consider ourselves progressive, that we are not somehow abandoning the opportunity to work with people of all faiths to bring about American renewal.",
        "So are you talking, for instance, about, say, reaching out to very conservative Republican center, like Sam Brownback from Kansas, who sort of, on the one hand, led the charge on stopping the killing in Darfur, on slavery in Sudan, on helping persecuted Christians in - escape North Korea, and yet on the other hand he's a very, very strong and fierce opponent of a woman's right to choose abortion?",
        "Well, I think Sam Brownback is a perfect example of the contradictory strains that we have in this country when it comes to faith and what those obligations are.",
        "And Sam Brownback and I are not going to agree on abortion.",
        "We're not going to agree on a constitutional amendment for gay marriage.",
        "But he and I are the two chief co-sponsors on a bill dealing with Darfur.",
        "And more than just the specific issue is involved, part of my intent in the speech was to figure out how can we stop using religion as a divisive force in the body politic and how can we tap into that sense that our values, our deepest moral commitments can be harnessed in order to bring about changes that might have seemed impossible if you were just looking at the realities of the here and now."
