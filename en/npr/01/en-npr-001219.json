        "But why did the wall fail?",
        "Two teams of engineers, one funded by the state of Louisiana and one based at the University of California, Berkley, have previously put the blame on the Army Corps of Engineers and on a weak layer of ground below the canal walls.",

        "The report says that underground, just outside the canal in people's backyards, there lurked a weak layer of clay.",
        "Once the movement started and the water pressures developed, there was enough force then just to cause an entire block to slide tens of feet and to breach the levee.",
        "The investigators say this conclusion is based on extensive computer models, soil samples, and even a miniature model of a canal wall that they tested by spinning it around in a centrifuge to mimic the forces of the event.",
