        "All of the songs are curated by NPR Music's own Stephen Thompson who explained to me how he put the list together.",
        "Well, I listened to more than 100 hours of songs - between 1,500 and 2,000 in all - to winnow everything down to 100.",
        "And why - what made me want to do this, it's what I would want someone to make for me going into South By Southwest.",
        "South By Southwest is just music in bulk and anybody who can kind of help you sift and winnow through that to a more digestible package is really useful.",
        "And the fact of the matter is if you go to npr.org and click on it, you can download all 100 songs in one zip file and just carry them with you wherever you go.",
