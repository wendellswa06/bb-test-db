        "The bird spends most of its life at sea, so its habits aren't very well known.",

        "When the data started to come in, he could hardly believe how high the birds flew.",
        "First, we found, oh, 1,500 meters, whoa, excellent, fantastique.",
        "And after 2,000, after 3,000, after 4,000 meters - OK.",
        "4,000 meters is over 12,000 feet as high as the Rocky Mountains.",
        "There is no other bird that is flying so high relative to the sea surface.",
        "Weimerskirch who's with the National Science Research Center in Paris says that kind of flying should take a huge amount of energy.",
        "But his instruments were monitoring the birds' heartbeats, and the birds weren't even winded.",
        "How did they do it?",
        "Well, they flew into a cloud.",

        "Winds that form these updrafts also disrupt waves at the sea surface.",

        "In other words, he had no place to vote.",
