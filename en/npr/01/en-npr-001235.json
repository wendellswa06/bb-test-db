        "We start with actual votes when we have the opportunity, including in Wisconsin, Democrats were choosing their candidate to run against - well, in the recall election against the governor.",
        "Right, and the guy who was favored to win did win.",
        "That's Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.",
        "In 2010, Barrett came within five points of Scott Walker in the gubernatorial race.",
        "And now in yesterday's primary, Barrett beat Kathleen Falk, the former Dane County executive, backed by organized labor who basically was the guiding force behind this recall.",
        "But Falk was a little more sympathetic to labor, but not to worry if you're on the left, Democrats and labor will unite behind Barrett, and they have basically a month to go before the June 5 - June 5 recall, where they're going to be running against Scott Walker.",
        "And in Milwaukee last night, Tom Barrett, the mayor there, did focus, as he did pretty much throughout the primary election, on his rival, Scott Walker."

        "In the last three months, absolutely right, last three months Scott Walker has raised over $13 million.",
        "What's fascinating about this race is there are very few undecided voters in Wisconsin.",

        "Well, Mitt Romney is collecting delegates, and he's winning the primaries.",
        "Certainly he won all three states yesterday, and what's interesting of course is that Ron Paul seems to be getting a lot of delegates in - when the battle goes to the state conventions.",
        "But Romney, of course, did very well in all the states, as we expected.",
        "What was more surprisingly, I thought, was in the West Virginia primary, in the Democratic side, President Obama of course has never been popular in West Virginia, shall we say.",
        "I mean, he lost to Hillary Clinton by 41 points in the primary, lost to John McCain in November.",
        "But this felon, the convicted felon from Texas, a guy named Keith Judd who's serving the - is in prison in Texas, he got 41 percent of the statewide vote in West Virginia against President Obama, and potentially he gets some delegates, but whether he does or not - again look, Obama's not going to win West Virginia anyway in November, but 41 percent is a lot.",
