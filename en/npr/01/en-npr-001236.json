        "It had been reported that several Republicans would have voted for it, up to five, and hence had it ever gotten to the floor, it probably would have passed.",
        "It did get out of committee, so that was the indication that at least some Republicans support.",
        "That's right, and as I say, there's been some polling late last year and a little bit early this year showing that it is favored.",
        "And, you know, that reflects in a huge amount of movement because in 1992, it was Colorado that sort of launched a national dialogue on gay rights because we supported a limitation on gay rights, which was ultimately overturned by the Supreme Court.",
        "And we have actually fairly recently, within about the last six years, voted against both civil unions and gay marriage in Colorado.",
        "But yet the polls indicate that gay marriage in Colorado is about dead even, as it is nationally, but that civil unions is in fact leading pretty substantially with just general public opinion.",

        "Hence, that's about maybe 40,000 votes.",
        "But definitely the polls indicate that up to a third of Democrats and 40 percent unaffiliated voters are opposed to gay marriage, and so I think that that's what - assuming there's a political calculation in the president's thinking, along with his philosophy and other views, that that's what's restraining him from moving forward.",

        "But President Obama also knows, as I said before, that every time it's on the ballot, it's overwhelmingly defeated, and he knows he has to stand for re-election.",
        "The thought has always been that once in a second term, should he get a second term, his evolving on gay rights would be more pronounced.",
        "But it's very possible, as you say, that the interview he's having with \"\"Good Morning America\"\" may further show more evolvement.",

        "We've been talking overwhelmingly about the economy, but suddenly it has loomed large.",
        "And at least to some extent I think the president's theory is that you sort of pick off voters by implying that the Republicans are extreme on one issue or the other.",
        "Essentially, it says that a year before the novel was published in July of 1960, that Capote had seen the novel, had read much of the book, and liked it very much, and commented that she has great talent.",

        "But 50-50 still means it's a very polarized issue, and it has huge passion.",
        "Last night we had crowds at the state capital, including actually the room had to be cleared for a while because it got so heated.",
        "So consequently, both passion and polarization, I think, makes the president move very gingerly here.",
        "Crowds supporting which side?",

        "At the same time, look at gay marriage, say that's not something that we should be supporting.",

        "So a lot of people who I know just have strong feelings against gay marriage.",
        "They don't want to affirm those sort of unions, and I think that it's going to be something that could make a lot of people stay home and not even want to vote for either candidate.",

        "And Ken Rudin, there is a political risk to this, as Floyd Ciruli has been saying, amongst Democrats, amongst key constituencies for the president, African-Americans, where he commands tremendous support, and Hispanics, where he's hoping to get 70 percent.",
        "And, obviously, Colorado is a perfect example of the latter, and that's exactly right in the sense that if Obama is to get a second term, he's going to have to keep those gains he made of those normally Republican states - like Virginia, like Indiana, like North Carolina, like Florida and Ohio, states like that - where any amount of turnoff from the Obama coalition from 2008 - be it African-Americans, be it young voters, be it conservative Democrats - could doom his chances.",
        "And, Floyd Ciruli, does your polling, just in general, support the findings that we've been hearing that pretty much in a place like Colorado, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama about dead even at this point?",
        "That's right.",

        "But he is really just beginning and sort of starting to consolidate.",
        "And the polls indicate it's fairly - it is close, it's within a couple of points.",
        "And so that I think the president is looking for sort of zero distractions, of being able to talk overwhelmingly on what he thinks are the strengths of his record and, obviously, the future, the way like the ad that you played - showed.",
        "So I see this as a very difficult issue for him because, obviously, there are strong people in favor of gay rights, including constituents of his.",
        "But it definitely has all the markings of an issue that you wouldn't want to lead with.",
        "As you know, the polls indicate, including ours, that one of his weaknesses is he is seen as more liberal than both his supporters but in particular the public in general, certainly the public he's reaching out to, the undecided voter.",
        "And so things that reinforces liberalism as opposed to bread-and-butter kinds of economic issues, I think, are what he would consider a distraction."
