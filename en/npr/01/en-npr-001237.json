        "And I'm talking about numbers in the 70, 75 percent approval for those issues.",
        "And so, you know, if this is going to be a campaign about micro-targeting, then this might be an issue that Barack Obama talks about on college campuses, the University of Virginia, VCU, for example, George Mason and maybe in Northern Virginia where there's a large younger population of voters, but maybe doesn't talk about so much in Norfolk or Richmond and talks about economic issues, for example.",

        "Quentin, we heard one of the callers earlier, Lawrence from Ohio who's African-American, talking about his reticence about same-sex marriage.",
        "Now - not that Lawrence speaks for all African-Americans, but obviously, we've heard in the black community, there is reluctance, and Virginia does have a sizable African-American voting constituency.",
        "What are you hearing about that in Virginia?",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "African-American voters are socially conservative in, you know, in large - in a large sense, and gay marriage is one of those issues that they tend to be more conservative on, say, than the Democratic Party, generally.",
        "But in 2008 when Virginia passed the constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, it failed in only two congressional districts - the 8th Congressional District, which is right up against Northern Virginia, Washington, D.C., area, and the 3rd Congressional District, which is the majority-minority district in Virginia.",
        "And so I don't, you know, African-Americans aren't of one voice on gay marriage.",
        "And I - and so I don't think it's just a losing proposition writ large amongst African-American voters.",
        "You know, I think as many as would oppose it, would also not oppose it.",
        "And so, you know, I think if the presidential - if the president's campaign micro-targets instead of, you know, broad brushing it on gay marriage in Virginia, then I don't think it would come across the same way as if it were a general issue that he spoke about across the state.",
        "And every indication we have is they're going to micro-target on every level.",

        "It wasn't an amendment to bar gay marriage.",

        "And what I'm wondering is, that in North Carolina, it may be that President Obama stands back and doesn't take a position on this right now.",
