        "So why do you think that they're evolving into having these shorter wings?",

        "One is highway road mortality.",
        "I think that's having an effect on the morphology of wings.",
        "Another could be changes in the insects that these animals feed on.",
        "They feed on flying insects, and land use in the study area is changing quite a bit.",
        "Many of our prairies and grasslands are being converted into cultivated corn, and that, of course, is going to change the insect community, so some of the wing length changes may be in response to changing food.",

        "Periodically, we have long - we have these periods of severe weather which will actually kill birds.",

        "So the theory is that these shorter wings help them maneuver more quickly, get around those speeding cars, maybe help them catch those flying insects.",
        "Would there be some downsize to having shorter wings?",
        "I mean, does it mean that they can't fly long distances, for instance?",
        "Well, there are actually maybe costs associated with this because some studies have shown that longer, more pointed wings are better for long-distance flight.",
        "And these birds certainly fly over long distances.",
        "They winter in Argentina, breed in North America, so they're - these are long distance migrants.",
        "So it's quite possible that there could be energetic costs associated with a shorter or a more rounded wing.",
