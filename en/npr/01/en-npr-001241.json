        "Historically, they used cliffs, a vertical wall underneath a horizontal overhang on a cliff, but these artificial structures really present the same sort of place to nest but - and are much safer in the process.",
        "The birds are more successful there.",
        "The nests are less likely to be washed away by wind or waves.",
        "So consequently, the birds are just doing better on these artificial structures.",
        "The nests last from year to year, and the birds place a great premium on taking over an old nest at the start of the nesting season.",
        "So for that reason, these bridges and highway culverts are probably attracting birds year after year.",

        "Hi there, Eli.",
        "You're on SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Hi.",
        "My question is - I was wondering if you'd studied populations of these birds who don't live near highways.",
        "So as - are there changes in their physical attributes as well and are they similar?",
        "Well, we would certainly predict that.",
        "But, no, we've not done any studies on cliff swallows using these natural populations.",
        "It's getting harder and harder to find them now because of this conversion of the birds to the bridges.",
        "But, no, that would be a logical next step, is to identify populations that have not been exposed to vehicles and - with wing morphology in those guys.",
        "You said before you study swallow societies.",
        "They sound like pretty fascinating birds.",
        "I mean, what are some things about them that might surprise our listeners?",
        "They're incredibly interesting.",
        "Cliff swallow society is a bit of a paradox because these animals show this intense desire to always be near others of their own kind, yet in the process of being together, there is just continual conflict among individuals.",
        "For instance, the birds that nest near each other in a nesting colony, they are constantly trying to do things to each other.",
        "They get in each other's nests.",
        "They still nesting material.",
        "They throw out their neighbor's eggs.",
        "They will try to lay eggs in their neighbor's nest.",
        "Males will try to copulate with the female living next door.",
        "They're really mean little animals.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF FLUME'S \"\"PIKA\"\")",
        "And it was a good deal, but...",
        "Well, I guess, I see all the parallels with humans.",
        "But I mean, for instance, one thing they do is they show this incredible play behavior.",
        "You'll get 50 or 60 on a wire, and they'll all crowd together, completely touching each other shoulder to shoulder, and then other birds will come in from above and try to knock some of them off the wire.",
        "And - I mean, it's clearly play, and the ones that are on the wire try to avoid getting knocked off.",
        "They'll even, sometimes, hang upside down in order to avoid surrendering their place.",
        "And this will go on for, you know, five or six minutes, and then their everybody just starts to spreads out and goes about, you know, resumes preening.",
        "So they're really fascinating.",
        "And the more you look at them as we've done, the more you learn about them and the more fascinating you really become."

        "I'm John Dankosky, and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",
        "Of course, one thing that you've said happens when these birds get together in these big, old colonies is some diseases and other things.",
        "They have bed bugs in their nests?",
        "They do have bed bugs.",
        "They're the principal parasite.",
        "And in fact, one of the major costs of living in colonies for these animals is this thing called a swallow bug, but it's actually a bed bug.",
        "It looks very similar to the human bed bug.",
        "And these bugs live in the colonies.",
        "The infestations can reach 2,600 per nest.",
        "So there may be hundreds of thousands of swallow bugs in a single cliff swallow colony.",
        "And when the infestations become severe, of course, reproductive success just, you know, drops and the birds began to desert their colonies.",
        "The babies that do survive are malnourished and in pretty bad shape.",
        "So that's one of the principal disadvantages of living in very large colonies.",

        "Well, we don't know that we're going to be able to do a whole lot more with cliff swallows because the road kills are just drying up in this particular study area.",
        "We just don't find many road kills anymore.",
        "I mean, we're down to only getting a couple of birds a year.",
        "So in this case, it's beginning to look like road mortality is becoming a bid of a non-factor.",
        "I think what you'd want to do, as the previous caller mentioned, you'd probably want to go to a place where they've been exposed to vehicles more recently or maybe not exposed at all and look at wing morphology there.",
        "Are cliff swallows found every place on the planet?",
        "It seems like they're the ubiquitous bird.",
        "No, they're actually restricted to North America as a breeding bird.",
        "There are swallows very similar that are, essentially, ecological equivalents that are found in Africa, South America, Australia and Asia.",
        "So there are related species elsewhere, but our particular bird is a breeder here, only in North America.",
        "Just very quickly, Doctor, do you expect these birds to change more as there are more and more people, faster cars.",
        "They're living in the same sorts of environment.",
        "Do you expect to see bigger changes in these swallows over time?"

        "Well, I think what this study shows is that animals can likely adapt to these human - these urban environments relatively quickly.",
        "Most of what we've seen in the Nebraska population has occurred over the last 30 years, and we know that because it was about 30 years ago that the birds began moving on to these bridges and culverts in large numbers in this particular area.",

        "This ship is three times the size of an aircraft carrier and the pirates tend not to take the cargo, but they hold it and the crew hostage and ask for ransom.",
        "They pulled in millions of dollars.",
        "So why do you think that, you know, this piracy has rekindled in Somalia, and what does it say that they were able to take over a ship of this size with this kind of cargo?",
        "Well, the critical thing here, Farai, is that the Somali economy is essentially in shambles.",
        "People don't have access to jobs that can pay a meaningful wage, and so what you have in the midst of this, again, lawlessness because of the crisis in Somalia over lack of a government, you have people now trying to find whatever means they can to survive.",
        "So this is actually one of - according to Al Jazeera - 63 ships that have been captured this year alone, and I think it is a sign that the desperation is intensifying, and more and more people are looking to a much less legal means, let's say, Farai, to try to make a living."
