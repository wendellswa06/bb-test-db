        "Navy operations very active, really for the last two years now, throughout these waterways.",
        "But it hasn't made a difference.",
        "Again, you have to go to the root causes of the crisis.",
        "The root cause is the lack of a government and the lack of a viable economy there in Somalia.",

        "Remember, it was December, 2006, when the U.S.",
        "actually ousted the Union of Islamic Courts in Somalia.",
        "The Union of Islamic Courts had brought for a six month period when they ruled the first ever period of peace since 1992 for Somalia.",
        "So you had this six-month window where people could send their children to school, women could walk in the streets freely, and there was a sense that life could begin again.",
        "Yet because they had Islamic in their name, the Bush Administration decided no, that was unacceptable, and went forward, and working with Ethiopian ground troops and U.S.",

        "naval operations, actually ousted that government.",
        "What you have had since is an incursion of these now insurgents that have been organizing, steadily organizing and gaining strength throughout the country, and they are now right at the doorstep of Mogadishu according to many reports.",
        "So it is very likely that this clamoring for a sense of determining their own future will lead to a more outright victory there in Somalia, and that you will have this current government that's been sort of propped up by Ethiopia and the United States in short order losing its legitimacy.",

        "Well I think we have to be clear.",
        "There are women living under Muslim law that are - some are facing extraordinary challenges, and many others are, in spite of living under Muslim law, are taking leadership in a number of areas.",
        "You see human rights defenders all the way from western Sahara to Somalia, where women peace activists in Somalia have been clamoring for peace and justice in the country, not just for women but for all Somalis.",
        "So I think we - because, again, of the difficult situation - we have to remember that Somalia is 90 percent Muslim, not extremist Muslim, but 90 percent Muslim, and we have to understand that there has to be a space to not hear Islam and not hear Muslim and hear extremist."
