        "Well, we did it by: one, covering as big a surface area as we could in the building with photovoltaics; by choosing the most efficient that are available today commercially in the world; and by driving the consumption inside the building with investments in efficiency down to a small fraction of what it typically is.",
        "Compared to the average building that exists in Seattle, we use 17 percent as much energy.",
