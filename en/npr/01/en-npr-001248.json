        "But it does communicate strongly to the rest of the country that if you can do it here, you can do it anyplace.",
        "And then similarly we - under the Living Building Challenge, have to get all of our water from the rain that falls on our roof, and that's just to flush the toilets, but for potable drinking water, for showers, for everything.",
        "We have to avoid about 360 toxic and mutagenic and endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are common in the building space.",
        "All of the materials in the building, and there's like 1,400 components, have to come from specific radiuses from the building site.",
        "It's a really tough set of challenges, and we're very proud to have done it.",
        "If you want to do it, you can do it, is the message here.",
        "And I suppose to be perfectly frank, we also have to say that compared to other class A office space in Seattle, we paid a premium.",
        "It costs 23 percent more to generate all your own energy, all of your own water, do all of that stuff on-site.",
        "But if you looked at the investments that society has to make to provide those services to other buildings, I think we actually come out ahead.",
        "And I think because this was the first building, it was particularly expensive.",
        "The second, third, fourth, 100th will be substantially cheaper.",
        "Who are your environmental heroes?",
        "Who's around now, who's doing work on behalf of the environment that you admire or maybe someone from the past even.",
        "Well, there are a great many people.",
        "I mean, in the context of this interview, I would particularly point out Cathleen Rogers and the staff of the Earth Day Network, who have taken that idea and kept it alive now in more than 180 countries around the world.",
        "It's typically the first introduction that school kids have to environmental values and issues and environmental education in general, as these events that are literally now every April held everywhere.",
        "If you look at things historically, there have been some amazing champions.",
        "I suppose that I might choose Teddy Roosevelt, and it's in part because of his strong progressive views with regard to wilderness areas, but it's also because of his Republican quasi-populist skepticism about a whole series of industrial activities that were not much being questioned then by any politicians.",
        "Yeah, trust busters.",
        "Let me go to the audience, right up here, yes.",
        "Hi, I'm Thea Bruce(ph), and I'd like to know if there is, since you were very successful with your building, is there a template now that many developers could use to make it economically viable for them to produce a building like yours for Seattle?"

        "Perfect question.",

        "We will publish on our website all of our materials and all of the specific suppliers of those things that we have, windows that were simply not available in the United States to meet our needs.",
        "We imported the technology from Germany and got a local manufacturer, Goldfinch Brothers, to make the windows.",
        "All of that stuff is there for Seattle and probably for the Pacific Northwest, from Portland up through Vancouver.",
        "...If we type anything anywhere online, we don't quite know in 2019, 2018 - in the digital age - where it's going to end up and who might see it?",
        "Richard, thanks very much for the call.",
        "One of the things about building in a way that's environmental sound is to be aware of your surroundings.",
        "You build a very different building if you're in Phoenix than if you're in Anchorage than if you're in Atlanta.",
        "But I think we've got a terrific template for Seattle, and I think the Living Building Challenge is an appropriate challenge in each of those areas.",
        "You mentioned all of the technologies that were made in the USA but are no longer made in the USA.",
        "What do you see as the future?",
        "Is there any way to bring - can we leapfrog a technology, bring something newer back or bring any of the current technologies back?",
        "I think this is all a matter of choice and policy, sure.",
        "I mean, there are a lot of ways that you can leapfrog, particularly in the solar field, by moving into nanotechnologies for example.",
        "The theoretical efficiency of solar cells is now very substantially - I mean hell, forget the theoretical efficiency.",
        "The real efficiency of solar cells is higher than the theoretical efficiency back when I was at SERI just because of new materials approaches.",
        "No kidding.",
        "The - and as you move increasingly into robotics, the fact that Ph.D.s in some other countries are prepared to work for less than high school graduates in the United States will also become less and less an issue.",
        "But it's a question of having the supportive policies.",
        "If you've got something that creates a genuine market for these things, then somebody's going to go out and exploit it.",
        "Now there has been a flood of solar panels on the market, and the prices have dropped.",
        "But there have been recent reports that the solar panels are really substandard, and they're falling apart before they were expected to.",

        "Well, we shouldn't be talking about solar panels generically.",
        "There are small Chinese manufacturers who have made substandard panels, have sold them some people believe for less than the cost of manufacturing them, and they have given it a bad name in a few circles.",
        "If you're buying from a responsible manufacturer, SunPower, who we bought it from, which is an American company, or any of the Chinese companies or German companies that have good reputations and track records of at least 10 years and good, enforceable warranties.",
        "You'll get a good product.",
        "Do you think there is a race between solar and wind, one has to win out over the other?",
        "No, they both have important advantages in different circumstances.",
        "With solar it's inherently modular, and the efficiency simply depends upon the solar intensity.",

        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "The power you get from wind goes up with the cube of air speed.",
        "So if it's twice as fast, you get eight times as much power, and it goes up with the square of turbine size.",
        "So if it's twice as big a turbine, you get four times as much power.",
        "So wind makes sense in places where there's a lot of wind and you can put up big turbines, don't make any sense in cities.",
        "That's where solar takes over.",
        "Do you ever wonder where we would be today - I'm sure you do - if Jimmy Carter's policies and procedures and funding had carried through for the last 30-or-so years?",
        "Well, I have a fairly clear idea, it may not be right since it was a hypothetical future, but we developed a rather thorough set of policies that were designed to bring America to getting more than 20 percent of its energy from renewable resources by the year 2000.",
        "Had that happened, we would have had such efficiencies of scale that - and efficiencies of mass production that the costs would have, by 2000, been lower than they are today, and I think the market would have been incredible, and it would have been a huge global export market for the United States.",
        "My sense, and this gets a little bit green, but I really think that photovoltaics in a human culture can play the role that photosynthesis plays in nature, where literally everything that is available can be covered with something that captures sunlight and converts it into something that is very useful for the purposes of the organisms that either produce it or eat it."

        "The world is seeing a massive wave of migration to cities.",
        "And in the United States, where we have a constitutional right as Americans to live anyplace that we want to, and big parts of the country are now becoming desiccated as a consequence of climate change, and people are moving to specific cities, I think that solar is going to be the way that those things increasingly get powered either for all of their energy, some cases, or for a very large part of that because of the happy coincidence between the time that the sun shines and the time that we like to be awake and doing things.",

        "So it's a win-win-win-win kind of policy, no losers in it at all, to go into buildings and get increases of efficiency of 35 to 50 percent with a 20-year contract to buy megawatt hours by the utility.",
        "Negawatt.",
