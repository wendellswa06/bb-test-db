        "It hurt.",
        "But Nordlum says it was a visceral reminder of why this kind of cultural preservation is important.",
        "The idea, though, is for Inupiaq, Inuit, Yup'ik women to feel proud of who they are, to feel strong, to create a sisterhood.",
        "And, Nordlum says, for each woman to feel part of something bigger than herself, supported each time she sees another striking mark of pride on a smiling face.",

        "And you've been in touch with former students who are in Myanmar now.",

        "The crisis is really devastating.",
        "The number may reach almost 250,000.",

        "They're all organizations that have been mobilized - the Red Cross, the World Vision, World Foods Program - that are based in the country.",
        "Many of them are using regional neighbors as a conduit but they still haven't been able to reach the most devastated areas.",
        "Now, what is the difficulty in terms of getting the aid into the country?",
        "Is it a political problem?",
        "Is the military junta not letting people in?",
        "Or - and - is an infrastructure problem?",
        "I understand there are lots of isolated villages that are reachable only by either helicopter or boat.",
        "The main problem is predominantly infrastructural.",
        "There are very few roads into the areas that were actually devastated.",
        "Those roads that have been hit are really completely covered with debris, and so there isn't very much access.",
        "The reports that have come out, is that there are bodies streaming along in, on these roads.",
        "It's just quite really shocking type of story."

        "You'd have to understand that more.",
        "Secondly, you'd have control over your data and that you would be able to opt out of any sharing arrangements.",
        "And the third thing is that you would be notified of any privacy breach.",
        "That is pretty common-sense legislation.",

        "It never even came up for a vote.",
        "Right.",

        "Should he go?",
        "Well, one of the bills that's pretty interesting - and I'm not going to the internal decisions in the company - but is Data Care Act, which would put that kind of accountability on the company, creating a fiduciary duty for these companies to protect their information, just like you have for doctors, just like you have for lawyers.",

        "Well, they can't.",
        "OK?",
        "They have created this monster, basically, that has so many good things that's part of it.",
        "There's a friendly part of the monster.",
