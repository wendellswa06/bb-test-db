        "It's a little counterintuitive because from all the economic news that I've read over the last three decades, the American economy has actually grown, productivity has increased, so you think incomes would do the same thing.",
        "Well, I think the report says two things.",
        "One is that while male income has been declining over the last 30 years, from 1974 to 2004, family incomes have, in fact, been rising, and I think that an important part of this story as well.",
        "So the stories for families is not - is not as bad as the stories for men.",
        "The subtext, though, is that if you look at family incomes and as they have risen over the last 30 years - and again, these are families with men in their 30s - that rate of growth is only about nine percent over the last 30 years, and that compares to a growth rate of about 32 percent for a previous generation.",
        "So you see declining male incomes from men in their 30s and then growing rates for families, but a slowing growth rate, if you will.",
        "And growing rates because women are working.",
        "That's correct.",
        "Part of that income increase for families has been women - women entering the workforce over the last 30 years.",

        "I think if you also look at what the president tried to do in 2001 and 2003 to stimulate the American economy coming out of a recession when he first took office was to enact a wide-sweeping set of tax cuts that stimulated the American economy and led to a record 50-week growth - job growth - in this country - or I should say 50 months."

        "For example, I think that the problems and the deficiencies in the response to Katrina actually have convinced the American people that we do need government, that the Republican mantra of smaller and smaller government, of Grover Norquist wanting to, you know, make government small enough that he could drown it in the bathtub, that Katrina showed us that we actually need government to do certain important things like preserve infrastructure and be available to respond to the kinds of disasters in a competent way.",
        "And that's the other piece, that competence counts.",

        "You know, Brownie may be a very affable, nice guy to have a drink with, but he shouldn't have been FEMA director.",
