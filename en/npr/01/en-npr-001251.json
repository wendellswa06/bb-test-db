        "Thank you very much for your interest in the topic.",
        "So lots of folks who still support the president.",
        "What about those who are wavering?",
        "And also, another program that people don't talk about as much, Tony, is something called the Millennium Challenge program.",
        "The Millennium Challenge Account was a program that sought to tie economic assistance from the United States to those countries or those democracies around the world that were willing to make systematic improvements in the way that they conducted their elections, the way that they had transparency with their own people in order to receive assistance.",
        "So it was the promotion of democracy, and perhaps, I would say, the signature accomplishment there is Ghana.",
        "Ghana was a country that had received a good deal of assistance from the United States under Millennium Challenge.",
        "They just had a successful democratically-elected government transition to power, and I think it's working.",
        "Well, let me let Sherrilyn jump in because we only have about 30 seconds left to get your perspective on this issue of Bush's legacy, particularly with regard to Africa.",
        "Well, I think the jury is out.",
        "I mean, I agree with Ron on the malaria initiative and some of the other health initiatives, including AIDS, although I think the issue of use of condoms and contraception being tied to the AIDS work is deeply problematic, and it's likely to be addressed by the Obama administration.",
        "I do think that, you know, there are a number of problems in Africa that really suffered from the inattention of the administration.",
        "Zimbabwe being one, and the growing problems in the Congo being the other.",
        "I think the issue of security on the African continent and the efforts of the United States to have a military presence on the continent in order to address concerns about the development of terrorism is going to be - is a potential problem that we're going to see growing into the future.",
        "I think the seeds have been planted in the Bush administration.",
        "I think very few people are aware of the increased military presence of the United States on the African continent and how that may be perceived by Africans.",
        "And so I think the possibility of Africa becoming a battleground in many ways between the United States and those opposed to the policies of the United States is a potential problem that may mushroom in the future.",
        "So that one, I think, the jury is going to still be out, and it may not be quite as rosy a picture as Ron paints.",
        "All right.",
        "We'll have to leave it there.",
        "Thank you very much, Sherrilyn and Ron.",

        "Over 200 women, from ambassadors to current and former members of the military, used social media to share an open letter written to spread awareness of sexual harassment and assault of women in the national security community.",

        "It's pervasive and that doesn't mean that things haven't gotten better.",
        "But there's a full spectrum of behaviors.",
        "And we say this very clearly in the letter.",
        "On one spectrum, you have the harassment, the assault - god forbid - situations of rape.",
        "But there's also this other side of the spectrum - right?",
        "- where we say men in positions of power are often perpetrating, sometimes unconsciously, environments that do silence, demean, belittle or neglect women.",
        "Can you give me an example?",
        "Jokes about women's appearances, about, you know, strippers or strip clubs, you know, all kinds of inappropriate comments, situations where you'd be in a room with very senior people, as I have been over the case of, you know, my many years at the Pentagon - and it was almost as if I became one of the guys.",
        "And I think that I tried to do that, to be honest with you, because it was a way of me feeling like I could level out a power dynamic.",
        "And it was always awkward.",
        "And it was always terribly uncomfortable.",
        "And to be honest with you, as strong as I think I am and as much of a dedicated and committed feminist as I have been for the entirety of my career, I was always surprised at how I chose not to address it in those set of circumstances.",
        "And why do you think that was?",
        "Well, I think it's complicated, to be honest with you.",
        "I think part of it is that I wanted to appear strong.",
        "I wanted to appear as if I could suck it up and take whatever came my way with a sense of humor.",

        "And so for me, that was constantly an inner conflict that I was trying to manage.",
        "And frankly, there was a lot of productivity probably that went into having to manage that kind of thing that really is real.",
        "Do you think that culture drove out women from the national security environment?",
        "I mean, women working in that sect are vastly outnumbered by men?",
        "There's no doubt.",
        "We all have our own red lines and our own saturation points that we get to with us.",
        "But there's absolutely no doubt.",
        "And I say that on the basis of - you know, of data because of women coming to me over time.",
        "And sometimes their reasons for leaving were cloaked in other things.",
        "But I think that very clearly for a lot of them who were willing to, you know, be a bit more forthright in why they were choosing to leave was the exhaustion.",
        "What is the impact in your view when you don't have women in senior leadership positions?",
        "What do women bring to the table?"

        "This is something on a different order.",
