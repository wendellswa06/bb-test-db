        "Well, let's ask him.",

        "He joins us today from a studio on the campus.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Langer.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Did you start work in a garage like David Packard, Steve Jobs, people like that?",
        "No, I didn't.",
        "I started doing some research at Cornell University when I was an undergrad student, and then MIT as a graduate student, and then Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard Med as a post doc.",
        "And how did you move on from there?",
        "Well, after being at Children's Hospital, I went back to MIT, and...",
        "Yeah.",

        "Those are some pretty great inventors.",
        "I think probably, though, people like that have a tremendous amount of persistence.",
        "They probably, also, aren't necessarily bound by what I guess I'd call conventional wisdom, which is how you're sort of supposed to think.",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "So does it take some sort of stick-to-itiveness?",
        "In other words, you don't care what people think that you're doing.",
        "You're self-confident in your methods and techniques and where - and what you have in mind.",
        "I don't know that they're necessarily self-confident.",
        "I don't know that I'm so self-confident, and I'm not sure about the other people you mentioned, but I think it does take stick-to-itiveness.",
        "I mean, you know, I think in science you fail much more often than you succeed, and you just have to be persistent and never give up.",
        "And then also a lot of times, people will tell you that your ideas aren't going to work and things like that, and so you have to just keep hanging in there.",
        "Do you ever make anything, and then you think, this is a great idea, but what the heck do I do with it?",
        "Oh, all the time.",
        "In fact, we just published a paper in science about a month ago where we came up with some new materials that when a little bit of moisture goes in, it starts moving all over the place, and it can generate a lot of energy and things like that.",
        "And - but we're really not sure what the, you know, we're really not sure what the best application is for something like that.",
        "And so do you then give it away?",
        "Or certainly, if it's valuable, you're not going to let people, you know, take it for nothing.",
        "Well, I think it depends on what you're doing.",
        "I mean, in our case, I mean, we certainly do write patents, but we publish everything we do.",
        "So anybody's welcome to try to use it and come up with, hopefully, good uses for it.",
        "So everything we do like in an academic institution is - you know, goes to the public in that sense.",
        "But sometimes, what you also want to do is - because it's hard to, particularly in medicine, to get enough funding to do the work as you do want to have patent so that people, investors are willing to support you so that you can take things, for example, into the clinical trials and things like that.",
        "Talking with Robert Langer.",
        "Our number is 1-800-989-8255.",
        "If you want to get in on our conversation, you can also tweet us, @SCIFRI, at S-C-I-F-R-I.",
        "And talking about invention, engineering, whatever, with Robert Langer trying to pick his brain.",
        "What are you most proud of, Dr. Langer?",
        "Well, I'm probably most proud of my students.",
        "I mean, I've had about 500 students and post-docs and about half of them have gone on to terrific faculty positions.",
        "Many people are - many of them are deans of different colleges and - deans of engineering or deans of medicine.",
        "A lot of them are department chairs, many hold endowed chairs.",
        "I think I have 11 of them are members of the National Academy of Engineering.",
        "And another half, probably another 250 or so have gone on to help start companies or had a high positions of companies and have created all kinds of new technologies and inventions for the world.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to come back and talk about some of those inventions and engineering with Robert Langer right after this break.",

        "Can you crowd source it to each other, do they get it on the top view?",
        "Do you all seek thank kind of inclusion of everybody?",
        "Well, what happens is this, have students from all those all departments in our lab and actually other departments too.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, we patent our - I mean, we patent - MIT is pretty good at patenting things.",
        "Since we have quite a few patents as was mentioned, I think, in my introduction.",
        "So we do that, and a lot of times, what we've also done is to create small start-up companies with our students and to develop the technologies to, you know, to a large degree.",
        "So there are probably something like over 50 products, at least, that have come out from our lab that are actually now, being used during various stages of clinical trials.",
        "We've heard so much about the U.S.",
        "falling behind in science and engineering, why think are so successful if we're so far behind?",
        "Well, I think, you know, what's happened, I think, is there's always got to be a frame of reference- the U.S.",
        "is still, I think, done well at MIT - I'd like to think, is doing well.",
        "But I feel I've been very fortunate in terms of having had great students and great collaborators my whole life and I think having, you know, when you work with related people, it's not that hard to be successful."

        "Well, do you think that's overblown that idea that we're - we don't produce enough qualified science and engineering students, do we?",
        "I think that - I think the concern is that we're slipping, and I think that that's true.",
        "I think that unfortunately, at the grammar school and high school level, I think that science education, and certainly engineering education, is not what it could be.",
        "And I think there have been various reports from like, the National Research Council a few years ago, like Rising Above The Gathering Storm had point out that the United States is, I think, sliding in significantly in these areas.",
        "So I think the concern is warranted.",
        "But you will admit, and you have heard this from other researchers and engineers, that even though we may be slipping, there is something unique about American innovation, Yankee ingenuity of new ideas.",

        "I do agree with that.",

        "They are willing, sometimes, to go against conventional wisdom, and I also think the colleges in the United States are, you know, there was a lot of excellent colleges and universities.",

        "And why is that?",
        "Is there something about our culture or what?",
        "That's a very good question.",

        "And we actually did that with John Santini, one of our students, and Mike Cima, another professor at MIT.",
        "And now there's a company actually doing that and they're even in human clinical trials where you could do remote-control drug delivery.",
        "And I've gotten other ideas.",
