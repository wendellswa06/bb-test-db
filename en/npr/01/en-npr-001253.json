        "Well, here, what happened is, you know, I - one of the venture groups that I've done a lot of work with is Polaris Ventures, and Jon Flint, who is a senior partner there and Amir Nashat, who is one of my former graduate students and now a general partner there, they were interested, you know, we've started - they've help to start a lot of medical companies.",
        "And one day they came to me and they were interested in starting a hair company.",
        "And so they said, well - one of the things they were interested in from talking with some of the hair people, hair stylists like Miss Di Rosa(ph) was could you come up with materials that would prevent frizz?",
        "So we looked at this.",
        "And Dan Anderson and - who is one of my colleagues and myself, as well as others at the company, and we realized that pretty much every company in the world that makes an anti-frizz product uses exactly the same ingredient, silicone.",
        "And actually, that happens in medicine too.",
        "People sometimes use exactly the same thing, just some off-the-shelf thing.",
        "So we took a much more fundamental look at it and thought that we could come up with materials that would work better because they could keep water out better and also be much lighter on the hair.",
        "And so that's basically how we in the company came up with it, and it does quite well.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You must me intimately involved with nanoparticles, nano technology.",
        "Well, that's something we've worked on for many, many years, yes.",

        "Well, we look at where they go in the human body, and I think we have a pretty good idea of that.",
        "Of course, our goal is - and a lot of what we do is to put anti-cancer drugs in them that - well, there's different goals, but that's one of the goals, is to put anti-cancer drugs in them and send them, you know, right to the tumor and hopefully no other place.",
        "But you can only do that to a certain degree.",
        "But we've actually been doing that.",
        "And there's another little company, Bind Biosciences, that Omid Farokhzad, one of my former fellows who's now a professor at Harvard Med School and I help start, and you know, so they're actually treating patients with cancer right now in clinical trials.",
        "What is the most underfunded, under-researched area of science and engineering or technology that could really use a boost?",
        "Well, I think all areas are underfunded, and I think they all need a boost, especially they need a boost, you know, starting today or tomorrow.",
        "So I think it's, you know, science is just such an important thing.",
        "It drives what we - what the whole country does technologically and the whole world.",
        "So I - and I don't know that you can cite a specific area.",
        "I mean some people might like to.",
        "But the fact is, is sometimes it's the areas that we don't even realize right now what discoveries are going to be made."

        "Thanks for calling.",

        "And as I mentioned, we're also working on new kinds of microchips that you could implant and actually regulate them by remote control.",
        "And I do think the opportunity to combine these things are there, though right now they all, you know, have a lot of technological hurdles on their own, so you want to solve the easier problems first, which is to do them individual and get them to the point where they're really helping people.",
        "And then maybe once you get there, they certainly could be combined.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And how would you control where it goes?",
        "Well, what we've done is - with nanoparticles what we've done is put certain type of arrowhead on them and those arrowheads could be designed, depending on, let's say the cell's receptors that you're trying to go to.",
        "So there are certain receptors, for example, on some types of tumors and there are certain receptors on some types of blood vessels, for example.",
