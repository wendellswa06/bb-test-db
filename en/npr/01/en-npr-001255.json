        "So the question is, what's in it?",
        "Now, it's interesting.",
        "The Chinese - if you look at the Chinese writings, they talk about having a safe distance between missiles of approximately a mile when they're in the tunnel complex.",
        "So if you said, oh, there was one mile between missiles, and I got 3,000 miles of missiles - 3,000 miles of tunnels, then that does raise the question of whether there would be a larger number than we have seen or believe.",
        "My own personal belief is they have a lot of reloads.",
        "That is that you have a missile launcher and that same missile launcher - just like us and the Russians in the old Cold War - one launcher could fire several conventional missiles.",
        "It could also fire several nuclear missiles.",
        "And that's - and it's that uncertainty, that question that then - and it's not going to go away.",
        "I mean, people can yell at me and they have, but it's only going to get worse as China builds up its force and more attention is given to the tunnels.",
        "So we're going to have to get into a negotiation with them and say, OK, guys, you know, do you really want to pursue this?",
        "What can we do to constrain it?",
        "What can we do have better confidence?",
        "And I'm sure they're going to ask stuff of us, so we ought to be willing to offer stuff to them as well."
