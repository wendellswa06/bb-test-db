        "So, this listener had good credit before she came to America.",
        "Does that make any difference to her credit history here or does she have to start over from scratch?",
        "We're talking with Phillip Karber, government professor at Georgetown University, who led a team that researched underground tunnels where China hides its nuclear weapons.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, coming to you from NPR News.",

        "And they're going to wave this report in their hands.",
        "That's true.",
        "There's that effect, and there's also the effect of people who have built a host of assumptions about what the Chinese have.",
        "One of the arguments that they have such as small stockpile is the argument that they haven't produced enough fissile material.",
        "Plutonium or highly-enriched uranium.",
        "If you look at that - those assumptions, those assumptions assume that they stopped producing in 1991, and in the last 20 years have not produced any enriched-uranium.",
        "Those assumptions assume that the Chinese have produced a small amount of plutonium for their military but have not converted any civilian plutonium of which they have - should have a lot, given all the civilian reactors.",
        "Not one ounce of that has been converted to the military, and yet you can't account for where it is.",
        "So - and I'm not saying they have.",
        "I'm not saying they have anymore warheads than the minimum.",
        "But the evidence is a lot more ambiguous than it is commonly portrayed.",
        "So - and my argument is, we ought to be engaging them and trying to get them to be a little more explicit.",
        "As you know, your critics say, some of those estimates you used were based on long debunked Web postings, some, in fact, based on an estimate by an American Naval aide back, I think, about 30 years ago.",
        "There's a whole bunch of estimates.",
        "So these are sort of - I think, frankly, that specific argument is very much of a cheap shot and sort of (unintelligible), but so let me sort of address it.",
        "If you go back to early 1990s, the National Resources Defense Council produced a great book.",
        "I actually wrote a very positive review of it on Chinese, British and French nuclear forces.",
        "And in that book, they said, oh, they could have around 700 in their inventory.",
        "The leading Chinese - the leading scholar on China's nuclear development, John Lewis, said about the same time they had as many nuclear weapons - that he had been told by the Chinese - has many nuclear weapons as both the French and the British combined.",
        "The Russian general staff in 1995 published a report that said they had 2,000 nuclear weapons.",
        "And the Russians know them better than just about anybody because they gave them much of the technology for their reactors, and they've been targeting them.",
        "So there's - so 15 to 20 years ago, people were talking about a force that was anywhere from twice to five times larger than the number we currently have, we currently estimate.",

        "And that's a legitimate question that needs to be addressed and not just treated as a demagogic issue.",
        "Again, I'm not making a claim, and certainly our research didn't say, oh, you know, yes, there's these all these weapons.",
        "But it is not illegitimate to go through and address various estimates.",
        "And by the way, the number that's sort of contentious, this 2,350, is the number that's used on Chinese - China's mainline encyclopedia or the online encyclopedia, which would be like their Wikipedia.",

        "We're probably not going to get the answer.",
        "One of the things we found, Neal, that's really interesting is the Chinese had built a nuclear reactor, 21 kilometers of tunnels under a mountain.",
        "We knew nothing about it.",
        "It sat there for 25 years unused.",

        "So I think the student research is responsible in the sense of raising this issue, and then people can sit down and discuss it.",
