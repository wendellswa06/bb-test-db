        "So, it depends on how much other credit you have.",
        "It depends on how much credit you have outstanding.",
        "But if you put someone on an existing account and you pay all your bills going forward, on time, and you reduce the amount of credit, I would say, probably, in a year or two, maybe, you should be able to see your credit score rise to a level which will help you qualify for some of the best rates out there.",
