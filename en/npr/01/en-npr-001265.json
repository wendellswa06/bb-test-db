        "Thank you, good to be with you.",
        "And you've defined your campaign as being the candidate who wants to most limit the role of the federal government.",
        "You represent a coastal congressional district in Texas, yet you've consistently argued that we should slash FEMA, the federal agency responsible for responding to disasters.",
        "In the aftermath of a hurricane, you've repeated that.",
        "Yes, I just think it is a serious problem, and that's why I don't think we should let it be dealt with by bureaucrats in Washington because they don't have a very good record.",
        "A lot of people would like to paint myself with a brush that says if you don't want the federal government to do it, you don't want to solve the problem.",
        "But sometimes, you know, when the federal government gets involved, they don't do a very good job, and that is my point.",
        "Matter of fact, the federal government invites more problem by offering what they call insurance, but - you know, against flooding and wind.",
        "But the truth is, is it's no longer insurance if the government says they're always going to bail you out.",
        "So people who enjoy the benefits of living on the beach and close to the water really are guaranteed that their houses will be rebuilt, and they said, well, we can't get insurance otherwise.",
        "Well, they can't get it because - it's real expensive because it's very dangerous.",
        "So it's a matter of risk.",
        "And I think that's an objection that I've had.",
        "And besides, I've had more complaints about FEMA than any other agency, the whole time I've been in Congress, and I have a coastal district, and there's too many stories about what FEMA did down in, with Katrina.",
        "So there's so many arguments that that's the most - that's not the most efficient way to deal with a problem like natural disasters.",
        "Well, if FEMA does not provide disaster relief, who should?",
        "Well, who's FEMA?",
        "FEMA is the taxpayers, and it's debt.",
        "They're $20 billion in debt already.",
        "I think the states should do it.",
        "You know, when the - when Katrina was such a disaster, there were a lot of complaints that the Guard units for the states that were involved, many of their Guard unit people were overseas, you know, worrying about war disasters.",
        "Matter of fact, I think it would be better if they were home worrying about our kind of problems here at home.",
        "But I'd also bring some of the money home.",
        "See, I'm not opposed, under the conditions, because - I was opposed to the concept, even when it was imposed on us by an executive order, not by the Congress, but by executive order.",
        "But I've always said that, you know, once we get involved in a program, you just don't walk away from it if you can come up with another reason - another way of dealing with it."

        "So what I have said is, you know, why don't we cut $10 billion a month out of the war going on over in Afghanistan, which is a total disaster, put half of that toward the deficit and put half of it back into our infrastructure or for the needs of the people we have taught to be dependent and actually try to work our way out of this.",

        "And I don't know if you heard the news today, but President Obama has asked to address a joint meeting of Congress on the evening of September 7th, which coincidentally, according to the White House, happens to be the date of the next GOP presidential debate.",
        "Which event do you plan to attend?",
        "I hadn't thought much about it because I guess I heard about that just a few minutes ago.",

        "Congressman, the headline about a month ago or so was that Michele Bachmann wins the Iowa straw poll with very little mention that Ron Paul finished closely behind her.",
        "And the other headline was that Tim Pawlenty drops out of the race.",
        "Then the more recent headline was that Rick Perry is taking over Ron - uh, Mitt Romney's role as frontrunner.",
        "As a member of Congress from Texas, you've obviously had some dealings with Rick Perry, and of course we'll see Perry in the debate next week.",
        "But what's your sense of how do you - what's your relationship with Rick Perry, and how do you see him as a presidential candidate?",
        "Well, I think he's a formidable candidate.",
        "I mean, he's the governor of a big state.",
        "I don't agree with his politics.",
        "You know, the Tea Party people had a candidate running against him for governor, you know, last go-around, and she had no money and got 20 percent."

        "I don't believe in executive orders.",

        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",

        "I think Austrian economics has been vindicated, something that I have followed since the 1960s, because it was the Austrian economists that predicted that the Breton Woods Agreement, the monetary system, the gold standard, would break down, which it did in August of 1971.",
        "So yes, if you understand Austrian economics, you can anticipate bubbles.",
        "You can't tell when the crisis actually will hit because there's other things that determine the precise timing, but we do know that if you run up debt and print money that the dollar will lose value, and it will wipe out the middle class eventually, and that is what I fear we're facing.",
        "That's why I'm such a - so determined to try to pay for the things that we do, whether it's a war or whatever.",

        "By 2007, they were committing over 300 acts of terrorism against Americans or allies of Americans.",
