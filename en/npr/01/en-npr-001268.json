        "Right.",
        "No, they're increasing but not as much as prescription drug overdose deaths.",
        "And what are the numbers like?",
        "Well, every - over the past few years, there's been about 12,000 prescription drug deaths involving prescription pain drugs and anti-anxiety drugs and closer to 4,000 each for heroin and cocaine.",
        "And as you look at those deaths by prescription drugs, they seem - well, prescription drugs have become underground drugs, too.",
        "You can buy Oxycontin from drug dealers.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I've been out on undercover drug-buy stings where undercover Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have purchased Vicodin, Oxycontin, drugs like that, right out on the street.",
        "This was a few blocks south of City Hall, very near my newspaper, a place I'd walked before and didn't realize it was an open-air drug market.",
        "And it's also a place where, in the past, illegal drugs have been sold.",
        "And some people might think the problem is mostly teenagers, who either buy those drugs from open-air markets or pilfer them from their parents' medicine cabinets.",
        "Yeah, and that's what I thought when we first started looking into this.",
        "But as it turns out, when we backed up and looked at the death statistics that are collected by the government, most of the deaths occur among people in middle age, and some of the greatest increases in overdose deaths in the past five to 10 years are among people even older than that, in their 60s."

        "Why?",
        "Well, I think - we don't know all the reasons, and there's a lot of research going on in this area now, but one of the reasons is that middle-aged people are on a lot of pain and anxiety drugs.",
        "They've got aches and pains, they've had, you know, surgeries, on-the-job injuries, things like that, and so they're taking these drugs.",
        "And so the drugs are available, but why do they overdose?",
        "Any number of reasons.",
        "We've seen a lot of cases where people start out with a workplace injury innocently enough and become dependent or actually addicted on the drugs and ultimately take too many.",
        "We've seen cases in this older age group especially, we've seen some cases of women in their 60s also taking the drugs for pain who made the mistake of taking doses too closely together, and that was enough to cause their death.",
        "And there's also combinations of drugs.",
        "Sometimes doctors aren't aware that a patient is getting one kind of medication and prescribes something else for another condition, and then the two drugs interact.",
        "Yeah, we see that.",
        "We see people on - a lot of these deaths are poly-drug deaths, where we somebody who's on at least one pain drug, which are called opioids, they're synthetic versions of heroin.",
        "Then they'll be on an anti-anxiety drug, a benzodiazepine, like a Valium or a Xanax.",
