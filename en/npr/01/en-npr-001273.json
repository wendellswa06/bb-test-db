        "The crisis lead countries around the world to rethink their use of nuclear energy.",
        "In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel last week reversed course.",
        "She imposed a moratorium on nuclear power and says she hopes to phase it out for good.",
        "In this country, the U.S.",
        "Nuclear Regulatory Commission has announced a safety review of all American nuclear power reactors, but President Obama remains a supporter of nuclear power, touting it as a relatively clean energy source that will help cut down on the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Still, the crisis in Japan raises the question: Should this country go without nuclear power?",
        "And if it did, what would fill the gap?",
        "Later in the hour, with pressure rising across the Middle East, what's at stake in Yemen?",
        "But first, should the U.S.",
        "live without nuclear energy?",
        "Give us a call.",

        "Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "First, can you just establish for us how significant is nuclear energy in this country?",
        "Nuclear energy supplies roughly 20 percent of U.S.",
        "electricity, so that's a big share.",
        "It's roughly equivalent to the amount supplied by natural gas and about half of the amount supplied by coal.",
        "Their balance is made up mostly by hydro-electricity and also by renewables like wind and solar.",
        "The one part of the economy where nuclear isn't a player is, of course, in transportation, which makes up a huge fraction of our energy demands.",
        "Right.",
        "So am I correct, 104 nuclear power plants in the U.S.?",
        "That's correct.",
        "One hundred and four nuclear power plants.",
        "The last one came online in 1996, but the last one to be approved for new construction was in the late 1970s."

        "And you said the last one approved was in the '70s?",
        "So I'm hearing Three Mile Island - was that kind of a big factor in our energy - nuclear policy?",
        "It's tricky to disentangle the pieces.",
        "Nuclear was already on its way down before Three Mile Island.",
        "Costs were going up, both to build the plants and to finance that construction.",
        "Might those costs have come down in the 1980s?",
        "Perhaps.",
        "We'll never know because Three Mile Island really killed off nuclear, and killed off public appetite for nuclear, while cost was already doing it in.",
        "And that's going to be a question now again.",
        "We've still not resolved the cost question.",
        "So if we sort out the safety side, we still don't know whether people will want to build these.",
        "But now the Bush administration had hoped to increase use of nuclear power and President Obama has invested funds to expand it further.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "There has been growing interest in nuclear power across the political spectrum.",
        "Republicans have traditionally been enthusiastic about nuclear and President Bush's position reflects that.",
        "Democrats have become increasingly positive toward nuclear because of their concern about climate change.",
        "We have a variety of options, of possibilities down the road, for zero carbon, zero emissions generation.",
        "But right now nuclear is the only one that's established at scale and at a cost comparable to fossil fuels.",
        "And so President Obama, along with a lot of other moderate Democrats, has turned to nuclear as a significant part of their climate change strategy.",
        "I don't see these people as being particularly enthusiastic about nuclear, but they've increasingly come to be able to live with it.",
        "And 8.3 billion in funds just last year for two reactors in Georgia.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "What's...",
        "So the U.S.",
        "government provides support for nuclear power in a variety of ways.",
        "The most prominent is a backstop on insuring the reactors and loan guarantees that provide some insulation from risk in financing these plants.",
        "There's so much risk in construction and cost escalation, but also in regulatory challenges and in public approval, that in order at least to get a few plants out there, the government decided that it needed to provide these backstops."

        "The idea was to demonstrate that plants could be built and then to take off the training wheels, as it were, and allow the industry to grow on its own.",
        "But there are a variety of other supports.",
        "Nuclear is eligible for a small but non-trivial tax credit for production for the first eight years that the plant operates.",
        "And there are other pieces, particularly on the research and development side, in helping develop next generation technologies that might be safer and more resistant to nuclear proliferation.",
        "So how many new plants then are kind of in the works, and where would they be built if that happens?",
        "I don't know.",
        "That's a tough question.",
        "I mean, the plant in Japan was 40 years old, to my knowledge, and as Mr. Levi said, the last plant commissioned in the States was in the '70s, so you're approaching that limit.",
        "But concrete itself, roughly speaking, is about 60 years.",
        "So what happens to the concrete?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We have talked to many, many - again, it's the mothers, as it happens, and in one case a father, as well, a man named Bob Pack out here in California.",
        "But there's lots of parents of kids who die, teenagers, who are shocked at the ease with which their children were able to get drugs either from doctors or on the street or what they call a rainbow or Skittles party where kids will throw drugs into a bowl and take a handful.",
        "And they're very shocked, and they're trying to bring attention to this issue, and they're working with state lawmakers and people in Washington.",

        "Obviously, there's a combination of things that improve car safety, too, and it's not going to be one magic bullet.",
        "But you may think it's apples and oranges; cars and traffic accidents and prescription drugs, but both things are necessary to our society.",
        "You're not going to control the supply side by banning it.",
        "People are going to need prescription drugs for good purposes.",
        "Precisely, and I think that's one of the reasons why - we weren't the first to make the comparison between drug deaths and traffic accident deaths.",
        "Public health officials with the CDC and others have been looking at these too, kind of trend lines of, you know, sort of large numbers of preventable deaths, as they've been coming together for several years.",
        "And you're right.",
        "I mean, it's ironic.",
        "It's - in a way that you've got these technologies, you know, one that helps us all be mobile and the other one that helps us live with pain, but there is a downside and a risk to using both.",
        "We're talking with Lisa Girion of the Los Angeles Times about a recent story that she's been doing on the problems posed by prescription drugs.",
        "We'd like to hear from health care people, those of you who work in health care - pharmacists, doctors, nurses and people involved in dispensing these drugs.",

        "What I wanted to comment about was I have several physicians who are clients of mine; I have a counseling practice, and both the emergency room physicians have expressed the same problem, which is that they're under pressure in the situation that they're in, and they're graded in a certain way on their performance, which includes patient feedback.",
        "So they'll get clients, patients coming in who are drug-addicted, on Oxycontin, other drugs like you've mentioned, and will press for the drugs.",
        "They're under a lot of time pressure.",
        "They have a lot of people to see.",
        "If they spend the time discouraging that patient, it ends up scoring negatively against them.",
        "So they feel a high degree of pressure to write the prescription, to get rid of the drug-seeker so they can go on and treat the people who really need help and also to keep themselves from being in a place where they could lose their position because they're getting negative scores against them from drug-seeking patients.",
        "And I'm sure that you put it that way and people think, well, gee, that's hardly ethical, and they're not supposed to be giving drugs to addicts.",
        "Yeah, absolutely true, hardly - not ethical, but on the other hand, if your family's well-being is based on your ability to maintain that job, there's a lot of pressure for you to not get those negative scores, and there's no incentive in the system for you doing the right thing.",
        "Both the physicians who see me do the right thing every night, and it's exhausting them, but they're surrounded by physicians who don't.",
        "So they get excessive pressure because the other physicians in the system are writing those prescriptions.",
        "They're fighting against the tide, and they're risking their professional standing to do so.",
        "Douglas, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",

        "Yeah, I think that's true.",
        "I think there are circumstances where physician performance is graded, and part of that may be patient satisfaction-dependent.",
        "And I think that one of the things we've learned in kind of understanding how pay-for-performance and those kinds of incentives work is that it isn't always necessarily about making the patient happy."
