        "I'm a labor and delivery nurse, and what I have noticed out of my years, things that would reduce it is better evaluation of mental health status of some of the patients.",
        "Because we tend to get some patients who abuse and also share those drugs and have come across problems while being on those prescription drugs.",
        "So better mental health evaluation.",
        "How does that help?",
        "Well, for - I mean, I actually do some of that evaluation.",
        "What I found is that patients, when they're not having pain anymore, but they have that medicine on-hand, they tend to take that to help to sleep.",
        "It gives them a stable mood, some of them, like the Vicodin.",
        "I've had patients confess that when they've been depressed, they've taken those medicines also so that they can alleviate some of the bad feelings that they're having, and they're not being evaluated for the mental health.",
        "So I'll make those referrals, but they'll still sometimes abuse those medications for that reason.",
        "Lisa Girion, is that something you found in your work?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "We have seen a lot of cases where there was some kind of mental health issue going on and potentially some psychiatric drugs onboard, along with the pain drugs.",
        "And so - and I think there's a lot of active research in that area, the extent to which mental health problems either cause or have something to do with addiction and overdose.",

        "So part of it is having these take-back days.",
        "It's actually very tricky to get rid of these drugs because you can't bring it to the doctor's office and have them get rid of them.",
        "That's actually against DEA regulations because then the clinician is viewed as serving as a drug dispensary, essentially, and most clinics aren't equipped to do that.",
        "The other thing that we have really encouraged is for people to store these drugs safely, so the use of lock boxes.",
        "You know, treat these drugs like they're cash because they really are.",
        "One of these pills can fetch, you know, staggering amounts of money, and people need to be aware of that.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "That's where it comes from.",
        "People tend to keep these drugs around if they don't finish them, and because they're prescribed by doctors and come to you in the orange pharmacy vials, kids tend to think that you can take them, get high, have your fun, and it's all going to be OK.",

        "They're the ones writing the numbers on it.",
        "If I see a number that I don't like, I can call and ask about it, but ultimately it's up to the doctor to fill that or not, or to approve it.",
        "If I have a patient there in pain, I want to help them, and if they have a legit, legal prescription from a doctor, then I'm inclined to fill it.",
        "If I suspect wrongdoing or any other things, I can refuse but at the sacrifice of the patient not getting their pain control, possibly becoming violent because they're not getting their prescriptions, which has happened with people, you know, getting fed up and wanting their pain meds now.",
        "Dr.",
        "Chou, should patient - should doctors be working more closely with pharmacists?",
        "Yeah, I think we should be.",
        "And one of the initiatives that we think may help with this is what we call prescription drug monitoring programs.",
        "So one of the problems that happens is that patients will go from ER to ER or from doctor to doctor and get - obtain multiple prescriptions, which is dangerous because each doctor doesn't know what the other one is prescribing, number one.",
        "And then, you know, the patient is exposed to a lot of different drugs all at once.",
        "So these prescription drug monitoring programs will be able to tell physicians and pharmacists when patients are getting prescriptions from multiple providers.",
        "The problem is that the monitoring programs have been somewhat fragmented, meaning that they're on a state-by-state basis.",
        "So like, for example, here in Portland, as a Portland doctor, I don't have access to the Washington system, and for those who know the area, Portland's right next to Washington state.",
        "It's not very hard for someone to cross the state border to get these drugs.",
        "And I think many of us believe that a more integrated, national-level system would be one way to help prevent some of these deaths.",
        "Many of these deaths are related to this doctor shopping."

        "So they're not well used, and the studies that I've seen that have looked at overdose mortality in states that have prescription drug monitoring programs have found that so far, they haven't been effective in bringing the death rate down.",
        "So it's an idea, but I think it's one where the experts believe there's room for a lot of improvement.",
        "On the pharmacy side, I've seen a whole range of responses from pharmacists.",
        "We've seen everything from pharmacists who won't take prescriptions from doctors that they believe are passing bad prescriptions.",
        "They just - you know, and a lot of times the big chains will do that.",
        "Some pharmacists will actually report doctors who they think are passing out bad prescriptions - you know, too-high doses, that kind of thing - to medical boards.",

        "Yeah, and I just wrote a story about a case in L.A.",
        "about a month ago where the pharmacist is accused of giving a list of customers' names to an allegedly, you know, dirty doctor who just wrote prescriptions to the names and sent them back to the pharmacy to be filled by this drug distribution ring that actually smuggled them into Mexico where they were sold to people from San Diego at border pharmacies.",

        "So we need to be trained better at learning and understanding when we need to stop these medications.",

        "And I think it's absolutely right that we - at this time we lack resources to do that effectively in a lot of cases.",
        "It's - these programs can be expensive, and many patients who need them can't get into them or can't afford them.",
