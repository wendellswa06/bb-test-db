        "And I think within a month or two after the latest version of OxyContin came out, I was hearing from addicts and from law enforcement folks that they had figured out a way to defeat it.",
        "And I won't tell your readers or your listeners how to do that.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "But - I won't share that, but they've figured it out.",
        "Here's another email.",
        "This from Mo(ph).",
        "As a veteran who receives benefits at the local VA, I've been personally affected by this problem.",
        "I have chronic pain in my lower back from a congenital problem exacerbated by injuries.",
        "However, on the one or two times a year I have a particularly painful flare up and need real pain control measures, I am denied effectively strong pain control simply on the basis that in the distant past I reported my alcohol intake as moderate and that I suffer from depression.",
        "I understand, statistically I may be at risk for abuse, but my particular history includes no abuse of these or other medications, no alcoholism.",
        "Yet I spend 10 to 15 days a year in pure, senseless and avoidable misery.",
        "I hope there's a solution for this soon too.",
        "And Dr. Chou, people in pain like that, as you've said earlier, they think that this is the solution.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think this is the really tough situation where, you know, we know that these drugs can be dangerous.",
        "We know that they're not super-effective.",
        "I mean on average, you know, people think of opioids as super-powerful pain drugs, but on average you're talking about a 20 or 30 percent pain relief for chronic pain at least, which is not very high compared to what we can get for post-surgical or other types of acute pain.",
        "So they're not perfect drugs by any means, but there are people who might benefit from them.",
        "And the challenge is trying to figure out, you know, how to prescribe them.",
        "We need to do a better job of assessing the patient for their risk.",
        "I think earlier people had - somebody had brought up the issue of psychological problems and how those can predict possible problems with these medications.",
        "And there's other risk factors that we need to train doctors to better look for and to better deal with.",
        "And we can prescribe the drugs in many patients, but we need to be able to structure our care so that it matches what their risk profile is, meaning that if somebody does have some risk factors, we need to be able to do things like give limited numbers of pills, you know, monitor them, maybe do some urine drug testing, follow them up frequently, all those kinds of things that we need to do to be more safe at...",
        "Dr.",
        "Chou, can you stay with us?",
        "We're going to take a couple more question on this when we come back from a short break.",

        "Hi, Neal.",
        "I'm a public defender, and I find that 80 percent of the crimes that my clients are involved in are prescription-pill-driven.",
        "I always ask the judge at sentencing, when are we going to see a doctor in here?",
        "I mean, these are prescribed pills, and they are the most powerful, highly addictive drugs that are made, and they're prescribed again and again to apparently healthy people who have minor injuries or a tooth removed.",
        "I believe that's the seatbelt.",
        "These doctors should be easy to catch.",
        "And at least where I work, I have never seen a doctor who overprescribes prosecuted.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Well, Dr. Chou, should - I'm sure there have been cases, in fact I know there have been cases.",
        "Yeah, there certainly have been.",
        "And, you know, it's this thing, I think that you don't want to get into a situation where doctors aren't able to prescribe medications legitimately, which I think, you know, despite all the alarming data - and I don't think anybody denies that the data are very alarming - that most prescriptions are probably legitimate, and they're well-meaning, and they're done in people who have real pain, who we're really trying to help.",
        "So I don't think we want to lose sight of that.",
        "But I do think that, you know, there - that some clinicians have become rather cavalier about prescribing these drugs.",
        "There was a perception that they were safe.",
        "This was fueled in part by the belief that things like OxyContin and the long-acting drugs were going to be safer and that we could prescribe them without worrying quite so much.",
        "But, you know ,we've had a long history of this with these medications.",
        "Heroin was actually developed as a less addicting form of morphine and was marketed as a cough suppressant when it first came out.",
        "So we've been trying to figure out non-addicting types of opioids for a long time.",
        "We need to be smarter about how we use these drugs and, like I said before, how we assess the patients and how we monitor them and take them off the drugs when they're not benefiting from them.",
        "Lisa Girion, not only do you have people taking the OxyContin, which is supposed to release its pain medication slowly over a period of time, and crushing it and, as you said, snorting it and getting everything at once, there's also been abuse now of fentanyl, which is presented in a patch.",
        "Right.",
        "Fentanyl patches come in at least three doses, as far as I'm aware.",
        "But it is 100 times more powerful than morphine, so it's very, very powerful.",
        "It was developed for cancer pain, for breakthrough cancer pain.",
        "And because it's for cancer and people who are - could be very sick and nauseous and unable to hold medication down, it comes in a patch form.",
        "And it also comes in lollipops.",
        "And we have seen several deaths, many deaths where people die with one, two, three, up to five fentanyl patches on their bodies, and it just knocks people out.",
        "Here's an email from Meria(ph) - I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly - in Castro Valley, California.",
        "I have chronic back pain and work in health care.",
        "I have repeatedly asked for non-medication interventions, including acupuncture and chiropractic, because I have firsthand experience with addicted patients.",
        "But my insurance will not cover these.",
        "We need better coverage for alternative therapies.",
        "And, Dr. Chou, is that something that doctors could lobby on too?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, the chronic pain, as I alluded to earlier, is a really complicated phenomenon where there's a lot of psychosocial kind of aspects to it, meaning that people can have the same degree of damage on an X-ray when you look at their back, but one person's pain can be much, much worse than another person's.",
        "And so addressing these psychosocial factors like depression, like how to cope with pain, how to relax when you're having pain, using some of these other alternative types of therapies like exercise and manipulation, all of those things, we think are really part of how to best treat chronic pain and may reduce the use of opioids substantially.",
        "The problem is many insurance companies don't cover them or these programs aren't always available and so - yes - making these better, more available, I think, would be a great step forward."

        "Lisa Girion, one reason they don't cover them is they say there's no evidence that they work.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, it's interesting because, in the workers' compensation system in California, which just underwent sort of a wrenching reform overhaul, one of the things that was curtailed was chiropracty and there are some people who believe - like who study the system - believe that we've seen an escalation in the use of opioids, pain killers, to treat injuries, you know, joint injuries, back injuries; that kind of thing, whereas in the past, those people would have spent more time with chiropractors or in physical therapy, that kind of thing.",
        "And so those limitations are pushing people onto pills and that's creating its own set of problems.",

        "Dr.",
        "Chou, I assume that would be when they don't necessarily see the patient in the office.",
        "Well, and part of it also is that people aren't always - you know, our mantra is for people to start low and go slow, that there's no rush to get somebody to, you know, high doses of opioids and - yes - there are many factors that can affect how people metabolize their opioids, including, you know, weight, size and kidney function and liver function and what other drugs they're taking.",
        "And so, yes, people need to be really careful.",
        "The other aspect that hasn't been mentioned is that some of these drugs are actually pretty tricky to use.",
        "Methadone, in particular, has become a widely used opioid because it's inexpensive and long-acting, but its pharmacology is quite complicated.",
        "It's a very long-acting drug and we actually think that there are overdoses occurring because people are starting them and then going up on them too quickly.",
        "So there's certainly some education that needs to be done for providers in terms of how to prescribe these drugs more safely.",
        "Well, thanks very much for being with us today.",
