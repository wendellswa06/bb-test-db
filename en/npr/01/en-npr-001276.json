        "And one of the things that you do on your Web site is that you use, as you put it, cool online tools.",
        "Yes.",
        "Is the Web good now?",
        "Is it a very useful tool for teaching?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Tell us what you do.",
        "Absolutely, and I would go as far as to say if a teacher is not using the Internet in their classroom in some manner, then they're failing their students.",
        "So one of the things that I use in my classroom, the first thing that I use is a blog, and our blog is called \"\"Extreme Biology.\"\" And what the students do is they communicate with each other about what they're passionate about in biology.",
        "So rather than me telling them exactly what they need to learn, instead, they're given an option to pick what topic in biology they find fascinating and what they want to share with their peers.",
        "And as you said, you know, typical science classes, yeah, they tend to be boring because you're learning about what has already been discovered, and students hate that."

        "That's one of them.",
        "Actually, we have actual - several sites.",
        "But I'm on this one.",
        "What's interesting about this is you have a topic called adaptation and acquired characteristic, and one of your students asks a question: I was reviewing the test - I was reviewing for the test, having trouble discerning between adaptation and acquired characteristic.",
        "Can someone help me out, please?",
        "And it wasn't you who helped out, it was a student, right?",
        "Yes, yes, oh, absolutely.",
        "That came on and explained the whole thing, and then you came back and said that's perfect.",
        "I know, it's wonderful.",
        "It's a wonderful example of what I'm trying to do in my class, which is have a peer-review process where the students themselves are working.",
        "Rather than having it being teacher-focused and I'm just up in front of the classroom just lecturing away, it's student-focused, and the students themselves are helping each other learn.",
        "And then they also see that I'm part of the learning community.",
        "So when they're picking blog-post topics to write about, they - they're informing me about new discoveries in science and in biology that I'm not aware of.",
        "Would they not - I mean, to me, you know, kids are blogging all the time.",
        "They see this as - it's like growing up with it, right?",
        "It's a natural part of life.",
        "But in classes, they probably just are afraid to raise their hand, answer a question.",
        "Does this help them speak up where they might not have spoken up in a classroom situation?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And it's really great because it allows for a lot of individuality and creative expression for each particular student to get the limelight for a little bit of time and really - or the spotlight and really have everyone focus on them for a moment, and it really makes them feel special."
