        "I mean, if you actually ask any group of people, when did they last look at the encyclopedia, probably this year.",
        "But if you ask them did they look at Google, Wikipedia or YouTube, all the hands go up.",
        "So we must look at that and say how can we optimize our education program in the future?",
        "Stacy Baker, as a high school teacher, can you make use of these lessons and things on a site like that?",
        "I actually went to the Web site, and I will say that a number of the presentations that are on there are pretty interesting, and I especially like the ones that Harry Kroto himself has made.",
        "You have a really entertaining presentation style.",
        "…before you get that?",
        "Sure.",
        "Is there a 60-year-old plant in the world, in the U.S.?",
        "As I was listening to them, I was sort of sitting on the edge of my seat and lifting up on my toes because I was very excited by what you were talking about.",
        "One of the things I thought was most interesting, though, is when you have the undergraduate students and the graduate students making these videos themselves, they're, in a way, learning how to better communicate their scientific ideas to the public.",
        "And I think - so it's benefitting them, as well.",
        "I think that's the big surprise.",
        "I never expected it.",
        "I just sort of asked my honors class to do a little five to eight-minute presentation, each of them, and I gave them one-third the marks on it, and it was fantastic.",
        "They all rose to the occasion, and some of them are just superb.",
        "And what's more, they ferreted out information that you would not think about, that wouldn't be there by some big sort of centralized program.",
        "We can get our young people to scour the universe of science and technology, many other things, and they do the work.",
        "And not only that, they don't really need to be experienced teachers because the enthusiasm comes through.",
        "The material is there.",
        "It's brilliant, and I'm so pleased with them.",
        "Francis Eberle, do you think that the Internet is offering us new opportunities in education here?"

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I think it provides a terrific resource, and I think you can see that with the videos that are made available here, and we were just talking about.",
        "There's also a whole range of data sets that students can use to go into and look for trends and patterns, and it allows a way for us to communicate - and students to communicate to each other in ways we've never had in the past.",
        "So it really is quite remarkable if it can be incorporated into a classroom setting - or even maybe that's perhaps the wrong way to say it - you know, learning situation where you can have students and teachers interact, and it's in an area or a space that isn't in a traditional classroom.",
        "Yeah, and not only are the graduate students, undergraduate students of Harry Kroto's classes working, but the junior high and high school kids in Stacy Baker's classes are creating their own videos.",
        "I'm looking at one now called \"\"The La Cucaracha Lab.\"\" It says: I'm so proud of my students who fearlessly completed a lab with the giant Madagascar hissing cockroach.",
        "Right, Stacy?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I learned when I moved to New York that there is no greater fear in New Yorkers than that of cockroaches.",
        "It was actually quite a fun experience for my students.",
        "Yeah, so we did this lab with giant Madagascar hissing cockroaches, and you know, we don't just keep it in the classroom now.",
        "We get to put it and publish it online in a video and in a blog post, and my students have already left some comments about that particular activity that people can read and comment to, as well.",
        "So yeah, it's definitely a great research.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think one of the things we often forget is that learning is a social activity.",
        "So when we, you know, isolate students or put them in separate areas where they have to think just to themselves and communicate to the teacher or to us in some framework, we're losing a lot of opportunities.",
        "And so what Stacy's done in the sense of - by putting the blog there, she allows students to interact from their own perspective and to develop their ideas with each other.",
        "And so that's a really terrific, terrific step.",

        "Hi there, go ahead.",
        "I had a question for Stacy.",
        "A friend of mine developed 25 videos, which is a full year of biology.",
        "He's a 28-year science teacher here in Texas, and he has used music in the classroom along with hands-on and audio to get kids engaged in Texas, and it's really improved our science TEKS scores, which is our standardized test.",
        "So I wondered, for the folks that are on your end, what their view is of using these types of videos in the classroom.",
        "Oh, I think it's fantastic what it sounds like he's doing.",
        "Is he putting them up on YouTube for everybody to see?",
        "They are on YouTube.",
        "You can look under Virtual Science University, and it will show you the videos.",
        "There's everything from videos on osmosis to the human skeleton, lots of really interesting and creative songs that he wrote specifically to science topics.",
        "Yeah, that sounds great.",
        "I've always thought that the person who benefits the most out of those types of tools is the person who's making them.",
        "So I think definitely having - inspiring others to make their own videos.",
        "So that's exactly what he's going to be doing - especially when he puts them up on YouTube - and anyone in the whole world can go access them, is he's actually inspiring, not just now his own students, but everybody who sees those videos.",
        "So I think that's a great reflection of what's being done now.",
        "Thanks for calling, Arlene.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Harry, what advantage does something like GEOSET have over YouTube of Wikipedia?",
        "That's the important part.",
        "What we have is a jewel sort of system in which there is a video of the teacher teaching, plus their material.",
        "So we see the material, and it's downloadable.",
        "So - but it's also just a concept module.",
        "It's not a whole presentation.",
        "It's something that a teacher can lift essentially directly out of the site and use directly or refine it themselves."

        "The second thing is I think that a lot more people who are actually practicing scientists should either, you know, in part, you know, be brought in periodically because there's nothing better than a really enthusiastic scientist to talk about her or his experiences in the classroom, if they're good at reaching kids.",

        "And they're looking into the possibility of making it available so that we can download the software to anywhere in the world so that they can make the little video and put their PowerPoint or other data sets in there.",

        "I would like to see those little tricks that they had developed to make - get me engaged in science.",

        "Let me ask all of you, beginning with Francis Eberle.",
        "But can these tools, can these videos take the place of a teacher who's not prepared as a science teacher?",
        "So many science teachers are not prepared to be science teachers."

        "That's a really great question.",

        "So that if some of us want to listen quietly by ourselves and then talk with others, some - wants to - you want to use that format, that you use that format in a classroom setting, that perhaps that works too.",

        "What does a teacher orchestrate that you couldn't necessarily produce in the video?",
        "And I think it's a very challenging thing in our time right now because of what we can do using the video.",
        "So, I think one of the things we have to keep in mind in - both of these tool are very effective - is that the question, though, that the issue that teachers continually work on or struggle with, I mean, we just did a survey which sort of confirmed this, or did confirm this, is overwhelming there.",
