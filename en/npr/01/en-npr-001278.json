        "And we need to really enable them to teach as well as we can.",
        "And the point about this is that I - with my - the GEOSET approach I thought was set up here at FSU and they're now moving out to other places, we really do recognize that the teacher is the conduit through which that information should be sent.",
        "Of course, the kids can watch it as well, but the teacher is there.",
        "And we're really aware that we can't bring them in all the time to long distances to get these refresher courses.",
        "But we can actually now distribute the best teaching material produced in wherever it is in the world and make it accessible.",
        "Okay.",
        "Good…",
        "Now, I'll be quiet.",

        "I grab great stuff on the Web wherever it is and insert it in a concept-module way into my lectures.",
        "And what I'm doing now is just trying to enable teachers wherever they are in the world to put their own material up there.",
        "And I think we're getting there and we're achieving it very well.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I think it's a challenge of our time because one is a resource issue, one is a time issue and training issue.",
        "And I absolutely agree with both Stacy and Harry's point that the teacher is key to leading and facilitating and organizing the ideas that are shared in a classroom.",
        "At the same time, you know, there is this wave of online courses.",
        "There are over a million courses offered online right now.",
        "Florida has, I think, it's over 200,000 high school students taking online courses.",
        "And I don't - I have no idea not knowing exactly what they're achieving in these courses.",
        "But it does raise the question, Ira, that you asked is, how does this fit?",
        "And so, that's why I was kind of continuing and saying so what is it we do as science educators that advances from a sort of traditional, you know, talking head in front of a classroom?"

        "And so, I get asked the question, well, how do they get through the content?",

        "They like different things.",
        "And what will happen is that as the year progresses and we're in, just, in class, you know, and I'll bring up, I don't know, just topics - photosynthesis or whatever - and a student, you know, will raise their hand and say, hey, that's like so and so's post about, you know, relating it somehow to the topic that we're discussing in class.",
        "So throughout the whole year, the student is picking different blogs.",
        "We actually get through enormous amount of content.",

        "And when I was teaching preschool science, even though I now do high school, I found them to be extraordinarily receptive and extraordinarily capable.",
        "And I saw that as sort of the stepping stone towards keeping their curiosity as they went along in school and also trying to keep them from deciding very early on in their lives that they were either a scientist or not a scientist.",
        "Were you successful in keeping their curiosity or have hints on how to keep that?",
        "Because we all - I think we do agree that kids are natural scientists when they're little.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…that's very tangible to the kids.",
        "And then in addition, I think that little kids, especially, they do really well combining non-fiction with fiction.",
        "So a lot of times I would read them picture books that had some kind of science theme and then would relate that to the real science.",
        "So read books about animals or read books about, you know, airplanes or whatever."
