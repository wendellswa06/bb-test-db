        "The other caller's point about the elementary science is right on.",
        "It's very important right now - it's always been somewhat of an issue - but with the current sort of systems that we have related to testing, that science really has moved off of many elementary science-in-schools' agendas.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And we really see that all across the country and the reduction in time during the week.",
        "But it's really unfortunate because, again, as has been said before, young children and even moving through at all levels - you know, what got all of us into science is that, you know, there's a wonderment and excitement to it.",
        "There's a, you know, the sense of discovery and unknown.",
        "And we often forget, and even sometimes teachers, that students come in and they don't have the answer.",
        "So when we have it in our head, we're sort of guiding them in a particular direction, and they're looking at it with fresh eyes.",
        "And we have to find ways to help ourselves look at things with fresh eyes and bring them to it in a very open way, because, you know, they're always asking questions.",
        "And I think we have - we lose them by sort of saying, here's the answer.",
        "I was talking to a couple of teachers this week, and we were talking about experiments in classrooms.",
        "And I said, are there too many virtual experiments?",
        "I mean, you can go online and dissect frogs like you use to online, body parts or whatever.",
        "Stacy, are there - is - are we missing something?",
        "By having these online virtual spaces, you never get to do hands-on stuff.",
        "Well, this is just my personal opinion as a biology teacher.",
        "I definitely think the online virtual labs make it easier to do a multitude of labs, especially when you're - you have a lack of money, because it is very expensive to do lab - science labs.",
        "Right.",
        "And so, they are very helpful, but I don't think they take the place of an actual hands-on lab experiment at all.",
        "The cockroach lab that we just did would - had been an entirely different experience for the students if we had just done it virtually online.",
        "There would've been a lot less oohs in the classroom.",

        "I'll bet, yeah.",
        "Handling cockroaches - hands-on experience.",
        "Have you ever thought about doing a national kids experiment?",
        "In other words, I have thought of something as simple as having all the kids - everybody goes home in their home, and they take a little strip of their hair and they put it in a cellophane, Ziploc bag, they don't put their name on it and they mail it into a central experiment place.",
        "We get to see what's in everybody's hair and we graph it nationally, kinds of metals or whatever that's in there.",
        "And then the kids could be part of data collection, analysis.",
        "We get somebody involved who really knows how to analyze the data, a professional, so it becomes a real experiment.",
        "The kids are thinking their part of that.",
        "Does that sound like a good idea?",
        "Sort of, like…",
        "And then how far off would a missile like that be from reaching the mainland United States?",
        "I think - I actually think some programs do offer, you know, sort of citizen-watch type of experiments, sort of, to get people around the nation involved in the same type of experiment, maybe counting dragonflies in their backyard…",
        "Right.",
        "…or honeybees in their backyard.",
        "And now with all these online tools, we have a way to be able to centralize that data and, exactly, have access to it or anyone have access to it.",
        "So I think that's a great idea.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yes.",
        "I would agree.",
        "I think it's a great idea, too, in that you're collecting information and utilizing the technologies to new kinds of analysis.",
        "Now, maybe hair might not be the right item to collect, but I think that…",
        "How about mercury in your local fish store?",

        "Well, there are people who actually have gone to fish stores and looked at, you know, the sample and looked at DNA and find out…",
        "Right.",

        "Right.",
        "I remember that one.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, so - yeah, but, I mean, the thing about what we have now is that we have all kinds of tools that are available to us and that there was one I was involved with some - couple of years ago with high school students, and they were able to do bioinformatics analysis, look at genetic profiles of mice using the same online free tool the client - the actual scientist used.",

        "But this teacher-share idea - I think it's phenomenal (unintelligible) national standards.",

        "And it's been a dream of mine, but I haven't really known how to go about making it happen, to be able to - you know, some guy in San Antonio or maybe someone in California has a really great idea about a way to convey something that I'm required to teach, I would love to able to access that and use it in my own classroom.",
        "And - but the point that I've been told - they keep telling me this when I bring it up with people that are above me - is that because I am an employee of my, you know, my particular school system, anything I make, I'm contractually obligated to give up those intellectual rights to the county where I work.",
        "And they say that that becomes difficult for, you know, public school systems especially if they start sharing that kind of information, because the intellectual rights don't necessarily belong to the individual teachers.",
        "So I wanted to make that comment to you guys to see maybe what you had to say about that.",
        "Francis, any comment?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, the only thing I could - would say is that I'm not sure what your local contract would say, but there is a way to get a - what they call a creative commons copyright which allows anybody to access up to a certain point.",
        "You know, I don't know if that would fit with where you are, but that's what many people are using for sharing materials or even regulate published and copyrighted materials, books and so forth.",
        "That the - they put a creative commons license on it and that allows anybody to use it.",
        "But, yeah.",
        "I don't know about the history you have specifically in your district.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I assure you, it only happens if it's - if there's financial gain involved.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Harry, how can schools and universities get involved in your project?",
        "What should they do?",
        "Well, universities can usually afford better equipment, and that's why we're working, as I say, with Microsoft in one or two other ways in getting the software so I can download it to your - the last guest's name I've just forgotten - because he's just the person that we're looking at because he wants to share his expertise, I think altruistically, with other teachers or throughout the world who also want to share those two or three things.",
        "They're not going to write a textbook, they're not going to do this, but they've got some neat idea of explaining that works in the classroom.",
        "And we want that and we want to put it up.",
        "And they will actually be able to see it in cyberspace and therefore be used by people throughout the world.",
        "And I think within the next, sort of, month or so, we should have downloadable software to enable them to take a camera and then plug in the PowerPoints and have the whole little COMSAT module, which will fit into a curriculum wherever it is appropriate.",
        "And that's now - I think it's going to be de rigueur.",
