        "If we phase out nuclear for the United States over an extended period of time, we would be replacing it with generation that's not any more expensive.",
        "Now, nuclear that is already established and already out there is relatively cheap.",
        "What costs money is building the plants.",
        "The fuel is relatively inexpensive.",
        "So if you switch very rapidly, you're taking something that's close to free and replacing it with something that costs money.",

        "Well, I don't agree that it would be impossible.",
        "As was stated by the other speaker, it's a big chunk of our existing power supply - in fact, two-thirds of our non-CO2-emitting power supply.",
        "So it's not impossible, but it would have to be done as, as he said, gradually and phasing in a lot of renewable capacity.",
        "What would - if we had no nuclear power anymore in the U.S., 20 percent of out electricity no longer came from nuclear power, how would that impact carbon emissions?",
        "Well, depends what you replace it with.",
        "Right now we have a huge excess of natural gas generating capacity.",
        "In fact, the capacity factor, which is really how much a natural gas plant is used, on average in the States is somewhere around 22 percent.",
        "So that means we have this large amount of excess capacity - more than enough to make up for the current production of nuclear power.",
        "So the emissions would go up somewhere between five to six percent for the U.S.",
        "economy as a whole if we replaced all of nuclear with natural gas.",

        "We may have carbon capture and sequestration, where we take the emissions from coal and gas and bury them underground.",
        "Those may materialize at a reasonable cost and at a reasonable scale.",
