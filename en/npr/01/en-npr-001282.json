        "Tell us about that.",
        "There was already an alignment of political forces in Germany pushing things away from nuclear power.",
        "Germany has swung back and forth in its policy toward nuclear power over the years.",
        "That can be explained in substantial part because it has a Green Party that carries a lot of political weight, particularly given its peculiar parliamentary system.",
        "And so the chancellor was in some ways looking for an opportunity to move in a political season away from nuclear, and this provided her with an opportunity.",
        "You've seen in contrast with that, in France the public is generally pro-nuclear and the alternative options are quite limited because France already relies on nuclear for 80 percent of its electricity.",
        "There hasn't been a significant change and you wouldn't expect there to be one.",
        "And why - I'm just curious why France does rely on it so much.",
        "At what point was that decision made and was there not much opposition to it?",
        "I actually don't have a good answer for you on that.",
        "But the reason that France has been able to build that much nuclear is because it's essentially a state-run enterprise.",
        "So the risks and costs are socialized.",
        "You don't have the same problems of uncertainty and regulatory issues and financial issues that you do in this country.",
        "It's also been part of a broader industrial strategy.",
        "France is not into this only for domestic electricity production but also for exports of nuclear technology.",
        "All right.",

        "Even though that's a large number, we do have the natural gas backup existing and we do have the land mass to produce - wind essentially is the only thing that's near market.",
        "So I don't think it's wrong to consider phasing it out because these plants are getting old, and even if we started to full bore construct nuclear plants, could we keep up with the pace that the old ones have to be decommissioned?"

        "And analysts tend to assume - or have tended to assume that after 60 years these plants might actually be re-licensed for 20 years more.",
        "The lifetime matters a lot because a power plant, a nuclear plant, is very expensive to build.",
        "So the longer period of time you can spread that capital cost over, the lower the average price of electricity, the more competitive the plant.",
        "With age comes some other issues.",
        "There's a design issue.",
        "Newer designs tend to be better and safer.",
        "But there are also structural issues, and whatever the lifetime of concrete is in a normal situation, you also have exposure to radiation and to other corrosive chemicals that cause concerns and that are addressed in the re-licensing process.",
        "Right now with waste we do have a big issue.",
        "We have waste basically stored onsite in cooling pools like has been the case in Japan.",
        "And a lot of the attention in Japan has been focused on the safety of those spent fuel pools.",

        "In the interim we do have a prudent, sensible step we can take.",
        "We can rearrange the pools in order to make accidents less likely.",
        "And after a short period of cooling we can move spent fuel into what's called dry cast storage above ground, where fires are less likely and are easier to put out.",
        "That's been recommended for several years.",
        "It's been resisted.",
        "It is a relatively inexpensive step that we could take in the near term that has been done elsewhere in order to improve safety and provide at least a medium-term way of addressing the waste challenge."
