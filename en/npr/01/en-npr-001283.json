        "There is plenty of uranium out there.",
        "Look, we're going to run out of uranium sooner than we run out of the sun and the wind.",
        "But at current plans we are going to have economical resources of uranium for many decades.",
        "And we can move to recycling techniques which are unwise right now, by which might make sense considerably further down the road if we have limited resources.",
        "Obviously the amount available at a reasonable price will depend on how quickly the nuclear fleet grows.",

        "Also wind turbines and solar panels.",

        "And there's a lot of costs involved in nuclear that's never been touched.",
        "Frank Zeman.",
        "Well, it's a trick question, I think, because nobody actually knows what nuclear power costs, because the government - we all know how much waste disposal is going to cost yet; the government provides insurance at a discount.",
        "So - I mean, to get an actual cost for nuclear would be, I think, at best a guess at this point, so we don't really know.",
        "I mean, the wind turbines have the - and solar panels have the advantage of being mass produced.",
        "So you can build a factor that produces parts and they're shipped to the site.",
        "So I think it's doable.",
        "The cost - you know, solar panels tend to be, you know, three to four times the cost of wind.",
        "So it would probably be smarter to start with wind, but it's certainly doable.",
        "It's really above what people want to pay for and whether they want to see their power.",
        "The nice thing about nuclear power is you have a giant facility producing a gigawatt of electricity instead of 1,000 one-megawatt wind turbines on the landscape.",
        "So it's about what people want to see in some parts.",
        "Hmm.",

        "It's essentially impossible to do a head-to-head comparison, not necessarily for the reasons that Frank identifies, but because nuclear provides a different sort of power service from wind and solar.",
        "Nuclear provides what we call base load power, that's that consistent, steady level of power that you need at all times.",
        "Wind and solar provide what we call peeking power.",
        "So they provide inconsistent power that, if well-designed, delivers energy at times when demand is higher.",
        "So there's this matching to load that makes comparison very difficult.",
        "You generally compare wind and solar with natural gas, which is also able to vary with time.",
        "And right now wind is not competitive with gas at its current price.",
        "But if gas got a little bit more expensive, there might be a more competitive situation.",
        "And solar is simply uncompetitive with other resources.",
        "There are some solar technologies that might deliver competitive power with nuclear well down the road.",
        "We talked about something called solar thermal that allows you to smooth out that power delivery over time.",
        "And if we could add storage, we might change the equation too.",
        "But we have no idea how expensive that storage would be, which makes it essentially impossible for us to predict the net price.",
        "All right.",
        "Terry...",
        "I would just jump in there quickly and say you could actually consider a wind system with 100 percent gas backup.",
        "And that would allow you to provide a base load-type scenario, especially given the fact that nuclear is only a fifth of our power.",
        "So it's a large chunk again.",
        "I don't want to underestimate the size of the nuclear power.",
        "But you could conceivably price out a gas backup...",

        "It's certainly part of the equation.",
        "One of the challenges you've seen recently is that on particularly hot days, when electricity demand happens to be high, that's when the thresholds you need to set for discharge of hot water from nuclear plants are the strictest, because bodies of water are already close to the thresholds that you don't want to cross.",
        "So certainly hot water discharge is part of it.",

        "The moment you make it part of the profit equation, the safety goes out the window.",
        "And we can see that in the Japanese reactors, in that the corporation that owns those reactors hesitated to use salt water to immediately cool them down because they feared damaging their equipment permanently.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You can't trust a corporation to do this.",
        "Well, thanks for the call there.",
        "Frank Zeman, how about that idea?",
        "Well, again, I would go back to saying nuclear is not all that corporate in the sense that the corporations just would never take this on on their own and would never seek insurance on the competitive markets for this type of thing.",
        "So...",
        "So all the ones in the United States are - I don't even know this -government administered?",
        "No.",
        "They're run by corporations, but the corporations run them.",
        "They don't build them and insure them, and they haven't - the liability for the waste disposal isn't on their books, as far as I know.",
