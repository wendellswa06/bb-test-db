        "Well, specifically, they're furious at a new budget that came in in January, and that's got tax hikes, which means that basic goods are costing more.",
        "And the broader picture here is that the government is struggling to pay back a loan by the International Monetary Fund.",
        "And to meet their requirements, they've imposed these austerity measures.",
        "That means they're not creating any more public sector jobs.",

        "You can find a number of examples, countries that sent troops to help our troops but wanted it kept quiet.",
        "So you think you can be pretty certain that any other country that was prepared to send military assistance to Afghanistan on the same terms now won't do it, at least they won't do it very readily, because they won't trust us.",
        "I think you can draw a very long list of these kind of consequences.",
        "The second is, when I talked about advice given to presidents, people are now going to look for how to restrict their views, how to keep you guys from gushing this stuff in the future.",
        "And the consequence of that in my experience is that people will restrict distribution.",
        "They'll go back to targeted emails, various other things.",
        "The result of that is twofold.",

        "And secondly, what is your take on the ambassador's view that the release alone forebodes some very bad things in the diplomatic world?",
        "Well, I sympathize with the ambassador's view because diplomats and journalists both have sources that they like to protect and need to protect, and if they can't protect them, they tend to have fewer sources.",
        "So I think journalists can certainly understand that as a parallel concern.",
        "In terms of what is in these documents that struck me, I think for the most part, it's not just shattering, shocking revelations of things we never knew before.",
        "It tends to be the backstory of things we did know.",

        "We had written about those.",

        "And President Saleh says, well, we'll keep taking responsibility for your strikes.",
        "So it's not brand new, but to sort of see it laid out and see how these conversations take place is really kind of fascinating.",
