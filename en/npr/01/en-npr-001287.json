        "We spent some time going through them.",

        "Doesn't that just create a big vulnerability sitting out there, that we've got so much that's classified, it's going to be lumped in with bombshells like, I don't know, conversations with the president of Yemen, you know?",

        "For instance, you, I am sure, have a happy family relationship, but someone might say to his wife something derogatory about his mother-in-law, which if his wife went off and told his mother-in-law would have a truly poisonous effect on the entire three-way relationship.",
        "And that isn't necessarily going to be a terrible surprise, but - what the person thinks, but having it reported directly becomes a bombshell.",
        "So a lot of stuff is classified in order to allow personal relationships to go forward.",
        "And I think that is a legitimate reason for classification for exactly that purpose, so that we can do the business of talking to people.",
        "Yes, there is a huge volume.",
        "Military is much larger volume than state reporting, obviously, but the problem is people who want to break a rule, not having a volume that is attackable.",
        "Did you find, Scott, in the materials that you read through that that was the case largely?",
        "That a good portion of these documents was about what the ambassador might call family business, perhaps, as opposed to something more politically sensitive?",
        "Well, I mean, it really kind of covers the waterfront.",
        "And, I mean, for example, there was a cable directing diplomats to assist the intelligence agencies by collecting biographical information and even things like credit cards and frequent flyer numbers from foreign counterparts to help - apparently to help NSA and other intelligence agencies track travel plans and that sort of thing.",

        "We appreciate the time that you have given us.",
        "But I can't let you leave without asking you this question: Did the New York Times in any way have any reservations about printing this material?",
        "Was there an editorial discussion about it?",
