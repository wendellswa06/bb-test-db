        "Yes, there were extensive conversations about this.",
        "I mean, the, you know, the government alleges that these were stolen documents, so to speak, and they were classified.",
        "And we, you know, consulted various people and heard some of the arguments that have been made publicly in recent times about the consequences.",
        "So there was extensive concern about this and discussion about this.",
        "And I guess the compromise solution that we came up with was we're not going to dump 250,000 unredacted cables on the Web, but that these 100 cables that we selected we thought were newsworthy and could be redacted in such a way as to educate the public, tell, you know, Americans what their government is up to in their name, you know, teach them a little bit about how diplomacy works, and one hopes, we hope, not do any grave damage along the way.",
        "Did the State Department concur?",
        "You said that there was discussions between your paper and...",
        "Well, there are ongoing discussions, but, you know, because we have several more stories and a bunch more cables to post.",
        "But they - you know, they made a series of requests to us.",
        "Some we complied with, some we didn't.",
        "So, you know, they certainly did not - I cannot say that we agreed 100 percent on everything that should be redacted, but we did - they did point out some things that were extremely - we were extremely grateful to have shown to us and that we did redact.",
        "Have we seen the worst of it?",
        "I guess - well, there's a lot of interesting information to come.",
        "What's interesting is that WikiLeaks itself has not put the quarter million documents online.",
        "They've had them for six months, and they still have not put them online.",
        "And so far, they're only putting online the same documents that we and the European papers are posting and with the same redactions.",

        "What's your question?",
        "I'm concerned about the privacy rights of American citizens who might be mentioned in these cables.",
        "For example, a young Marine guard who is replaced for committing indiscretion with a Polish telephone operator, for example, or an American citizen, a young woman who's involved in something, say, that she regrets later on a beach in South India, reports to the embassy her concerns.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "Well, obviously, the man who should be replying is Scott Shane.",
        "I'm deeply sympathetic to the question there, and I'm - I guess I'm inclined to snidely say that when The New York Times and other papers have no respect for the rights of the government or the need to get on with privacy in any effective government dealing, why do you expect them to be concerned about the privacy rights of individuals?",
        "But, obviously, I'm not the man to answer the question.",

        "Isn't this a form of treason?",
        "You know, ultimately, it is a legal definition, and I'm not the lawyer to answer it.",
        "I would deeply, deeply like to see every conceivable legal remedy brought to bear against those who have released the documents.",
        "I recognize that in talking about legal action against those who print them, that that's not our system.",
        "There are constitutional objections to that.",
        "I think that I would hope that as much legal action would be taken as possible, and that those who've leaked the documents would be dealt with as severely as possible.",
        "Whether, in a technical sense, treason applies is a question I'd like to say yes to, but I think it's a legal question that has to be answered that way.",
        "And I should point out, we are going to have this very discussion on the program tomorrow as we get into the legal...",
        "With, hopefully, somebody who could answer it better.",

        "I have a quick question, and actually, it's in two parts.",
        "The first part is who, if anyone, other than the United States, stands to lose the most face in the Middle East with the release of these documents?",
        "And is this going to affect our ability to work with Iran in trying to curtail nuclear issues?",
        "Thank you, Kevin, for that.",
        "That sounds like my aunt's question.",
        "The list of who's going to be affected is longer than we'd probably have time for.",

        "...as a result of this, which the Gulf states will all understand to be a warning - equivalent of a warning shot across the bow from their big neighbor across the Gulf.",
        "I don't say it will happen, but it's quite possible.",
        "Any number of countries will react badly in having, essentially, their privacy and their expectation of confidentiality quashed in this way.",
        "Some of the damage will be very hard to tell, because it will be what people don't tell you in the future what they won't cooperate with that they might have that's very hard to assess that.",
        "In terms of Iran, pretty hard to know whether it gives you any immediate consequence one way or the other.",
        "It leaks an awful lot of stuff, but it's mostly people's attitudes about Iran, rather than things we might directly do ourselves.",
        "And it certainly limits our ability to put pressure on in some ways, because insofar as it lays out ways that we've gotten countries like China and Russia - they're very important - to come on board with elements of sanctions and embarrasses them, they'll be less likely to cooperate.",
        "We have a little more than a moment - a minute left.",
        "There are two things that I'd like to squeeze in, if I can.",
        "Number one, can the government shut this website down?",
        "I do not know.",
        "That's tomorrow's question.",

        "And my other one is this: We've talked about all of the potential problems, some of them ominous sounding, in your view.",
        "Is there any benefit at all to the release of these kinds of documents for the American people and beyond our shores?",
        "Yes, that young whippersnapper Daniel Akaka, who is 86 years old.",
        "And of course, he's a junior senator by age, as well, because he's four days younger than Daniel Inouye.",
        "But Akaka, who has been in the Senate since 1990, has not been raising money."
