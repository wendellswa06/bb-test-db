        "But the original Istanbul plot, and the idea to strike Turkey was something that bin Laden himself had in August 2001, about a month before 9-11-- specifically, personally authorized to some of the plotters.",
        "So, yeah, you're right.",

        "And, so, a lot of what he--and he's implicated by other people who are now standing trial on the Istanbul bombing.",

        "I assume that there's some concern about betraying other operations, or an organization, the al-Qaeda organization, but it's not quite clear why he's leaning both ways.",
        "And that leads to another question, which is, has his information been made available to American authorities who may want to know what he knows about what's going on inside Iraq?",
        "Yeah, I know that, according to his lawyer and reports in the Turkish press, at least once, I think twice, CIA, people who are assumed to be CIA, American Intelligence people have been to his prison cell in, where he's being held in a high-security place in Istanbul, and have talked to him.",

        "He did, you know, you might remember, there were two assaults on Fallujah.",

        "It got so far, and at the same time, the Shiites were starting their insurgency in the south, and that defensive was called off.",
        "But during that time, al-Saqa showed up with some other people from Turkey.",
        "He then stayed while Fallujah became, you know, really, an insurgent town, and Zarqawi was one of the people sort of running the place.",
        "And, in that time, he was a fairly senior commander, I mean, I don't know what his field abilities are, but he was somebody who was, according to former fighters, calling in coordinates for border attacks on U.S.",
