        "Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich appearing at the Iowa forum.",
        "And he's got a bit of baggage in this contest - two divorces.",
        "Again, we should mention Buddy Roemer does, too, but that's going to be a problem with social conservatives.",
        "Well, that's exactly it.",
        "I mean, the reason we talk about -they're talking about social issues in Iowa and not economic issues is because - look at previous winners of what's happened in Iowa.",
        "Mike Huckabee, who ran as a religious conservative and came out of nowhere to win the caucuses in 2008.",
        "Pat Robertson, of course, started off with a strong second place finish in 1988.",
        "The social religious conservatives are very, very strong in Iowa, and that's the key to winning the caucuses there on the Republican side.",

        "Eventually, Mike Holmgren was able to harness all of that spirit that Brett Favre had and turn him into an MVP quarterback that led the Packers to their first Super Bowl title since the Vince Lombardi era.",
        "And the rest, as they say, is history.",
        "But in the final years in the league and into retirement, Favre did have, you know, a major slip up off the field, in that he was accused of sexual harassment by at least three women.",
        "How did this affect his legacy?",
        "Well, I think that in terms of football, those decisions, whether he's Hall of Fame worthy, have never really factored what happened off the field.",

        "Now, you should know this about him.",
        "He was a guy who, unlike a lot of athletes today, was willing to live his personal life out in the public - his addiction to Vicodin pain killers in the '90s, his wife Deanna's battle with breast cancer, his father Irv passing away on the night before one of his greatest performances.",
