        "And that's about the most divisive issue that she's going to be speaking on between now and in the hearings.",
        "Well, we learned from Robert Bork that the more you tell senators about your judicial philosophy, the bigger trouble you can get into.",
        "And it's been a pattern for the most part since Bork that you say as little about your philosophy, certainly about abortion, things like that, issues that could come up, certainly will come up in the confirmation hearing.",
        "But it's interesting.",
        "You know, Arlen Specter, who voted against her for solicitor general last year, said the reason he voted against her, I mean, of course, it's very possible that he did it to curry favor with because he was still a Republican back then, but at the same time, he said he voted against her because she didn't give that much sufficient information about what her philosophy was during the confirmation hearings.",
        "But I suspect that when we have the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Elena Kagan, she'll be equally close-mouthed.",
        "Senator Specter still a member of the Judiciary Committee, no longer the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.",
        "In any case, actual votes cast yesterday in West Virginia, where the big news was the defeat of Congressman Alan Mollohan.",
        "Right.",
        "He's been in Congress 28 years.",
        "He succeeded his father, Robert Mollohan, in 1982, who was first elected, or the last time he was elected was in '68.",
        "So for the last 42 years, we had a Mollohan in the 1st Congressional District in West Virginia.",
        "But I know there's a lot of anti-incumbent, anti-Washington feeling out there, but there's several reasons for why Mollohan went down.",
        "One, he's always been involved in some kind of ethics problems.",
        "He's always been accused of steering earmarks towards businesses that are run by his allies or his friends.",
        "So that was always a question about him, even though he never suffered at the ballot box.",
        "He always won overwhelmingly re-elections.",
        "But at the same time, he also voted for the health care bill, and the National Right to Life Party, which has long supported Alan Mollohan Mollohan is a pro-life Democrat switched their support to Mike Oliverio, who defeated him, who defeated Mollohan yesterday because of the vote on health care.",
        "And he also campaigned that he was corrupt and out of touch.",
        "That's exactly right."

        "In any case, the big news last week, couldn't get it on last week's program, not there in time, but over the weekend, a caucus in Utah denied a place on the ballot to Bob Bennett, the conservative Republican from Utah who had this to say afterwards.",
        "The political atmosphere obviously has been toxic, and it's very clear that some of the votes that I have cast have added to the toxic environment.",
        "And it is both Tea Partiers and, indeed, the Club for Growth that is claiming the scalp of Senator Bob Bennett.",
        "Right, and it was a big scalp, and now, of course, as Bob Bennett alluded to, there were some votes that did cast him in bad favor with some conservatives, like the vote for the TARP program in 2008.",
        "Now, a lot of Republicans voted for that, including Orrin Hatch.",
        "Orrin Hatch could be in trouble in 2012, but Bob Bennett look, the conservatives in it's very easy for us in Washington to say that Bob Bennett is a sufficiently conservative kind of guy, and there's no reason why he should have been voted out by Republicans at the state convention last weekend.",
        "But there's conservatives in Utah who said that's not enough, that the anger is real, the anger against the Obama administration is real, and Bob Bennett is kind of quiet, a colorless conservative, even though his voting record is pretty sufficient, but we want more from that, more of that from our elected officials, and Bob Bennett was not sufficiently conservative.",
        "So he only finished third, a weak third, and you needed 40 percent of the Republican support to advance to even get into the primary, which is June 22nd.",
        "So his career is over.",
        "Now, he is discussing the possibility of running as a write-in candidate.",

        "Bob Bennett is talking about it.",
        "I suspect he does not run as a write-in."
