        "What would you say is the biggest difference between you and your principal opponent, Rand Paul?",
        "I think the biggest difference is that I've actually got a record of accomplishing a lot of the things that we need to focus on in Washington.",
        "We and since I've became secretary of state, we've actually slashed spending by over 15 percent.",
        "We're spending 15 percent less, but we're actually doing more for the citizens of Kentucky, and that kind of efficient government is something that voters all across Kentucky are looking for in this time where we need to get our fiscal house in order, but we still need to get things done at the federal level.",
        "But that record is something that distinguishes me from, you know, candidates who say good things on the campaign trail but aren't able to accomplish it as they get into office.",
        "Ken?",
        "Mr.",
        "Secretary of State, a lot of times in the past, a political record would be advantageous, especially against somebody like Rand Paul, who had never run for office before.",
        "But as we saw in Utah with Robert Bennett, as we've seen around the country, there was an anti-Washington, anti-incumbent feeling out there, and even though you're not the incumbent senator, you are backed by Mitch McConnell and perhaps what they call the establishment, and it looks like there's an anti-establishment vote out there, which helped Rand Paul.",
        "Well, you know, in theory there could be some parallels.",
        "As you say, you know, I have not been in Washington, never worked there, you know, don't have a father who's been there for 20 years in Congress.",
        "But I think that my record is important to voters.",
        "I mean, it's something that you know, people really are looking for solutions.",
        "They're sick and tired of rhetoric, and you know, I'm not the incumbent senator, as you said, and I think that my record is going to make a big difference and help us to overcome the money that Rand has been able to raise around the country from his dad's libertarian followers, as well as all the media connections that have helped him develop, helped him during his campaign.",
        "Some of your ads have said Rand Paul has strange ideas.",
        "Which ones in particular are you talking about?",
        "Your father is Ron Paul, the former Libertarian Party candidate for president of the United States, ran last time for the Republican nomination for president."

        "Well, a couple that most Kentuckians, when they hear about it, they just can't believe - one is that he opposes the Patriot Act.",
        "This is something that's disrupted over 20 terrorists acts since it's been passed and was even renewed and supported by a majority of the Congress that's currently composed and signed by President Obama, and is part of the Republican Party platform.",
        "And another one is, you know, his comment recently that Iran having a single nuclear weapon is not a threat to our national security.",
        "You know, these kinds of views, especially in an era of national security, are really concerning to Kentucky Republican voters, or Kentuckians for that matter, not just Republicans.",
        "I think most Democrats in Kentucky would support me on those views.",
        "Let's get a caller in on the conversation.",
        "This is Thomas, Thomas with us from Owensboro in Kentucky.",
        "Yes, my question is for Mr. Grayson.",
        "I noticed on your TV ads, you criticize Rand Paul for saying he wants to raise the age limit to 70 years old on Social Security and Medicare benefits.",
        "If we don't do something like that, what's your answer to fixing the problem?",
        "The debt problem is presumably what he's talking about.",
        "Secretary Grayson?",
        "Sure, yeah, thanks for the question, Thomas, and I'll be in Owensboro I think on Monday on this tour.",
        "I hope you can come out and we can talk in person.",
        "But what the ad criticized, Dr. Paul's position, where he said he would have voted against the Medicare bill if it were introduced if he'd been in Congress back in the '60s, and he did raise some he did state that he wanted to increase the Social Security retirement age.",
        "I think we need to do with the debt, as you put the question, is that our federal deficit, we need to focus first on discretionary spending and do some spending freezes and even go beyond that on non-defense discretionary spending.",
        "You know, with the stimulus, we've increased spending by an extraordinary amount over the last couple years, and we need to go back to those pre-stimulus levels.",
        "If we do that, then I think that'll help give our creditors, our rating agencies, and just small business owners the confidence that we're taking this problem pretty seriously and we're going to address is before it gets out of hand.",
        "So those are the kinds of steps that I'd like to see, to get the spending under control, get the deficit under control and get this economy moving again."

        "I have no idea what Dr. Dobson meant.",
        "We received his endorsement, he saw my views on life and other issues that matter to him and saw Dr. Paul's views, which are not quite as strong as mine on that issue.",
        "For example, he supports the morning-after pill in certain situations.",
        "And then somehow he announced that he changed his position on that.",
        "You know, we were very straightforward in giving him all the facts, and he said he originally considered the facts.",
        "So I think you'll have to ask Dr. Dobson.",
        "I know last night Fox News tried to ask him and he walked away from the camera, and so I'm not sure what went on there, but I'm very proud of the state right-to-life endorsement and the folks all across Kentucky for whom these issues matter are flocking to our campaign.",
        "Less than a week to go - how would you characterize the tone of the campaign?",
        "And also the latest polls show you trailing your opponent.",
        "Well, you know, what we've been doing with our TV and radio ads is focusing on making the case to the voters, talking about my concern for what's going on in Washington and being fed up with the Obama agenda and talking about focusing on spending and my track record.",
        "We've been very positive.",
        "What's interesting is they've gotten really negative over the last couple of weeks with their ads.",
        "They even sent a letter out to a bunch of Kentucky voters, taking aim at my wife and daughters on a local issue, and I think that's a sign of a candidate that may have peaked too soon, when you're going after the opponent's wife and family.",
        "But we feel great.",
        "We've got this great tour all across the state.",
        "We've had good crowds.",
        "We're seeing a lot of support, and we're going to win this, and the only polls that matter are the ones on election day, and frankly, the polls that are done by the most reputable pollsters show this to be a dead heat."
