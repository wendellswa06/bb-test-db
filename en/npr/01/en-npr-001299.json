        "Well, I was proud of Senator Bunning for what he did, and I think it was actually misinterpreted.",
        "He didnt actually hold up the benefits.",
        "What he said was, let's take the money out of existing pool of money that had already been allocated for the stimulus money.",
        "Because they had passed about three weeks beforehand something called pay-as-you-go, which meant they had agreed not to add to the deficit.",
        "But immediately, within three weeks, they broke their own rules twice.",
        "And this is why - because of this lack of backbone - that our deficit is exploding, and so I think Senator Bunning did the right thing.",
        "And had I been there, I would have stood right up there with him and explained it to the American people, that our deficit is what's consuming this nation and it's also what's destroying jobs.",
        "If we want to create jobs, we need to shrink the pool of money that we give to the government and increase the pool of money that's left with private business and private individuals.",
        "And so unemployment benefits you would have opposed - not only you supported Senator Bunning's position, but then opposed the unemployment benefits extension that was approved later.",
        "No, what I would have said is that - take the money.",
        "If you're going to extend unemployment benefits, take the money from existing money...",
        "But if that was not...",
        "...not add to the debt.",
        "But if that was not the option offered, would you have voted against it?",
        "I think that was the option that was offered by Bunning - was to...",

        "Right.",
        "That was the vote that he was promised, and then in the end the vote ended up being different than that.",
        "But the vote I would have held out for and supported would be to take the money from existing funds.",
        "I'm just trying to get you to say what - how you would have voted on the actual vote.",
        "Would you have voted to extend the unemployment benefits as it stood on the floor or oppose them?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, I think it's an important discussion as to how long we should have unemployment benefits.",
        "The benefits, as I understand it, were to extend them beyond two years?",
        "Yes, I think that's right.",
        "Right.",
        "And the average unemployment benefits in Europe, I think, are actually about a year.",
        "So there is an argument to be made for that two years may be an excessively long time.",

        "So for example, in the housing market, we have to find a bottom to housing.",
        "But also in the employment market, in order to find a job and to get people back working, unfortunately what has to happen a lot of times is you have to accept jobs at lower wages...",

        "So the argument is that, yes, you do have to have limits.",
        "Exactly what the limits are has to be decided in every individual instance.",

        "It's been unanimous the last two times around.",
        "So I find it hard to believe that I would be making any other vote if there's no other choice.",

        "Yeah.",
        "In fact, I've made overtures and extended an olive branch to him.",

        "And when we do, we will work together.",
        "We have agreed to appear at a unity rally with him on May 22nd.",
        "And so I think in many ways there are many things we do agree with.",
        "I've made great pains and gone around the state to emphasize our areas of agreement.",
        "On McCain-Feingold, he fought for 10 years against it, not only in Congress but in the courts.",
        "And then I always agreed with him, that I think McCain-Feingold was unconstitutional...",
        "And the Supreme Court seemed to agree with you both.",
        "Yeah.",
