        "Is there any precedent for doing this - for bringing charges against somebody whose victim died much, much later of injuries sustained years before?",
        "To my knowledge, there is no case where there has been this much time between the pulling of the trigger and the ultimate death - 33 years.",
        "There are cases where people have been in a coma between and then died, but nothing nearly this long.",
