        "I mean, if you think that Iraq is sort of some ally being stabilized by the steadying hand of America on the bicycle seat - if you believe that, as former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld seems to believe, then you can imagine what it would be like if you took the hand off the seat.",
        "And taking the hand off the seat in that situation, if you buy his assumptions, means that you're going to have more chaos and more bloodshed, and probably more intervention by regional powers around Iraq like Saudi Arabia and Iran.",
