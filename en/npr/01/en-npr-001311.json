        "John Roberts, who, at 50, would be the youngest member of the court, would take the oath as chief justice under the president's new plan.",
        "Hearings on Judge Roberts' nomination were to begin tomorrow.",
        "They're now delayed.",
        "This is in part because former Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who died Saturday, will be lying at the Supreme Court prior to his funeral on Wednesday.",
        "Here's part of what the president said this morning.",
        "President GEORGE W.",
        "BUSH: ...the passing of Chief Justice William Rehnquist leaves the center chair empty just four weeks left before the Supreme Court reconvenes.",
        "It is in the interest of the court and the country to have a chief justice on the bench on the first full day of the fall term.",
        "After announcing the planned elevation of Judge Roberts this morning, the president flew to Louisiana to meet with hurricane victims there.",
        "Joining us is NPR's senior Washington editor Ron Elving.",
        "Ron, how does this work?",
        "Judge Roberts was supposed to be replacing Sandra Day O'Connor.",
        "Now he's slated for a new job.",
        "Yes, it is quite a different job, Alex.",
        "The way it works is that the president will withdraw his nomination of John Roberts to replace Sandra Day O'Connor and replace that by resubmitting a new appointment for him as chief justice replacing Rehnquist.",
        "That will technically, for the moment, leave the court with just one vacancy to fill in Rehnquist because Sandy O'Connor did not actually leave the court, she just tendered her resignation.",
        "And if necessary she could pick up in October with the rest of the court and hear cases as she would have if she were not planning to resign.",
        "Ron, does it make sense for the new guy coming on to be the chief of the court?",
        "Actually, it's been typical for the president to choose an outsider to be the chief justice.",
        "That was the case when Warren Burger became chief justice, before Rehnquist; it was the case when Earl Warren became the chief justice back in 1953.",
        "And, in fact, at that time, when the death of the chief justice, Fred Vinson, took place in September of 1953, he actually--that is, President Eisenhower actually put Earl Warren on the court as a recess appointment to be the chief justice.",
        "So it's not unprecedented by any means.",
        "Actually, William Rehnquist, being elevated from the court, to be chief, was rather the exception.",
        "Well, I guess it's not exactly as though the president is going to have to start over on this nomination for someone to fill Justice O'Connor's seat.",
        "Because there was widespread speculation that Chief Justice Rehnquist may leave the court."

        "As you remember back in June, we were talking about this all the time, anticipating that because of the advancement of his thyroid cancer he would choose to step down before going any further.",
        "As it turned out, the chief justice decided that he thought he might have a chance to begin a new term.",
        "Unfortunately, that was not the case.",
        "But there were many names that were bandied about at the time, of course.",
        "Twenty, 30, names were talked about at the time.",
        "And certainly the president has a short list to work from, people he might have appointed instead of John Roberts, and now people that could fill that slot as associate justice.",
        "And...",
        "How about questions--I've--I just wonder about--there has--was a little kind of comment that `Gee, this really should have been an appointment for a woman.",
        "It wasn't.",
        "But maybe there's more pressure for that now.",
        "There's certainly every bit as much pressure as there was back in June, and, of course, that included the president's wife, Laura, who said she thought it would be nice to see another woman on the court.",
        "I think we should all be looking down to New Orleans for one more reason than the obvious and that is there are two women on the Circuit Court of Appeals there for the federal judicial system, both named Edith, Edith Brown Clement and Edith Hollan Jones.",

        "Of course, raising, again, his presence there, his flag there, and showing that the federal government is trying to do everything it can, but, of course, landing in political controversy as--even as he arrives, because of the rather rocky relationship right now between the White House and the governor of Louisiana, Kathy Blanco.",
        "How about concern over political effects?",
        "Well, you got evacuees now spreading out to a number of states, a huge number of them in Texas, hundreds of thousands, perhaps, going to be in Texas.",

        "They're going to keep it on page one.",
        "I'm afraid that the two disasters we've had here.",

        "It would show that they knowingly aided and abetted and enabled 19 hijackers in the murder of 3,000 innocent people."
