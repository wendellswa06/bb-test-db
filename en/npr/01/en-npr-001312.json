        "It's kind of equivalent to fitting a thread that's two football fields long into a head of a pin.",

        "And as I recall in those days, it took anywhere from two to three hours to get a call through.",
        "Why?",

        "It allows us to make phone calls from anywhere in the world to any other place in the world.",

        "It's not possible and that's why there will never ever again be another Walter Cronkite.",
        "You might have a perfectly talented journalist who is able to combine all the wonderful qualities that Walter had, but the environment is so different today with the literally hundreds of channels that are available on cable television, satellite television.",
        "And of course when I began in television news, there were the three networks as you mentioned, Neal.",

        "And so the effect of that trip to Vietnam, Ted Koppel, where he came back and published and broadcast his assessment - tremendously important.",
        "And I don't think, albeit all the CBS execs these days are making it sound as though they wish he had never left, he wasn't forced out, but it was made quite clear to him that age 65 would be a pretty good time for him to leave.",

        "So, it can be an argued that what Walter did - and clearly, that was not singularly responsible - though was in part responsible with something that President Johnson already knew, even without having been told by Walter Cronkite, and that is that this was an effort that was failing in Vietnam.",
