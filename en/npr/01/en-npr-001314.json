        "In 2013, you pushed through what was one of the toughest gun laws in the country.",
        "And, in some of the rural counties in upstate New York, your popularity dropped sharply at about that point.",
        "Any regrets about that?",
        "Not the way you angered the NRA, but the way you've angered some of your own constituents who own firearms?",
        "Any regrets?",
        "No. As a matter of fact, Don, it's one of the proudest things that I did.",
        "You're right.",
        "My entanglement with the NRA goes back.",
        "I passed the toughest gun control law in the country.",
        "It did hurt me politically to this day.",
        "But I believe it's set a model for the nation.",
        "I believe the law is the right thing to do.",
        "I believe, as time goes on, it's even shown itself to be more and more correct.",
        "But there is a political price here, Don, and that's what people have to understand.",
        "When you take action, there are going to be people who are annoyed and who believe the Second Amendment is sacrosanct and slippery slope, etc. And politicians don't want to pay that price.",
        "I understand that it hurts when you look at those polls, and you see (laughter) your numbers have gone down.",
        "But if you are in this business only to keep your polls high, then you are in the wrong business.",

        "You probably heard the story of the Baptist missionaries who said they hoped to help dozens of children, only to find themselves under arrest and charged with abduction.",
        "Some volunteers rushed to Port-au-Prince to help hundreds of thousands of people left homeless with no idea how to provide food, water and shelter for themselves.",

        "What's the goal?",

        "Tell us about what you've seen.",
        "I know you just got back from Haiti, and obviously, lots of organizations are trying to help there.",
        "What's working?",
        "What isn't?",
        "Ms.�BASTIEN: When I was there, I visited 12 camps in Port-au-Prince and Leogane.",
        "I also went to Dufort and Montrouis, two villages outside of Leogane.",
        "And most of the people I spoke with told me that they were still waiting for the relief.",
        "I believe that one of the main reasons for that is those organizations and the terrain that are there to help, they do not know what to do.",
        "I mean, when I got to the airport in Port-au-Prince, most of the aid was packed there.",
        "And I spoke to someone, you know, from Haiti recently, and he told me that the aid is still stacked there.",
        "So based on my assessment there and some experiences I had while I was there distributing food in Belair, I do believe that the best way to go about this is to use grass-roots and community-based organizations that know the people, know their needs and know their way around the country.",
        "So international aid organizations, don't try to do it yourself, but enlist local help."

        "And then a few children tried to get back in the line, and some of the leaders, the grass-roots leaders right there, you know, told them that you were already in the line.",
        "So they know the people.",
        "They know who they are.",
        "They know their needs, and the best way to go about making such that those in need really get the help is to use those that are part of - involved and engaged in these communities.",
        "Do you encounter problems of Western aid organizations - that's principally who we're talking about - in Haiti, the United States and Europeans, that have, well, stereotypes of Haitians?",
        "Ms.�BASTIEN: Well, the belief is that Haitians are not able to organize themselves, they are - they do not have the skills to manage.",
        "And I think it is a myth.",
        "I believe that, given the opportunities, Haitians rise up to the occasion like they did during this recent earthquake.",
        "We saw on TV, we were mesmerized to see how Haitians rose up to the occasion and then dug people out of holes and crevices on their own.",
        "They decided on their own to pull people out of the rubble, people that they don't even know about.",
        "And I think that this earthquake demystified the belief that Haitians cannot do for themselves or cannot be trusted.",
        "Oftentimes, when the aid goes to Haiti, the organizations brought their own talents, their own experts, and those on the terrain are not trained.",
        "And I, again, believe that the best way to do this is to use the people who are there.",
        "If they need training, train them so that when you go back to where you come from - be it the U.S.",
        "or Canada or France - then the talents and the expertise stays there.",

        "It's about sustainability.",

        "The people are Haiti's best resources.",
        "I mean, they are waiting, eager to work, to be put to work, and we've seen that over and over again out there.",
        "Ms.�BASTIEN: So we need to do it.",
        "We need to use this resource to get out - Haiti out of the condition that it's in right now.",
        "And with respect, part of the reason people have those beliefs that the people of Haiti can't be trusted and are unable to do for themselves is the evidence of the Haitian government, which has been widely regarded as both incompetent and corrupt.",
        "Ms.�BASTIEN: Well, some of the members are corrupted.",
        "But then again, over the years, what have we done?",
        "We are saying that the Haitian government is corrupt, yet we gave money.",
        "We gave millions of dollars to NGOs, nongovernmental organizations, on the terrain, that are also corrupt."

        "And in those situations, finding local people, local organizations to empower, if you will, in other words give them a lot of money and a lot of resources?",

        "In many ways, as you go to Haiti, of course, when you - the experience is overwhelming.",
        "And it seems like there's a disintegration of almost every structure of the society, whether it be the church or politics, whether it be education or even the social fabric of homes or neighborhoods.",
        "And clearly, the help of the international community is absolutely indispensible.",
        "But I think she's very right in saying that that help has to, as much as possible, come through and siphon through the channels of the Haitian people themselves.",
        "And through the Haitian people themselves - now, obviously, there are situations where you're setting up field hospitals and that sort of thing, and those require specialists.",
        "And that's not what we're talking about.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "For example, our own team from Jesuit Refugee Service, a team of American doctors from the Milwaukee-Chicago-Detroit area, went down there two days after the earthquake itself and really worked in the immediate wreckage and in the immediate chaos of the situation, and that's absolutely important.",
        "That's absolutely important.",
        "But then how do you make the transition between providing that kind of emergency care - and I'm sure your doctors ran into the same situation as other doctors we've talked to who went to Haiti, saying a lot of the problems we dealt with were people who were - had - you'll excuse the expression - preexisting conditions.",
        "Their health was a mess before the earthquake began.",
        "How do you then transition from this emergency kind of care to developing a health care system that can deal with these problems over the long term?"
