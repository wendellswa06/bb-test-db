        "Sure.",
        "And that's going to be a generational issue, I think.",
        "We're not going to see a resolution to the health care needs of the Haitian people - as ordinary or extraordinary as they are - within the next generation, or perhaps the next two generations.",
        "But even now, after the immediate emergency stage is beginning to begin to come to an end, I think what we're seeing is basically people with a great deal of upper respiratory problems, vaginal infections, people who have, you know, some very basic but real issues such as diarrhea, which are going to be an important issue in the coming weeks for the health of many, many of the Haitian people.",
        "We're talking about the best way to help - not just in Haiti, but in other kinds of situations.",

        "Yes.",
        "I worked for the Red Cross in Hurricane Katrina, and the biggest thing we focused on was to make sure we didn't create a dependency in the local communities, because they were pretty small.",
        "And you want to get people back up on their feet, but you don't want them to start relying on this check and not doing anything else.",
        "And how do you make that transition?",
        "That's pretty difficult.",
        "Well, is there a material deficit?",
        "Of course there is.",
        "In a case like Haiti, in a relief context, that's pronounced.",
        "But people have a long-time talked about the issue of poverty of being.",
        "Well, basically, they had a set time limit.",
        "They would only go in for a couple of weeks to a month, just long enough so that people can, you know, start getting into trailer homes, you know, and they wouldn't wait a lot longer than that.",
        "And whether they were completely beyond it or not, basically they had a set time limit so that you couldn't have abuses from either side of the system.",
        "Even if it wasn't intentional, you'd have people all worried about, you know, how these people are doing and then staying too long, and then there's just this point at which everybody involved just starts to get attached to this situation and can't move on.",
        "It becomes a permanent structure, not the emergency situation you were there to deal with.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Greg, thanks very much for the phone call.",

        "It is the best of human instincts: When catastrophe strikes - an earthquake in Haiti, for instance - go rush, help.",
        "Sometimes, though, that help can go awry in any number of ways: It's pushy or paternalistic or thoughtless or unprepared.",
        "So what is the best way to help?",
        "Our guest is Father Ken Gavin, national director of the Jesuit Refugee Service USA.",
        "If you've worked for an NGO or an aid organization, what do you think is the best way to give support?",
        "Our phone number is 800-989-8255.",

        "Go to npr.org.",
        "Click on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And Father Ken, I just wanted to ask you, I know there's a philosophy of this that the Jesuits have worked on called accompaniment.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Frequently enough, when we talk about our work in Jesuit Refugee Service, we say that what we do is accompany, serve and advocate or defend the rights of refugees or forcibly displaced people.",
        "And that term, accompaniment, as you say, Neal, is incredibly important, because I see it as the envelope out of which all our service and all our advocacy - however important they are - flow from that sense of accompaniment."

        "And what we mean by that, I think simply, is to be close to the people, to be in solidarity with them, to step into their shoes, to experience their hopes and losses.",
        "Our sense of accompaniment comes from that spark of the divine that we recognize in every human person.",
        "It comes from our believing that even in the greatest tragedies like Haiti, that our God stands present with people in their suffering.",
        "So that accompaniment is kind of the very source of what we are.",
        "To give you an example, years ago in Haiti, after the tsunami, I was in a little coastal town called Chrumriya(ph), which was rubble, basically, aside from a mosque that had just been rebuilt.",
        "Not in Haiti, but in...",
        "I'm sorry, this was in Indonesia, in Aceh in Indonesia.",
        "Yes.",
        "And the people said to us, you know, JRS is different than other NGOs.",
        "And I said, oh, is that so?",
        "Why is that?",
        "And they said, well, because a lot of other NGOs come, and they take - with their clipboards, and they do their analysis and they leave in their SUVs, and you never see them again.",
        "And I said, so what makes us different?",
        "And they said, well, you stay with us.",
        "And I looked puzzled.",
        "And then they pointed to a little green REI tent, a little pup tent in the midst of the rubble.",
        "And they said, and that's where you stay when you come with us.",
        "So with them, in other words.",
        "Yes, exactly.",

        "And in the Western world, we've had this mentality that poverty is basically deficit, it's a lack of.",
        "So it's particularly a lack of financial and material resources.",

        "And so we have this sense of I, you know, I can't do it myself.",
        "Others have got to do it for me.",
