        "And one of the things that I thought was really useful about some of the recommendations and some of the approach that we did was not only to go in and assess the situation in terms of - particularly post-traumatic stress disorder and that sort of thing, with a lot of the women being raped and people being put into camps - but was to look at the Bosnian professionals themselves who would be treating their, you know, fellow citizens, and to part of what we recommended was to actually take these professionals and the Bosnian citizens and give them respite, so that, over the course of a few years, two or three years after the act of war was over, we could bring teams of Bosnian health care workers to the United States, give them two weeks of training and basically a break.",
        "And I think that most of the people we worked with were very grateful for that, to just even get a chance for their own health and well-being, as well.",
        "And as we go ahead in Haiti, Suzanne, those psychological issues are going to be, well, I think there was a story in the paper this morning about how after weeks of dealing with an emergency, finally, the grief is getting out.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "No, I mean, it's you know, any of us who I work in public mental health and have done a lot of work in post-traumatic stress disorder issues, and it always is once everybody has a roof over their head and some food in their stomach, that's when you just kind of collapse into grieving and then sometimes worse, into things like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "Sure, I mean, the situation in Haiti is unimaginably difficult for these people and it's not going to go away, both emotionally, and as well as physically for a long time.",
        "Suzanne, thanks very much for your call.",
        "And Steve Corbett, I heard you murmuring in agreement there.",
        "Mr.�CORBETT: Yeah, I was in Mexico City in 1985.",
        "I was actually working in rural Mexico.",
        "And then when the earthquake hit there in Mexico City in '85, I was sent there and ran the relief operations.",
        "And just the reality of grief and giving people space to grieve is really, really important, and - just to understand the reality of that.",
        "But, you know, part of what we discovered there, as well as I did some consulting for work in Banda Aceh, after the tsunami, is that one way to overcome grief and some space(ph) is actually is to be doing things that you see as being productive.",
        "You know, a really common thing you do after a crisis, and especially a natural disaster of these scales, is start things like cash-for-work programs, which the U.N.",
        "has already started in Haiti, where you're paying people some wages to go out and do something, and in the case of Port-au-Prince, it's cleaning up, those kinds of things.",
        "And so they're productive.",
        "And Banda Aceh was going and cleaning out mud from all of these government offices and the banking system and the businesses so they could get back on their feet.",
        "And I was doing some consulting with others about - with the Chalmers Center for Economic Development at Covenant, we were working with some NGOs to just how to get the businesses restarted.",
        "And so much of it was not here's a bunch of things.",
        "We'll call - we'll do it for you.",
        "Here's a bunch of money for free.",
        "It's here's some cash to work.",

        "Russia just put more pressure on Ukraine.",
        "You bet.",
        "You know, interesting story, within a few days after the earthquake in Haiti, some savings groups - which is a very common mechanism in the majority world of kind of group-based coming together to bring your savings together so somebody has a lump sum of money to do something with - already were cranked up and going.",
        "I mean, they're using their social networks in very positive ways.",
        "So you want to come alongside that.",
        "And sometimes our outside aid and this is going to sound counterintuitive we sometimes bring it - now -too early, and in too great of quantities.",
        "Now, in relief, you can't be too early.",
        "When you start moving down to rehab and into development, the longer-term changes, and potentially in Haiti, we've got to be really careful about overwhelming so much with outside aid that we actually hurt local initiatives.",
        "I wanted to go back, though, to that psychological point and ask Father Gavin to weigh in here.",
        "My sense is that the grief in Haiti is not only enormous for the Haitian people, but the grief is enormous for all sides.",
        "A Jesuit brother, Brother Jim Boynton, has been down there the last few weeks working with a U.S.",
        "medical team.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And he said, you know, that's true.",
        "And he said, you know, one afternoon, I was just - I moved aside from the trauma of this medical unit and was standing there with - wiping the tears from my eyes and a Haitian man my own age, about 40 or so, came up to me and he said, I really - I'm deeply moved by the fact that you, a North American, could be weeping for my people.",
        "And Jim said to him through his tears, he said - and in his poor Creole said, you know, in my language, we have a word for what you just went through and we don't call it a Haiti quake, we call it an earthquake, because it is a grief that touches all our hearts."

        "I was a nurse volunteer in Haiti in 1985 and the conditions that I saw - I was in the northwest part of the country and spent a lot of time in Port-au-Prince - it was just heartbreaking and difficult physically and mentally and psychologically and emotionally to deal with the situation then.",

        "Now, the human suffering is so much greater.",
        "And my point in calling is I think anyone that contemplates, I'm going to go to Haiti and help, and I have this skill or I have that skill, they really need to think or be screened carefully by whichever organization accepts them that they can really handle what they're going to see and how they're going to feel personally, because it is wrenching to see some of the things that go on in Haiti on a normal - so-called normal day-to-day basis.",
        "Now, you have an earthquake with devastating human tragedy and injuries that - you know, if the person going there to help falls apart and can't handle that, they do become a burden to whoever they're supposed to be working with, and that was your opening...",
        "Sure.",
        "...statement today that, you know, how can you help and not get in the way.",
        "And from my experience being a volunteer in several different countries, there are definitely people that get in the way and you don't want to be tied up taking care of them when you have a job to do.",
        "So I think people just need to really be screened very carefully and certainly shouldn't just take off on a plane and go down there and not know what they're getting into.",

        "We saw it in Kosovo.",

        "We saw it in - after the tsunami hit.",
        "Because of the injection of outside money.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Because there's all this - a lot of people come with the good intention, but we have business thinking - let's say, for example, you can effectively do 10 projects at $10,000.",
        "And if I'm an NGO, a non-governmental organization, and I spend $100,000, I go back and I tell my boss, yeah, I've spent all this money with this micro-financing and I've got 10 projects at $10,000, and that's effective, but it's not necessarily efficient, because what happens is there are environmental problems.",
        "A good example is like the cutting of the mangrove trees following the tsunami in 2004.",
        "So, if you have fishermen and, all of a sudden, they go to cut down trees, in the mangrove trees, now they're causing more environmental vulnerability...",
        "Why would they cut them?",

        "Oh, I see.",
        "So, for wood to build shelters.",
        "Yeah.",
