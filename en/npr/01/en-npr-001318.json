        "Now, those Russians who are not Latvian citizens, are you saying that is entirely by their choice, there's no barrier to that?",
        "No.",
        "There are certain requirements.",
        "For instance, length of residence, basic knowledge of the official language of the country, an ability I think, to know the words of the national anthem and a few requirements of that sort.",
        "It's truly not a very stringent requirement.",

        "As much as you disapprove of President Putin's seizure of a part of Ukraine, do you think he's gotten away with it?",
        "So far, he has.",
        "Do you think he will get away with it?",
        "It remains to be seen how hard any measures taken by the West will bite him.",
        "And that is also difficult to predict, because we live in such a globalized world, where there interconnections both in energy supplies and in the flow of financial markets is not as predictable as one would like to see it.",
        "If the sanctions should happen to bite sufficiently, something might happen.",
        "But otherwise, of course, having once seized it, it's like a vulture having seized something in its claws.",
        "I doubt that voluntarily they would give it up.",
        "Is there a real danger, do you think, that another part of Ukraine might be taken by Russia?",
        "There's definitely a real danger.",
        "When you look at the number of troops that are massed around the frontiers, I don't think they do that in order to get sort of a Sunday afternoon outing for their soldiers and their equipment."

        "And let me come back to your feeling of security or insecurity about your own country.",
        "When you think in just the most basic terms about Latvia's security situation, do you say, well, we're a NATO power, that's the end of that, we don't really have to worry at this point?",
        "We have to worry every minute of every day.",
        "We have to be ready in every possible way.",
        "This is why when we were first given the membership action plan for NATO, we took it very seriously, indeed.",

        "Oh, 2 percent of GDP for defense spending.",
        "That's your requirement.",
        "Yes.",
        "And we haven't - of course, we had a very serious crisis in 2008 and 2009, in terms of cuts in salaries and job losses and whatnot.",
        "So there was this difficult period when, indeed, our investment in defense had to decrease, but now it has to increase again, because, yes, we have to be fully participating partners in our common security, which is a security that NATO offers.",
        "Do you have to be prepared for an actual war against Russia, or are you simply saying that if you fail to build up your defenses, you're just inviting trouble?",
        "I think that in terms of defense, one has to be as ready as one possibly can for every possible contingency, some of which are more likely and others less likely.",

        "President Obama and Russian President Putin have had another long telephone conversation about how to end the crisis in Ukraine.",

        "According to Poland's defense minister, the delegation yesterday was blocked by unidentified men in military fatigues.",
        "That's Suhas Rao, a researcher at the Center for Genome Architecture at Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University.",
        "He says that DNA is looped and folded in an incredibly complex way and that the way the DNA is folded can determine which genes get turned on.",
        "That's why Rao and his colleagues have created a 3D, high-resolution map of those 10,000 tiny loops.",
        "And these loops are bringing together far away sights along the DNA string and kind of organizing the genome.",
        "So tell us about the importance of this 3D map that you've created.",
        "What sort of things are affected by where these loops fall?",
        "Sure.",
        "So you have thousands of types of cells in your body, and they all have the same exact DNA inside them, but they all accomplish very different functions.",
        "And what we found is, actually, when we compared the maps of the 3D genome across different types of cells, we observed the kind of genomic origami.",
        "And so just like you can take a sheet of paper, and you can fold it up into a crane or a warrior depending on how - where you make the folds, a cell starts with the same genome.",
        "But depending on where these loops form, it can help the cell perform different functions, whether it becomes a lung cell or an immune cell or some other type of cell.",
        "So more and more, we're finding that folding drives function.",
        "And another big discovery is that the protein that connects these loops tells which genes to turn on or off.",
        "Can you talk about the implications of that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So with diseases like, I mean, cancer and many other diseases, a lot of the variance or a lot of the mutations that affect those diseases affect proteins.",
        "They lie in regions that code for proteins in genes.",
        "But a lot of the variation actually lies in these hidden switches, these regions of the genome that turn genes on and off.",
        "But they don't actually code for anything.",
        "And so, after the human genome project, we've realized that these hidden switches are really important.",
        "But what we've realized is very difficult is connecting these hidden switches to which genes they turn on and off.",
        "And we can start to understand how mutations that we know are associated with disease, but we don't know why - we can start to understand, well, what are the pathways that are affected?",
        "You're revealing some really major, important things that are determined by the shape of DNA.",
        "Now that you have this 3D map, are there other big things that we're going to discover about what's encoded in the shape of the DNA as well as the DNA itself?",
        "I mean, I think we've gotten a much better sense now with these high-resolution 3D maps of the normal shape of the genome is.",
        "But in a lot of diseases, it's possible that the 3D structure changes dramatically, and the actual cause of the disease could be because you have a different kind of 3D shape of the genome.",
        "And so I think that's an important direction that we're kind of pursuing.",
        "Now that we understand how the genome is kind of folded in its normal way, we can start to kind of edit the shape of the genome.",
        "So we go beyond the normal genome editing that's happening now where we just edit the sequence, but we actually change the folds."
