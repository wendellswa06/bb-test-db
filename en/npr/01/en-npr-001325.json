        "Well, the election is an important reflection of the enthusiasm of the Iraqi people to get on with the process of taking control of their own government and taking charge of their own sovereignty.",
        "The Americans, I think for their part, have to understand that the American military presence now is probably going to be a bigger obstacle than it is a positive element, because the American military presence is going to be the major reason why many Iraqis will look at their new government, possibly seeing it as only partially legitimate, as a puppet of the American system that's been installed there.",

        "And, in fact, they would almost welcome American sanctions 'cause this would give them a rallying cry among their own people and throughout the region to make it look like they are the ones resisting this great American hegemonic ambition in the Middle East.",
        "So I think the United States has to be very careful with its partners in the Security Council to see how it can focus narrowly and clearly on continuing their investigation into the assassination of Rafik Hariri and the other people who've been killed in Lebanon since without getting that mixed up with American ideological neocon-driven agendas about regime change in Syria and Iran and other places.",
