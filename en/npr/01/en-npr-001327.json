        "I'm Robert Feldman.",
        "I'm the chief economist for Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities here in Tokyo.",
        "Feldman says one big problem is Japan is rapidly aging, driving up health care and pensions costs.",
        "But the electoral system here favors the elderly, so most politicians are afraid to slash services.",
        "It means they can't cut medical benefits, even though they are overgenerous.",
        "There is only a 10 percent copayment for older people when they go to the doctor, and they pay no insurance premiums.",
        "So, Japan continues to shovel money towards older people, running up the national debt, instead of investing for the future.",
        "Basically what we've done is borrow money for current consumption, which is not exactly the best way to improve productivity in the economy.",
        "As in the U.S., Feldman says the problem is fundamentally political.",
        "There is an inherent myopia in the way that democracies make decisions, and unless we can redesign our democratic institutions to think about the future a little bit more than we do right now, then the sustainability of living standards is called into question.",
        "Of course, analogies only go so far.",
        "The U.S.",
        "has avoided some of the traps that have ensnared Japan.",
        "For instance, the Fed flooded the American economy with money to avoid the price deflation that has plagued Japan.",
        "And Naohiro Yashiro, who teaches economics at International Christian University in Tokyo, says to their credit, U.S.",
        "politicians are trying to force themselves to confront the debt.",
        "Japan also need such kind of device as fiscal cliff, you see.",
        "We don't have such schemes.",
        "So actually that's us who wants to, how do you say, follow the example of the United States.",
        "Feldman says voters in both countries have to look past their short-term interests and think about the long-term health of their economies.",
        "As an example, and perhaps a metaphor, he points to Japan's annual health exam, which includes body measurements."

        "You've got to go to the doctor every year, and if your waist is a little too bit, he's going to tell you about it.",
        "Once you know that, then you are responsible for doing something about it.",
        "Feldman, a trim 59-year-old, went in for his exam last year.",

        "If you've ever wondered why it's hard to stay on a diet, consider this observation from�Ralph DiLeone, a brain scientist at Yale.",
        "Where interest rates are going from now is one of those wonderful questions that if I knew for sure, I would speculate on the bond market, make tons of money and never would have to talk to people like you.",
        "Which, of course, would be a huge perk.",
        "Not everyone can get those low mortgage rates.",
        "Banks are requiring higher credit scores these days, and homes that have lost too much in value may not qualify for refinancing.",
        "Also, rates on jumbo loans of more than $417,000 are still higher than 6 percent because the government doesn't guarantee or securitize those loans.",
        "Very low interest rates have another affect, as well."

        "And that huge demand creates some serious choke points.",
        "Home appraisers are overbooked and bank office systems are overloaded.",
        "One of the biggest problems, he said, is that the short-term credit necessary for banks to grant loans has been greatly reduced.",
        "Brinkmann used to call very low rates \"\"I Love Lucy\"\" rates, as in unless you watch the show when it first aired, you probably haven't seen rates that low since.",
        "We have now gone below the \"\"I Love Lucy\"\" rates in terms of where things are now.",
        "And so you have now exceeded my ability to attempt to predict.",

        "We will get to China, but first, we just heard from Larry Abramson on the Wisconsin budget battle and the battle over the federal budget now moves to the Senate.",
        "Does anything about this year's negotiations strike you as different from years past?",
        "So when you have so much of the debate about such a small sheer of what the government takes and spends, it makes it a different kind of debate from what we've had before.",
        "And it seems to me not a particularly meaningful debate and just sort of a lot of bluster about something that may be completely unlikely to happen.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, there's the practical fact that with a still Democratic-controlled Senate and a Democratic White House, these cuts are very unlikely to go through in their current form.",
        "And also, I think in historical retrospect, we'll see an election campaign in 2010 that was largely dominated by talk about the deficit and this great fury of getting things passed of the House recently.",
        "But it is, again, most of what the federal government does is not touched by these proposals, and so it does seem a mismatch of energy and even vitriol and practical effects.",
        "Now, I'm changing the subject here to technology.",
        "I know there's one technology story, which obviously caught your eye this week, as a magazine person.",
        "Apple has decided to allow something called in-app subscriptions to newspapers and magazines from their mobile devices.",
        "The catch was that Apple was going to take 30 percent of all the revenue that came in this way and also control the information about the subscribers, which, for the publications, would be a real challenge.",
        "So almost immediately after Apple's announcement, Google came up with a plan where it was going to, like, charge 10 percent for subscriptions sold through its Android system and also let the publishers have control over the subscriber data.",
        "So there is an interesting battle going on with, I think, real implications for how, as I said, journalism is able to get revenue in the new online age.",

        "What's the news from China?",
        "And so, while it's been important for the U.S.",

        "The Interior Department is putting walruses in a kind of purgatory.",
        "They join some 250 animals and plants that deserve the protection of the Endangered Species List, but they aren't getting it.",
        "Where walrus fall on this priority system is they're a little bit low on the totem pole, you might say.",
        "Rosa Meehan manages marine mammals in Alaska for the Interior Department's Fish and Wildlife Service.",
        "She says there's no question, walrus numbers will be reduced as sea ice declines in northern Alaska.",
        "But the government has limited money and uses it for species most likely to go extinct.",
        "Meehan says the condition of walruses is less dire.",
        "That's because they live a long time and there are still lots of them.",
        "The Interior Department did list polar bears as a threatened species two years ago because of shrinking sea ice.",
        "Meehan says unlike polar bears, walruses don't need the ice to feed themselves.",
        "They can rest on land and go out and feed in the water and return to land.",
        "And so, because they have that ability to continue feeding even if there's not ice, that's a pretty dramatic difference between walruses and polar bears.",
        "But some biologists say melting sea ice threatens walruses even more than polar bears because walruses depend on sea ice for reproduction.",
