        "The adolescent brain is very sensitive to these kinds of substances.",
        "And so they continue to use it and may use it in increasing amounts and are at risk for developing problematic cannabis use.",

        "Erik Altieri directs the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML, which wants to see marijuana legalized for adult use nationwide.",
        "He says lots of research finds little harm in marijuana use.",
        "And a hidden benefit of legalization - he says it could actually reduce marijuana use among teenagers under 18.",
        "That's because we are taking marijuana off of the street corner, out of the hands of drug dealers who have nothing but incentive to sell to everyone and anyone, putting it behind the counter of a regulated business that has to check for ID, that has to answer to the government and has oversight.",
        "And in states that have legalized recreational marijuana, Altieri says there has not been an increase in use among underage teens in part because it may be harder to get and in part because the cool factor is lessened.",
        "By legalizing it and normalizing it, it's become just another everyday thing that adults partake in.",
        "It doesn't have that same draw to it that it used to."
