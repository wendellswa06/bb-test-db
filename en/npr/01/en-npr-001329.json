        "And when - or else I had to call the parents to deal with something such as this was berated by the parents with the student in the background, yelling in the background.",
        "So lack of - just lack of respect all around.",
        "I just - college didn't prepare me for that at all.",
        "A kicking, screaming rage in a 9-year-old I can understand.",
        "Calculated plotting, that's what I find hard.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So, like I said, I'm not passing judgment on the parents, but either - something in Ohio or - I don't know if this is nationwide - a congresswoman is trying to require - this was just on the radio today, require parents to volunteer in the school.",
        "Make it a requirement, get them time off their jobs to help.",

        "Where there is a routinely occurring violence, domestic violence, that they observed where there is no one monitoring what they are watching on television or via the Internet.",
        "These are all contributing factors that we want to look at as we make an assessment as to the child's potential, not only to make a threat but to act upon those threats.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And the character of the plot of assigning different roles to people, again, you hate to point fingers at TV.",
        "But doesn't that, there's so many teams assembled on TV to do - carryout various plots of some part sort or another.",

        "The other piece that I think is important to mention is the issue of imitative behavior.",
        "One of the very, very serious concerns we have about incidences such as the school shootings or suicides is that, you know, we know that there are other youngsters out there who are troubled, who have issues, who have conflicts, who need mental health support, or the guidance and assistance from a caring adult, because they look at these terrible horrific incidents and - for some there's a need or desire to want to either repeat those activities or to outdo them.",
        "And it seems to me that this particular situation that were talking about may very well have been a gesture on the part of these children to imitate something that they either heard or heard about us or saw, and maybe we were lucky because at this very tender age they may have lacked the formal sophistication to make it happen.",

        "But I would hope that the caller would acknowledge that, at the very least, if the facts are reasonably correct and the child was scolded for standing on a chair, the response or the planned response was clearly a shocking overreaction to whatever the - was that the teacher did.",
