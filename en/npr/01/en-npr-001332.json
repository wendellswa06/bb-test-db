        "Well, you look back over the last week, and we've seen several cases where Trump has tried to appeal to more moderate and independent voters, not just those core supporters who helped him win the primaries.",
        "You know, his campaign has brought in new leadership, and they're seeing the polls.",
        "He's down in nearly every national poll, most big swing state polls.",
        "Right.",
        "And there have been a lot of humanitarian and logistical questions about a large-scale deportation campaign, and maybe the Trump campaign now realizes that.",
        "But there's a big political problem here for him.",
        "A lot of supporters really want this.",
        "They backed this idea, and his campaign is all about Donald Trump being this blunt truth-teller who doesn't care about the consequences.",
        "So if he really does backtrack on something like this, that kind of undercuts that I'm-here-to-tell-the-truth argument.",
        "One of those shakeups in the campaign of course is that Trump has a new campaign manager, and now there's this possible shift on a major issue.",
        "We heard a lot about Trump expressing regret for some of the statements he's made over the course of the campaign also.",
        "I mean what do you make of all these changes?",
        "I think - I mean there have clearly been strategic shifts here, but we need to put this in some perspective.",
        "Donald Trump is still attacking people online.",
        "This morning he personally insulted Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC.",
        "In recent days, Trump surrogates have been on TV, promoting rumors that Hillary Clinton is sick or frail.",
        "I mean there's absolutely no proof of that.",
        "But we have seen these big changes, and I think the most notable one is the fact that Donald Trump is staying on script at every rally instead of riffing, and that's what's really gotten him in trouble over the course of the year.",
        "But by and large - still a very nontraditional campaign.",
        "We did get a look into that nontraditional campaign this weekend when the latest round of campaign finance reports came out.",
        "Did we learn anything new looking at these disclosures?",
        "Yeah so Donald Trump's campaign spent about $19 million in July.",
        "That's more than they've been spending month to month before, but Hillary Clinton's campaign spent two and a half times that amount.",
        "About half of what the Trump campaign is spending went to a web design company that hasn't done any political work before, though they have worked for some of Donald Trump's private companies.",
        "He did spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on his own companies again for air travel and for rental of events and office space.",
        "There's still less than a hundred people on Donald Trump's staff, and something that a lot of people who looked through these reports pointed out - the campaign spent more on those make America great again hats than on payroll.",
        "So the bottom line is the campaign is outsourcing a lot of the typical campaign work, voter outreach, data analysis to the Republican National Committee.",
        "That's NPR's Scott Detrow.",
        "Thank you very much."

        "They hate us so much.",
        "Protesters, many of whom from Baltimore's poorest African-American communities, recalled stories of police brutality, harassment or misconduct they'd experienced or witnessed.",
        "People said the city was slow to respond to the anger and the riots.",
        "Since the unrest, the Baltimore mayor, who is not running for reelection, has fired the police commissioner and hired Kevin Davis as the city's top cop.",
        "Davis openly criticizes the Baltimore Police Department's old policing strategy, one in which officers arrested first, asked questions later and left thousands with criminal records even when the cases were dropped."

        "As the president defined the role, it will be to listen, to learn and to foster dialogue, respectful dialogue with the nations of the Islamic conference.",

        "Thomas Pickering, who served as U.S.",
        "ambassador to Israel, Jordan and Russia, as well as to the United Nations, says it's the combination of force and diplomacy that's important.",
        "As you look at the history of American foreign policy, you find successes that are probably most significant when we have been strong, when we have been confident, but used that confidence to engage in negotiations.",
        "Where we have run more into difficulty is in the efforts to try to use military force to short circuit diplomacy or to cut it out entirely."
