        "It's named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who famously paid a lower tax rate than his secretary.",
        "That's not likely to really go anywhere with the Republicans, and certainly not with the Republicans in the House.",
        "The Senate Republicans, their idea, and the idea that's been put forth a couple of times now by House Republicans, is to replace the across-the-board spending cuts with even deeper cuts on a smaller portion of the federal budget.",
        "In a sense, they want to get rid of some of the defense spending cuts, but double down on cuts to programs that primarily benefit the poor.",
        "That's not likely to win much support among Democrats."

        "And that's true, in terms of the dollar amount.",
        "Eighty-five billion dollars is only a couple of percent of the overall federal budget.",

        "Again, it's, you know, we're not talking about cutting programs by half, but we're looking more like an 8 or 9 percent reduction in spending.",
        "And it's - of those remaining things that he government does, it's across the board.",
        "And so...",

        "It is kind of, really, not working very well.",

        "Yeah.",
        "That's right.",
        "It was designed to be a brain dead spending cut.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "It was.",
        "There's deliberately no opportunity to set priorities or to triage or to put money where it will do the most good and maybe take money from - where it's not doing so much good, or to do it to preserve funding and programs where the money is needed immediately and take money away from programs where, maybe, the money wouldn't be needed for a while anyway.",
        "Now it's got to be from across every line item an equal proportional amount.",
        "And so, it is, in the words of Erskine Bowles, the co-chair of the president's deficit reduction committee, stupid, stupid, stupid.",
        "It's stupid because it makes no attempt to set priorities.",
        "It's stupid because it takes money away from the things that we should be spending money on right now to boost the economy - things like public works projects - and it doesn't take money away from those things which are the biggest drivers in the deficit, namely, rising health care costs.",
