        "And certainly President Obama has said, I'm willing to talk about making cuts to entitlement programs.",
        "But if you look at the - across the spectrum of the lawmakers, they haven't been willing to make that kind of big compromise.",

        "Now, there was a separate move, of course, that the House Republicans put through, the no budget, no pay, which was going to dock the pay - dock, and not just by 9 percent but dock the pay entirely of lawmakers if they couldn't come up with a budget.",
        "But that's for next year.",

        "Last Friday, we had the Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood at the White House telling us about air traffic control towers would have to be closed or shut down overnight, long lines and long waits for planes flying between major hubs this summer.",
        "Today, we had the Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano at the White House telling us that we're going to have longer lines at Customs when you come back into the U.S., and that - waits at the border or at ports for cruise ships terminals would be longer.",
        "So, all in all, it sounds like not a great formula for the tourism business.",
        "But it's in the administration's interest to sort of maximize the sense that people have about how severe these cuts are going to be because they're trying to get lawmakers to budge off their stubborn positions and make a deal.",
        "So the hiring practices really look at criminal backgrounds and they look at job references and they look at education and they look at your capacity to physically do this job.",
        "But we don't do enough in measuring someone's capacity for emotional intelligence.",
        "On the other hand, it's sort of in the interest of Republicans to downplay the sequester, to downplay the impact.",
        "You know, philosophically, Republicans in general are advocates of smaller government and they think that a lot of what the government does now it shouldn't be doing.",
        "So they try to say, well, you know, we can - if we can have a little less government, that's probably a good thing.",
        "And do we have any sense which one is more right?",
        "Well, this is going to be a real, interesting practical test.",
        "I mean, one danger for the Democrats is that if the sequester comes into effect on Friday and there's - everybody sort of wakes up and says, huh, that wasn't so bad; for the Democrats, if they sort of overplay their hand, this might just sort of be proof for the Republicans that, well, we were spending too much and we can get along fine without it.",
        "On the other hand, if folks really are bothered, if people feel like, you know, the government services have really suffered, that could come back to haunt the Republicans as sort of the champions of the spending cuts.",
        "And couldn't what happens play into now - we just feel like we're going from deadline to deadline here.",
        "Isn't March - tell me about March 27th.",
        "That's kind of a next deadline.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's the next deadline, and that's when the government's authority to spend money altogether runs out.",
        "They're operating now on sort of a short-term lease here.",
        "And that expires at the end of March.",
        "And I think a lot of the betting now in Washington is that this sequester probably will go into effect and nothing much will happen until we get to that next deadline.",
        "At that point, we're talking about a much more severe government scale-back.",
        "It's not that everything would close.",
        "I mean, we'd still fly fighter planes and the men and women in uniform would keep doing their jobs.",
        "And all the, quote, unquote, \"\"essential government personnel\"\" will continue show up.",
        "But you'd see an even more severe dialing-back of government services if they don't make a deal to extend that short-term lease on the government here.",
        "So that'll sort of be the next pressure point when lawmakers will be under some pressure to make a deal."

        "Is that still a possibility by March 27th?",
        "Well, yeah, absolutely.",
        "And, again, if folks are not really feeling - that is, you know, the people whose opinions Congress cares about, if they're not really feeling the effects of the cuts, it'll be - the Republicans will be in a stronger position to say, as we negotiate a longer-term spending plan, let's keep the spending at right where it is, or maybe scale it back some more.",
        "If people are really crying uncle, I'm saying, oh, my planes are - have been delayed too long and if these are the folks who are dependent on Meals on Wheels are screaming bloody murder and that actually carries weight with the lawmakers, they might say, OK, let's think about how we might do this in a different way.",

        "And the UN envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, actually resigned after that.",

        "And it's really going to make the chances of a resumed peace track or negotiations very far removed.",
        "Has he consolidated his military position over the past few months?"

        "Well, he has to a certain extent.",
        "Over the last year or so, we've seen a much more focused, coordinated campaign by the Syrian army and its allies.",
        "Essentially, those allies include Lebanon Hezbollah organizations, but there are Iraqi Shi'a volunteers also fighting in Syria on behalf of the regime.",
        "And they have actually been successful.",
        "So the big question now is that - yes, the regime has been able to push the rebels back from Damascus somewhat.",
        "They've restored control of the critical roots - the coast - they've retaken Homs and making fragile gains in Aleppo in the north.",

        "Well, I think the Syrian army already is overstretched.",
        "At the beginning of the conflict, it was the Syrian army, especially The Fourth Armoured Division - the Republican guard - that was spearheading the war against the rebel forces, and they suffered high casualties.",
        "So, these days, the Hezbollah - Lebanon's Hezbollah - they are at the forefront of the offenses now, and the Syrian army is playing more of a support role.",
        "I mean, there are obviously still troops on the ground, but the crucial role they're playing now is in terms of delivering artillery power and airstrikes on rebel forces, with the Hezbollah guys spearheading the assaults on the ground.",

        "The veteran technocrat is seen as an effective, if charismatically challenged, foreign minister.",
        "But at the last rally of the race this weekend, Steinmeier bounded onto the stage at the base of the Brandenburg Gate and took rare forceful shots at his rivals.",
        "Chancellor Merkel would prefer to end the coalition with Steinmeier and his party in favor of a governing alliance with the pro-business Free Democratic Party or FDP.",
