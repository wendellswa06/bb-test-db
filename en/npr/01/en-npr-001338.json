        "So for the rest of the hour we're going to talk about an interesting new project that kicked off this week.",
        "It is the International Polar Year.",
        "You may remember 50 years ago - I remember, I'm old enough to remember - the International Geophysical Year, which is, as I said, 50 years ago when people were studying the poles for the first time.",
        "And now they're going to go back to studying them again because the ice, the polar regions are very, very important.",
        "We talked about the artic here being free of ice in the summertime, while at the other end of the Earth, in Antarctica, the ice is melting, too.",
        "And that's very important because 70 percent of all the water, all the fresh water on the planet, is locked up in that most southern of continents.",
        "And of course melting ice off the continent leads to rising sea levels.",
        "You have flooded seacoasts and not to mention potentially catastrophic changes to warm ocean currents that keep hundreds of millions of people warm in the winter.",
        "The polar seas are also, you know, home to microscopic plants and animals.",
        "We think about the poles - you see pretty pictures of the polar bears on the ice.",
        "Well, there are incredible numbers of microscopic plants and animals at the bottom of the food chain right up there that live in the ice.",
        "Of course, being at the bottom, we have the larger animal that feed on them and so on, and so on, and so on, up the food chain.",
        "So it's no surprise then that scientists want to understand the ecology of the polar regions and how they are changing due to global warming.",
        "And as I say, to learn more they are fanning out until the end of the year after two years of intensive study.",
        "And so for the rest of the hour we're going to preview the International Polar Year, talk about the kind of questions the researchers from over 60 countries hope to answer with their expeditions.",

        "Yes.",
        "Basically, we wanted time to allow a full year at least of research at both poles.",
        "And because a lot of the research activity occurs when we can access the poles, and that's usually in the summer in each polar region, and the fact that the summer in the polar regions are opposite.",
        "In the arctic, the summer is in May, June and July, and in the Antarctic it's November, December, January.",

        "We recognize that the polar regions play important roles, but there are many, many unknowns.",
        "And coming to an understanding of how it works in the whole planet system can really help us get a sense of our future.",
        "Another goal is to bring out fundamental discoveries in many research areas.",
        "There are areas that are just poised to make huge discoveries - genomics in biology, polar biology, and adaptation to change.",
        "How do these things work?",
        "In addition, leaps in medicine.",
        "There's an Arctic Human Health Initiative that many nations are joined in to look at the affects of pollution, climate change impact on disease, and circumpolar infectious disease surveillance.",

        "Well, did this lousy response in 1918 actually make the pandemic worse?",

        "That in a lot of ways was the most terrifying part of the situation, to the extent that people who were trying to organize volunteers and get - just to carry food to people who were sick, they couldn't get volunteers, or a volunteer would show up for a single shift and never be seen again; to the extent that people were actually starving to death because their neighbors and in some cases even their families were afraid to come and bring them food."
