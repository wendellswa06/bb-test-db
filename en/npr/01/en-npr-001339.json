        "And I noted that occurrence in some big cities and I was kind of curious whether that kind of alienation was limited to the cities.",
        "So I looked in some very rural areas where neighbor and family really was everything, and I was -somewhat to my surprise - found the same thing there: people starving to death because others were afraid to bring them food.",
        "And I think that was a direct result of the government lying about how bad things were.",
        "(Unintelligible)",
        "In a very few places, such as San Francisco, where they told the truth, where the government and the unions and the business leaders all signed a joint statement, huge type in the newspaper said wear a mask and save your life, even though the mask didn't do any good, that's a very different message than saying this is an ordinary influenza by another name.",
        "And San Francisco functioned.",
        "Nobody starved to death in San Francisco 'cause others were afraid to bring them food.",
        "You know, they had a pretty well organized system there to carry people to hospitals and things like that, much better than other places where people were lied to.",
        "It got so bad that Victor Vaughn, who was a very serious, sober scientist who at the time was in the war effort as the head of the Division of Communicable Diseases, he said that if this continues its current rate of acceleration for a few more weeks, civilization could easily disappear from the face of the Earth.",
        "And he wasn't really referring to the illness itself.",
        "He was referring to the way society was beginning to disintegrate.",
        "We're talking this year about the kickoff this week of the International Polar Year, studying the poles, both the north and south poles.",
        "Of course, the North Pole is basically floating sea ice, and Antarctica is a whole continent.",
        "And the pole in Antarctica's under two miles of ice, and it's laying under it.",
        "And so they're going to be looking at a lot of stuff down there.",
        "I'm talking with Mary Albert, past chair of the U.S.",
        "National Committee for the International Polar Year, Jody Deming, member of the U.S.",
        "National Committee for the International Polar Year.",
        "Our number: 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Dr.",
        "Deming, what interests you most about studying the poles, or the ice there?",
        "You hit the correct word, the ice.",
        "The ice determines so much about what happens in the Arctic Ocean.",
        "As you said, it's the ocean we have on this planet that's unique because it's covered with ice.",
        "So ice determines not only weather patterns and how the ocean flows, but how life exists in that ocean, how ecosystems are structured.",
        "And the ice itself passes through some very severe conditions as we go through the Arctic winter.",
        "And so it's an opportunity to study the limits of life on our planet.",
        "As things get very cold and very salty, it turns out in ice.",
        "So I'm interested in ecosystems structure and the changes that we're going to be seeing, that we are seeing, as climate changes - and so rapidly in the Arctic - and the types of genetic systems that we may lose the chance to learn about as we lose the ice where they live.",
        "What genes are in the ice?",
        "Well, they're all - most of them are from microbial organisms, microscopic organisms that we can't love in the same way that we love polar bears but that we should be quite interested in because they've evolved for a long time on this planet.",
        "They have very interesting genes that have helped them to survive severe conditions.",
        "We could take advantage of those genes in human health perspectives, for example.",
        "Some of these little microbes, they coat themselves up with essentially mucus to protect themselves from the severe cold.",
        "The genes that produce those compounds - those compounds themselves could be very useful in health initiatives.",
        "There's one favorite example I have of bone healing that can be facilitated by these kinds of mucoid compounds.",
        "And here in the polar environments, who would have ever thought that we might have a pool of genes there that could help us solve some of our own human conditions."

        "And so what does the global warming do to, you know, this gene pool, or the microorganisms there?",
        "Is it just simply that the melting of the ice would lose a home for where they live during the year.",
        "Well that's a good question.",
        "We'll certainly use the home that they are dependent on.",
        "The question is, can they survive in the ocean as it warms up?",

        "That's in my capacity as an astrobiologist, because I'm very interested in the extremes of life on this planet.",
        "Because - well, let me just go that direction a little bit.",
        "As an astrobiologist then, if you study what's available - what can live on this Earth under extreme conditions, then you might find what to look for in other planets out there?",
        "Well, that's the idea.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Earth is not the only planet in this solar system that has an ocean.",
        "Europa, the moon to Jupiter, has a full ocean that's larger than our ocean.",
        "And it's also capped by ice, much more ice than we have here.",
        "And our - if we ever have a chance to sample that moon, we'll be sampling the ice.",
        "So if we have any expectation of life being in that ice, we'd better fully understand the ice on this planet and what lives in it before we lose it all as the planet warms up.",
        "As the planet is warming and as the poles - and let's continue to talk about this ice for a bit - are you seeing changes in the life in the ice?",
        "And is it adapting, or what is happening?",
        "What changes are occurring?",
        "Well let me put it in a slightly broader context now, because the primary production that goes on in the Arctic Ocean, either the plants that make organic matter from CO2 in the atmosphere and sunlight, a good portion of that production that happens in the Arctic Ocean right now happens in the ice itself.",
        "So we have ice algae that are living at the base of the ice in conjunction with the ocean below.",
        "They're getting just enough light through the ice above and all their nutrients from the water below.",
        "They flourish early in the spring, they fall out, they fuel the life that lives at the bottom of the ocean, and go up the food change from there.",
        "Larger crustaceans and mollusks, the seals and fish that feed on them, the polar bear that feed on the seals.",
        "And there you have the whole ecosystem."

        "Well, as we lose the ice, we shift away from this ice algal production to an open water system like the rest of the world's oceans.",
        "And the rest of the world oceans don't support the same sort of higher trophic levels, or larger animals, that we know.",
        "And one area we might want to be quite concerned about is the area of fisheries.",
        "Most of our major fisheries of the world are at high latitudes, if you've ever thought about it, and we're warming those high latitudes.",

        "One effort I'll be involved with in Greenland is looking at how the snow - and I'll explain here now - snow that's more than a year old we call firn.",
        "So in central Greenland it's so cold that the snow never melts.",
        "It just piles up for centuries and centuries, and thousands of years.",
        "And on the surface you have snow as we know it, is less than a year old, but that doesn't melt.",
        "So below that it's about 100 meters of firn, which is really old snow that becomes compacted.",
        "Thank you for being on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And firn serves as an archive for old air so that we're looking at how we can - what's the interaction between the structure of the firn and the air within the firn with the ultimate goal of being better able to use chemistry of firn air records to look at the atmospheric composition before the industrial revolution, or around the time of the industrial revolutions, so that we can actually go into the firn and study air that was in the atmosphere at that time.",
        "So the climate is stored in that air?",
        "The climate is stored in that air, and contaminants are stored in that air, too.",
        "I'm partnering with some French from Grenoble in France who are measuring mercury in the firn air to see, you know, our current mercury emissions.",
        "We don't have a baseline for what mercury was in the past.",
        "And if we can understand how the system works, we may be able to determine what mercury content was in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution.",
        "Now we've heard news that the Greenland ice sheet is melting three times faster than they had thought it would be.",
        "Is that part of your bailiwick or is that someone else who would be studying that?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, I mean all of this involves many, many researchers, so Jody and I aren't the only ones involved.",
        "There's researchers form many nations looking at many aspects.",
        "And actually ice sheet stability is the topic that - and climate change in ice sheets - is a topic that many in the United States will be studying using satellites from NASA to look at large patterns of melt, and using geologists and geophysicists to understand how does the surface melt percolate down through the ice and enable the ice to break up and slide off of the ice sheet, off of the continent faster, to understand how the mechanism works.",
        "So I'm one small player in one very large system.",
        "And many countries - we talked about 60 countries being involved.",
        "Why so many?"
