        "I just wanted to comment on - I have lived in Alaska all my life and I've noticed a change ever since, you know, probably about, like, around 10 years old and the winters that we up here.",
        "I mean we used to have winters where, you know, like snow would, you know, be covering up all the way up to your driveway or all the way up to your garage door.",
        "But in the last 10 years, 10 or 12 years, it's been - we've had really just weak winters up here, you know, like - as if, if you're a snowboarder or a skier and there's not much time for you to actually go snowboarding or skiing.",
        "The winters were really warm.",
        "Not a lot of snowfall at all, you know.",
        "It would get cold, you know, in February.",
        "And we have this kind of warming period in February up here, and it's so kind of constant that construction builders up here can kind of plan around it.",

        "And we've had like, you know, in the past I would say like three years or so there's birds still kind of like flying around in huge flocks in the middle of January and February - and I don't mean ravens or anything like that - but normally when you wouldn't see birds you do then.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And our captain had to take some serious measures in anticipation of passing through a very narrow strait.",
        "At that time of the year, historically, no ship had ever passed through Belle Strait or Fury and Hecla Strait, because those straits are known to be completely blocked by ice and something we call multi-year ice, very old ice that just clogs the straits.",
        "So as we entered the strait, we were all absolutely shocked to find that it was wide open, not a single bit of sea ice anywhere.",
        "And we sailed through for the first time that late in the fall.",
        "We went through two straits like that.",
        "So this is just witnessing the changes that have happened - the loss of ice, the opening of these navigable passageways.",
        "It's going to mean a change of thinking internationally about how we look to the north for various navigational issues.",
        "Why is the warming occurring so much quicker in the polar regions?",
        "Why are we seeing this kind of melting in the open sea, the sea opening up so much, Dr. Albert?",
        "The polar regions are more sensitive to climate change, perhaps, than the mid-latitudes.",
        "Because even under the coldest conditions, snow and ice as natural materials are much closer to their melting point than other surface materials, you know, like sands and stone, and things like that.",
        "So they're sensitive to the environment, and in addition there are important feedbacks that occur.",
        "For example, when arctic sea ice melts, the sun, instead of being reflected off of the top of the snow back into space, goes down into the ocean and it warms the water.",
        "And the warmer water then reflects heat that goes back up and adds more heat into our greenhouse effect.",
        "So there are feedbacks caused by the different nature of the covering surface.",
        "We call the albedo, the amount of sunlight that's reflected versus the amount that's absorbed.",
        "And so when more is absorbed, it increases warming.",
        "George in San Francisco, welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Thanks, Ira.",
        "We would like to know if we can demonstrate a correlation between movements of massive ice sheets such as you've mentioned -Greenland, South Pole and Arctic ice sheets, maybe a couple of miles of ice -between the movement of those, maybe miniscule movements that wouldn't notice if you're in camped right on the ice, but perhaps the water that trickles down and lubricates the surfaces beneath, perhaps all the way to bedrock, might cause slight movements in the ice that could trigger seismic activity.",
        "You mean at the ice, or someplace else - where you're living?"

        "Let me see if I can get an answer.",
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "Just as ocean waves can propagate huge distances between continents in long waves, seismic activity, and activity that propagates in a seismic way through the earth, can propagate long distances and be heard further away.",
        "I don't know the extent to which we can sense ice sheet movement from far way, but I would think seeing the evidence that ice sheets leave on rocks that they've gone over.",
        "They gouge the rocks; it leaves a clear imprint on the surface after an ice sheet has been in a place.",
        "It would not be at all surprising if you could detect movement seismically.",
        "That ice sheet is how heavy?",
        "Well, it's basically - the Greenland ice sheet is two miles thick in the center.",
        "I don't know the total weight, but that's a huge mass.",
        "We could take that mass and we could measure the mass, and then we could calibrate that against various leverages and pressures that it exerts on the landmass under it.",
        "And then we could be looking for or anticipating any changes in the seismicity in the immediate area and possibly radiating from it.",
        "I think you need to file a paper with the NSF to try that out.",
