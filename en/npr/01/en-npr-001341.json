        "Yes, I imagine that there are people who have started to measure this.",
        "Yeah, it's very interesting because I don't think people have any idea of how much ice locked up in Greenland or Antarctica.",

        "Well, quite a bit.",
        "If it would melt, it would - if all the Greenland ice sheet would melt, Boston, New York, Washington, D.C., large parts of Florida would be underwater, as well as L.A.",

        "It's a way of, you know, just reestablishing frozen materials that we need to sustain our present ocean levels?",
        "Describe what you mean to me.",
        "You take water, you pump it out of the ocean, and pump it where?",
        "Pump it up onto the North Pole.",

        "And possibly even on certain ice ridges in the Antarctic as well.",

        "And he said we walked across it.",

        "Yes, yes.",

        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Good day.",
        "First of all, the solution for global warming is nuclear winter.",
        "And the liquid water that lubricates the ice sheets is also melting the ice sheets because it has more energy in it than the ice can absorb, which leads to my question.",
        "Which is measuring the temperature of the ice sheets so we know how fast they're warming up, especially at the last degree, the phase-change degree between solid and liquid, which the difference is between 32-degree solid and 32-degree liquid is 80 degrees.",
        "Which means if it warms up, absorbs one degree of temperature of energy each year, it would take 80 years to do the change.",
        "And so please speak to measuring temperature of the ice.",
        "Yes, it is true that there's a huge amount of energy locked up in phase change.",
        "The change from water to ice takes a lot more energy than it does just to change the temperature one degree.",
        "These days, the way we're measuring temperature of massive areas is through NASA's satellites.",
        "And the satellites have sensors that can detect at least surface temperatures of the ice sheets, and they have mapped areas where, you know, how much melting is occurring and how it's warming in other areas.",
        "That was a really sensitive indicator of climate change, and so these changes that occur change the structures snow not only from ice to water, but within the structure itself.",
        "And all that's observable in satellite imagery.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",

        "In addition to the sea ice, there's permafrost observatories throughout the circum-arctic in Russia, northern Scandinavia, Canada, Alaska to look at how fast the ground is warming, because the permafrost is thawing and that's causing huge problems with infrastructure, and roads and things.",
        "In addition, there are atmospheric observatories monitoring, again, around the arctic and all the different nations, the chemical content of the atmosphere - how is the ozone changing?",
        "What's the chemical composition?",

        "So for example, on the Bering Sea, the coast of Alaska, we've already seen in the last few years there are complete crash of the ecosystem with all the players shifting.",
        "Things are in a recovery mode now, so we have a chance to study what it's like to see an ecosystem crash and recover.",
        "But we have to expect that these things are going to happen as warmer waters move further and further north, as warmer air temperatures reduce the availability of ice to maintain the current ecosystem."
