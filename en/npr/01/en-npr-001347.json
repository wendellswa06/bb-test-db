        "There's your surgeon, but there's also the person who is keeping you alive, known as the anesthesiologist.",
        "And while people will invest time in finding out who's doing their surgery, nine times out of 10, they don't have a clue who's going to be keeping them alive while they're having that surgery, and that's the job of the anesthesiologist.",
