        "This one would seek to drive mortgage rates for homebuyers as low as four and a half percent.",
        "The Treasury is not talking about this plan publicly, and sources close to the matter tell NPR, quote, \"\"that nothing is imminent.\"\" But as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, the move is under consideration.",
        "Sources say the super-low interest rates would only be for home purchases, not refinancings.",
        "The idea is that the trouble in the housing market is at the heart of the financial crisis, and lower interest rates would prop up that market by making it cheaper to buy a home.",
        "So the government's considering moves that could create the lowest interest rates in more than 50 years.",
        "This is a great plan.",
        "This would have a very significant effect on the housing market.",
        "Chris Mayer is an economist and dean at Columbia Business School who's been calling for this kind of action.",
        "He's been arguing that the credit crisis is making mortgage rates artificially high right now compared to other interest rates, and he says that there are things the government could do at little or no cost to the taxpayer.",
        "He says if Treasury is in fact considering that, this is a very big deal.",
        "The government announcing a mortgage below five percent would for many people be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to borrow money at that rate and buy a house, an opportunity that their parents never saw in their lives.",
        "Mayer says home prices have already fallen sharply around the country, so they're getting more affordable.",
        "So he thinks the low rates would entice a lot of people who've been waiting to buy homes.",
        "My estimates suggest that as many as a million and a half to two and a half million home purchasers would come into the market."
