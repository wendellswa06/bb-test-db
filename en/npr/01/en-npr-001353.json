        "As lender of last resort, the Fed's job is to stand ready to provide liquidity to prevent credit markets from seizing up just as they have done in the past few days.",
        "And as a scholar who studied the Great Depression, Bernanke is very familiar with the consequences of failing to take such actions, and he's on record of having urged proactive policies of this sort in Japan when the central bank there was faced with a banking crisis 10 years ago.",
        "So as for imposing policy on the fly, yes, they've kind of had to do that because who could have predicted the way things have evolved?",

        "What the Fed is having to do is trying to assess on the fly whether those mortgages are legitimate collateral for the loans it wants to make.",
        "Now, I believe the Fed is accepting only the very highest grade mortgages, mortgage backed securities in its discount window lending.",
        "So in that sense its exposure to risk is probably pretty small.",

        "So the Fed's decision to open the discount window to primary dealers was clearly an attempt to prevent just such a scenario.",

        "But ultimately the value of a company is what somebody else is willing to pay for it - no more, no less.",
        "And the problem that all these financial firms are facing is that there - as they're dealings become more complex and more sophisticated, they also become more opaque.",
        "And what that means is that it becomes harder for outsiders, that is to say potential buyers, to determine just exactly what assets they have on their books and what risks they're exposed to.",
