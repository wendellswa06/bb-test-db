        "An economy growing too slowly, too few ladders of opportunity: There's a consensus that those are big problems, but not much agreement on what a new war on declining mobility might look like.",
        "Mara Liasson, NPR News, Washington.",
        "Hundreds of Nigerian women and children have been freed from captivity by the Nigerian military in the past week.",
        "They had been held captive by the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram.",
        "Associated Press correspondent Michelle Faul spoke with some of the women, who are now at a refugee camp in Yola, Nigeria.",
        "I asked her if any of the rescued women or girls were part of the Chibok girls, the focus of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign.",
        "That's not clear.",
        "The army has actually rescued nearly 700 women in the past week.",
        "And then last night, they said that they had come upon another group of 260, so you're talking a lot, a lot of women.",
        "The women that we spoke to in Yola were the first group to reach the safety of a refugee camp.",
        "None of them who were registered said that they were from Chibok.",
        "Michelle, what happens with these women and children now?",
        "Where do they go?",
        "Well, they're going to stay in the refugee camp probably for several weeks.",
        "A team of people trained in trauma counseling arrived in Yola this morning.",
        "And I spoke with the doctor who's in charge of the team, and he has counseled other women who've been held for many months by Boko Haram.",
        "And he said some of them are so brainwashed that they actually have come to believe this Islamic extremist ideology and believe that Boko Haram is good and that the government of Nigeria and the military are evil.",
        "And it really takes a lot of hard work to put these women back into a mental frame of mind where they can continue with their lives.",
        "Do you have any sense, Michelle, of what sort of stigma these women and girls may face if they do go back to their home communities?",
        "I think there's a very real danger that some of them may be shunned because it is assumed that any young girl who was held was raped.",
        "I have spoken with other young women who escaped from Boko Haram on their own, and they told me that they were not.",
        "But I must say I wondered.",
        "When I was looking at the very many children and babies who came in this new group, I did wonder whose children those were.",
        "Is there one story that you heard from the women at the refugee camp who've been rescued - one story that has really stuck with you about what they endured?",
        "And, you did not dispute the charges against you.",
        "And I'm happy and proud to support a candidate who loves this country so much."

        "Can you offer some guidance for surrogates and their handlers?",
        "Well, I think, the first thing that you ask of surrogates is that they do no harm.",

        "You're out there to talk about the candidate's ideas, the candidate's campaign.",
        "You're not out there to be an analyst.",
        "And I think that's where a lot of the surrogates get in trouble, is that they feel like they're going to be out there and be a professional pundit.",
        "And your job is to, right before you're about to make a statement, ask yourself, is this going to do the candidate harm and B, am I being an analyst or an advocate?",
        "Jennifer Palmieri, it sounds like a fine line to tread because you're asking someone who has to be prominent enough in his or her own right to make it valuable to have them there, but not to be speaking in their own right.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, the value, normally, is not on what the surrogate is going to say, but in the fact that they may draw people out and get the attention of people that would not otherwise pay attention to the candidate.",
        "So that is what the value is.",
        "And what you have to balance is it's convincing them that they should not make news.",
        "You know, what I will often say is, you know, you understand that the press will take anything you say and they will try to use it against you, and you just have to assume that that is what they're going to try to do to make them extra special, guarded.",
        "And also, I think it's best to not say — you know, don't try to represent the candidate, tell people why you are for the candidate.",
        "And then, you might be better off.",
        "But as we heard in your montage that doesn't necessarily protects you.",
        "Now, I want to ask you about a particular kind of surrogate and your experiences — the spouse.",
        "I mean, how can the national press secretary, the campaign manager or whoever presume to tell surrogate number one, the spouse, what to say and what not to say?",
        "Well, I mean, it's tough.",
        "I mean, we probably have similar experiences here, but I always thought that Elizabeth Edwards was somebody who is, you know, she was speaking for the candidate so often that you…",
        "Right.",
        "It was very hard to - and she has - she's been through so many of these campaigns before that she was much, I think, much better of a surrogate than - now, Ms. Romney was a wonderful surrogate.",
        "I mean, she was somebody who was an incredible validator on the issues of family and the issues of exactly who Mitt Romney was.",
        "The challenge was here is somebody who's not used to dealing with the national media."

        "I think that they are.",
