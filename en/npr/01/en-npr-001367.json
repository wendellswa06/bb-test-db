        "Louis had seen them drive by and heard them beating Till.",

        "In August 1955, although Emancipation had occurred almost a hundred years earlier, much of the Deep South remained unchanged.",
        "The murder of young Emmett Till, accused of whistling at a white shopkeeper's wife, horrified America.",
        "Ordinarily, whites weren't prosecuted for killing blacks in segregated Mississippi.",
        "But the Till murder so shocked the nation, it forced the state into trying shopkeeper Roy Bryant and his stepbrother, J.W.",
        "Milam.",
        "And the state allowed a first, a surprise black witness Willie Louis, who was then known as Willie Reed.",
        "At that time, it was virtually unheard of for a black person to testify against a white, particularly if that person grew up as a sharecropper, depended on whites for his livelihood.",
        "George Curry is editor-in-chief of the National Newspaper Association's wire service, which provides news to the nation's black newspapers.",
        "He's also finishing a book on the Till case.",
        "Curry says immediately after Till's murder, local black leaders worked together to spirit Willie Reed away to Chicago.",
        "They knew his life was in danger.",
        "Reed had seen a group of white men in a pickup truck's cab, with their black employees and a cowering boy on the bed of the pickup.",
        "By the time the trial started, in September, Reed was in Chicago but he agreed to return to Mississippi to testify at the trial.",
        "George Curry says the courage that took was unimaginable.",
        "Especially having escaped Mississippi, knowing that the risk involved, and then to voluntarily come back and stand up and testify and point out J.W.",
        "Milam in that courtroom was phenomenal.",
        "The atmosphere in the courtroom was tense.",
        "About a half-dozen members of the black press came to record the proceedings.",
        "Simeon Booker covered the trial for Jet Magazine.",
        "He recalls how the black reporters were greeted in an oral history for Black Books and Reviews.",
        "I remember Sheriff Strider, who came in the courtroom every morning: Hello, niggers.",
        "Willie Reed identified Roy Bryant and J.W.",
        "Milam, as Till's assailants in open court.",
        "Sixty-seven minutes later, an all-white jury acquitted both men, a virtually guaranteed outcome that made Reed's testimony all the more courageous."

        "And so there was finger-pointing there that seemed to indicate that people wanted to blame Iran for that.",
        "In another case, we've had a number of denial-of-service attacks against banks in the U.S., denial-of-service attacks go after the website of a business.",
        "And again, there, the finger-pointing has been against Iran.",

        "There are certain methods or tools that they used in multiple attacks.",
        "And so that allows forensic investigators to create a sort of family of attacks and attribute them to single actors.",
        "And in some cases, you know, when actors are - when they're active over a long period of time and engaged in a number of attacks, they will eventually make mistakes.",
        "And so it can be possible sometimes to attribute attacks to an individual or to an organization.",

        "But, of course, if they get information that's helpful, they can hand it over to the government and get paid for it.",
        "So it's often hard to know where it's a directed attack - a nation-state directed attack, or whether it's sort of freelancers operating under the assumption that they will be rewarded with for what they do.",
