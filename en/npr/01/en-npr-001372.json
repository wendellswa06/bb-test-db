        "Absolutely.",
        "In some cases, in fact, the way the studies have defined it, a job saved would be perhaps a government job that was going to be eliminated otherwise, and wasn't because of the stimulus money.",

        "The Maliki government is foot-dragging on that effort.",

        "How do you make them happy so they don't return to the barricades and start shooting at the Iraqi forces and American forces?",
