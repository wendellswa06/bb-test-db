        "Yes, we do know.",
        "This is a very understood and familiar event, where you get a small fatigue crack in the skin of the plane, and if it's been undetected, as it clearly was in this case, that can weaken the structure.",
        "And what happens when a plane climbs to altitude is that there's a gradual change in the pressure inside the cabin and the pressure outside the cabin.",
        "Most airplane cabins are pressurized to the equivalent of 8,000 feet, which means that once the plane's above 8,000 feet, there's an increasing differential between those two pressures."

        "So by the time it gets to cruise, which could be 34,000, where this event happened, or, say, 36,000, it's like a balloon where the pressure inside the balloon is greater than that outside.",
        "And if the skin of the balloon bursts, then the air escapes from it.",
        "That's exactly the phenomenon that happened to this Southwest Airlines 737.",
        "And it goes by the scary name of explosive decompression.",
        "If what happened is known, if the phenomenon is well-understood, is prevention well-understood?",
        "Prevention ought to be flawless, and it clearly isn't because obviously if this happened, even when there's a regime in place to specifically check 737s of this age for that condition - because there's a record of this happening - which means, I think, first of all, that the regime is not rigorous enough, and secondly, it's not frequent enough.",
        "And part of the - is part of the problem the fact that Southwest, like a lot of airlines, does a lot of its maintenance overseas?",
        "I don't think you can connect those dots quite so easily.",
        "I am reluctant - I don't want to sound xenophobic.",
        "It doesn't follow necessarily that if you ship maintenance overseas that it's going to be done less well than it would be in the U.S.",
        "I mean, obviously it's being shipped there because the labor costs are far lower.",
        "It doesn't mean the competence of the people doing the tests is any less.",
        "But what really matters here, and this is the responsibility in the first place of the airline, what really matters is how well those maintenance checks which are done, how closely they're supervised.",
        "In the case of Southwest, they do a lot of - the major checks in the life of an airplane are called heavy maintenance, and Southwest do it -we don't know yet if the last check done on this plane was done in El Salvador, but in fact Southwest does do a lot of its heavy maintenance in El Salvador.",
        "And I believe that the airline has, say, two people down there all the time supervising these checks.",
        "But you have to remember that this business is intensive, and they work three shifts, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",
        "It takes around nine hours to check each plane for these cracks.",
        "The problem is that the technology used is designed to react to known problems in the metal, not necessarily, so far, unknown problems in the metal.",
        "It's far too arcane a subject to go into in any detail, but that's the basic situation."

        "So what we need to be worried about here is we're not picking up, in the earliest stage, if there's a flaw in the skin of the airplane.",
        "And every incident of the kind that happened on Friday should be regarded as a precursor to a possible crash.",
        "I think there's far too much complacency in saying: Well, the plane got down okay and Southwest has an impeccable safety record, which it does.",
        "In 40 years it's not lost one passenger.",
        "Not one in flight.",
        "The other part is they fly one type of plane.",
        "It's one of the reasons for their success, their business model.",
        "They fly the 737 in various models.",
        "This plane is among its older planes.",
        "Yeah, well, you've got a conjunction here of frequent flying, every day - each plane in the fleet probably flies six or seven flights a day.",
        "What matters crucially in terms of the decompression is the number of times the pressure changes each day, because that is what, in the end, adds up.",
        "It adds up in a way that causes metal fatigue.",
        "So you've got that, the number of times these Southwest planes are flown each day, and then you've got the age of the plane.",
        "In this case, the plane was 15 years old.",
        "It had done about 46,000 cycles - a cycle is a technical term for takeoffs and landings per day - which is a very high number of cycles for a plane of that age.",
        "And so it means that it's almost certain, from this episode, that we need to have more frequent checks on not only planes of that age but maybe younger planes too.",
        "And the fact is they seem to have found cracks.",
        "After they grounded that whole fleet of 737-300s over the weekend to inspect more closely, they found more cracks.",
        "Yeah, I think that's quite alarming too.",
        "I think, in a way, there's a paradox here, which is fascinating, which is that because there are so few serious crashes now, because the safety regime is so effective, that we've become tolerant of close calls.",
        "And this was certainly a close call.",
        "But my question is: How close do you need to get?",
        "No, but I've noticed this, that every time you get a major episode, like the one on Friday, a lot of other incidents, which normally would not be reported, do get reported because there's a sort of alertness to it.",
        "Dealing with bus - the NTSB is stretched very thin.",
        "They have to cover basically every incident involving transportation.",
        "People don't realize that they're not just dealing with airlines.",
        "And I think we depend a lot on - their integrity is very high.",
        "They have very good people there, and they should be making recommendations on the basis of what they find, in this case to the FAA, which is a far more bureaucratic and slow-moving organization."
