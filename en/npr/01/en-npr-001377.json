        "Now, we fly the smaller jets, but I will end up often on a flight that is three to four hours long, which doesn't sound very regional, if you think about it.",
        "And the planes don't have TVs, and they don't have headphone jacks.",
        "I think people get upset when they get on planes like that.",
        "In addition, those sized planes don't accommodate the large rollerboards.",
        "So you have to check them at the plane and pick them up when you get off.",
        "That's actually a nice thing, but people don't understand it, and they get very frustrated.",
        "When you add that up with TSA, for people that aren't accustomed to going through security, that can be really confusing and difficult.",
        "So I think you buy a ticket and assume you're going to be on a plane at least the size of a 737, and you get on a jet that only seats 66 people, and you're flying from, I don't know, Columbus, Ohio, to - let me think, what I have done really that's really a long flight?",
        "Hmm.",
        "I don't know, I can't remember offhand, but...",
        "I bet you've got a Tampa in there.",
        "Yeah, you're three and a half hours on that plane with one lavatory.",

        "That's a sure sign that we're unhappy with that.",
