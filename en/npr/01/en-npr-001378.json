        "Because they don't know because if there's a plane of 150 people, 130 are probably paying a different price.",
        "That infuriates customers at both ends of the scale, because someone who flies from coast to coast and got a $99 fare one day wonders why the next time it's $999, and the business traveler who always pay $999 wonders why that person sitting next to him got a $99 fare.",
        "Wasn't the tradeoff for airline deregulation supposed to be cheaper flights?",

        "And the flight to San Antonio got us delayed because we got stuck 30 minutes in the - what you call, in Dallas where they call - they're waiting for the plane to get to the terminal, and we just feel that - is there any study shown that more people are missing flights because they're leaving in a hurry.",
