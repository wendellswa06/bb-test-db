        "Congratulations, 125 years of Spelman.",
        "You've been at the helm for the past 4 years now, I guess?",
        "Yes.",
        "I started at Spelman in 2002, and it's a real pleasure to be there now that we're celebrating our 125th anniversary of educating women who change the world.",
        "Speaking of educating women who change the world, you recently got some good news from a ranking of colleges.",
        "Why don't you tell us about that?",
        "Well, I was very delighted to see that Spelman College was represented in all of the national rankings: the U.S.",
        "News & World Report, Princeton Review.",
        "But the one that I was most excited about was the Washington Monthly.",
        "And they look at three factors: social mobility, research and community service.",
        "And I was delighted to see that in terms of social mobility, Spelman was ranked number one.",
        "So recently, we had a Roundtable panel, our everyday Roundtable that got into some of the challenges facing HBCUs.",

        "We don't need black colleges.",
        "We don't need white colleges.",
        "That's just old hat.",
        "We need non-racial institutions of higher education.",
        "We have to see that race-identifiable colleges are anachronistic.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "Because in addition, of course, to being all female, Spelman is a historically black college.",
        "I think that there's a need for diversity in education.",
        "There's a need for women's colleges as well for historically black colleges as - and, of course, Spelman is both.",
        "I think it is important for all colleges to be open to everyone, and Spelman, of course, has always been available to anyone who wanted to apply.",
        "Having said that, though, I think it's important to say that - and I speak as someone who has been educated entirely myself at predominantly white institutions and spent most of my professional life working in predominantly white institutions.",
        "And what I would say is, of course, there are many excellent institutions where African-Americans students can be well educated, but there is something special about coming to an institution where you can say this place was built for me."

        "The role of a Boy Scout troop leader is so fundamentally different than that of a one-time-a-year military recruiter that it's just ludicrous to equate the two.",
        "Moreover, the government maintains that mandating equal access for the military involves not speech but conduct.",
        "It does not affect the law schools' internal composition.",
        "The faculty members, Reeder notes, can protest anytime they want."

        "The government's ultimate rebuttal is that no law school has to do anything.",
        "Schools can even keep military recruiters off campus entirely, but then there'll be no federal money for anything at the university or, as the legal maxim goes: `He who pays the piper calls the tune.",
        "The schools counter that the law imposes unconstitutional conditions, that the strings the Congress has attached are unconstitutional.",
        "Again, Josh Rosenkranz.",
        "The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions says that the government is allowed to tie strings in certain circumstances to decide how its money is going to be spent, but it does not get to bind the speaker.",
        "In short, the schools contend that the government cannot force an institution to carry the military's message by cutting off all funding to a whole university when only a small part of that university has defied the government's command.",
        "`If the government can attach those kinds of strings,' the schools say, `what will stop it next from cutting off funds to schools that do stem cell research or perform abortions at university hospitals?",
