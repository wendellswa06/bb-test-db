        "Earlier this week, I spoke with the author of that story, Nicholas Thompson, who also wrote the new book, \"\"The Hawk and the Dove: Paul Nitze, George Kennan, and the history of the Cold War.\"\" Thompson explained how Perimeter works.",
        "If there's a crisis, somebody in the Defense Ministries has to turn it on, so that's the first step.",
        "It then tries to find evidence that there's been a nuclear hit on the Soviet Union.",
        "If it determines that there has been a hit, then it tries to communicate back to the Defense Ministries.",
        "And if it can talk to them, it says, okay, humans are still alive.",
        "I don't need to work.",
        "I'll shut off.",
        "But if it can't communicate with them, then it knows there's been a crisis.",
        "We've been hit by a nuclear warhead and all the lines of communications with the Defense Ministries have been taken out.",
        "So now, we need to bypass all the traditional layers of command authority, and suddenly, the ability to launch a nuclear retaliatory strike is given to some junior official in a bunker.",
        "So suddenly, there's the capacity for the Soviet Union - even though the entire leadership is dead - to still strike back and destroy the United States.",
        "You did talk to many senior American officials: James Woolsey, former senior CIA director; George Shultz, the former secretary of state, who thought that this was a fantasy.",
        "They just didn't believe that anything like this existed.",
        "Well, once it's explained - I mean, they believed that it's real once there's evidence and once it's shown.",
        "But the amazing thing is that we weren't told about this system.",
        "George Shultz, secretary of state when this thing went online, he wasn't told.",
        "And okay, so now why didn't the Soviet Union tell us about it?",
        "Right.",
        "If it was supposed to be a deterrent, why didn't they tell us?",
        "And the reason they didn't tell us, there are a couple of reasons.",
        "One, they're extremely secretive.",
        "They didn't tell their own arms negotiators.",
        "Number two is if you tell the United States about it, there's a better chance that we could disable, or trick it, or destroy it.",
        "But then the third reason is that it wasn't built as a classic deterrent.",
        "It was built to deter the Soviet Union.",
        "It was built to prevent this issue of launch on false warning.",
        "And that is the Soviet radars pick up what they think is an American nuclear strike.",
        "Now, it might not be an American nuclear strike.",
        "It may be an eclipse or it may be a flock of geese.",
        "But they think they only have 10 minutes in order -whether to decide whether to retaliate before they're all killed.",
        "If you have this doomsday machine, it means you don't feel like you need to respond immediately."

        "Hmm",

        "My sense is that overall, it made us safer.",
        "I'm wondering how plausible that theory is, though?",
        "If SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, which became known as Star Wars, was very consciously designed as a deterrent and was publicized by the United States…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…as a deterrent, it seems odd that the Soviets wouldn't do the same with this.",
        "Well, the Soviets just thought a lot differently about deterrence theory than we did.",
        "I mean, the closest parallel is we had an airborne command center flight during the entire Cold War, so that if the Soviet Union blew up Washington, we could have responded.",
        "We had airplanes in the sky 24 hours a day.",

        "Now, Spelman has been blessed with generous alums and donors, including Bill and Camille Cosby.",
        "What do you think separates Spelman from some of the colleges like Clark Atlanta and Morris Brown in the same region that may not be able to do same kind of fundraising?",
        "Implied in your question is that Spelman is a wealthy institution.",
        "And what I like to say is that Spelman is a healthy institution.",
        "One of the reasons we are healthy is because we have a longstanding practice, a very disciplined practice of not spending money we don't have.",
        "So we have been blessed to have received gifts - not only the Cosby gift, which came in the 1980s - but gifts that came in the ‘20s and ‘30s.",
        "And dollars that were invested, and that money has grown over time, so our endowment has been built up.",

        "But what is essential to any college's fiscal health, including the fiscal health of Spelman, is active alumnae participation.",
        "When you look at the alumnae rate of participation at Spelman College over a five-year period, it is 79 percent - which is fabulous.",
        "But if you look at it over an annual period, it's about 16 percent.",
        "One of the things that we are focused on is encouraging our alumnae to recognize that they need to give every year.",
        "It would certainly transform our ability to fund more of our students in terms of financial aid and scholarships.",
        "And I think it's a real education process.",
        "Every school, I think, really needs to focus on this.",
        "And sometimes, you know, it takes money to raise money.",
        "It costs money to send up the mailings.",
        "It costs money to do the telethons.",
        "It costs money to do some of the things that more affluent, predominantly white institutions have been doing for many years.",
        "But Spelman, I think, is in a position to be a model for other historically black colleges in the sense that we are really focused on this.",
        "And we believe, if given the opportunity and given the information, our alumnae will respond to our every woman, every year effort.",
        "Moving beyond Spelman, how do you think a sort of systemic issue of funding historically black colleges and universities could be addressed?",
        "Well, certainly, historically black colleges and universities have made a tremendous contribution to the education of our population, and that needs to be perhaps more widely acknowledged than it is.",
        "One of the things that you can say, if you look at the leadership of our African-American community, you will find that graduates of historically black colleges and universities are very well represented.",
        "But the reality is in local communities, some of the smaller, perhaps lesser-known historically black colleges have been contributing greatly to that local economy in terms of taking students who are sometimes under-prepared because of the inequities of our K through 12 educational system and helping them move from, perhaps, first generation college to college graduate to contributing member of the economy, and contributing in terms of civic participation.",
        "That's a very important legacy.",
        "It is true that there are some colleges that are really struggling.",
        "But it is important, I think, to continue to recognize that these colleges and universities are serving populations that do not have ready access to other institutions.",
        "And that's an important role.",
        "You know, I'm thinking here, specifically about Morris Brown…",
        "Yes."

        "…and it may be delicate for you to comment on other school, but that college - which is right in the same region as you - has had so much trouble financially and even academically.",
        "Is there any way to strengthen partnerships between historically black colleges and universities that are in the same region?",
        "How do you interact with the other schools, because Atlanta is really a hub for the HBCUs?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The Atlanta University Center Consortium represents Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta University, The Interdenominational Theological Center - which is also known as ITC - and Morehouse School of Medicine.",
        "Morris Brown, when it was an accredited institution, was also a member.",
        "Since it has lost its accreditation, it is no longer a member.",
        "And that is, you know, an unfortunate circumstance.",
        "However, when we were all together as part of the Atlanta University Center Consortium and continuing - the schools that continue to be members - we do work together in a variety of ways.",
        "For example, Clark Atlanta, Morehouse College and Spelman College share a dual degree engineering program.",
        "We have exchanged relationships with other schools - Georgia Tech, the University of Michigan, other engineering schools - but the office which supports those dual degree engineering students is collectively supported by the three undergraduate institutions of the Atlanta University Center.",
        "So we are able to save some money as the result of keeping out dollars together and combining resources in a variety of ways.",
        "But we are also part of a larger consortium of schools in the greater Atlanta area known as the Atlanta Regional Consortium of Higher Education, sometimes referred to as ARCH.",
        "And that's important, too, because historically black colleges do play an important role in higher education, but we are also part of the wider world of education.",
        "And we want to be in relationship with predominantly white institutions, as we are Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia Tech, Georgia State, Agnes Scott College, as well as the ones with whom we have a historic relationship.",
        "Finally, in your book Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria, you provide a different perspective on what some people have called self-segregation.",
        "If someone is listening now who's heard everything you've had to say, but still isn't necessarily sold on the need for historically black colleges in the year 2006 - I mean, make an argument for why this isn't self segregation, or isn't just self segregation.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's actually, in its effect, not that different from Soviet doomsday response machine.",
        "But there's a big difference, we told the Soviets about it because we wanted to deter them from striking.",
        "They didn't tell us because of all these other issues.",
        "If we think about the college years as a time when you are really exploring who you are, what you hope to be, how you want to define yourself and if you are from a group that has been historically marginalized and undervalued, having the opportunity to attend a school where - as I said earlier, you are at the center of the educational experience, where your intellectually development, your leadership development is at the core of the mission of the institution - is a very empowering experience which is hard to find in the context of a society that still advantages those who are white, disadvantages those who are not.",
        "I think recognizing that important exploration of identity and what it means to be thinking about who you are, who you can be in the world at a particular moment in your development as a young adult is really critical.",
        "Certainly, when we think about opportunities for young people to get to know each other across racial lines, it is very important to create places where that can happen."
