        "And it just seemed like he said look, I've been doing that enough, I've been compromising for four years, now it's my game, it's on my terms and not so much take it or leave it, but he seemed much more confident than I saw him in the first inauguration.",
        "Paul Glastris, for example on the immigration, he said get me a comprehensive bill in the next few months, and I will sign it.",
        "He's trying to get control of that timeline when you know Republicans would much rather send this up in bits and pieces and not get around to some of it.",
        "That's right, and I think if you look at each component of the speech, he said almost nothing about Republicans.",
        "He didn't charge Republicans with anything, he didn't say any nasty things, negative things.",
        "He barely mentioned the Republicans.",
        "He simply talked about his agenda.",
        "But each of those agenda items, right, and this is where the combativeness and the assertiveness comes, each of these agenda items, he knows he has the public polling behind him, these are broadly popular, and he knows that each of them are difficult for Republicans to get behind.",
        "It's hard for Republicans to get behind background checks.",
        "It's hard to get behind immigration reform.",
        "It's hard for them to get behind the minimum wage.",
        "And so he's just laying them out there (unintelligible) which is not saying let's come to an agreement on this, he's saying this is what I want to do, and you all can decide what you to do.",
        "And Peter Robinson, using a rhetorical device, for example of immigration, a bill like the one that Joe Lieberman and John McCain were working on a few years ago; on minimum wage, you know, Mitt Romney and I agreed on this; putting these - his ideas in Republicans' mouths.",
        "Right, right.",
        "I - sure, and then Marco Rubio comes on the television a few moments later and says, in effect, Mr. President, we're a little ahead of you here.",
        "We - I and some other members of the Senate, both Republicans and Democrats, actually are further along on this issue than you are.",
        "If you begin looking at it in detail, he talks about manufacturing hubs, about the reason manufacturing is coming back to this country is because we're producing enormous quantities of natural gas, driving down - there's a feeling to me in which he's behind the actuality, the reality of the country.",
        "We hear voices, the voices of the people that we could not be there for.",
        "They come back.",
        "They come back to visit all different times.",
        "It's an odd moment.",
        "Now - and here Paul and I may just, we may disagree.",
        "So I know we want to talk about the speech, but to me the oddness was that he's putting forward a liberal agenda in a large and in some ways an honest way.",
        "He is simply saying here it is, I believe in big government, I believe in government answers to economic problems, and here's where we're going to go."

        "I agree completely with Ken's point that the kind of implicit body language was to the Republicans not only do I need you, you're just not that important right now.",
        "But I don't read the reality of the underlying political situation that way.",
        "Republicans did keep the House, they have 30 out of 50 governors.",
        "I think he's getting ahead of himself.",
        "At the same time, though, Margaret Thatcher used to say first you win the argument, then you win the elections.",

        "He's won an election; so did Republicans.",
        "The political change hasn't taken place.",
        "But I give him full marks for making the argument, making his case.",
        "Republicans, at least Republicans in Washington, there are some governors who are doing so, Republicans in Washington have yet to do so nearly as effectively, make the case for their argument.",
        "Paul?",
        "Well, I agree, kind of, with what Peter is saying.",
        "I would say this: I thought Barack Obama last night talked to the broad middle of the country and more or less ignored the right-wing base of the Republican Party.",
        "Well, Ted Nugent was there.",
        "Ted Nugent, but he didn't say anything about Ted, though probably got his autograph later, I would have.",
        "I think Marco Rubio ignored the broad middle of the country and talked to the Republican base.",
        "That's kind of where the two parties are right now.",
        "And this shift to the middle that you all are talking about, I think that is what's going on.",
        "And then you had Rand Paul come out to talk to the base of the Republican base.",

        "You know, I wonder if maybe perhaps the president was going as aggressive as he was early because, as you said, Paul, earlier, he doesn't have that much time.",
        "When you think of Ronald Reagan's 49 state landslide in 1984 and two years later the Republicans lost the Senate, you think of Bill Clinton with the great victory in '92, he had a Republican Congress for the rest of his presidency.",
        "And even when Obama was elected in 2008, all those good feelings disappeared in 2010.",
        "So we don't know exactly what will happen in these midterm elections in 2014, which, as you point out, is - are right around the corner.",
        "And so maybe he needs to get as much done as soon as possible because things could change in a heartbeat.",
        "And I think what Peter is saying is that that he doesn't have enough Republican votes to get done what it is he put out there.",
        "Am I right, Peter?",
        "Well, he's not trying - I thought he might say last night he's given - he's won his election.",
        "He gave a very aggressive inaugural address.",
        "I thought last night might be the moment when there were some overtures to cutting a deal - the grand bargain.",
        "You, Republicans, raise some taxes.",
        "I will cut entitlements, and we will deal with the biggest problem the country faces, which is that we're spending 25 percent of GDP and only bringing in 21 percent, and the difference is being made up by China and Ben Bernanke.",
        "Didn't even get mentioned.",
        "There were no serious - as you both said, and as I agree completely, it was almost as though the Republicans were not even in the chamber.",
        "So this was - he's made the decision that to get done what he wants to do, which is to reposition the politics of the entire nation, it could hardly be more breathtaking in its ambition.",
        "He intends to run a political second term from the very get-go.",
        "And interesting, he seemed to have decided, as you said, the debt and deficit are not the problem.",
        "Jobs are the problem.",
        "And if the economy begins to recover as some suspect it will, partly on the back of those energy discoveries that you were talking about, Peter Robinson, is he - might he win his gamble?",
        "Oh, he might.",
        "Oh, I believe it's - absolutely he might.",

        "Back in those days of Ronald Reagan and those - in his first inaugural, government's not the answer, government is the problem.",
        "How conscious was it amongst his speechwriters, amongst his inner circle, this shift, this tectonic shift in beginning to move the center?",
        "We didn't think of it - we speechwriters - I can only tell you the way I experienced life as a speechwriter in the Reagan White House.",

        "Ronald Reagan did not say I'm going to move the politics of the country.",
        "In 1980, a man who'd been a conservative for two decades - temperamentally conservative longer than that but he'd become a Republican and the leading conservative spokesman in the early 1960s, found his political moment.",
        "The country in a sense moved to Reagan and all - the way we felt about it was the way the president felt about it, which is if you see what we see here in Washington, the budget problems, what the Soviets are doing, all I, Ronald Reagan, need to do is explain myself to the American people.",
        "And once they see what I see, they'll come to the same conclusions that I reach.",
        "Now, what he did have in common with Barack Obama is that Ronald Reagan was never even really all that interested in the inside game.",
        "She gives one small example from the day before.",

        "He was always trying to address the American people and understood that if you move the country outside the Beltway, inside the Beltway takes care of itself.",

        "I think what you saw here last night was - what is new here is the president, President Obama, spent the first four years after getting elected trying desperately to play an inside game, partly because he had to.",
        "They were just enormous problems that needed immediate attention and big complex legislation moving.",
