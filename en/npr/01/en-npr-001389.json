        "So what if you'd like to get off that train?",
        "Is there any way to slow down that information, to free yourself from all the distractions, to turn the clock back to those old, boring, 20th-century values?"

        "Great to be here.",
        "Adam, do we have any idea what's going on in our brain when we multitask?",
        "I mean, is our brain made to multitask?",
        "Well, we're learning a lot more.",
        "I think the advance of brain imaging and what we call functional brain imaging, seeing what your brain is doing while we challenge it, has really clarified a lot of what's happening.",
        "A lot of this has been suspect for a long time, but we're learning a lot more of the details, and it certainly seems that our brains are not - you know, it's becoming increasingly viewed that our brains are not highly adapted for multiple streams of information at the same time but rather focusing at a particular direction.",
        "And we see that usually what happens when you demand great degrees of quality or of care, as opposed to something that's automatic like chewing gum and walking, when you demand this, what happens as opposed to actually doing two things at the same time, it seems that you switch between these things.",
        "And with each switch, there's a cost, a cost in performance that occurs."

        "So Dr. Gazzaley, there is some negative.",
        "There is a negative impact on our brain this way?",
        "Well, it does seem that there's a negative impact on performance.",
        "We're now learning what are the neural mechanisms by which you try to multitask and maybe if those can be improved.",
        "But it does seem that if you look at the quality that you achieve doing one thing at a time as opposed to switching rapidly between them as you attempt to multitask, that there is some cost over there.",
        "Can you actually see this in the brain as it works?",
        "Is it possible?",
        "Well, yeah, we can see what's going on as you engage in something that you might be doing, and we do this in experiments in our lab.",
        "We set up our participants.",
        "They're inside the scanner.",
        "They're viewing something.",
        "Maybe they're trying to remember something, and then they're challenged with something else.",
        "And we can see that as opposed to if they were doing one thing continuously, their brain sort of switches gears to the new task and then requires that they reactivate the original thing that they were doing.",
        "Now, this is a very simplified experiment so we could see what's occurring in the brain, but you can imagine in real life and sort of your description at the beginning, when you have emails coming in, and the music's playing with your MP3s, and you're checking your email, and you're working on your Word document at the same time, how that impairs performance.",
        "Now Clifford Nass, you've done some studies that actually look at how well people are able to multitask.",
        "Do people think they're better at it than they really are?",
        "Well, people - the people who multitask most frequently think they're actually the best at it, and in fact, they're the worst at it.",
        "In fact, all the evidence we have suggests that the people who multitask the most actually are the least capable of any important aspect of multitasking.",
        "Really?",
        "Yeah, this absolutely shocked us.",
        "We embarked on our research assuming there must be some secret talent that I wish I and my other colleagues who aren't multi-taskers had, and we resulted in finding out they're pretty bad at everything."

        "How do you know if you're a good multi-tasker or not?",
        "Well, it's hard for people to know.",
        "I mean, we actually have studies that look at the most fundamental things one needs to be able to do to multitask: filter out irrelevancy, manage your short-term memory well and actually how rapidly, as Adam mentions, you switch tasks.",
        "And in all of these cases, even when they're not multitasking, multi-taskers are just much worse at it.",

        "So far, the only thing we have suggestive evidence for, although it's for a tragic reason, is they seem to be better talking on the cell phone while driving.",
        "They're still very bad at it and shouldn't do it, but it turns out that when you - when anyone talks on the cell phone, that becomes their primary focus, and they're really trying to filter out the road, this thing that's distracting them from the conversation.",
        "And ironically, because high multi-taskers are bad at filtering out the road, they actually see the road more and drive a little better.",
        "But of course, you're saying that - you're not advising multi-taskers to do that.",
        "Oh no, everyone is much, much worse, it's just low multi-taskers are worse still.",
        "Plus, the idea that when you're driving, the road is sort of an annoying distraction probably is not a prescription for good driving.",

        "No.",
        "Adam, is technology evolving faster than our brains can adapt?",
        "Well, you know, I think that that is - that's the sort of provocative question here that certainly Clifford's study has really highlighted.",
        "It seems that the increase in the number of information streams that we attempt to engage in is really exceeding our resources and there seems to be a tremendous attraction to do it, despite the fact that many of us are aware, even while we're doing it, to some degree that maybe that document that you're working on just is not as good as if you didn't check your texts during it.",
        "So, you know, I think it's an interesting question to think about how we interact with our environment, how this is influenced by technology and how we respond to it, how our brains can deal with it.",
        "But kids now are growing up with multitasking.",
        "I mean, kids, you know, they just sit there - and I say kids, I mean people in their 20s and 30s, too.",
        "They think it's nothing to sit there and have a conversation with you without you really being there.",
        "They're twittering and doing all kinds of stuff.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think that this is a really scary and important thing to consider: What are the implications of this?",
        "We don't really have long-term data on what it means to engage in such continuous multitasking from a young age.",
        "You know, I think there's a question of whether or not you develop - and Clifford's study suggests this - you know, potentially that you develop a different cognitive style, one that does not permit you to really engage in one sustained activity at a high quality, maybe the type of activity that you need to do to read a book, where you actually turn from page to page to page to page without interruption to actually take in that information.",
        "And, you know, I think a question that we don't know the answer to for sure is what are the developmental implications of growing up in such a different environment than a lot of us did.",
        "Cliff, can you add any to that?",
        "Yeah, there - so far, it seems that the developmental implications are very worrisome.",
        "As I said, the children, we look at college students primarily, although we're expanding to many other populations, students who have had a great deal of multitasking in their younger lives, and what we're seeing is, again, the ones who do it more lose some fundamental abilities.",
        "Now, the other part of this you've alluded to is when I actually tried to, with a couple of colleagues, get a group of students to stop multitasking for a week just so we could see if it would have any effect, despite the fact we offered money and all sorts of things, everyone said no, it would destroy my social life.",
        "I really can't live in a world in which I can't constantly communicate with a whole bunch of other people via whole other number of media while I'm consuming content about yet other people."
