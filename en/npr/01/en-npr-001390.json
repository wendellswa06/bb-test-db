        "And so essentially what we've done is even if we knew that multitasking was affecting our brains in a negative way, there is so much social pressure not just for the young, but in the workplace, more and more companies are demanding that you answer every email within 15 minutes, keep multiple chat windows open, you should be accessible by phone and not, you know, let things go to voicemail.",
        "So the social pressure to continue multitasking is absolutely enormous, despite the probable cognitive and, perhaps even more importantly, social harms.",
        "But do we know in a work environment that this makes you any more productive or less productive?",
        "Well, we know it makes you less productive in two senses: one in the sense that Adam referred to earlier, which was every time you switch from one task to another, you pay a price.",
        "A second way is that we've sort of deduced or decided that deep, hard thinking, the type of stuff you do, like, when you're writing something, writing a paper or something, that you really have to think hard, or you're reading some complex news story, I think there's been a devaluation of really hard thinking, which is exactly what multitasking either prevents from one point of view or wonderfully allows you to avoid.",
        "So then that will be a luxury in the future.",
        "Well, except that so much of our science, our cultures, depend on people thinking hard.",
        "So if it is a luxury, it means we've got a whole lot of work to do in our educational system, in our knowledge discovery systems that are engineered to figure out how do we design a world in which the lack of deep thinking actually works out well.",
        "Uh oh, I think we're there politically.",

        "We're talking with Clifford Nass, author of the upcoming book \"\"The Man Who Lied to His Laptop.\"\" I guess he did have to in this multitasking world.",
        "And Adam Gazzaley is associate professor of neurology, physiology and psychiatry, University of California.",

        "Some people I think enjoy multitasking - I'm a dog groomer.",
        "I can groom a dog, answer the phone, make an appointment all at the same time without stopping what I'm doing.",
        "I think sometimes people just like the pressure.",
        "Yeah, Adam, what is this about all this information that we love it so much?",
        "Are we wired to love this sort of stuff?",
        "Well, it's clear that there needs to be a lot more work on understanding exactly why we enjoy this so much.",
        "Some it makes sense from understanding our desire and response to be engaged by novelty.",
        "So, you know, it's well-known that novel stimuli and environment arouse the reward system, and this is part of what allowed us to evolve to be sort of engaged by novelty.",
        "And multitasking probably has a higher novelty load in general as you continuously switch to new things that feel exciting.",
        "So, you know, perhaps that's part of it, but it certainly does seem that some of the interaction that people have with it may be, you know, almost reaches sort of what can be thought of as a level of addiction, where they crave this type of stimulation.",
        "Do you agree, Clifford?",
        "Yeah, we actually do have some evidence, we are tracking down more of it, that most high multi-taskers, people who chronically multitask, believe that new information is better than old information, whereas low multi-taskers believe that the information they're working with is more valuable.",
        "I mean, Barbara Freed at Stanford makes the point that for the younger people, looking at other streams of information, it's because they think something thrilling is happening.",
        "For older people who, you know, check their emails frantically, it's not because we think there's something great there just lurking for us, it's that we just don't really want to think that hard or for that long or just want to get away.",
        "It doesn't look like we're going to be turning the clock back on multitasking anytime soon.",
        "So, is there a way to practice it to get better at it?"

        "There is some data, now, that multitasking, or at least dealing with interruptions and dealing with distractions, which I sort of put in a different category, things that we're trying to actively keep out of our streams, and that, you know, also seems to have a great impact on performance, that these skills might be trainable.",
        "We actually have some experiments in our lab now, trying to see if individuals - especially older individuals who show a susceptibility to both multitasking and distraction's impact on memory even greater than young adults - if they, by practicing this, can develop these skills and potentially improve memory abilities.",
        "So there's already data out there that suggests that these skills, like most skills, are trainable to some degree, and, you know, how far we can go with that is still an open question.",
        "And I think learning or reminding oneself that there is a joy to just focusing, that there is something delightful about it, especially in the social realm, where actually we think we're seeing the most scary, negative effects.",
        "But there's something lovely about thinking hard.",

        "So I would say okay, if you're not going to write the book, you don't get to, you know, read a magazine or whatever.",
        "You have to clean the toilets.",
        "And boy, my writing really got down pretty fast, and I got the book out on time.",
        "So I think putting oneself where the alternative is not just a playful information task, but instead is, you know, hard, physical labor, will really encourage mental work.",

        "I'm doing activities that are fairly boring.",

        "And so I tag them together, I switch back and forth, and it makes it more pleasurable to go through.",
        "However, I think that this new awareness, since I've been researching this more recently, you know, the awareness of the impact that it has has led me to change my style and sort of just require some discipline and say okay, I am now working on something that has a deadline, it has to be very high quality.",
        "I have two hours.",
        "I'm quitting my email.",

        "Maybe asking for help from people, like here, take my cell phone and my iPad or whatever.",
        "Don't let me have this for the next hour.",

        "I mean, try sitting through a dinner conversation, realizing that your, in your pocket, your phone has just notified that a text has arrived and actually try to not check it and see, you know, see how that feels and see how you can work through that and realize that you can survive without this constant need for updating all your information streams.",
        "I'm sorry.",
