        "Now, how do you do the homework with the tweeting and the music and the phones and everything else?",
        "Yeah, the music question is a challenging one.",
        "I don't know if Clifford agrees with this, but, you know, if you look at the data, there's definitely some mixed data in the world, in the literature of looking at the impact of background music.",
        "So there is some evidence that possibly having distracting information around you that you're forced to push out might help you focus more.",
        "There's been some studies in the workplace with different - actually not necessarily music but at least white noise - showing some benefit, as opposed to a total silence or listening to the chatter of each other working.",
        "So I think that that one still needs a bit of investigation, and just to clarify, you know, there's multitasking, what we're talking about, when you choose to engage in a secondary task while you're already doing something; and then there's this entirely other world, that's very complex, of distraction, the type of information that you're trying to block out or maybe exposing yourself to to block out, that is also interfering with our goals.",
        "And we have a lot of evidence that this really decreases, this ability to block out these distractions, as you get older, and it affects your memory.",
        "So I think that we still want to figure out a lot more about what type of distractions might be helpful and allow you to focus, and what really harm you.",

        "Instrumental music is the one where, really, the jury is out.",
        "We're starting a major study exactly on that.",
        "So if you want to compromise with your kids, it's - if there's no voices, that's okay.",
        "The reason is that voices engage the exact same part of your brain that listens to - that processes words, whereas instrumental music is processed on the other side of your brain.",
        "So there's likely to be less interference.",

        "He has tended to overestimate if - as I said, oversell - the military's commitment to abandoning Maduro because I don't think at this point the military, particularly the high-command - people like Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino - they haven't been yet sold on the fact that if they do turn in Guaido's direction, they're going to be safe.",

        "What I'm hearing from many people, for example, expat leaders here in the diaspora who are in constant contact with Guaido and his team in Venezuela, what they're hearing is that Padrino particularly wants the sort of deal that would not necessitate him having to leave Venezuela.",
