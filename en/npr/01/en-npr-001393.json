        "He pines after his best friend, played by Molly Ringwald, but she's about to date a rich kid, Andrew McCarthy's Blane, much to Duckie's disappointment.",

        "(As Duckie) You can't do this and respect yourself.",

        "That's not a name.",
        "Despite the chemistry, Cryer revealed in his book that he felt like neither Ringwald nor McCarthy liked him very much.",
        "It wasn't that they were unkind.",
        "They're just very different people than me.",
        "I'm very outgoing.",

        "Well, you know, I think the problem, Neal, is that people just don't really understand what they mean.",

        "And let me tell you a little bit about this piece that I wrote for Slate and how it came about.",

        "Exactly.",
        "And because we don't understand what they mean, we - we - we, you know, we automatically attribute the worst possible scenario to them.",
        "And indeed you suggest that most of these dates are put on, well, rather arbitrarily - there are very few standards, and what standards there are change wildly from state to state, in those states that have standards, even in some cases from city to city.",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean, you know, one of the things that I learnt that really amazed me was that there is no federal regulations that govern expiration dates apart from infant food and sort of baby formula.",
        "So all the dates that are being put on, you know, your biscuits, your cookies, your preserves, they're all being decided upon by manufacturers, purely by manufacturers.",
        "And there are some laws within different states that govern...",
        "Dairy...",
        "...dairy products...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...for example.",
        "But again, the - as you mentioned, they vary wildly and for your listeners in New York City, I'm sure many of them would have noted that when they get their carton of milk in New York City, it has a different expiration date from the rest of the state or Connecticut or Pennsylvania.",
        "And, you know, that really confused me for a long time.",
        "And I learned that it's because New York City is the only city within the entire country that has its own rules for milk.",
        "And it was decided upon by the New York health department in the 1950s and you know, they say that apparently at that time, it was a common practice to - for out-of-town grocery stores to resell milk that was about to expire to New York City markets and especially into the more deprived areas.",
        "And so to prevent that, they instituted that New York City had to have a more conservative date.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I think, you know, at least, anecdotally that that's what they do to a lot of convenience stores.",
        "The convenience stores tend to have milk that's just about to expire.",
        "So I'm not sure that that's a deliberate policy, it just seems to be that way every time I go down to the Royal Farm store.",
        "Sure and it's interesting - you used the word \"\"expire,\"\" and what does that mean?",
        "Does it mean that, you know, when it reaches that date that that food is, you know, suddenly become toxic to us?",
        "It absolutely doesn't.",
        "And I think that the ultimate takeaway that I got from doing all my research and reporting on this story was that, you know, we have to trust our basic human instincts.",
        "You know, food is an organic substance.",
        "And, you know, nature will tell us when it's not right to eat.",

        "You know, but if you have a chicken breast in your fridge that is a day past its expir-- you know, its use-by or sell-by date and yet you open up the pack and it still smells fresh, it, you know, it has that sort of lovely rosy hue, then again that's nature telling you that it's perfectly fine for you to cook it up and eat it.",
        "And, you know, I spent a long time reporting and researching this story and speaking to many food scientists and food safety consultants, and the one thing that was consistent amongst them all was that, you know, they said exactly the same thing to me which is that, you know, expiration dates are conservative.",
        "And they're conservative because the people who put those dates on your food, they come by them by considering the worst possible scenario.",
        "You know, they think about the person who has bought their meat from the grocery store, has maybe taken, you know, a long trip through town, done some shopping, gone home, maybe forgotten to put the meat in the fridge for an hour or two.",
