        "It, you know, it seems like I can eat it, so I ate it and it was absolutely fine.",
        "It tasted great.",
        "And then a couple of days later, I had a yogurt with me that I'd taken to work and it was in my bag.",
        "And I had spent the whole day rushing around New York.",
        "I was in the subway.",
        "It was getting nice and warm in my bag, and jiggling around.",
        "And when I eventually came to eat it that evening, I opened it up and it had separated.",
        "There was a sort of strange milky fluid at the top.",
        "It was very lumpy and no amount of stirring would revive it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And, you know, I thought I'm definitely not eating this.",
        "And that yogurt was well within its shelf life."

        "There's some sort of variations, you know, if it's very acidic, whatever is in the can is very acidic, then you should maybe use it within sort of two or three years.",
        "But canning - when you can a product, you're putting it under very, very intense heat treatment, and that will really kill just about anything, any bacteria that's inside of it.",
