        "Well, thank you so much for having me.",

        "First thing we have to know - Percy Fawcett - Percy Harrison Fawcett was obsessed with the Lost City of Z.",
        "What was it?",
        "What is that place?",
        "Fawcett had begun doing explorations in the Amazon in 1906, and he mapped the interior of the jungle over a period of about - nearly two decades.",
        "And during that time, he began to collect bits of evidence, clues that he believed indicated that the Amazonian jungle had contained remnants of a great ancient civilization.",
        "And this had been a dream going back for centuries, and the earliest kind of incarnation of this vision of an ancient civilization, a place like the Lost City of Z, was El Dorado.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And was El Dorado - what was El Dorado?",
        "Was it a European invention or a Native South American invention?",
        "One thing that's really important to understand is that the Amazon is just an enormously vast wilderness.",
        "It's about the size of the continental United States.",
        "And for ages, it really remained the kind of last blank space on the map, just because it was so impenetrable.",
        "And the first conquistadors who arrived in the Amazon had been told by the Indians that the jungle area had contained a great civilization.",
        "Sir Walter Raleigh said that he'd been told that the civilization was so wealthy and had so much gold that the inhabitants used to ground the gold into powder and literally paint it on the inhabitants until they shined from the head to the foot.",
        "And they began to go into the jungle to look for this.",
        "Thousands died looking for it.",
        "And the first big El Dorado expedition, some 4,000 men went, and some 4,000 men died.",
        "Wow.",
        "And it was always assumed - going to back to your question - it was always assumed that El Dorado was really just a product of the imagination of the - basically, a delusion.",
        "After three centuries of so many people dying and suffering and finding no evidence, people assumed it really was a figment of the imagination.",
        "And one of the things I try to wrestle with in the book is, is that really the case or isn't it?",
        "So, why do people think - or why did Fawcett's attempt - attempts to find El Dorado - they got further than some, but obviously they didn't get to the very conclusion.",
        "Yeah, I mean Fawcett, unlike the conquistadors, he had been trained at the Royal Geographical Society; he had a scientific bent.",
        "Now, he was an amateur.",
        "This was still an age where there really weren't too many professional archaeologists or anthropologists.",
        "He came of age as an amateur, but he was trained at the Royal Geographic Society; he had a scientific bent."

        "And during his expeditions, he had a more rigorous method in trying to gather evidence.",
        "So he - for example, he was once in the Bolivian floodplains of the Amazon, and he had climbed these large earth mounds.",
        "And when he was at the top of the earth mounds, he began to - he saw something sticking out of the ground.",
        "He bent down; he picked it up.",
        "It was a shard of pottery.",
        "And he began to scratch everywhere along the soil, and he found all these shards of pottery.",
        "Now, it was an era before there was carbon dating, so he couldn't say its age, but it looked very old, and it looked to him as refined as something from Greece.",
        "So, there were clues like this.",
        "So his methodology - unlike the conquistadors, which were slowly kind of pursuing greed and were really - the way they came in with just vengeance towards the native inhabitants.",
        "Fawcett was really - it was a much more of a scientific quest.",
        "Right, right.",
        "And he was a remarkable explorer in his own right.",
        "I mean, he had some fantastic physical abilities, at least as you describe them in the book.",
        "Yeah, I mean, he was - Fawcett - he was a large, strapping figure, and he would go on these expeditions over these nearly two decades, and he would take very small parties of about a dozen men.",
        "He would go into areas where expeditions did not come back from.",
        "They had almost no immunities from diseases, so they would get malaria, they would get yellow fever, they would get elephantiasis.",
        "He would take in these parties, and usually half the parties would die of starvation or disease, and yet he always emerged.",
        "And it gave him a sense of invulnerability, and you might even say almost a god complex.",

        "They are not even to the point of raising chickens or planting corn, as I've seen in other parts of the developing world where I've traveled.",
        "There's still the menfolk going off into the jungle to bring back the kill, and women gathering fishes and berries and mangoes and so forth close by.",

        "You didn't see them.",

        "I wanted to know not just kind of how he died, but I also wanted to know the mystery of his life.",
        "And so, my quest was to try to always find every little clue that was a part of that.",
        "And so, in a way, I was chasing him, and he was my Z.",

        "And you - yeah, you definitely can't help but realize that the experience is why you do it.",
        "And you can read as many books and you can check out as many pictures and videos, but there's nothing greater than the experience, the feel of the Andes air against your cheeks or the smell of the African rainforest or the sound, or rather lack of sound, while you push yourself both physically and mentally.",
        "And not only are you out there exploring the physical world but, you know, there's an enormous amount of introspection that you get when you're on one of these adventures, pushing yourself to the limit.",
        "Graham, I want to ask you.",
        "Have you ever gotten - in these adventures you're describing, have you ever felt like, you know, you might have taken one step too far?",
        "Yes, and I think that's the part that reminds you that you're alive, because you're up there and - you know, a recent adventure was up on top of Aconcagua, and a snowstorm came up.",
