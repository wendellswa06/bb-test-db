        "I just wanted to say one point about the introspection, because I think that's very interesting, and it really does relate to Fawcett.",
        "Fawcett would go on these journeys, even before he disappeared in his final expedition in search of Z, and he would go for a year, two years without contact with the outside world, with just his men.",
        "And he was a spiritualist, and a lot of his journeys had a great deal of introspection in his writings.",
        "And there was even some question whether Z was a spiritual quest or was it - was he searching for something concrete?",
        "Well, Graham, thanks for that call.",
        "We're talking about explorers and obsessions.",
        "David Grann's new book is called \"\"The Lost City of Z.\"\" We'll talk more about his own obsession with this story in a moment.",

        "This is Talk of the Nation.",
        "I'm Joe Palca in Washington.",
        "The Lost City of Z\"\" is a story all about obsession - the obsession of the explorer Percy Fawcett to find the magical city of El Dorado; the obsession of the author of the book, David Grann; and the obsession of many other explorers to take the risks they do.",
        "Did you hear stories as a young boy about - I mean, did you get to see Kurdistan?",
        "Did you hear stories about it?",
        "But the real need is to find out who the terrorists are.",
        "Today, we want to hear from you and your - from you explorers in the audience.",
        "Have you taken a trip to the South Pole, to Everest or K2, to the heart of the Amazon?",
        "Tell us why you did it.",
        "Our number here in Washington is 800-989-8255.",

        "It's all at npr.org/talk.",
        "I wanted to ask you about the difference in travel today with what Fawcett experienced 80 years ago.",
        "And the reason I'm thinking about this - it's about - oh gosh, it's now 15 or 18 years ago.",
        "I made it to the South Pole.",
        "Wow!",
        "You know, the South Pole, and it's pretty darn impressive, and I'm glad I went.",
        "But I got on a plane in Washington, and I flew to Tennessee, and then I flew to Los Angeles, and then I flew to Auckland, and then I flew Christchurch, and then I flew to McMurdo, and then I flew to the South Pole.",
        "And apart from the fact that I had to sit down for a really long time, it wasn't like what I would call strenuous.",
        "And once I was at the Pole, the big decision was whether to have Bailey's Irish Cream or, you know, beer with my dinner or something like that.",

        "I remember Bailey's, for some reason, was very popular at the South Pole when I was there.",
        "And I felt a bit of a fraud, because these initial explorers were putting it all out there.",
        "And you describe in your book - you had cars and planes get you a large proportion of the way.",
        "But it felt like you were much closer to the experience of what…",
        "What Fawcett did?",
        "Yeah, than I was.",
        "It's interesting.",

        "Shackleton.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "One of the things I try to do in the book is alternate chapters between the past and the present.",
        "And my hope in doing that was to really juxtapose and show how the world had changed and how the Amazon had changed.",
        "And so, to get a little bit to your point, when we started out on the trip, we left from Cuiaba, which is the capital of Mato Grosso Now, the name Mato Grosso in Brazil means dense forest, and we got a big car - we needed four-wheel drive.",
        "And we take it, and we're driving.",
        "And I had Fawcett's letters with me.",
        "And I'm reading his letters, and he's describing just hacking through dense jungle.",
        "It's so intense.",
        "He had taken his oldest son with him.",
        "They become separated at one point, and the third companion is sick.",
        "Now, I'm looking out the window of the car, and it looks like Nebraska.",
        "There's literally nothing there.",
        "It had all been cut down.",
        "There was literally no forest.",
        "I mean, you could see to the horizon.",
        "So, the beginning of the trip - and I try to show that - is just one example of how - this is only - it was 1925, 2005 - so what, about 80 years?",
        "- how the world had changed.",
        "But as we move further north into the jungle, there really still are dense pockets of wilderness in the jungle.",
        "And so, for the latter part of the journey, while we could make that trip in two days that it took Fawcett a month, according to his letters.",
        "We did it in two days.",
        "But then the latter part was a bit closer.",
        "But even then, it's never quite the same as what they were going through.",
        "I had malaria pills, for example."

        "Yeah.",

        "Hi.",
        "Hi, Bill and everyone.",
        "Thanks for having me on here.",
        "I'm an explorer, I guess, an adventurer, and really fascinated personally by the cerebral aspects of exploration.",
        "I am also the director of a mountaineering museum here in - the American Mountaineering Museum here in Golden, Colorado, and was fortunate enough to take part in the discovery of George Mallory's remains high on Everest in 1999.",
        "And really, you know, the question of exploration versus obsession with exploration, I think, really comes to fore in many stories but specifically in the story of George Mallory in 1924, and his obsession with reaching the summit of Everest that eventually ended in him remaining on Everest forever and losing his life up there.",
        "But it's interesting that you described your own sense of obsession in going back to find him.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "You know, it was - you know, it was interesting because in some senses, we - you know, we were obsessed with finding him and putting ourselves at great risk in order to attempt to find his remains.",
        "So, it is an interesting, almost dichotomous relationship, because on the one had, we recognized his obsession that eventually, I think, got him killed up there.",
        "That's my opinion, but I think that's what led to it.",
        "And yet, we were embarking on a similar obsession in our attempts to find him and tell his story and Irvine's.",
        "One of the very interesting things that has some parallels with your story is, after Fawcett disappeared in 1925 with son and his companions, he had warned that nobody should follow in his wake because it was too dangerous.",
        "And literally, scores of people plunged into the wilderness trying to recover his party alive or dead, and find Z.",
        "And just as Fawcett had became obsessed, they became obsessed with chasing his ghost, and chasing the ghost of the city of Z, and countless of them lost their lives.",
        "They died of starvation or disease, or many of them also disappeared like Fawcett.",
        "Jake, thanks for that call.",
        "David, are you - I want to jump to the punch line here.",
        "Are you satisfied that - how far was Fawcett from finding what he was after?",
        "Are you satisfied that you know what happened to him?",
        "And did you find the City of Z?",
        "Did I find the city?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean the interesting thing about this mystery - it's often called the greatest exploration mystery of the 20th century - is that it really has two separate components.",
        "It's two mysteries wrapped into one, which is - there's the mystery of what happened to Fawcett, a man who was pretty much considered indestructible, on this final expedition.",
        "And then there's the question of Z.",
        "Of course.",
        "...Will be loyal to us.",
        "And in tracing his path and staying with various tribes that he stayed with, one of the really interesting things was that many of the tribes, even though they don't have written records, they have oral histories, and these oral histories are passed down for generations with incredible precision.",
        "And Fawcett and his party were among the first white men they'd ever seen.",
        "So, it was a very historic moment in their history.",
        "And I was amazed and astonished that they had an oral history about his party, and these oral histories are almost like epic, Homeric poems.",
        "And they - these - these oral histories had incredible clues and gave me a real sense of knowing, or as close I think as possible, to knowing to what happened to Fawcett."

        "And then, the second part was this question of Z.",
        "And I eventually met up with an archaeologist working in the very area where Fawcett believed Z would be, a man named Michael Heckenberger.",
        "And he had uncovered ruins, remnants of 20 pre-Colombian settlements.",
        "And there's now, really, a revolution in archeology, and in our understanding of the Amazon and what the Americas really looked like before the time of Columbus.",
        "So, one of the more astonishing things was learning that Z is much more than a fable.",
        "Right.",

        "Very close.",

        "I grew up in South Africa in the apartheid era, and I was always filled with questions about, you know, life on the outside, because there was very - kind of restrictive travel in South Africa at that time.",
        "So, my passion for exploration, I think, was more a cultural passion to find out how the people are living and all these things that I was taught as a child to believe, and that were obviously not true once I set foot outside the country.",
        "You know, and once I discovered that, I realized that I had to explore the rest of my continent to fully understand, you know, where I grew up.",
        "And I think once you know what the questions are, then you know where to go and look for the answers, in terms of exploration, so…",

        "And they're happy, you know.",
        "It's kind of a question of finding civilizations still today - or cultures that live with the bare, bare minimum, and they are just extremely content.",

        "I grew up in a little town up in the Andes as a teenager, and there was a family there named Fawcett, and there was an airline in Peru named Fawcett.",
        "And this family was a fairly well-established family in Peru, and I know that the Fawcett name is a fairly well-recognized name in parts of South America.",
        "Is this any connection to this man, Fawcett, who was doing all this exploring in the '20s?",
        "Dave Grann?",
        "Yeah.",

        "On some maps, it still says Fawcett Country."
