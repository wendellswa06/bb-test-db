        "Hey there.",
        "Thanks.",
        "So, I don't know where you draw the line between travel and adventure.",
        "I suppose, you know, what I have done would fall under the heading of travel, especially when compared with Fawcett and other great adventurers.",
        "But I've, you know, traveled in Alaska, and that was my great adventure of my youth, when I got out of college and went from one end of the state to the other, and got stuck and lost in all kinds of places in between.",
        "We would hear stories about Kurdistan.",
        "We, obviously, were fully aware of the Anfal campaign, the genocide, against the Kurds in the late '80s.",
        "We were constantly called to rally, to demonstrate...",
        "But, my question - I've always been fascinated by stories of explorers and obviously, Sir Francis Burton is one of them.",
        "And I think of what drives adventurers, and I think of what kinds of personalities they had.",
        "Burton always comes off, especially in the Rice biography, as being sort of dour and extreme.",
        "And then I think of, you know, the impressions I have of, say, Rockefeller - young Rockefeller, who I think was in Southeast Asia - seemed like always a very happy person.",
        "What kind of person was Fawcett?",
        "What was his affect?",
        "What was his personality like?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "And Fawcett was an incredibly complicated character, and he was incredibly daring.",
        "I mean, there were few men, you know, arguably, who would show more courage than what he would do.",
        "He would march into areas where people just simply didn't go, and make contact with tribes that because of the bloody history of the contact with - even once-friendly tribes would ambush interlopers.",
        "And Fawcett, unlike many people of that day, refused to let his men fire their weapons on the native tribes.",
        "He would order them to drop their weapons and in kind of crazy, mad, Victorian fashion, sing \"\"God Save the Queen.\"\" And then he would take his handkerchief...",
        "It's always worked for me.",
        "It always works - \"\"God Save the Queen.",
        "Right.",
        "And in a mad, Victorian fashion, would take off his handkerchief and wave it in the air, march into a fusillade of arrows.",
        "And this isn't just lore because I read it in his companions' diaries, not in his own, where it was just simply embellishment.",
        "So, he was incredibly daring.",
        "At the same time, he was incredibly curious, he was very driven, but he was also very maniacal.",
        "And someone like me would have been terrified to be with him.",
        "And he was a very polarizing figure in his expeditions, because if you kept - could keep up with him, you admired him and worshipped him.",
        "But if you were weak and slowed him down, you were terrorized by him.",
        "We're talking with David Grann, the author of the new book \"\"The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon.\"\" You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "Yeah, in your book at least, you describe in this last expedition with his older son, how he sort of marched off when the son and his - and the younger companion weren't able to keep up."

        "He - there was nothing - he let nothing stay in his way of his object and his goal.",
        "And in some ways, that would sometimes help his men survive, because he was in such conditions where you had to be maniacal.",
        "In fact, there was a rule among his parties that if you were wounded or too sick, you would have to be abandoned, because there was no way to get you out, and you would risk the welfare of the whole party.",
        "And so, he would drive those men through that wilderness to try to get them out.",

        "I do believe FISA's obsolete as a weapon for dealing with international terrorism, and the reason for that is precisely that it's tied to the idea of warrants.",
        "But it is very common for these kinds of individuals and groups to essentially try and exploit a situation like this.",
        "I mean, these guys really study the newspapers.",
        "They follow the news very closely around the country and look for opportunities to interject themselves.",
        "You know, if there is, say, some terrible black-on-white crime, for instance, as there has been recently Knoxville, Tennessee, in particular, you know, the groups will swarm around, you know, and use the event to denounce - basically to denounce black people but under the guise of saying, you know, they're fighting crime and so on.",

        "The book that he, in fact, gave Justin Barker, his so-called autobiography, you know, advocates the resettlement of blacks, Jews, Latinos and so on to the countries they, quote, unquote \"\"came from.",

        "There recently had been cases where journalist names and addresses were posted online if what they said seemed to be disturbing to someone who came from a racist background, a self-avowed racist background.",
        "What's specifically about that kind of targeting, that kind of exposure is pernicious?",
        "Well, I mean, it's pernicious because it's terrifying to its targets, you know?",
        "This posting we're talking about was put up by a guy named Bill White in Roanoke, Virginia.",
        "He is the leader of the so-called American National Socialist Workers Party, in other words, an explicitly Nazi group.",
        "And, you know, his headline was, lynched the Jena Six, and then in the secondary posting, he listed the five of the six addresses and home phone numbers he was able to get and suggested that should the Jena Six be set free by the courts, that perhaps individual white people might want to go to Jena and deliver justice themselves.",
        "You know, I think it's obvious what effect that might have on the person who's a target of such thing.",
        "This is very common.",
        "Whites did the same thing to Leonard Pitts, a well-known columnist at the Miami Herald for Knight Ridders, actually a friend of mine.",
        "You know, he's done it to me many times because I'm often quoted criticizing him.",
        "You know, the point of all of this is that these groups are very adept to kind of getting in your face.",
        "I mean, Bill White posts that, you know, lynched the Jena Six, and he understands perfectly that somebody like me is going to notice that immediately and that it helps to propel his name and his group's name essentially into the headlines and, you know, he doesn't give a hoot that, you know, virtually all the press he gets is going to be bad, it's going to somehow describe him as a white supremacist or a neo-Nazi.",
        "You know, his point is that he's trying to get his name out there because presumably, he will get a few new members out of it and, of course, that means dues for him."
