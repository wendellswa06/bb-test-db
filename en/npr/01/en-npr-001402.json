        "One are the things that you write about in the novel that you capture, I think, with great detail is the way that the terror of this one incident seeks into everybody's daily life, and I wondered how you got the idea for that.",
        "I think it was important to me because I love, you know, non-fiction books, but I think with the fiction I wanted to kind of capture within that moment when the characters did not have access to the aftermath or what's next.",
        "So I just wanted to show just in as realistic a sense as I could what actually happens as these characters are living their daily lives, having to deal with this aftermath.",
        "I mean, these are high school kids.",
        "They're dealing with, you know, preparing for the prom, dealing with school plays, all of these things that are normal in their development as young people.",
        "But they're also dealing with the aftermath of this horrific crime.",
        "And in our lives we can't necessarily separate those.",
        "We still have to go about our daily business.",
        "But I wanted to kind of show how this people cope.",
        "The other device that you used is that of the funeral home.",
        "And your protagonist is the seventh generation of this long line of family members who ran this funeral home, and you imagine the passed down knowledge of how to repair a body broken by lynching.",
        "Where did that idea come from?",
        "Well, I do have an uncle that works at a local funeral home in Mobile, Alabama, so that was one source of research.",
        "But also just looking at the role that, you know, funeral homes have played in the black community as not only businesses, but also as, you know, spiritual avenues, because they are there in churches when people are being buried.",
        "Because sometimes that's really the only avenue throughout history, the only avenue that a lot of black people have had after a death like this.",
        "They might not get the kind of legal remedy they wanted, but they will look for some sort of honor for that dead person through a funeral, through a church ceremony, through the religious rights that kind of made everyone feel like there is a better world somewhere.",
        "What do you imagine your African-American readers taking from this story?",
        "What do you imagine your white readers taking from this story?",
        "Do you think it will be that same thing or different things?",
        "That's an interesting question.",
        "Because I think for some people -especially African-Americans like myself who grew up in Montgomery, Alabama -there are a lot of people in our families that have first-hand knowledge of certain things that happened in the '60s or '70s.",
        "I know if he comes up for adoption, I'm going to be the first one calling here: Hey, I want that dog.",
        "In fact, Barack Obama did call for national unity numerous times during his presidency, especially during times of racial conflict and violence.",
        "That, too, was downplayed or ignored in much of the conservative media that shapes opinion here in rural America.",

        "The phone started ringing Sunday afternoon at my home and the phone rang all night long.",
        "I was alarmed.",
        "You see, Temple had discovered that grassland bird populations were dropping.",
        "He knew agriculture and real estate development had destroyed nesting sites, but he told his students something else was taking a significant toll.",
        "Cats have been involved in the extinction of more bird species worldwide than any other factor except habitat destruction.",
        "Based on his research, Temple estimated that cats, both domestic and free-ranging, were killing at least 7.8 million birds each year in his state alone.",
        "That information led members of a citizens group called the Conversation Congress to suggest what some saw as a radical solution, that in rural areas, people be allowed to shoot stray cats just as they're now permitted to kill skunks, possums and weasels.",
        "Professor Temple, himself a cat owner, wasn't sure that would work.",
        "After all, there are millions of unclaimed felines wandering the Wisconsin countryside.",
        "I simply don't know what impact it would have, but I suspected it would be ineffective.",
        "Still, Temple's name had appeared in a newspaper story about the proposal to shoot cats, prompting threatening phone calls.",
        "Someone tacked a vicious note to his office door.",
        "He was attacked on radio talk shows, and a self-proclaimed witch from upstate New York even put a curse on him."

        "Coyotes, gray-horned owls, other predators that are out there.",
        "But what about all those stray cats with no owners to keep them inside?",
        "Lepczyk suggests a statewide program to trap and put them up for adoption or place them in captive colonies.",
        "When critics say that's unnatural, he argues the needs of felines should be weighed against the survival of birds that evolved in a place where there were once no cats.",
        "Well, cats are not natural in this landscape.",
        "They're not native to North America, and we have to think about trade-offs."

        "The only problem was we didn't train them.",
        "We put them on the campus, and so they did exactly what they were trained to do.",
        "They arrest everything that was a crime, including what I call soft offenses, school frights or frays, disorderly conduct, mouthing off and disrupting public school.",
