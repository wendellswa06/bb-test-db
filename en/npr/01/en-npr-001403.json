        "I showed them the statistics.",
        "I showed them the research that the more you arrest, the more you suspend, your dropout rates are going to go up, and that wasn't helping at all because most of these kids were not delinquent in the first place.",
        "I mean the fact remains is that just because you commit a delinquent act doesn't make you delinquent.",
        "I committed delinquent acts.",

        "Absolutely, and so we got together.",
        "It took us nine months, and we developed a protocol to find another alternative.",
        "And what we did is that we decided not to arrest these kids and focus only on the more serious offenses.",
        "And so as a result, we had a dramatic decrease in the referrals to the juvenile court by 72 percent.",
        "But since then, our graduation rates have gone up 24 percent, and our serious weapon charges have gone down 70 percent.",
        "So it seems to be working.",
        "It is working.",
        "It's all based on relationships because now the school police are on the campus all the time.",
        "The kids don't see them as the bad guys.",
        "And so they're building these relationships with the kids, and as a result, they're getting more information, and they're able to stop things from happening before they get on the campus.",

        "And these are neighborhoods with open-air drug markets and crack houses and white drive-through buyers and all that kind of thing.",
        "And most of the men can end up with criminal records, at which point they're doomed, and their community is damaged.",
        "And so what we do instead is identify the drug dealers - there are never that many, even in the most distressed neighborhood - get a case ready to go, look at whether they're violent or not.",

        "And let me say this.",
        "You know, I agree - and this whole thing around school safety has extended beyond the scope of the schools because what's happened is that, you know, our police, our school police used to be called kiddie cops.",
        "No one calls them kiddie cops anymore.",
        "For example, you know, we've had a couple school resource officers been named officer of the year and cited for solving more crimes in the community, including homicides, than any other police officer because the detectives know that they need the SROs because they're a rich resource because of the type of relationship-building that they have done.",

        "Yes.",
        "I mean, the program was not initially designed for drug crimes, but the police have started to broaden it on their own.",
        "Even though the protocol is specific about these certain what we call focus acts or soft offenses, over the last several years, the police, in seeing it work, have stopped making their own arrests on those offenses not included in the written protocol, which includes possession of drugs and things of that nature.",
