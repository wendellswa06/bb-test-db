        "He finally got caught and charged with conspiracy to commit armed robbery and got four to 15 years in prison at 19 years - he was 19 years old.",
        "And it, obviously, led to me raising my daughter by myself, but it also set him up for failure because he didn't have an education when he went in.",
        "And, of course, he got his GED in prison.",
        "But he didn't know how to care of himself from that point on.",

        "He could have - he grew up not seeing anything but crime.",
        "And had he understood that people were looking out for him and invested in him, I really believe he could have invested in his community, and he would have been involved in his daughter's life.",
        "And it would have changed her life, and probably for generations would have an impact.",
