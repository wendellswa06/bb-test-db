        "And that was a real wake-up call for me.",
        "It led to an ongoing conversation with Les.",
        "Well, that's a story I tell in part to not just critique others, but to remind us that we have to turn this kind of critical self-reflection on ourselves, and I think one of the things that white people have to do is not only be honest with each other, but be willing to step out into public and have those honest conversations with members of other racial groups.",
