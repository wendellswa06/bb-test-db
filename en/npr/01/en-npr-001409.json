        "Initially, I went to France, yes, where I stayed for three years.",
        "And how did that, then, influenced what you wrote about after you left?",
        "Actually, I discovered that when I left - I had been traveling a lot throughout the world, but when you leave and you know that the possibility of coming back is not anywhere near, you have a different feeling from the feeling you would have if you were leaving for a few weeks and coming back.",
        "But a lot of things do change, as well.",

        "You are looking at a right - always looking at the country or to -it's own motherland or fatherland from a distance.",
        "And then, like the lady was saying, there's certain things, when you're in the country which you actually take for granted.",
        "When you've left, you begin to hear even the sounds of birds, the rivers and the wind.",
        "Everything becomes different and much more intense because you now have an element of longing with you.",

        "I just wanted to ask Miss Nafisi if - does she particularly have a hope that experiences that she had gone through where people like me can anyway be introduced to the Iranian people, the younger people there who have no idea what an immigrant has to go through in any place, under any circumstances.",

        "And I was very happy to know that I'm not just an American, but I am an Iranian-American, and I think that that is a quality that once this country loses, it would lose its soul.",
        "So as an Iranian-American, your history of Iran will not only be useful to Iranians, but it will also be useful to the new - to the country you've adopted.",
        "But I wanted to tell you that one of the - I always think, whenever I feel homesick, of what the Germans thinker Theodor Adorno said, that the highest form of morality is not to feel at home in your own home.",
        "And when I was back in Iran, I was so much stripped of everything that I thought was me, my history, my religion.",
        "The Islam that the regime talked about was not the Islam of my grandparents or the Islam of my parents.",

        "Am I really not Iranian?",
        "Was I not born in a Muslim family?",
        "And like you, then I had to excavate the past and investigate my own past, and through the past of my poetry and my history to connect to my own people.",
        "And when I was there, whenever the regime talked about the U.S.",
        "being decadent and imperialist, the country that I knew so much about and that had accepted me so well, I would connect to my own people again through Saul Bellow and Emily Dickinson and Zora Neale Hurston.",
        "So literature became a vehicle through which I could communicate both with people inside Iran.",
        "And now that I am outside, whenever I want to talk to people about Iran, I want them to know that Iran is not the Iran that Mr. Ahmadinejad is representing."
