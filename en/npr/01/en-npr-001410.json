        "Well, I think for, you know, a lot of us who, as I mentioned, you know, come out - comes out of this generation, that before - my parents generation, for example, considered themselves sort of in wait here.",
        "They were - they came here during the Duvalier dictatorship in the '70s.",
        "And through the '80s, they perhaps envisioned this time when they would be able to go back and restart their lives.",
        "And then slowly, there's been this transition for people who are not artist, people who are artists, where there realize, well, maybe I'm here for awhile.",
        "Maybe I'm - you know, because there are other things, besides political power - you know, natural disasters, economic problems - that are keeping us here.",
        "And it's the same for the artist.",
        "And some of them - now, there's this possibility that some have to go back and forth.",
        "There's also this thing in this conversation about exile and immigration that's called transnationalism, and that especially if you live in a place like Miami, I can be in Port-au-Prince quicker that I can be in New York City from Miami.",
        "So that also adds another dynamic to the conversation for - I think for both people who are creating artistically and feel like they need to go back and refresh, and other people who just going back to see relatives and so forth.",
        "And gives you, as we've been hearing, that unique outlook on both places.",
        "Yes.",
        "What I think of as a mixed gaze, because you are looking at the United States as a with Haitian eyes and that you're looking at Haiti with American eyes.",
        "And so there's a kind of - something in between that's perhaps sometimes personally uncomfortable, but I think it's rich terrain for art.",

        "I've been in the United States for almost 13 years now and have published poetry as well as short stories for several years.",
        "The key point, though, is it's been so long since I've come here and I've kind of adjusted to life here.",
        "But even today, when I write either in Kanada or in English, what happens is I go back to my youth and my childhood, and every single poem or short story I write is from my past.",
        "However much I want to try and write today's stories of my neighborhood here, I somehow end up writing every single small story that I experienced in my youth and in my childhood.",
        "And do you think if you wrote in English, it might be different?",
        "No.",
        "I actually am trying to write something different in English.",
        "But when I actually try to write in English, it just goes back to my stories from India of my teenage years and my childhood years.",
        "It's all different stories, but it's all from my past.",
        "So it's kind, you know, it's ingrained and it's really hard to change that.",

        "Oh, yes.",

        "So it is really a way of going back all the time.",
        "And I think one also realizes the dynamic that no society can no culture can be stagnant.",
        "It is to be moving all the time.",
        "And one has to realize that as a writer, for me to write is always - even when I was in the country, sometime I was writing about my aspirations and I put characters in a future Zimbabwe somewhere and let them deal with certain issues in a certain way.",

        "And I also although I lived in this country more than half of my life, but still, always with my poetry, with my writing, I'm trying to bridge the gap between these two person inside me, or bridge the gap between the two cultures that I'm dealing with every day.",
        "And that's a very, very amazing experience that I, you know, I just try to prostrate in my poetry and my writing.",
        "And actually, I made a website that - it's for language, and the main goal is to gap to bridge this gap between cultures.",

        "It is the fact that I, as a person, as an artist and a writer, I quite often come across a reaction to - not a reaction to my work, but I oftentimes finds that there are, including in some media outlets, there are some predetermined perimeters as to the topic, the themes that should be or are in my work, whether it's the visual arts or in the literary work, arts.",
