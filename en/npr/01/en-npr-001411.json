        "Because the only place where there are no boundaries of nationality or ethnicity or language, is the realm of imagination.",

        "But social media has changed means of one level, which is information.",
        "But still, to know - to put yourself in place of how someone feels in Zimbabwe or Haiti or New Orleans or Iran, you have to experience the story, you have to have the feel of it.",
        "And for that, you go to the land of imagination.",
        "I just wanted to say one small thing.",
        "Up to now, we've been talking about how we can illuminate our past or the places where we came from.",
        "But I think some of the greatest writing has been also about writers like Conrad or Nabokov, who have illuminated and given us fresh views about the new countries they adopted.",
        "Nabokov's best work was about America, and it was written during his period of exile in this country and later in Switzerland.",
        "And I think he could see this America through the eyes of his Russia.",
        "And even Russian language glimmers through those amazingly light field scenes in Lolita or his other works.",
        "So it is not just that other country that comes to us.",
        "This new country is also nourished because language is also a home.",

        "So are we paying higher prices, and can you link those higher prices to these tariffs?",
        "The short answer is yes.",
        "Now, of course there are lots of things that matter to the cost of living that are more important than tariffs - what happens to the price of oil, for instance, or what's happening to housing prices and rents.",
        "But the government measures show a 50 percent increase in the cost of - in the price of washing machines largely because we've put tariffs on imported washers.",

        "But if there's no resolution to the trade dispute, yes, more prices are likely to go up.",

        "Some will absorb the cost of the tariffs in their profits and not raise prices so much.",

        "Well, what the president sees is a bit beyond my competence.",
        "But there are a couple of possible explanations here.",
        "One is that President Trump thinks it would be good for the U.S.",
        "overall if we relied more on domestic manufacturers than imports 'cause that would mean more jobs here in the U.S.",
        "even if it means that those workers have to pay more when they go to the store.",
        "And the second possibility is this is a bargaining tactic.",
        "Inflict some pain on the Chinese, a little pain here, and it's temporary in order to get better trade deals in the long run.",
        "Well, I mean, briefly, who is winning here, the U.S.",
        "or China?",
        "Like, who's more vulnerable, who's less vulnerable?",
        "I think that the impact of the tariffs so far on either economy has been modest.",

        "I'm not trying to make that into a business story, but I do think that it's important and interesting for the future of the Internet that the king of searching for stuff on the Internet has now purchased the king of watching little bits of video on the Internet.",
        "I think that presages a total change in the way people consume television and media.",

        "All of the sort of time shifting that we can do now includes media shifting or medium shifting, I guess, from television to the computer to iPod, to whatever you want to watch it on; and in shorter bytes, not just a half hour or an hour.",

        "So, you know, people making their own television.",

        "Looking back over this past year, it's not that there was any one particular story that most stood out.",
        "It's the continuing trend of - obviously - the ongoing validation that global warming is a very real problem, that it is one caused in no small way by what human activity is doing, by putting more greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere.",
        "And the fact that some of the political standpoint that, unfortunately, the United States has really not shown the kind of leadership that it should in dealing with this problems seriously.",

        "You know, maybe that's one of those sort of tipping point phenomenon.",
        "Another one I think is that we're starting to see the business community is starting to respond.",
        "We mentioned at end of year we have our own Scientific American 50 list in which we're acknowledging different technology leaders.",
        "And our business leader of the year was actually the Swiss reinsurance company, Swiss Re, because they have been encouraging a lot of the business community to try to factor global warming strategies into their long-term planning.",
        "But I think we can even see some sorts of movement at least even within the administration.",
