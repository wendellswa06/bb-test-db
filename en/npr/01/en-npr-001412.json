        "David Wessel is director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, contributor to The Wall Street Journal and also a frequent guest on our show, which is good for us.",
        "David, thanks.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "Professor K.C.",
        "COLE (Journalism, University of Southern California): Well, in terms of physics, I would say mostly things that haven't been covered very much.",
        "I was surprised that there's so little being said about the preparations for the Large Hadron Collider, the LHC, that will become the world's most powerful particle accelerator either this year or next.",
        "What's happening is people are trying to figure out what could possibly be seen, extra dimensions begin one of them, new families of particles being another, all kinds of exotic stuff.",
        "Mini black holes.",
        "If you don't really work out what you might see and what the signature of it would be, then you won't see it if it's not right in front of your nose.",
        "So a lot of it has been about clever new ways of actually looking for invisible things.",
        "In math, of course, as he said, I was delighted to see that science put Poincare Conjecture as number one.",
        "What I find fascinating about this is that there are all these problems in math that can be solved in dimensions one and two, and Dimensions five or higher.",
        "If you want to tie a nine dimensional not in a ten dimensional space - no problem.",
        "But Dimensions three and four are very, very complicated and there are these whole class of problems that haven't been solved.",
        "So this was quite an important breakthrough.",
        "Of course, important for us in a way because we live in three dimensions - four-dimensional space time - and so there's a lot of overlap between math and physics in these areas.",
        "And I can say more about this if you'd like but...",
        "It was so important that it was made the number one story.",
        "I think it's hard for the public to understand how important that might be, that of all stories that one was chosen.",
        "Why was that?",
        "Can you give us a little more of that flavor?",
        "Well, there are a lot of things, you know, that are fairly typical of the way things happen in math, and also science in general.",
        "Somebody finds a solution to a problem, whereas other people have found pieces of before and then puts it together in a unique way that eventually everyone looks at and says, yeah, well of course.",
        "Let me just state what simply the problem is that he solved.",
        "If you're living in a certain kind of space, basically, how do you know what its shape is?",
        "And by shape I don't mean geometric shape, but shape - does it have holes in it.",
        "You know, they joke that a topologist someone who doesn't know the difference between a doughnut and a coffee cup, which is true because the only thing that matters is that it has one hole.",
        "So you're basically defining families of kinds of objects in space, just like biologists do.",
        "Mathematicians do basically the same thing in terms of classifying.",
        "K.C., I want you to hold that question because we've got to take a break and I want to get to the - you know, give you time to tell us what that question was.",
        "And we'll be back.",
        "As I said, we'll be back with all our guests talking about the big science, math, technology stories of the year.",
        "Also bring on our other guests to give us their ideas.",
        "Stay with us.",
        "We'll be right back after this short break.",

        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking about the top science, health, medicine, technology, mathematics, you know, stories of 2006.",
        "I'm running them down with my guests John Rennie, Barron Lerner, K.C.",
        "Cole and Adam Rogers.",
        "Our number: 1-800-989-8255.",
        "And when I rudely interrupted K.C., as I want to do to all of my guests, she was explaining why the top prize for this year in Science magazine was a mathematics prize.",
        "You were about to tell us the significance.",
        "OK, what I was trying to explain was that this gave you a way of basically figuring out what kind of topological space you live in even though you're embedded in it, which is a very difficult thing to do.",
        "You might ask what possible practical application this kind of thing could have.",
        "Well, as usual, it's a lot of the tools that were developed leading up to it will become very important.",
        "For example, they teach us things about singularities, you know those nasty things at the parts of black holes that pinch off space time, and they pop up as problems all over the place in statistics and math.",
        "So this is actually giving a way to figure out whether or not they're there.",
        "Basically, you imagine a space.",
        "If it's a sphere, you can tie a string around it and pull it closed and you won't encounter any resistance.",
        "If it's got a hole in it and you do the same thing - you pull the string, it will knot.",
        "It will get stuck.",
        "And so it's a mathematical way of seeing the topology of the space that you are living in.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Barron Lerner, what would be your pick?",
        "I guess one story that you didn't mention was surrounding breast cancer.",
        "And interestingly this year, the rates of breast cancer for the last year that we have data, which is 2003, showed a major drop of seven percent of the new cases of the disease.",
        "And this was very striking because for years and years - for reasons that people couldn't explain - that rate of breast cancer was either staying the same or creeping up.",
        "And there were a lot of different hypotheses as to why that was happening, and then all of a sudden we see this very significant seven percent drop.",
        "And now it's being speculated that the reason for that is that women stopped taking hormone replacement therapy because of all the negative publicity about that.",
        "So that was very, very striking because this would suggest that for years and years it was the medicine that was being given to treat the symptoms of menopause that indeed was causing more harm than good.",
        "But it was certainly good news.",
        "I mean, what, they said 40,000 deaths were averted.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean it's very exciting news.",
        "And one would expect that this decline would continue because more and more women have gotten off hormone replacement therapy based on the study results."

        "So one of the things that I don't think you covered this year was the imaging of dark matter.",
        "And you can see a great picture of this at a site called BadAstronomy.com, and they did it through the use of gravitic lenses.",
        "Yeah, it was the collision of two - like the bullet picture I think it was called.",
        "Right, K.C.?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, and that's another great example of people being clever about how to figure out how to see something that you can't see - dark matter being essentially transparent, so it doesn't interact with anything.",
        "So, you know, they figured out, well, if two galaxies collide, the way that the matter clumps with each other is going to be different than the way the dark matter does and therefore it will be distributed differently.",
        "And bingo, they went out and looked for it and they found it.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "John, one of the biggest stories of the year - I mean we think - don't think about it, but we remember that Pluto getting kicked out of the planetary lineup.",
        "Right.",
        "But, you know, Tony, this is probably in many respects not the biggest or most important science story in a lot of ways, but it probably grabbed the public's imagination more than almost anything else.",
        "And it is a development that actually does have some real scientific importance to it.",
        "You know, there's been this question for quite some time when we were looking at Pluto as a sort of very small, oddball planet out sort of towards the edge of the solar system and the question of should it really be a planet.",
        "And it's position has been steadily undermined by the discovery of more and more things out in the Kuiper Belt, the ring of icy bodies out - farther out in the solar system, some of which are actually even larger than Pluto.",
        "So the decision was that this should actually be sort of relegated to a kind of a dwarf planet status.",
        "And I'll take the maybe publicly unpopular opinion.",
        "I think they made the right call on this.",
        "Because I think in terms of what we actually know these days about the science of how planets form, demoting Pluto is actually more in keeping with that science even though it's a very sentimentally unpopular position to take.",
