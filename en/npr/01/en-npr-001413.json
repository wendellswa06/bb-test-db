        "I'm only on level one of \"Zelda,\" so I'm pretty well intact, you know.",

        "So the Wii is the new Nintendo system.",
        "It's this very small little white box.",
        "It looks very much like an Apple design, right?",
        "It's a little kind of white thing, sits very prettily, glows blue next to your television.",
        "This is the first gaming system - I'm not a huge gamer, but we got one in the office and I went in and tried it out.",
        "It's the first one that I seen that made me think this is the thing that adults will take out at parties.",
        "This is a system that is designed to be - not to be used by sort of a, you know \"Halo\" obsessive, you know, who's going to sit in front of a really, really high-end $600 system, like what the Playstation 3 is, and try to be there for hours and hours and really gawk at how great the cinematic quality of the graphics and, you know, how great the blood explosions look because of the new physics engine.",
        "This is a system where - you know, the game that I tried out was the tennis game.",
        "I love the tennis game.",
        "It's fantastic.",
        "And on the Wii the graphics are very cartoonish, intentionally so, because it's simple, right?",
        "But the controllers are motion sensitive and wireless.",
        "So you stand there and you play tennis as if the controller was your racket.",
        "You flick your wrist to hit a ball.",
        "And it's really compelling.",
        "I mean it's like Tetris compelling because it's really fun.",
        "And you sort of stand there with another person standing next to you, and you're making kind of charades-like gesticulations and trying to get this, trying to win a doubles tennis match.",
        "It really was kind of a journey back to simplicity for video games, for computer games, which is totally the opposite direction that most gamers - most game systems, most game software makers are headed.",
        "You know, it's almost like the difference between the Airbus A-380, the giant, you know, double-decker, 600 people, flies around the world, and Boeing's little 787.",
        "That's a smaller plane, more efficient, bigger windows and sort of a nicer experience."

        "The Wii is just a really pleasant experience as a game.",
        "And that's - it's something that, as people get more and more serious about the games, I have a suspicion that they get less fun.",
        "The Wii is actually more fun.",
        "You actually hold all the sports equipment like you do in real life.",
        "I mean it's a little - the controller, they show you how to hold it in the golf game.",
        "You have to hold it like a golf club, stand sideways to the screen, and swing, like, the club.",
        "And someone imitates it on the screen.",
        "Bend your knees, keep your back straight…",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, it's just - baseball it's as hard as somebody throwing in 95-mile-an-hour baseball, actually, when you don't have to hold the thing like a bat.",
        "So you really, I think, as you say, you actually are part of the game instead of just using your thumb to manipulate it like you do in the other controllers.",
        "It's just quite amazing.",
        "This is such an important thing that's going on now with the kind of computers and the online - I think this year was really the first year where you could seriously talk about online worlds and not the be totally geeking out.",
        "I mean places like \"EverQuest\" and \"World of Warcraft\" and \"Second Life\" and \"The Sims\" all really became places people go just as much as San Luis Obispo is a place that people go.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that's a profound change in the way people I think interact with each other, and sort of think about themselves and their own personalities and where they are in space and time.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Another, I guess, watershed event, K.C., that happened is this political situation, how that affected science this year.",
        "And now the switch possibly, because the Democrats are coming back into power.",
        "I'm glad you brought that up.",
        "I was afraid to because I know the last time I was on I talked about that a lot.",
        "But, yeah, what's interesting is it's finally gotten to the point where the scientists are fighting back and saying, enough manipulation, enough wasted money going in really silly programs like the moon to Mars mission, for example, which is just devastating many, many other fields."

        "They found this - founded the Scientists and Engineers for America, an organization that's actually raising money to run advertising supporting candidates in various fields.",
        "Because, you know, it's gotten to that tipping point where people just could not stand anymore the fact that science does not seem to have an ear these days in Washington.",
        "John Rennie, do you agree?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean I think it's - what's unfortunate is that, because the scientists have now had to get sucked into a political process where they have to speak up to defend what should be rational courses of action and the rational interpretation of the scientific findings, it's that unfortunately it does make it possible for people who oppose some of the sorts of actions they'd like to see - for example, global warming deniers and the like - to be able to maintain that scientists themselves just represent their own kind of interest group, their own lobby.",
        "And that I think does - it's a kind of - has a very corrosive effect on the way that the public views science.",
        "And there's going to be a lot of damage that's been done by the people who've been opposing this.",

        "Fox wound up doing political ads in favor of candidates who were doing stem cell research because of his Parkinson's disease - and that was another very interesting mixture of politics and science where, you know, I think Michael J.",
        "Fox was out there as a Parkinson's patient first and foremost saying, I want to scientists to be able to explore whatever they can.",
        "But at least the folks on the Republican side assumed that this was all a political ploy, which I really think it wasn't.",

        "I think it's been very interesting to see the counter reaction to that that you've seen, for example, California trying to take leadership on both stem cell research and also in global warming by setting its own greenhouse gas emission standards."

        "Well, I was going to say one of the most dangerous places, what you might call faith-based science, has been affecting us is in terms of national security.",
        "And we're spending billions and billions of dollars on a missile defense system which virtually, you know, a very tiny percentage of the physics community even think could possibly work.",
        "But just in terms of general reports that scientific organizations have come out with telling us what makes sense to do is not what we're doing in almost every case.",
        "We're just not basing these decisions on how to spend dollars in any rational, sane way.",
        "In fact, even trans fats - I mean I was when I was joking about the cigarettes - but even the dangers we tend to go after in the medical field a lot of times just don't make sense compared to other risk factors.",

        "coli in it or something like that.",
        "And it just occurred to me that what we were told sort of publicly after the anthrax attacks in 2001 was that a new biosafety program, right - we were going to get really concerned about biological weapons being deployed against us, and that that was also going to help us deal with surveillance for food-based illnesses and figure out emerging diseases as well.",
        "And, you know, none of that happened, either.",
        "I think that gets at some of what K.C.",

        "It's that, you know, that even when there's a veneer of rational decision-making or, you know, decisions made based on sort of an immediate panic that we hope will have ramifications that are positive if they go forward; we tend not to be able to make that happen somehow.",
        "We still can't figure out how to keep E.",
        "coli out of the food chain, you know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We still have trouble making large decisions that will span decades, and moving large masses of bureaucracy and people."
