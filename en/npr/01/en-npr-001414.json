        "Right.",
        "This year, two books came out, I believe.",
        "One of them by Lee Smolin and I'm not sure of the other author, but it was titled \"Not Even Wrong.",
        "And you get from the title, books about string theory kind of debunking it or maybe saying it's barking up the wrong tree.",
        "What do the your physics (unintelligible)",
        "Yeah, it's come under a lot of - string theory's being hit left and right.",
        "Let me go to K.C.",
        "and then John, and then go to my panelists.",
        "K.C., What do you think?",
        "Has it had its time and it's ran out?",
        "No.",
        "Has the string run out?",
        "No, it's a very difficult set of problems that they're working with.",
        "But these two books did make a very big splash.",
        "And I have to admit that I wrote one of the most negative reviews, as was the New York Times review.",
        "In that it is so easy to sit back and criticize - really, by people - the other author was Peter Voit who has a Web site, Not Even Wrong - by people who really aren't that much in the middle of it.",
        "Both of the books had a little bit of the flavor of I'm not invited to your meetings.",
        "I'm not in your club.",
        "Nobody is paying attention to my theories.",
        "You get the impression that you have to be an insider.",
        "The thing about string theory is that even string theorists will tell you nobody exactly knows what it is.",
        "It's a way of solving this incompatibility between gravity and the large-scale universe and the small-scale universe.",
        "But it had so many mathematical successes that most people are fairly convinced there is something there, even if they're not sure what.",
        "And what a lot of these books were also addressed at was basically poo-pooing math, as if, well, you know, it's just mathematics, just mathematics - which goes against the long history of math discovering real things, like anti-matter, for example.",
        "So lots is going on in string theory.",
        "It's just that these two books coming out at the same time with the same complaint did get a lot of press attention."

        "It's the theory currently that everybody would have to knock over - what they have to beat to come up with something that is a better theory.",
        "You know, I think string theory - it does, it has contributed a lot and there are legitimate questions of course about, you know, string theory.",
        "There are many, many different formulations - never questions - of how do you settle on what is the best one.",
        "But, really, somebody's got to come up with a theory that clearly works better than string theory does to be a serious critic.",

        "I mean he had, you know, he had published in string theory.",
        "And also, that's a little bit - K.C., that's a little bit of an ad homonym, right?",
        "I mean the substance of the book is very solid.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "If you talk to string theorists, they would say that, throughout the book, the success of loop quantum gravity has been vastly exaggerated compared to string theory.",
        "I think one of his big complaints, which is something that bothers a lot of people in the physics community, is just what Ira mentioned - the fact that string theory has probably an infinite number of solutions.",
        "So you're left with the problem of, well, you know, is there a right solution?",
        "Why are we living in a universe that looks like this when it could look just about any other way?",
        "And several physicists have come out in favor of the anthropic principle, which I'm sure we must have talked about it before.",
        "The idea is that we live in the universe we do because, if it were any different, we couldn't live here.",
        "And that is very bothersome.",

        "All right, we're going to - we'll pick it up, Barry, later on because we love talking about string theory.",

        "It took 15 years to develop this, or at least it took a great number of years to get the FDA to approve it because they were nervous about breathing this stuff in through the lungs, but it seems to have proved to be no problem at all.",
        "And so diabetics, who frequently postpone taking the insulin because they don't want to keep jabbing themselves, hopefully will start on the medication sooner, before they start having serious side effects from the diabetes.",
