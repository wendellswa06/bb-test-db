        "In September 2000, Kris Freeman took a routine blood test and found out he had Type 1 diabetes.",
        "His body wasn't making insulin, the hormone that helps turn sugar and other foods into energy.",
        "Type 2 diabetes is the more common form, often brought on by obesity and lack of exercise.",
        "Certainly those weren't problems for Kris Freeman at the time of his diagnosis.",
        "He was a superbly conditioned athlete in one of the most strenuous endurance sports.",

        "It was, Oh my God, can I keep skiing?",
        "The first three doctors he asked said no. Freeman, 19 at the time, would have none of that.",
        "But he realized if he were going to prove the doctors wrong, he'd have to approach his illness the way he'd done almost everything else in his life, with precision and focus.",
        "I have so much respect for my body that I immediately started treated myself as though I had diabetes and even took insulin the first night that I came home from the doctor.",
        "Freeman went research crazy.",
        "He learned about the importance of keeping his blood sugar level not too high, not too low.",
        "He had to start keeping track of what he was eating and drinking, and Freeman became tethered to his little black bag, a wallet-size carrying case that contains injectable insulin and gadgets for measuring blood sugar.",
        "During the video shoot, he demonstrated the process, first jabbing the tip of his finger with a device the size of a pen that has a needle on the tip.",

        "How about an ice cream maker?",

        "They can be critical, they can be honest with me, but there's always a kind of very loving support because, after all, non-white folks have a stake in white people getting their act together on the question of race.",
        "You talk about white people and non-white people, and in a country like ours where you have the immigration mix changing, do you ever foresee whiteness encompassing what we call non-white people, perhaps Asians, perhaps south Asians, or do you think whiteness is a fairly well defined and fortified territory at this point?",
        "Well, I think there are two lines that whiteness will never cross.",
        "Because of the distinct history of the United States, I think the indigenous genocide and the holocaust of African slavery mean that white America, and at least white America in its current state, is not going to be able to encompass people of African descent or people of indigenous descent.",
        "You mentioned south Asians.",
        "I know some south Asians - Indians, Pakistanis - who are very dark-skinned but consider themselves white.",
        "They come out of a professional background and a middle-class status, and in some ways they think of themselves as white.",
        "Whiteness can be flexible, as in any system of domination and power.",
        "The people in power can be flexible when they need to.",
        "But I think the distinctive history of slavery and the indigenous genocide, the crimes are so deeply woven into the fabric of American society that it will be very difficult for us to cross that line until we come clean; that is, white America, the dominant culture, comes clean about the nature of those holocausts.",
        "Are you afraid, again, that your language, like holocaust, like white supremacy, will prevent people from understanding what you're talking about, or are you - you talk in the beginning of the book about saying that love in action is often harsh.",
        "Yeah, I think actually some of the polite diversity, multi-cultural language we've been using in recent decades precludes us from really coming to terms with some of these realities about white supremacy.",
        "So yes, I realize the language is harsh, but I'm speaking to white people who are struggling.",
        "The audience for this book is really white liberals, not reactionary, right-wing conservatives who are in complete denial about the nature of racism.",
        "I use the term holocaust knowing that that's a very delicate term.",
        "Many people want to reserve it simply for the Nazi attempt to eliminate European Jews, but I think when we're talking about millions of people murdered, we're talking entire societies, entire continents ravages, I think holocaust is an important and appropriate term.",
        "It gives us a sense of the scope.",
        "The United States came into being through a racist holocaust of indigenous people.",
        "The United States, the Europeans who invaded the United States continent, killed almost every single Indian on the way to creating the United States.",
        "Well, I don't know what word is better for that than holocaust.",
        "African slavery, of course, we're talking about an unknown number of people dead in the process of rounding up slaves in Africa.",
        "The middle passage, plantation life in both North and South America.",
        "Certainly tens of millions, some argue for even higher figures.",
        "That's another holocaust."

        "I would like to believe that someday the concept of race evaporates and people do not divide up the world according to race.",
        "But we can't get to the stage where that's possible, of course, until we come clean, as I say, until we come to terms with the racialized and racist history of the society in which we live.",
