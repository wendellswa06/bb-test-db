        "Then there was another company called Vanadium Corporation of America, which did mine vanadium, but they had a secret contract to siphon off uranium from vanadium or -for the Army.",

        "Well, the Navajos did.",
        "What happened there was an Indian trader was helping them, and he put some stones out on his counter, and about 15 miles away, there was a valley where the patriarch who had settled the place had found these strange rocks up on the mesa where he'd graze his sheep.",
        "And he called this stuff leetso, which is the Navajo word for yellow dirt.",

        "But the federal inspectors let them go without cleaning up.",
        "And so there was all this ore that was nicely squared off by the blasting laying around, and there were these sandy mounds at four processing sites around Navajo, huge in this one area where the betrayal took place, they had two piles.",
        "One covered 20 acres, and one covered 10.",
        "And it was - the Navajos were very poor and very practical, and they discovered this stuff made really good cement.",
        "And they had these square rocks, and they used it to build foundations and floors and bread ovens and stucco walls.",
        "Wow, and so you recount how when some of the white people came in, they had Geiger counters, and they wow, it like went off the charts.",

        "And they would actually come and do medical exams, but they were under orders not to scare away the workforce.",
