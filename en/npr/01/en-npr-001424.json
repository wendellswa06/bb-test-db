        "From the security community standpoint, whenever a victim pays, it not only encourages the actual criminal who's attacking the user or the company in this instance, but it also encourages other cybercriminals to do the same.",
        "What makes certain industries, say, like the medical industry, more vulnerable than others?",
        "Well, the medical industry is - not only the fact that they often don't have the kind of resources or budget to invest in cybersecurity similar to other big corporations usually 'cause they're spending a lot of it on medical equipment and things like that, but the different kinds of equipment they have to use usually aren't updated as quickly as far as what operating system they run on or what kind of tools they have, which makes them vulnerable.",

        "This hospital paid the hackers.",
        "What assurance can it give patients that that data is safe?",
        "Well, the data itself has been unencrypted according to the hospital after they paid the ransom.",
        "As far as assurance on whether or not it's safe from now on, the reality is that no data is really that safe because of just a lax amount of security that's employed by hospitals, organizations, things like that.",
        "I'm really trying to think of a good answer that sounds reassuring.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "This is depressing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, it is.",
        "Why can't you?",
        "Is there something - are certain industries vulnerable, and if so, why?",
        "Every industry is vulnerable.",
        "A few years ago, we saw attacks - breaches from retailers like Target or Home Depot, so credit card information, personal information like that was stolen.",
        "We saw attacks against banks which went after things like personal details - your address, your phone number.",
        "We've seen attacks against insurance companies and other medical facilities.",
        "I mean, unfortunately, it seems to be a trend these days that after an attack happens to a particular industry, that industry starts paying a lot more attention to the cybersecurity measures.",
        "And in this case, with hospitals, I guarantee you that medical facilities, hospitals and things like that will start taking these kinds of attacks more seriously than they ever have before."

        "Who are their friends down here?",
        "And this is a neglected body in terms of that, and I'm not speaking strictly as a Republican, but I can say this having served under Clinton, we had a much better relationship even with a president who'd been impeached by this body."
