        "...The Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets.",
        "The Warriors have won 2 out of the last 3 titles, including last year.",
        "But a lot of fans think that they'll be dethroned this time around.",
        "How come?",
        "Houston's the No. 1 seed by virtue of the best record in the NBA this season.",
        "The explosive guard tandem of James Harden and newcomer Chris Paul has worked brilliantly despite doubts before the season.",
        "And Houston has the home-court advantage.",
        "And that means the uber-powerful Warriors start the series with two road games.",
        "Golden State obviously is good enough to win anywhere.",
        "But if the series does go the distance to Game 7 in Houston, that's where home court could be very valuable.",
        "Does any of this have an effect on the scoring?",
        "I mean, these are two high-scoring teams typically.",
        "Oh, the two best offensive teams in the NBA - we're going to see lots of scoring with two distinct styles.",
        "If you distill their offensive philosophies down to a word, Golden State would be movement - Houston, space.",
        "The Warriors are constantly moving, cutting, always looking to find the best shot even if that means it's Steph Curry 40 feet from the basket.",
        "The Rockets emphasize spacing the floor, putting two or three players out wide beyond the three-point line.",
        "Now, this gives more room to operate for those two guys I mentioned, James Harden and Chris Paul.",
        "Ball and player movement aren't as big a deal with Houston.",
        "The Rockets want to shoot a ton of three-pointers or get layups but not much in between.",
        "All right, I want to tackle the East side now...",
        "Yeah.",
        "And while you're not exactly a celebrity, you were a public figure, at least in Fredericksburg and the surrounding area.",
        "And the story then traveled quickly.",
        "You were compared to Michael Vick, even to Seung-Hui Cho, the man who opened fire at Virginia Tech.",
        "Correct.",
        "And in recent e-mails compared to O.J.",
        "Simpson, but also compared to Larry Craig…",
        "The senator from Idaho."

        "Correct.",
        "Complete with, I believe, some questionable discourse around that.",
        "These kinds of things reflect people's anger, people's upset, but I think they reflect, I'll say a failure to take the first lesson of this, which is to open some space for a rational discourse and thought prior to action.",
        "It's important in these cases, when there are calamities, that we sit back and ask what happened and why.",
        "If this is out of character, that presumes a character to be out of.",
        "And it's important not to let your anger take over and I think with that, the whole situation could have turned out much more differently, much differently.",
        "I simply believe that I should have been allowed the time to explain myself, to resign, and then to have me and the institution and the town move on in better terms.",
        "As the newly appointed president - as you say, just 10 months into your, in your tenure there - would you understand that people at the university thought that you had embarrassed the institution?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I said it right from the beginning, and I apologized for that.",
        "I apologized, in fact, to every member of the board directly when I met with them.",
        "On the other hand, a complicated situation like this needs time to be understood.",
        "Incidentally, explanations are not excuses, and all I wanted was time to explain and understand myself what happened.",
        "And I think that's very important.",
        "Instead, very quickly, you were being asked to explain yourself in front of university committees and that sort of thing.",
        "Well, I actually volunteered to go down to the board to explain to them what I knew, but I don't think the whole story worked out very well.",
        "As I have said, I don't think I told the story well, but I don't think they listened very well.",
        "The issue here, really, is you can't know the - the causes and consequences of something like this until you go through it.",
        "I didn't know about my depression.",

        "Imagine that.",

        "I was embarrassed.",
        "I was ashamed.",
        "I needed dignity.",
        "I needed to find out what was going on.",
        "Do I really need to say those things?",
        "My wife, of course, became a lightning rod, soothsayer and doubtful predictor of events and so my family stepped up to the plate.",
        "But again, I'm saying that explanations are not excuses, but an explanation helps us understand and get us to those lessons that we need so that we all can move on more positively.",
        "On the TALK OF THE NATION Opinion Page, we're talking with William Frawley.",

        "For him to have been treated the way he was, to lose his position and possibly his career, I think the penalty far outweighed the incident.",

        "Well, I know that people who are involved in drunk-driving incidents are acting in a manner that is normally, totally unlike the manner in which they conduct their daily lives.",
        "And when an incident like this occurs, as he stated, everything came together and it was the perfect storm - that isn't something that happens every day.",
        "He wasn't drunk driving to and from school.",
        "He wasn't drunk driving on all his time off.",
        "This was a specific incident based on a number of symptoms that he had.",

        "Again, I'm not excusing my behavior, and I take responsibility, and I did make some bad judgments, and I think I needed to move on to a different position.",
        "The important thing is how we handle ourselves in the aftermath, understanding what the causes are and what - and what the consequences should be.",
        "You know, the workaholism, depression workaholism, alcohol self-medication cycle is very well-known, and IMH has a number of studies about it, AMA has that, and it's particularly apparent among men.",
        "That's the kind of thing that male executives, holding constant that there more are male executives than female executives, happens and this needs to be dealt with in that way.",
