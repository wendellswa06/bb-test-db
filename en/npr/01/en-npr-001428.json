        "His mom, as you say, becomes ill and eventually leaves in early chapters.",
        "And this shatters him completely.",
        "And without that kind of maternal foundation, he spends much of the rest of the novel trying to kind of reconstruct a sense of self that can exist without the presence of a mother who's there for him or a father who's there - because his father is careening from job to job himself and doesn't have necessarily the time to be the kind of presence in his life that Tunde needs.",
        "Well, you know, it's - as you put it, infected with pain, but it's also infused with love.",
        "Yes.",
