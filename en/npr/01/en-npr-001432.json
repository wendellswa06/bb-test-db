        "And over those years, I've noticed in trying to do what I can to promote blues musicians coming through town, putting them up even at my house to let them save a little money, I've really noticed lately that it's a struggle for touring musicians.",
        "Aside from things like festivals during the summer, which always seem to have a good audience, the Blues Cruise is always sold out, premiere clubs like yours, Legends in Chicago, get the crowds.",
        "Wrong choice of word - a fertile ground for study?",
        "So how realistic do you think it is that a Democrat could win this seat?",
        "But the little clubs that get strung up across the country are really struggling, and musicians are having to travel a lot longer distances at a lot higher overhead to sustain themselves.",
        "I'm just wondering what your opinion is about the state of the average touring blues musician across the country, trying to make the bread-and-butter gigs.",
        "Well, I think it's a little rougher now than it was on me, but if you hear what I had to go through, what Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf and them, you would tell them they're doing fine, because we used to have to take a hotdog man and feed me, Junior Wells and half of the band, and driving through there.",
        "When I first come through Salt Lake City, I was almost out of gas, and we scrapped up enough to make it all the way.",
        "We was going to San Francisco, from Chicago to San Francisco, no stop in Denver, no stop in Salt Lake City.",
        "And I'm, like, I wonder why don't they stop me here.",
        "At least I could go to sleep and somebody would probably give me a hotdog.",
        "But, you know, if you come up through what you're telling me where they're coming up through now, they'll know how to appreciate it if you make it.",
        "Now, I was in Australia about 35 years ago and watching television, and they said, you know, athletes, musicians, whatever, I don't care how good you are, only 5 percent going to make it."
