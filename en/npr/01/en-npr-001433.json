        "The crisis in Ukraine and Russia's action there has raised many questions about who wants what.",
        "We're joined now by Julia Ioffe, senior editor at The New Republic, formerly a correspondent for The New Yorker from Moscow.",
        "Thanks very much for being with us.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "What do you see that's going on that's distinct from the way it's been cast in so many accounts as some people being pro-European in Ukraine, some people being pro-Russia?",
        "You know, I arrived in Kiev just after the shooting stopped and right before Yanukovych fled the country.",
        "And what struck me was that by this point this was not about Russia and it was not about Europe and it was certainly not about the U.S.",
        "It was about Yanukovych and his corruption and the way the kind of thuggish way he ran the country and about the kind of country these people wanted to live in.",
        "The other misconception you hear a lot about Ukraine is the East-West divide, that the West speaks Ukrainian and wants to be part of Europe and that the East speaks Russian and wants to be part of Russia, and that's not quite true.",
        "First of all, everybody speaks Ukrainian.",
        "Everybody speaks Russian.",
        "There are more Ukrainian speakers in the West and more Russian speakers in the East.",
        "But historically, it's been a rural-urban divide.",
        "So, the rural areas speak Ukrainian and the cities and the industrial areas speak Russian.",
        "Now, it's become a generational divide.",
        "So, older people, for example, of Vladimir Putin's generation and even a bit younger think the way he does.",
        "So, for example, in 2008 at a Russian NATO summit in Bucharest, Romania, he told George W.",
        "Bush, who was then our president, he said, you know, George, what is Ukraine really?",
        "It's not a real country; you realize that, right?",
        "And there are people who really think that, who think that the way that the Soviet Union was carved up into these individual countries has created a lot of fictitious borders and fictitious countries.",
        "But what I found in Donetsk and the Russian-speaking southeast of Ukraine was that people born after 1991 into an independent Ukraine identified as Ukrainian, regardless of their ethnicity, regardless of their language preference.",
        "There's very much a generational divide.",
        "The question that seems to raise itself every few hours here, is this divide so deep and so serious that the two groups that you described can't inhabit the same country safely?",
        "Right, 'cause, you know, between 1990 and 2003, Congress embarked on this campaign to double the NIH budget over a five-year period.",
        "So during those years, NIH was getting increases of about 15 percent a year.",
        "But since then, you know, the budget has flattened out, and for 2006, as we said, NIH budget is getting cut for the first time in almost 40 years.",
        "Does this kind of budget increase and cuts in some places and increases in the Pentagon money and space explorations--does that surprise you, given the priorities the president has set?",
        "According to the latest obesity researchers, 67 percent of Americans are overweight or obese.",
        "It seems almost like the harder we try to lose weight, the more weight we are gaining.",
        "And for all the money we spend on weight loss gimmicks, scientists at clinics and universities spend their research dollars trying to figure out even the most basic questions about weight.",
        "Is one diet better than another?",
        "Are there genetic reasons for obesity?",
        "The answers have often been surprising, and my next guest has been following weight loss research, has gathered the myths and realities about dieting into her new book.",
        "Gina Kolata is a science writer for the New York Times.",
        "She's the author of \"\"Rethinking Thin: The New Science of Weight Loss - and the Myths and Realities of Dieting.\"\" Good to see you again, Gina.",

        "Well, there's been decade after decade after decade of research that explains not - that shows not just how very difficult it is, but why it's so very difficult.",
