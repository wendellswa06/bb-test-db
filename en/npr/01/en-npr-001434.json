        "And they weren't - they took out the smokers, they adjusted - every time they look for something, the curve persisted.",
        "So I said, well, why would it be that overweight is better?",
        "And one hypothesis -and it's just a hypothesis - is when people get old and they get a chronic disease and they get cancer or something, if they're very thin, they have no reserves, I mean, if they start to lose weight because they're ill, there's nothing left.",
        "The other thing is the question of being fit and fat.",

        "They hit a certain weight range and then their blood sugar goes up, and if they could just get below it, it might go down again, but they have a lot of trouble.",
        "There is a big study by the National Institutes of Health, which took people who were on the verge of getting diabetes, their blood sugar have been rising.",
        "And they divided them into three groups.",
        "One group took a blood sugar-lowering drug.",
        "One group was the control and one group dieted and exercised.",
        "They had intensive therapy on dieting and exercise.",

        "They hadn't really lost weight.",
        "What they'd done was kept up with the walking program.",
        "And that seem - and so that wasn't so much that they've lost a lot of weight, but that they were fit.",
        "So if maybe that if health is the issue, maybe trying to tell everybody that they have to lose 50, 60, 70 pounds - which they can't do anyway - is not really the best answer."
