        "And there are, of course, a lot of others.",
        "And as you said, in this 2006 budget that the president just signed, only two of them really have a significant increase, and those are DOD for weapons and NASA for space.",

        "This is a dark time.",
        "This is the fall of 1944.",
        "So it's just a few months after the landings at Normandy, and you've got allied forces making their way across the continent, headed toward Berlin and Munich.",

        "So Paperclip has to figure out how to get these scientists in a way that's morally acceptable.",

        "He said it was always really about the science.",
        "He was always thinking about space, and he was a reluctant Nazi.",
        "I found otherwise.",

        "government, NASA in particular, was so complicit in keeping his past hidden.",
        "And in doing the research, one discovers that, you know, not only was von Braun an ardent Nazi, but a member of the SS.",
        "And not only was he running the underground slave labor facility where his rockets were being built - he wasn't running the facility, but he was in charge of the science there - but when they were running low of good technicians, Wernher von Braun himself traveled nearby to the Buchenwald concentration camp, where he handpicked slaves to work for him as laborers.",
        "And when you see that kind of activity during the war, and you have to imagine what he saw and what he knew, it's impossible to excuse him from his Nazi past.",
        "Another thing that's really remarkable in this is that after this rush to acquire the secrets of Nazi biological and chemical weapons, there was a great push to get our own biological and chemical weapons program up and running, using these same men.",
        "And, you know, through the lens of history, this all seems like one tragedy compiled on another - when you consider that right now, you know, it's - Syria's chemical weapons are being destroyed at great expense; those are the chemical weapons that were developed by the Nazis.",
        "And I write about this at length, and located some astonishing documents that had never before been revealed, showing that Army officers with the Chemical Corps worked and enjoyed working with some of Hitler's closest scientists.",
