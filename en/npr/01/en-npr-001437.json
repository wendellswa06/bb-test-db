        "It means an opportunity to motivate and bring out the Latino vote.",
        "We are a growing community.",

        "We are a very young community, but more and more folks are turning to the voting age and so we have a large number of voter registration efforts, perhaps the most in our history.",
        "There is a great deal of attention paid by both candidates to our votes, so it's an opportunity to show our muscle, if you will.",
        "You say there's been a lot of attention paid by both campaigns to your vote, yet we hear very little talk about immigration from either candidate.",
        "I think they're avoiding it for obvious reasons, but it remains a top issue within our community and within the American people, and I suspect that it will be on the agenda early on in whatever administration takes office.",
        "And the good news from our perspective is that both candidates are committed to a comprehensive immigration reform.",
        "Yet Senator McCain, who proposed that immigration bill in Congress and was one of its principle sponsors, now says he would vote against his own bill."

        "And you say, for obvious reasons, neither candidate is addressing the issue.",
        "What's the obvious reason?",
        "The obvious reason is that we have a very strange situation where the president of the United States, the leaders in both Congress - both sides of the House in Congress, the Chamber of Commerce, the FLCIO, the major religious organizations, all were in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, but you had a very shrill and effective talk-show minority, greater talk show who were able to galvanize the American people against this bill.",
        "Are you surprised, in a way, given that what happened there, are you surprised that you're not seeing this issue being demagogued(ph) in this campaign?",
        "Well, I'm not sure it's not being demagogued at the local level.",
        "I think it is still being demagogued, but I'm happy that at least that either candidate is demagoguing this issue, yes, very much so.",
        "In terms of the Latino civil rights, are we just talking about immigration here?",
