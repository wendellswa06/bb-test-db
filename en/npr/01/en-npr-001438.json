        "Yeah.",
        "...because NASA's budget is going up, but not nearly enough to do everything that NASA has traditionally done.",
        "In order to build this next generation of human spacecraft, NASA is cutting its other investments in areas such as astronomy, biological research, environmental monitoring of the earth and also aeronautics.",
        "How did the National Science Foundation do?",
        "Well, the National Science Foundation received a small increase in its budget, which is very important since NSF is the primary funding source for university researchers in areas other than medicine.",
        "But NSF hasn't done very well in the past few years, so in real terms, NSF has less money to spend this year than it has in the last few years.",
        "So it's...",
        "Are...",
        "...going to be a painful adjustment for many of these researchers.",
        "Are there any major projects that are outstanding that we would know about that--who will have to be cut back from the budget?",
        "Well, there won't be--there's not one big project that you could point to, because federal research is funded in, you know, thousands of grants given to researchers around the country, and they're all taking, you know, small pieces of this quest for new knowledge.",
        "Unfortunately or fortunately, I mean, this impact is going to be felt in pieces, and the true impacts may not be clear for years or maybe even decades to come because research is an investment into our future.",
        "Yeah.",

        "It's called the animal kingdom, but Iain Couzin of Princeton University says most animals live in something closer to a democracy.",
        "One common property we see in animal groups, from schooling fish to flocking birds to primate groups, is that they effectively vote to decide where to go and what to do.",
        "When one fish heads for a potential source of food, the other fish vote with their fins on whether to follow.",
        "Couzin says his research shows that this highly democratic process helps groups of animals make better decisions than any one member of the group could.",
        "He says it also shows that successful animal leaders know that they can't get too far ahead of their constituents.",
        "They seem to simply reconcile their own goal-oriented behavior - you know, I want to move over there - with this local tendency to align with others.",
        "Because if you don't tend to be influenced by others, you then leave the group behind and you may get eaten by predators or you lose the benefits of group living.",
        "Couzin says these sorts of findings in animals should be of interest to human leaders, because we humans carry a lot of evolutionary baggage with us into the voting booth.",
        "He says when it comes to leadership, people are especially similar to animals that live in groups and depend on cooperation to survive.",
        "And these groups tend to pick cooperative leaders."

        "Take chimps, for example.",
        "In chimpanzees it's not necessarily the physically strongest individual who seizes the control over the group, who becomes the alpha, it's usually the more cunning individual; someone who forms his coalitions well and picks a partner who, together with him, they can overthrow the alpha.",
