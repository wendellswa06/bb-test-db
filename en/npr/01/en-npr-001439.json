        "Well, because nobody had a majority so it was a matter of assembling enough building blocks among these parties to have a majority.",
        "That's right.",
        "He lost by two seats, his party did, but obviously the next step is to form a government.",
        "And it was always going to be difficult for Iyad Allawi, the leader of the rival Iraqiya list(ph), which is seen as a sort of secular list, although he is a Shiite.",
        "Most of his votes came from Sunnis and so it was always going to be difficult to construct a parliamentary block where they were the majority.",
        "You say that there was this party that got the most votes but hasn't been able to assemble a coalition that included both major religious groups.",
        "Instead, Nouri al-Maliki is close to assembling his majority and he would basically be relying on Shia votes to do that.",
        "What does that mean for Iraq?",
        "I'm not sure if that's the right word, but we are sometimes - get the feeling that we are strangers in our own country.",
        "Strangers in your own country.",
        "There is a sort of a divide within the Latino community between those who have been here - many people for generation upon generation upon generation, and newer arrivals, as some of whom arrive here without papers.",
        "Well, even those who - let me give you a better history.",
        "During the '30s, when we had the last Depression, perhaps close to a million Latino - particularly Mexican-American citizens, were illegally deployed into Mexico, illegally deported according to our laws.",
        "So what you're seeing is some of the grandchildren of those people who were illegally deported coming back to this country.",
        "We also had a million Brazilo(ph) workers coming into this country.",
        "And so are those folks who were brought here initially under legal circumstances and began to form a pattern of working in this country.",
        "There is also a pattern that does form, as you suggest, during economic bad times when people seem to want to find scapegoats.",
        "Do you fear that Latinos will be the scapegoats?",
        "Absolutely, we have a tradition in this country of trying to blame some group for malaise, whether it's the Italians during the crime days or whether it's Chinese workers who take our jobs.",
        "That's an unfortunate human condition.",
        "We're talking with Raul Yzaguirre, the civil rights activist, the former head of the National Council of La Raza, a national Hispanic advocacy organization and a think tank in the United States.",

        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "And let's start with Charles, and Charles is on the line with us from Chicago, Illinois.",
        "Yes, Raul, I want to commend Raul for all of his participation and how he has opened the doors for many second and third generation Latinos.",

        "Thank you.",
        "My comment is - is from the perspective that Latinos are scapegoats right now.",
        "And the unfortunate thing that the whole immigration issue is an issue of racism and prejudice and - are easy to identify, just like the blacks are black individuals, they have black skin.",
        "Latinos are brown and they have brown skin, and they have a last name that's identifiable.",
        "This isn't going to be easy unless we really address the issue from that perspective and that Americans need to understand that Latinos are in their home.",
        "They are in their homeland, they are in America, and they are Americans, and that we need to really make a major effort to change the ideology.",
        "I think when we talk about revolution and change taking place, I think what needs to change is the way we think and how we formulate our ideas and our philosophies about who is American and who this country really belongs to.",
        "I think this election is an opportunity for the second and third generation Latinos to take a very serious stand and claim their heritage as Americans and participate fully in American society.",
        "Thank you for that, Charles.",
        "And I wonder, Raul Yzaguirre, as you listen to him, I'm sure that you find much to agree with.",
        "I wonder, though, and let me ask you both.",
        "Do you find any - is it just racism?",
        "Is it only racism if you say you want to protect the border?",
        "No, of course not.",
        "There's lots of folks who are immigration restrictionists are not racist, and they're concerned about the legitimate issues such as crime and inability to control our borders.",
        "We are a sovereign nation, and we have the right to control our own borders, there's no question about that.",
        "But the fact remains that there are a lot, for example, there are a lot of Irish folks in Boston who are undocumented aliens.",
        "They came out in the immigrant race and protests, and nobody talks about those folks.",
        "And so there's an element of racism that we need to ecognize.",
        "Charles, what do you think?",
        "I really think there are many issues, not only just racism, like there's an issue of security, but those kinds of issues, I think, are bloated up.",
        "I think one of the issues is that if we have an issue of security, there's biometric card identification systems we can put together.",
        "I think it's more that the American people, the American public needs to understand why Latinos are here, why Hispanics are here.",
        "They've been here.",
        "I was - I was born here.",
        "My parents came here in the late '40s.",
        "You know, we're - and I'm from a Puerto Rican background, but the Latino immigration issue is my problem, and even if I am Puerto Rican and I am an American citizen.",
        "I think that if the American public understood more of what these issues mean and how we can deal with security issues, hw we can protect our borders, how important trade with Mexico, with Latin America is, how important to maintain good relations with places like Ecuador, Venezuela, Bolivia, and how important those things are for the stability of the hemisphere.",
        "I think it's a matter, like I said, of a revolution of ideas, of changing thinking.",
        "And I think Raul and his organization has done that in the past and is really reaching out to second and third generation Latinos, as well as to Americans, the American public.",
        "I think the rhetoric that goes out there, you know...",
        "Charles...",
        "You know, to protect America, that's - I think that's what affects it most."
