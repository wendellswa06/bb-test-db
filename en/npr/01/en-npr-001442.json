        "For some of us, that role is to be out on the frontline, for some of us is to write the checks.",

        "Like I said, there are, you know, we are African-American same-gender loving people so we have a lot of issues.",

        "So its one of those things I think especially now, today, because there is a lot more activism and a lot more visibility - you mentioned television - that younger people like Mark are more comfortable to come out.",
        "Because if I look around today, I work in Compton, I see so many more out young black women and men from my days when I was in school, which was just 10, 15 years ago.",
        "Well, you know, let me ask you about language, though.",
        "You used the term same-gender loving people.",
        "Right.",

        "It's kind of like Jasmyne said earlier: You know, I can't separate my blackness from my lesbianism because it's all a part of the same person.",
        "But I think there is this sort of unspoken and sometimes a very verbal taboo against interracial dating in this community.",
        "I've had friends that have told me that if they ever found me dating - if I was ever dating a white woman that I was no longer welcome in their homes.",
        "What?",
        "Or that I could come but I couldn't bring my partner kind of thing.",
        "And I think, you know, I kind of laugh about that now, but I think it just speaks to a lot of internalized hatred, self-hatred, that we still harbor a lot of internalized homophobia, and not recognizing, you know, one, there are very few of us.",
        "We are a small, limited community even though we think we're this huge community, and to some degree we are.",
        "But the reality is love knows no color.",
        "And I almost laugh when I hear myself say that.",
        "I think people have a right to choose who they will share their affections with but, you know, I think to have some of the views that we have around interracial dating in this community are as dangerous as a lot of the views that white people hold about black people in general.",
        "Jasmyne, I'm going to give you the last word.",

        "Karl Rove, at the time, had--was a candidate for the leadership of the College Republican organization, and the election was disputed.",
        "Rove was accused in essence of dirty tricks, of encouraging espionage on other candidates, and there were delegate selection contests.",
        "The battle was so fraught for this organ--the chairmanship of this organization that it fell to the Republican National Committee chair, George H.W.",
        "Bush, to rule to decide the dispute.",
        "He reviewed the case, reviewed it pretty closely actually, assigned an FBI agent to question Karl Rove, and he came away convinced that Karl had done nothing wrong, but he was impressed by Karl Rove's drive and intellect and hired him right away as an aide to the Republican National Committee.",

        "Bush, did not end happily.",
        "Well, it was--Karl Rove's career, although he is very much in the background in Washington, seldom interviewed publicly, not a frequent face on television, though that's changed in the last few weeks, his career has--because he is such an aggressive and skilled political player, and pushes the envelope on everything that he does, he has landed in controversy and he did, Neal, as you just suggested, land in some controversy when he worked for the first--for President Bush's--this is George H.W.",

        "Interesting, isn't it, since that's the name of the columnist to whom the current leak probe is--has in part been focused.",
        "And the leak to Novak was what went on in this meeting in which the Texas state chair was berated.",
        "The chair at the time, a fellow by the name of Rob Mosbacher, charged and, according to Houston Chronicle, still believes that Karl Rove was the leaker.",

        "He has--my colleague with whom I wrote this article and worked the book, Peter Wallsten, and I believed that he probably has the broadest portfolio of any White House aide in history, and that he's accumulated more power in that in one office than any aide in history, but his official portfolio ranges across domestic and foreign policy.",
