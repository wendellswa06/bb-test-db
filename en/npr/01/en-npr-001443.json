        "Environmentalists and Indian tribes on the one side not wanting to lower water levels in the river.",
        "Farmers desperate for water for their crops said, `We have to water our crops and we need to lower these water levels.'",

        "Karl Rove got his start or this job in national politics in Washington through the father and came to know him very well and the father found indeed in that investigation, the College Republican case, found in Karl's favor.",

        "Now earlier today President Bush himself was asked, I think, himself for the second time in as many days about Karl Rove's political future at the White House and whether he thought he had done anything wrong and that sort of thing.",
        "President of the United States said, `There's an ongoing investigation.",
        "I'm not gonna talk about any of this until that investigation is completed.",
        "Yet clearly given both his professional and personal relationship with the president, if it comes to it, this is gonna be a very painful decision.",
        "Well, this is a very tough moment for this White House, in part because of the strong statements that were made previously about the invest--about what would happen to an individual who leaked the name of a covert CIA agent.",
        "The president said on more than one occasion that he would fire the leaker, someone who committed that act if they were identified.",
        "And as you know, Scott McClellan told the public that it was ridiculous to think that Karl Rove and others were involved in the leaking of classified information.",
        "So if it indeed turns out that Karl Rove is involved, it's a very--it will--it's a very difficult situation for the White House to respond to, and one of the things we're already seeing is a sort of careful parsing of language.",
