        "When General David Petraeus finally got to take his turn at the microphones this afternoon, the first thing he wanted to do was assure his audiences that his report was independent and that the surge was to some degree working.",
        "As a bottom line up front, the military objectives of the surge are in large measure being met.",
        "In recent months, in the face of tough enemies in the brutal summer heat of Iraq, coalition and Iraqi security forces have achieved progress in the security arena.",
        "Though the improvements have been uneven across Iraq, the overall number of security incidents in Iraq has declined in eight of the past 12 weeks, with the number of incidents in the last two weeks at the lowest levels seen since June (unintelligible).",
        "When he arrived here, Petraeus told me it might be too little too late.",
        "But he clearly now thinks the military has a good change if the effort is sustained, and he's going to ask for more time to reassess the situation in March before making further reductions.",
        "That would mean an additional six months with a second assessment to come on the first anniversary of the surge.",
        "Even the war's critics agree that there has been progress in some parts of Iraq, such as the notoriously violent Anbar province.",
        "But there's disagreement as to who should get the credit for the progress that has been made.",
        "Michigan Senator Carl Levin talked with NPR's Jacki Lyden about that yesterday.",
        "There's going to be disagreement over whether or not the progress in Anbar province is a result of the surge or whether or not the Sunni sheikhs in Anbar province decided even before this surge that they just had enough of al-Qaida.",
        "And so, Levin says, the launch of the surge and the reduction of al-Qaida may be coincidental.",
        "Whatever the reason, one of the larger questions remains whether the progress the troops are making is sustainable.",
        "In a recent letter to his troops, Petraeus acknowledged the toll the war has taken on their ranks and their families - in fatalities, and casualties, and in sheer mental stress.",
        "As General Petraeus makes his assessment public, the question now is what continued sacrifices will be required of his people, for what reason, and for how long.",

        "He addressed your head.",
        "You had to think in a King sermon, but you also were going to feel.",
        "Any sermon that I preach, if it does not challenge people to think, that's not quite getting, and if it does not move them to feel, it doesn't get it.",
        "And what about that preaching style would you say stands out in the minds of the American people and our ears?",
        "Well, I think that there was a kind of magic about the cadence and the tone of his voice and the way he actually started quite frequently fairly slow, but slowly you were enveloped and you were a part of his pace; you moved along with him.",
        "He engaged you.",
        "I mean, often he would ask a question repeatedly, and even if you didn't get a chance to answer back, you thought back an answer.",

        "Now I would assume that the topics that were chosen or the topics addressed by King also influenced his speaking style.",

        "But he brought the biblical story to bear and often would tell the story and then apply it, or sometimes would describe the nature of the crisis and then bring a biblical image to bear on it.",
        "Reverend Forbes, you've cited a key word, and that is `image.'",
        "Yes.",

        "His messages had images, but the images always were muscular; by that, I mean his images required you to think about what action is necessary in order to rise to the occasion.",
        "Whatever he said, the image managed to get both into your mind and then it would, in a sense, trickle down into your soul and eventually it would be down to your feet where you were ready to take some action about what he said.",
