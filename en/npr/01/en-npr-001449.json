        "But you know, for 15,000 people, that's their life.",
        "And I think what I was interested in looking at is the way that jobs that used to be done in a relatively small way by teams of 10, 15 people are now done by thousands of people, and the feelings that provide, that creates, principally the feeling of a loss of meaning.",
        "You know, one of the things I think we all really want from our work is a feeling that our work is meaningful.",
        "Again and again, I came across that when I talked to people in their workplace.",
        "Of course, you want a salary, you want to be, you know, paid for what you do.",
        "But you also want to feel that you're making a difference.",
        "And I think, you know, one of the features of the modern working world is we work in large organizations.",
        "The majority of Americans work in organizations of over 100 people.",
        "As soon as an organization gets over a certain size, you get quite distanced from what you're actually doing to other people's lives, and that's what I was curious to look at.",
        "This incredible specialization of our lives, that we're not even baking cookies, we're in charge of the machine that applies the chocolate on top of the cookie.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, I was talking to some employees who do the insurance for the pallet, the sort of wooden crates on which the biscuits will go from one hub to another, and so they are so far - you know, I was thinking about, you know, how does work become meaningful?",
        "Work becomes meaningful when you feel you're making a difference, either because you're making somebody's life less painful or because you're in some ways producing pleasure for them.",
        "Now, baking - don't get me wrong - baking cookies is a pleasurable activity.",
        "I mean, anyone who is ever hungry in the middle of the morning goes for the cookie jar.",
        "Thank goodness these things exist.",
        "But the problem is if you're employee number 8,300 of a giant organization, you're very far from the source of the meaning sort of generating aspect of the cookie business.",
        "And that's why there were some people who just felt a feeling of drift, a kind of alienation, like what are we doing this for, that you would never have felt in a small business, which explains - you know, I talked to a lot of people about their fantasies, what is your fantasy of work?",
        "And people came again and again to the idea of the small enterprise, the small shop.",
        "You know, it's the small cookie baking shop or whatever it is.",
        "And it's quite clear why this happens.",
        "Because we want to see - we want a connection between what we are doing and the difference it's making to another person's life.",
        "So we don't all need to be president, but we need to feel nevertheless that we are having an impact, a positive impact of somebody's life."

        "I have a sort of vague understanding, and that's - you know, a feature of the modern world is we tend to not understand who people are until we've asked them what they do.",
        "You know, the classic opener with a stranger is, what do you do?",
        "And you know, 200 years ago, we didn't necessarily do that.",
        "We'd say, you know, who are your parents, or where do you come from?",
        "Now we say, what do you do?",
        "And it's a symptom of the modern economy that most of the time, we can't actually immediately grasp what people do because jobs are so specialized.",
        "And that's very good from an economic point of view.",
        "It keeps specializations, creates efficiency.",
