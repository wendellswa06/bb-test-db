        "You almost have to say, I don't exist until I'm doing that work again, which seems really painful and really horrible.",
        "And I think in the current economic climate, we have to leave some room in our imaginations for the fact that people are not just their jobs, that the job you do might be - you know, the really interesting question is not to ask somebody what job do you do but what job would you like to do?",
        "What is your dream?",

        "It was in the 18th century that economists and political theorists first became aware of the paradoxes and triumphs of commercial societies, which placed trade, luxury and private fortunes at their center while paying only lip service to the pursuit of higher goals.",
        "From the beginning, observers of these societies have been transfixed by two of their most prominent features: their wealth and their spiritual decadence.",
        "Venice, in her heyday, was one such society, Holland another, 18th-century Britain a third.",
        "Most of the world now follows their example."
