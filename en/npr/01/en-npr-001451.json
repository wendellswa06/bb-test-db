        "But it's not necessarily easy because you have to not only be able to negotiate traffic at the same rate of speed that everyone else does, but also be able to be safe and punctual and especially respectful to my individual clients.",
        "And anyone who works in the auto industry out there should know that sometimes it's a rough biz, you know, trying to make people happy, especially when it comes down to giving them parts that, necessarily speaking, most people would not, you know, think to - you know, I mean, find a value in.",
