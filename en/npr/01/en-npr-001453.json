        "I mean, is an oil shortage inevitable, no matter what?",
        "It's not inevitable, no. I mean, it's not.",
        "The bottom line is that we do have enough oil to make up for this loss of oil at Prudhoe Bay.",
        "And if you believe the Department of Energy, they estimate with all the outages that we have right now going around the globe - and that's Nigeria, which is, you know 2 million barrels a day, potentially, that could be out.",
        "They say that right now, the excess capacity in the world is about 1.5 million barrels, which is more than most experts think.",
        "So we do have a little bit of slack in the system.",
        "The problem is, is that we don't have any slack for any other outages.",
        "So if we do happen to get a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico where production is shut down, or if we do have a disruption in Nigeria, or in Venezuela or Iran, then we're basically going to have to rely on the world's strategic petroleum reserves and our already-high inventories, and if we get into that situation -and I think inventories could fall at the fastest rate we've ever seen them fall.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now Washington has announced that they will free up some of the reserves, if necessary, to compensate for the cut in oil supply.",
        "How would that help?",
        "Would that…",
        "It is going to help.",
        "It's definitely going to help.",
        "And I think that if refiners are short of oil, they're going to definitely take the U.S.",
        "up on that offer, and that consistently has been our buffer against these types of disruptions.",
        "I mean, years ago, when we had a lot of spare production capacity in the world - four or five, or six, or seven million barrels - these types of disruptions would hardly rattle the oil markets, because there was always another oil producer ready to, you know, increase production to pick up the slack.",
        "The stories in verismo operas, they're all about the raw emotions of the common people.",
        "I mean, we're talking, like, busted-up lovers, murder, betrayal, you know, the usual stuff.",
        "Owens-Shields points out the KKK is just next door, in neighboring San Gabriel Valley cities.",

        "They include things like electric guitars, drums, electronics in their music.",
