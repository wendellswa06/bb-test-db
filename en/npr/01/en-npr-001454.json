        "Just listen to the richness of Kaufman's voice.",
        "It's got all this power and kind of the darker, burnished colorings of a baritone.",

        "(Singing in foreign language).",
        "The new record that we're listening to is an all-Italian CD called \"\"Verismo Arias.",
        "What's verismo?",
        "It's kind of a musical movement that blossomed around the turn of the 20th century in Italy.",
        "And the music got bigger, it got bolder, it got more melodramatic.",
        "Nowadays, we don't have double features anymore, we don't have drive-ins anymore and the scene has changed.",
        "So, we don't have B movies in that technical sense but we still do have the littler movies, the movies that not so much is invested in - and crucially these lower budget movies without stars and so forth, that still get made all the time, are the movies that allow for more experimentation, more risk taking, more personal expression by directors and writers and all the creators in the industry precisely because there's no big investment riding on them - you can take a chance without worrying that, you know, you're going to be losing somebody's $80 million.",
        "And because of that, these are the vehicles that then - young directors, writers, actors - that propel them to start them.",
        "You think of \"\"The Duel\"\" for example that well you know, a young men went on to make a film about sharks.",

        "Yeah.",
        "No - exactly.",
        "And of course, that's a function that TV movies have served for a very long time.",
        "You mentioned Steven Spielberg - and \"\"Duel\"\" was a made for TV movie - and yeah, that helped to launch his career.",
        "And of course the great producer Roger Corman - and director - who is still around, launched any number of major careers.",
        "You write a great essay about the career starting film for Peter Bogdanovich.",
        "Well, exactly, \"\"Targets\"\" - which is I think a phenomenal movie and inexplicably all but forgotten movie.",
        "And you know, he's just one of many film makers.",
        "But Francis Ford Coppola got launched this way.",
        "Martin Scorsese got launched way down in the B movie world.",
        "So, you know, so many of these people started small and then worked their way up.",
        "And I suppose that somebody could sit down and write \"\"Sharks\"\" and so forth and show that people who are now making the - today's equivalents of B movies, let's say the straight to video quickie that never even gets into a movie theater - some of these people are now showing what they can do and eventually they'll be making real movies and maybe ultimately real A movies, which, by the way, doesn't necessarily mean better movies.",
        "Sometimes people make their little quickie for no money, just as a calling card because they want to go and make, you know, more Mummy remakes or something in Hollywood.",
        "But the directors who really do have something in their soul that they want to express, can very often do that best in a B movie and then maybe they get bigger budgets, but they keep the same passion.",
        "Let's see if we get some callers in on this conversation.",

        "Would you agree with him Sterritt, \"\"Gun Crazy?",
        "Oh, I think Steven is right on the money with this, yeah.",
        "I mean, \"\"Gun Crazy\"\" is a really perfect example.",
        "It's a movie that's really well-known to film critics, you know, we all know it and love it and have seen it a million times.",
        "But it's really not that well-known by the general public.",
        "And it really deserves to be - it's an amazing movie with amazing performances, as Steven pointed out.",
        "I mean, John Dall who was, let's face it a terrible actor - even Hitchcock couldn't make him give a good performance in a rope - gives this out of the clear blue sky brilliant performance in \"\"Gun Crazy.",
        "And there is this bank robbery scene where the whole thing, the camera stays in the car while the bank robbery is happening indoors and it's just this long take that keeps going on and on and the suspense builds and builds - and part of the suspense is, well, the scene actually proceeds smoothly until the camera runs out of film or somebody's going to make a mistake and have to film the whole thing over again.",
        "Or could they really not afford to build another set to stage the bank robbery.",
        "Well, all these kinds of problems come up.",
        "Anyway - but that's exactly the kind of movie that we wanted to call attention to in the B List, yeah.",
        "Steven, we'll all go out and rent a copy.",
