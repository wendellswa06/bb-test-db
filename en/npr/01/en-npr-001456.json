        "These themes are expressed and explored so intelligently in these movies that it is really quite remarkable.",

        "Good question.",
        "Yeah, very good question.",
        "And that's one of the things where if there's no more B movies in the old sense of the low-budget quickie for the bottom half of the double bill, they're definitely are equivalents of the B movie nowadays.",
        "And a lot of the Indie movies, the independent movies, are just exactly that.",
        "And if you think about it, some of the people who still work in independent movies, that is creatively, they're not controlled by the Hollywood studios are really the equivalent of B filmmakers.",
        "Maybe the best example is Jim Jarmusch.",
        "And we have \"\"Stranger Than Paradise\"\" in the book.",
        "But if you look at even a recent movie by Jim like \"\"Broken Flowers,\"\" you'll see that he's got bigger names and he shoots in color but it's still the same sensibility at work.",
        "And even somebody like Woody Allen who gets all these huge stars to work with him all the time but they work for very little money and he makes the movies cheaply and quickly and we think of them as art films but in a way, they're the equivalent of the old B art films.",
        "Interestingly, you're talking about B movies as sort of a trick of mind, not necessarily a budget.",
        "For example, you site \"\"The Conversation\"\" is in this book and that's a film - and by the way Justin, thanks very much for the call - that's a film made by Coppola right after the \"\"Godfather,\"\" so he was a pretty hot property and it stars Gene Hackman right after \"\"The French Connection.\"\" So he was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood at that particular moment.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "In fact, we say in our introduction of the book that we took a big tent approach to the B movie.",
        "We didn't say we're not going to give you a definition of what the B movie is because any attempt to do that would just really be arbitrary.",
        "So what we said to the members of the National Society of Film Critics is that tell us what movies that you'd like to write about and if it doesn't automatically sound like a B movie, then you got to tell us why it is, you got to tell the reader why it is.",
        "And \"\"The Conversation\"\" is an example, written by - the essay written by Peter Kuo and as he points out, Coppola had just made the \"\"Godfather\"\" which was making gillions of dollars and of course, had enormously big stars and was a super major production from Paramount Pictures - and Coppola was pleased with it in a lot of ways but he hadn't enjoyed making it all that much and he had ultimately felt that he was basically just kind of making a motion picture version out of Mario Puzo's novel.",
        "He wanted to do something that really came out of his own heart and soul.",
        "And so he made \"\"The Conversation\"\" and yeah, you know, it had a healthy budget and it has Gene Hackman in it but doesn't have anything like the resources that the \"\"Godfather\"\" had in it.",
        "So by that standard, relatively speaking, it is kind of a B movie and it's spirit of kind of personal expression and not worrying much about the box office.",
        "It's very much a B movie made in between the two fabulously successful Godfather; pictures.",
        "We're talking with David Sterritt, the co-editor along with John Anderson of \"\"The B List: The National Society of Film Critics on the Low-Budget Beauties, Genre-Bending Mavericks, and Cult Classics We Love.\"\" And you're listening to Talk of the Nation, which is coming to you from NPR News.",
        "And of course, we can't skip another genre which contributed so much to the B movie and that is the Western.",
        "Here is Gary Cooper in \"\"Man of the West\"\" as well.",
        "What else, a former outlaw plagued by his past.",

        "As we speak, \"\"Appaloosa\"\" is playing and it's a wonderful movie with big stars and big production values and a lot of interesting things going for it.",
        "But back in the day, there were a lot of westerns that were made with very limited resources and westerns were so hugely popular that the idea was just to get a lot of that out there without always worrying about the details and what resulted from that was some really interesting and offbeat uses of the Western movie convention.",
        "And some pretty big actors like Gary Cooper, like James Cagney was in a couple of Westerns, you don't think of that and of course, Randolph Scott, Jimmy Stewart.",
        "I think Jimmy Stewart's classic roles are Westerns.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And again, Rodriguez has already come up in this conversation with regard to \"\"Grindhouse,\"\" which is in the book.",
        "And Rodriguez, my own personal view of his secret in his early career when he got launched was that he's just a brilliant film editor and he can take those little pieces of film and he can put them together into these really kinetic combinations that take something - a scene that maybe doesn't even have a whole lot going on for it - and turn it into something that's really exciting to watch.",
        "And again, it wasn't just a trick, it's something that he's been able to build on and have quite a major career making kind of mainstream movies as well as little more offbeat things.",
