        "Yeah.",
        "Arpaio just came tromping into this race as the huge elephant.",
        "And it changes everything.",
        "And still on the Republican side, Congresswoman Martha McSally is expected to enter the race tomorrow.",
        "She was the first American woman to fly in combat.",
        "Tell us about her.",
        "She's got a great story - first woman to fly in combat, was an Air Force colonel, has held her seat in Congress for two terms in a district that - it's Gabby Giffords' old seat.",
        "It's a swing district.",
        "For a Republican to hold that is a very, very difficult thing.",
        "She was not a big fan of Donald Trump, did not endorse him.",
        "She has been considered the mainstream Republican candidate, certainly the one that Mitch McConnell would like to see take over Jeff Flake's seat.",
        "Again, things changed totally this week when Joe Arpaio jumped into the race.",
        "It's been 30 years since Arizona sent a Democrat to the Senate.",
        "And on the Democratic side, it seems that the leading candidate is Kyrsten Sinema, who's currently in the House of Representatives.",
        "She has a really interesting background.",
        "Tell us about her.",
        "Well, she used to be - when she was in the state legislature, she was a screaming liberal, came to the conclusion that nothing was getting done and also to the conclusion probably that she was never going to be elected to anything on a statewide basis in the state of Arizona if she didn't moderate.",
        "But for whatever her reason was, she became a more moderate force.",
        "And again, she has been elected in one of our few swing congressional districts and managed to maintain that seat.",
        "We spoke with two former Enron workers today.",
        "Both have landed on their feet.",
        "They're running their own businesses and not spending a lot of time looking back.",
        "Evan Betzer worked in Enron's broadband division.",
        "He and another Enron colleague have now founded Stoneworth Financial, an investment banking firm that specializes in mergers and acquisitions.",
        "Betzer says he's not going to spend too much time keeping up on the Lay and Skilling trial.",
        "I feel like this type of news can really, for a former Enron person, you can get really wrapped up in it.",
        "I spent a lot of time in the early going days pouring over every bit of it in the paper, etc., but since then I think really have tried to not get too wrapped with it.",
        "I've read that a larger percentage than usual of former Enron employees have started businesses of their own.",
        "They decided to hang their own shingle rather than work for someone else.",
        "Do you think that might be a matter of trust there, that some of these employees were afraid to work for someone else and decided to set off on their own?",
        "I think actually it has to do with the type of person that Enron recruited.",
        "It attracted Type A personalities from other parts of the country to Houston.",
        "And in particular, Enron liked to look for entrepreneurial people, people with an entrepreneurial flair.",
        "So I think that might actually explain part of the reason why so many former Enron people have started businesses.",
        "And I think there's a second reason as well, which is that at the time when Enron went bankrupt, the opportunity cost of us starting our own business was very low.",
        "Which is to say, if we didn't start our own business, then we'd have to go out and get hired by somebody else.",
        "At the time with the dominoes falling in energy trading, etcetera, there were just, you know, more and more jobs being taken off the market on a monthly basis.",
        "So what'd you have to lose from starting your own thing?",
        "And Houston is a low cost of living place.",
        "So you can have a pretty low burn.",
        "You can go out there and start something new."

        "She hosts fantasy tea parties for young girls.",

        "And I have instant feedback in that you know right away that you're doing a good job because the kids are happy.",
        "So you might not have started this business, Tea Parties To Go, if not for the collapse of Enron?",
        "Well, I've always wanted to have a tea room but didn't want to really spend that much money for the build out and everything.",
        "So this is the next best thing, is to take the tea party to the children's home.",
        "And I was going to do it when I retired, but I kind of got early retirement, if you will.",

        "But I felt that everything will work out and I think they should have some kind of punishment.",
        "I don't know what it would be, but they should have prevented this from happening.",

        "Do we know?",
        "A number of economic factors in the last 20, 30 years have just shifted manufacturing to China.",

        "And it's just simply more cost-efficient to manufacture bicycles and bicycle components in China.",
        "So, as we said, tariffs went up to 25% from 10% this week.",

        "I'd like you to explain how this actually works from where you sit.",
        "I mean, who actually pays?",
        "The consumers.",
        "And considering the fact that the general tariff on a bicycle was 11% before this trade dispute started, now the tariff on bicycles is 36%.",
        "And that's really the tariff that they pay when the bike comes to port and comes into the U.S.",
        "And then there's always a markup on that once the bike reaches the floor of a bicycle shop or a mass market retailer.",
        "So the consumer will pay more than 36% on top of the existing true cost of manufacturing the bicycle.",
        "So, you know, about 6,500 small bicycle retailers exist in the U.S.",
        "And we can all imagine, you know, the bicycle shop on our - you know, downtown.",
        "And there are tens of thousands of mass market retailers where you buy different kinds of bicycles."
