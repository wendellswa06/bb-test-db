        "And I know a lot of other parents are considering using it, but basically my form asks if it would be okay if a parent begs out of a particular fundraiser by simply writing out a check in a way of a donation.",
        "And then that way, 100 percent of the funds go toward the cause, rather than the typical scenario where a fundraising company gets 50-80 percent of the funds, and the school gets, you know, 20-50 percent of the funds.",
        "Hmm.",

        "But if we find out that this Prudhoe Bay situation is going to go on for some period of time, I would expect that we could see another spike in gasoline prices.",
