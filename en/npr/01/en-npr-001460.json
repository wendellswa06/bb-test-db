        "But two days back in Washington was enough to remind everyone that governing's no cakewalk either.",
        "Many of the president's lines yesterday were lifted directly from his stump speech.",
        "We can't just cut our way to prosperity.",

        "There can be.",
        "And I think where we've seen this play out more than any other places in California and it sorts of has its roots with Proposition 13, which sort of really capped the ability of local school boards to raise local revenues.",
        "And you found parents stepping to the fore and saying, well, if we can't - if our school board can't do it, we will do it.",
        "And we're not talking here about, you know, wrapping paper sales.",
        "We're talking very large scales, sophisticated fundraising efforts that have happened in a lot of districts, much to the benefit of the schools.",
        "But it can raise the series equity questions by masking the inability of some schools in the community not to have that kind of success.",
        "There are also issues of - well, there seems to be a fundamental issue of what's the parents responsibility - we're talking about public schools here - and what's the responsibility of the government?",
        "The responsibility of the government at every level of government, we would say, of course, is fundamental here.",
        "There's nothing more crucial to the future of the country and the economy than a successful public school system.",
        "But you find, right now, that school boards increasingly in many states are being put in a roles of suppliants - where the discretion to raise money locally are being taken away - in part motivated by equity concerns.",
        "Because over-reliance on property taxes leads to inequities as well.",
        "But when all the decision-making is at the federal and the state level, you have lawmakers, whose focus isn't solely schools.",
        "And it's a competing priority with everything else, and this is played out in this local stretched budgets."
