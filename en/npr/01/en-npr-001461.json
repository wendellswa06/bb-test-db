        "There were enormous disparities in fundraising amongst various parts of the school community.",
        "On a per-pupil basis - again, the context was California, so fundraising played a major role in some of the very necessary things - so on a per-pupil basis you would have one school who would raise $32 over the course of the year in fundraising per pupil, and another school $1,003 per pupil.",
        "And when you add that up that's a fairly broad disparity.",
        "So how did you try to address it?",
        "We proposed a policy that was eventually adopted after a long series of public discussion - and good, but very difficult debate - that took a percentage of all fundraising at every single site, pulled it and redistributed based on a student weighted formula that took into account factors of impact, such as poverty and the like.",
        "And as I understand it, you mentioned difficult debate.",
        "There was a lot of controversy.",
        "There was.",
        "A lot of dealt with some of the comments that you were talking about in the previous section.",
        "The difference between fairness and equity, and the ability for one school to be focused just on one school - and the parents of that school versus an entire school system.",
        "And I'm sure you've heard this comment before: I want my money to go to the school my kid attends.",
        "As to those other schools, that's why I pay taxes.",
        "Correct.",
        "And we heard that a lot and had to talk that piece through.",
        "And we shaped the conversation around the issue of community.",
        "While there are many schools, it is one community.",
        "And all of our youth actually graduate from one community and participate in our democracy.",
        "And the fundamental notion is that every student gets, in my opinion, the right to the same quality of educational experience, no matter what their geography -especially when we're responsible for the totality of one school district.",
        "And how did you come up with that 15 percent formula?",
        "Well, that was the number that we proposed in an act, so that 15 percent of everything that was raised at a school site over the course of a year was then pooled and then redistributed on the formula based on impact."

        "And we looked over roughly the percentage of a total budget in a school that was supplemented by fundraising.",
        "Because in California - as was mentioned earlier - we have enormous impact on the ability to raise funds.",
        "So music, and library books, and furniture, and staff, and support staff, and the list goes on - are frequently supported by the incredible generosity of parents.",

        "We reduced the differential the first year after we proposed it by a fairly significant margin.",
        "But I think the more important piece of data was the real concern after we implemented it, that actually district-wide fundraising would decrease, when in fact it actually increased.",
        "I think the community had a difficult but a very good debate.",
        "Again, in the end, it was very much a conversation about community - one that I was quite proud of - albeit it was tough.",
        "Let's get some more listeners involved in the conversation.",
        "By the way, are you doing the same thing now in Prince George's County, Maryland?",

        "Even people that don't have children, no matter where their schools go.",
