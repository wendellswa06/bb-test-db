        "I think there's a lot of outside-the-box thinking on the part of schools and school boards and school communities.",
        "It's interesting, though.",

        "So we were talking about north of 10 percent in the annual operating budget of an individual school.",
        "In Maryland, it is considerably less, although the issue of a scale and economic impact is much larger in the community I have.",
        "Because of the nature of the community you're in?",

        "So I think the question becomes how do we resolve these issues in a way where you have the least amount of these types of impacts?",
        "And for me I think the issue is a foundation that supports the basic mission of the school, whose primary purpose is to do this fundraising.",
        "And then it's left for the school to deal with the issue of equitable distribution of those funds.",
        "And are there foundations in Prince George's County?",
