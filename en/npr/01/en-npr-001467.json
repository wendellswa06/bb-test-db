        "Kalnay thought, maybe there's a way to revive those atmospheric currents.",
        "It occurred to me that the same mechanism would go in the opposite way, so it will increase the precipitation and the vegetation - and then more precipitation.",
        "Since the problem was that light-colored dirt and sand reflecting the sun, she'd need something dark instead.",
        "But what dark thing would you want covering huge areas of the desert?",
        "Well, solar panels.",
        "Kalnay convinced one of her postdoc researchers to create a computer simulation of an otherworldly Sahara, where 20 percent of the land is covered with solar panels - also windmills.",
        "Kalnay thought they might also help the air currents.",
        "And the simulation turned out just the way she wanted.",

        "Just a couple of weeks ago the government did extend another $30 billion in aid to AIG and that deal is still being finalized, so there might be some leverage there.",
        "The White House spokesman even suggested, today, that the AIG employees should think long and hard about whether to take the bonuses, sort of trying to guilt them into turning money down.",

        "AIG as an insurance company, did it fall outside of that network of regulations that govern banks.",

        "Unlike a bank which has FDIC insured deposits, AIG was not subject to that sort of regulation, even though, as this episode has demonstrated, it's tentacles go just as deep into the financial system and it poses just as much risk to that system.",
        "So one of the principles that the president and law makers here are working on as they try to draft new regulations, is that any company with that sort of influence, that poses that sort of systemic risk, should be subject to more government oversight because the alternative is a very shaky financial system and that jeopardizes the credit that the economy, and now our economic recovery, depend on.",

        "He points out that small businesses have been a big job generator over the last decade -about seven out of ten jobs - and so, in essence it's important to help those businesses and also to show that the bank rescue efforts are not just about help the Wall Street.",
