        "Day Gardner, let me ask you as relates to that, you are pro-life.",
        "But are you concerned at all that we could, in fact, see the abolishment of abortion?",
        "Of course, that's what I hope for, and that's what I pray for.",
        "I think when it comes to Alito, nobody really knows exactly where he stands.",
        "And for that matter, all we can do is just wait and see.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Ms. Gardner, one of the questions in terms of the abolishment of abortion is that it would disproportionately affect women of color in terms of, we know historically that African Americans had higher rate of what was called back alley abortions.",
        "How do you reconcile that fact with the abolishment of abortion?",
        "Well, the risk of death from abortion was greatly reduced in the 1940s and '50s, before abortion was every legalized, by the development of antibiotics and modern surgical procedures.",
        "The thing is that since 1973, there have been more than 350 deaths due to abortion.",
        "And I honestly believe that if, and hopefully when, abortion is abolished, that will not increase the deaths of women, and it will definitely save millions of children.",
        "Ms.",
        "Martel Gaiter, what's your thought?",
        "First of all, at Planned Parenthood, 90 percent of our work is basic healthcare, where poor women, uninsured women, women of color would not have any other way to get a Pap smear, a breast exam, diabetes tested.",
        "I think that one of the reasons why there is abortion in the Black community is because so much education and prevention needs to be done.",
        "We start our programs at Planned Parenthood with abstinence.",
        "We do not believe that young teenagers should be having sex.",
        "However, we believe that without giving them good information about their own bodies and sexuality, that they will be ignorant, and ignorance kills.",
        "Let me follow up on that, if you will, and ask you this.",
        "In terms of abortion, to a great degree still, it is painted as an option for middle class White women.",
        "Are you concerned that Black women lose their voice in all of this?",
        "It is an issue for White middle class women who have traditionally been at the forefront of this, because there have been so other many issues in the Black community, such as education, economic justice, civil rights, equality, that African American women have pretty much seeded the leadership on this issue to White women.",
        "However, as the statistics show, it is important that African American women get involved in this because of the health disparities that need to be closed and the fact that we want our babies to come here healthy, so that young women that are pregnant can get tested early, and they can get prenatal care throughout their pregnancy if they choose to bring the pregnancy to term.",
        "However, if they choose not to, they know that they can have adoption, they can have a medical abortion, or they can have a surgical abortion.",
        "Our position is that the decision should be made between the woman and her God and her family.",
        "It is not the right of these 15-year old little boys to come out in front of our clinic to protest on Roe v.",
        "Wade weekend to make that decision.",
        "Mr.",
        "Chief - excuse me, Justice Scalia, I didn't mean to promote you quite so quickly."
