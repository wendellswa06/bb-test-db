        "They came from West Africa, which had been undergoing a very gradual process of Islamization since the 11th century.",
        "And where were those first mosques?",
        "So these would have been informal places.",

        "African-American slaves tended to practice West African traditional religions or Christianity in the 19th century.",
        "But as that population of Muslims was declining, the population of Muslims from the Middle East and Southeastern Europe was increasing.",
        "Immigrants came from Turkey, from Syria, and today the countries of Palestine, Jordon, Israel, seeking opportunity like the Southern Italians and the Greeks of the same era.",
        "And they were the ones who first began to pray together, probably as early as the 1880s or 1890s.",
        "But we just haven't found any archeological or documentary evidence that would establish for us that there was an actual gathering of prayer at some sort of mosque space.",
        "Now, today, I think most Americans would be surprised to learn something that you've written about - you write a lot about the myths of Islam in America that far and away, the single largest Muslim ethnic group in America are African-Americans, not Arab-Americans, not South Asians.",

        "Edward Curtis, based on your research, can you assess what the kind of the mainstream American perspective was on Muslims throughout most of American history?",
        "I mean, how did Americans see Muslims?",
        "Muslims have been important players in the American national consciousness since the days of the Puritan.",
        "Cotton Mather thought that Muslims were a sign of a Christian schism.",
        "That kind of misunderstanding or negative view of Islam has been with us always, and it's kind of come and gone in cycles.",
        "When did we first sort of start to see really pronounced anti-Muslim sentiment in America?",
        "I mean, is what we're seeing today pretty new?",
        "Well, it's really hard to compete with Cotton Mather and some of the Protestant evangelicals of the 1820s and '30s who go on and on about Muhammad and Muhammadans, or Muslims, being the antichrist."
