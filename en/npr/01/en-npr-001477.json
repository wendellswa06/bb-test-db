        "And now it's - you know, I think we all have a very different reaction.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, there was a time not long ago where those big hits were the highlight hits and really promoted the league.",
        "Now as more and more scientists come out about how - the damage it causes, it's not just the big hits.",
        "It's also just the actual sustained - they call them subconcussive hits.",
        "Yeah.",

        "You've got LeBron James, one of the best players of all time, who is not just, you know, a great player, but I think is one of the larger things that's really helped out the NBA.",
        "They, unlike the NFL, have very much encouraged their players to express their personalities and sometimes to express their political beliefs.",
        "I remember when LeBron James, after President Trump told - said that he was not going to invite Steph Curry and the Warriors to the White House, and LeBron James refuted that and actually called the president you bum, which is kind of a crazy thing to think of, an NBA player calling him you bum.",
        "But perhaps what's even crazier is it seemed to work to shut Trump up.",
        "He actually has not talked about the NBA since then.",
        "So I guess it requires someone at the level of LeBron James.",
        "But I do think that's the issue.",
