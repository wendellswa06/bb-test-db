        "So they patched it up.",
        "The tank was still dropping.",
        "Other burst pipes were draining it.",
        "And because the town was coming off 2018's record breaking hot and dry conditions, the mountain springs feeding the tank were running extremely low.",
        "And I said, OK, we're shutting off.",
        "That meant for more than a week, there was no running water at all for most of the town's 1,600 customers.",
