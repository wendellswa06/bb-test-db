        "Very well.",
        "What do you think of Senator Biden as Obama's choice for VP?",
        "You know, the only candidate who was going to really help him to fill in the blanks and the lack of support would have been Hillary Clinton, and obviously he made a choice not to do that.",
        "So I think Biden is as good a choice as anybody else.",
        "You know, the key rule here is you pick someone who doesn't hurt you and can help you a little, and certainly Biden helps a little bit, maybe a lot.",
        "He's got the foreign policy credential.",
        "You know, they both have very similar liberal voting records, and certainly the state that Senator Biden represents, Delaware, is pretty much a Democratic state these days anyway.",
        "So it's not - it's not like it helps there, but it does help on the substance side.",
        "Well, you talked about his strengths: the foreign policy background, the Washington experience.",
        "What do you consider to be his weaknesses?",

        "Well, I think to a certain extent Biden has had the reputation of some gaffes along the way.",
        "And unfortunately in a presidential campaign, gaffes get highlighted.",
        "You know, I think the biggest thing is just simply - you know, he's been a part of the process for a long time, and Obama had promised to be a candidate of change.",
        "And, you know, it's a little hard to attack the Washington system when you have one of the most senior members of the Senate who's been there as long as McCain, or longer than McCain.",
        "So it's not quite the contrast that you might have had with someone new or someone younger.",
        "What effect might this have on John McCain's choice for vice president?",
        "You know, my sense is he better have someone who's articulate.",

        "It was very interesting.",
        "There's this groping towards a more constructive agenda, a real alternative.",

        "And E.J., you get the last word on CPAC.",
        "I think part of the issue here is whether conservatives really care about new ideas, or are they infatuated with the idea of new ideas.",
        "I was struck when Paul Ryan said for the most part, these disagreements have not been over principles or policies, they've been over tactics.",
        "Well, if these are fights over tactics, they're not really fights over new ideas.",
