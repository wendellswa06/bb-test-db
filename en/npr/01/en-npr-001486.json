        "And on this record, Galliano plays with some string players.",

        "I don't think I've ever heard of someone who specializes in classical accordion, Tom.",
        "Well, he's actually experimented in many styles over the years.",
        "And Galliano, at age 4, followed his dad's footsteps and took up the accordion and largely made a career by playing with jazz greats.",
        "Does Galliano, would he offend Bach purists?",
        "I mean, will they hear this and say this is really cheesy?",
        "Well, this is not Bach on period instruments, let's say.",
        "Right.",
        "But, I think, Guy, he's not overstepping his bounds.",
        "I mean, if he where taking these heart wrenching arias and pieces from the St. Matthew Passion or Bach's cantatas and trying to rework that for an accordion, it might not sound so great.",
        "But most of the music on this CD is music that Bach himself probably played in coffeehouses.",
        "So, I mean, this is nice, light music.",
        "A good summer CD."

        "There are six small plastic parts lined up beside each other connected by these little half-moon shaped wires.",
        "There's a lithium battery about the size of a nickel, then there's the teeny chip that contains the symphony and then a port to plug in your headphones, because that's the only way that you can actually hear it, unless you have engineers, like we do here, that can take it and throw it into a computer."

        "It's tinny, yes.",
        "Too long, probably, yes.",
        "But there are really some interesting textures, some polyrhythms and some small musical ideas that Tristan Perich builds on, nicely, I think.",
