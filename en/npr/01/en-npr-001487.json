        "Wow.",
        "There are relatively few singers today that have what Brewer has, and that is the muscle, the buttery beauty in the voice and the intelligence with which she uses it.",
        "What's the piece we're hearing now?",
        "This is one of a number of scenes from operas by Richard Strauss that Brewer sings on this new disc.",
        "And that particular outburst is one of many found in the Strauss' operatic retelling of the story of Elektra.",
        "And this is the recognition scene, where, just in a moment, Elektra finally recognizes her brother, who has returned home to, among other things, take an ax to their mother, who had previously murdered her husband.",
        "Should we brace ourselves for more jet propulsion?",
        "Well, there is a lot more on the record, but no. Actually, I want to go to a passage here so you can hear that, although Brewer has this really huge voice, she can scale it down here with some gorgeous, terrifically supported soft singing.",
        "Now, here, she's just recognized this stranger in the house as her brother, and she's relieved, because she knows what's on his to-do list."

        "And Brewer's becoming more and more in demand in opera houses all over the place.",

        "They didn't know for certain whether there was going to be a strike, but they built up in anticipation.",
        "And I think that that's really what's causing some problems.",
        "Now two months into the strike, Merkle says GM still has about 50 percent more trucks and SUVs in inventory than it should have.",
        "And Merkle says the market is still heading in the wrong direction.",
        "That means GM could be making even further cuts in the years to come.",

        "You are besieged by people on both sides, coming in, trying to make arguments as to why various provisions are either subject to the Byrd rule or not subject to the Byrd rule.",
        "Reconciliation means the bill needs just 51 votes to pass in the Senate, not the usual 60, but these bills are also subject to the Byrd rule, and it means any provision within them has to be taken out if it doesn't lead to deficit reduction.",
        "And the people who do that weeding are Alan Frumin and his staff of nonpartisan experts.",
        "He'll deliver his verdict early in the week, but does the Senate have to listen to him?",
