        "I'm quite optimistic that there'll be a Miami Beach 50 years, 100 years from now, but we need to set aside sort of the political nonsense about the debate about whether climate change is happening and embrace our problem and start developing comprehensive strategies.",
        "At current rates of sea level rise, officials in Miami Beach believe the work underway now will buy the city at least 50 years.",

        "When people smoke pot, their desire for food goes up and what they eat just seems yummier.",
        "Researchers at the University of Chicago wondered if a lack of sleep might lead to overeating by affecting the brain in a similar way, so they designed an experiment at the University's sleep lab.",
        "Researcher Erin Hanlon says they began by recruiting 14 healthy young adults.",
        "These were all people that were, quote, unquote, \"\"normal sleepers,\"\" so all the people typically slept about eight hours a night.",
        "The study was divided into two parts.",
        "For one session, they were allowed to sleep normally.",
        "For the other, they agreed to a crazy schedule.",
        "They went to bed at 1 a.m. and were woken up at 5:30, so they got just four-and-a-half hours of sleep.",
        "In both sessions, they were offered buffet-style meals and plenty of snacks.",
        "They were given way more food than they could ever eat.",
        "And it turned out that when participants were sleep deprived, they ate.",
        "During the normal sleep condition, they ate about 600 calories of snacks.",
        "And in the sleep restriction condition, they ate almost a thousand calories and snacks."

        "Our bodies make endocannabinoids, and they act on the same brain receptors as marijuana.",
        "What Hanlon and her team discovered is that when people missed out on sleep, the endocannabinoid levels peaked higher.",
        "So when you see an increased peak in endocannabinoid levels, people are saying they feel hungrier or their desire to eat is stronger.",
