        "The religious conservatives that I speak with in South Carolina agree with me that if we have a central government or federal government or a president that can unilaterally close a mosque, they can also close a synagogue or a church, and that a government or leader who can keep out Muslims can unilaterally keep out Jews and Christians.",

        "Republican campaigners at the national level need to step up and be ready to propose serious, substantive, actual counterterrorism strategies rather than the sort of vague and, frankly, probably ineffective idea that Trump has thrown out there - in the usual sort of Trumpian fashion, which is a big explosion, a lot of smoke, a lot of fire, and then there's really nothing there that makes America safer.",
        "You're not necessarily going to win over a lot of the Trump supporters who aren't thinking much beyond the satisfaction of Donald Trump's latest rant, but you will be able to talk to folks who are part of that 75 percent of Republicans who haven't yet made up their mind on where they're going to land and who are looking for - legitimately looking for - real answers on our national security and real responses to Islamic terrorism.",

        "Are they not correct?",
        "I mean, when you look at the polling of the last couple of months, there hasn't seemed to be a benefit to the candidate who tries to speak directly to him, tries to counter him.",
        "Well, we're reaching a point now where there will be a serious Republican candidate who emerges from this field, and they will be a person who is called upon to essentially restore the limited government conservatism that supposedly informs the Republican Party and move it away from this sort of reality TV show that Donald Trump is engaged in."
