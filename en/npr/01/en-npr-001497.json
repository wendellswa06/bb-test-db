        "We wanted to make sure that there were better planning guidelines in the future for this type of intensive development.",
        "But when the new county plan was completed, it gave tentative approval not just to SummerCamp, but also to four additional St. Joe projects.",
        "That left Don Ashley and others in Franklin County feeling betrayed.",

        "And does having friends in high places, does that help make the conversation a little easier?",
        "Actually, I think it works the opposite way.",
