        "It wasn't a question of, oh, can you try to get in the black audience, but they actually provided us with tools and a budget and that is the substantial difference.",
        "So the first thing we did was we had a launch event at the Apollo Theater.",
        "They were already scheduled to do a presentation there and we used that opportunity to invite some of our cultural tastemakers and key group leaders who could begin creating the buzz.",
