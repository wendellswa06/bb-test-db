        "Gee, it's hard to pick one that stands above all.",
        "Our mission is to fight racial discrimination and sadly, that's still a pressing problem in the United States.",
        "So we'll be talking about the many different ways one can go about fighting this ancient problem.",
        "How did you feel personally when you heard the Supreme Court's desegregation ruling, which a lot of people are saying is rolling back the clock on issues that the NAACP and other organizations championed?",
        "Well, it's absolutely rolling back the clock.",
        "You know, they took the position that race can't be used under any circumstances in trying to eliminate racial discrimination.",
        "And, of course, you cannot eliminate racial discrimination without using race.",
        "So this was a severe setback.",
        "And one can only hope that school districts around the country will find way to try to fit the prescription laid out by Justice Kennedy who suggested that there were occasions when race could be used.",
        "Let me turn to black folks in the war.",
        "You have a situation where African-Americans have consistently been less pleased with the president's handling of the war, with the overall status of the war.",
        "And now you have a situation where the military is essentially hemorrhaging black military members.",
        "You have a 40 percent decline in the number of folks who were enrolled and enlisted in the military from the black community.",
        "What have you got on the agenda for the issues of Iraq and the military for your convention?",
        "Well, we're proud to say that we oppose the war before it started.",
        "We were on the right side of history from the very first.",
        "The news about the lessening numbers of blacks in the service, leaving a part the issue of the war, is bad news because the American military has generally been a place where upward mobility is offered to racial minorities.",
        "It is a relatively fair segment of our society.",
        "It's a place where people who aren't sure about what their role in life may be, find a place where they can exercise their talents.",
        "So it's bad news that the numbers are going down.",
        "But I guess it's a reflection of the great unpopularity of the war.",
        "So let's turn a little bit to the federal government.",
        "Last year, the president spoke at the convention, but it took five years to get him to play ball.",
        "Have you met with President Bush since?",
        "I've not personally met with him, but members of our organization have met with him.",
        "My vice-chair, Roslyn Brock, was in the White House about three or four weeks ago and had a quick conversation with the president.",
        "So relations are better than they used to be.",
        "The bad news is that we asked all of the presidential candidates to come to our convention, but only the Democrats have said yes.",
        "Do the Republicans then think that it's a lost cause because of the overwhelming numbers of support for the Democratic Party among black voters?",
        "Well, if they do, it goes against what they've been saying all along.",
        "They keep saying they want to reach out to racial minorities who haven't been friendly to the Republican Party.",
        "President Bush himself told us when he spoke to us that black Americans don't trust the Republican Party.",
        "Well, if that's true, one way to overcome that distrust is to come and appear to us - appeal to us.",
        "We'd like to hear what they have to say."

        "Why did you select Mr. Chertoff?",

        "We annually have a military dinner.",
        "Generally, we have a military figure speak to it.",
        "Now you can't say that Secretary Chertoff is a military person, but he heads a quasi-military agency, one that is supposed to be watching our security and making sure that what happened on 9/11 doesn't happen again.",

        "In fact, they're saying the opposite.",
        "They have opposed Trump on many of his policies.",

        "He is criticizing people for doings things that he himself has done.",
        "I mean, it feels important, Ayesha, to set all of this current controversy in a broader context, which is that Trump's language on race has been racist before.",
        "From the day he announced his campaign four years ago, there's a pattern.",
        "There's a throughline.",
        "It's a part of a long pattern.",
        "When he announced that he was running for president, he talked about some Mexicans, calling them rapists.",
        "He said, even before he became president, during the campaign, he talked about a Mexican judge and said he couldn't fairly decide his case.",
        "And, of course, he made a name for himself before he became president by questioning former President Obama whether he was born in the United States.",
        "And his language about black lawmakers and black public figures has also raised questions about the way that he's insulted them and their intelligence.",
        "So we heard from these four lawmakers earlier today.",

        "So Republicans were mostly quiet yesterday, but you do have a number of Republicans at this point speaking up.",

        "You knew Secretary Mattis, of course.",
        "What do you think went into his decision to leave now?",
        "Well, I think Secretary Mattis spoke very forcefully for himself that the president has a view of the world that is making America less safe and likely less prosperous by denigrating our friends and allies and encouraging challenges by our adversaries and rising powers.",
        "And I thought there were two really important points about the secretary's resignation letter - first, what a forceful case he made for what has governed - the ideology that has governed American foreign policy for the last 70 years since the end of World War II.",
        "And the second thing that I thought was really important was that - his acknowledgement that the elected president has a right to a Cabinet that reflects the president's views and works assiduously to carry out the president's policies."

        "(Laughter) That's an understatement, Scott.",
        "Yes, I do think the decisions the president's made in the last year, the personnel decisions in particular, have been determined to push away people who have views different than his own and to reinforce his own preferences.",
        "He's got a right to that.",
