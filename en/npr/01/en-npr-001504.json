        "Well, no, and in fact it's meant to go specifically to plants that will build cars that get 20 percent better gas mileage than they're currently required to.",
        "However, the Big Three, or the not so Big Three, as I prefer to call them these days, are looking to waive that requirement.",
        "So, at that point, it really is just a transfer payment from the taxpayers to the domestic automakers, and it's noteworthy in the case of Chrysler, which really, its entire future strategy is based on importing cars from China and having other people, such as Nissan, build their cars.",
        "They would be precluded from the money unless the laws are amended.",
        "But they're working hard on amending the law in Congress, and in fact, the $25 billion amount, while that's what was specified as the total amount of loan guarantees that the industry would get in the legislation, they're looking to increase that to $50 billion, at least, currently.",

        "You ought to go for more than that.",
        "Well, I think that that's probably part of the thinking, is that things could get worse, and that as their cash flow dries up, that they're going to need even more money.",
        "And there's no doubt that the industry, while they're committed to free marketeers, in their public pronouncements over the years have very little trouble accepting money from the government.",

        "In fact, you cannot lease a Chrysler today.",
        "All those things indicate a company in serious trouble, as does the fact that they've pretty much announced that they will outsource many of their future cars and essentially be, what is, I guess, what you'd call a marketing company.",

        "GM and Ford's prospects are a little better because they actually make cars overseas that are fuel efficient, that given enough time and money, they can build over here.",

        "General Motors is perhaps more problematic getting their stuff over here, and their cash burn is probably even more extreme.",
        "Both of them have the problem that they don't have very much left to sell.",
