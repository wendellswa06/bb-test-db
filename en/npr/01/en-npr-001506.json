        "I don't know if you're aware but at some college campuses where they've done surveys, there's about 16 to even as high as 20 percent of college students have used methylphenidate, Ritalin for studying purposes and to enhance cognition and to be able to cram for exams and so forth.",
        "So it's fairly widespread in the USA in college campuses.",
        "It does indicate that control must be part of this equation, Dr. Ludwig.",
        "Is there evidence about that; that if kids feel like they are in control of what they're eating that they make better choices?",
        "Well, the worst thing that a parent can do to a picky eater is force them to eat something because that pairs that particular taste with the stress response.",
        "The body begins to release stress hormones - like cortisol - when forced to do something that it doesn't want to do, at the moment.",

        "Instead, offer the food.",

        "They do take longer but at Chop Chop, we like to say, if you teach your kids to cook now, they'll be making you dinner later.",

        "So there's a bonus down the road.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You know, there's a natural developmental cycle here at work.",
        "Children are born with a fear of unfamiliar foods, which protects them from eating something toxic.",
        "But they're also programmed to develop an increasingly broad set of taste preferences.",
        "If not, children would die of starvation after weaning.",

        "Simply say, no junk food in the home."
