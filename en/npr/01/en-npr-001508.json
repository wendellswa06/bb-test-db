        "Linda, President Mubarak has taken the Palestinian position that any Israeli withdrawal should be negotiated with the Palestinians.",
        "Is that what he said today?",
        "Yes, he did say that today.",
        "He said he encouraged the Israeli prime minister to open negotiations with the Palestinians.",
        "He said Egypt would do whatever it could to help those negotiations.",
        "However, he hinted that Egypt would not oppose a unilateral withdrawal if Israel decides that that's what would happened when he said we want negotiations but if they don't work then, quote, \"\"We will have to find another way.",
        "And another Egyptian official said on background that Egypt will not oppose any withdrawal from occupied territory.",
        "So there seems to be a shift in the Egyptian position.",
        "They still prefer negotiations, but that they will not stop Israel and will not try to prevent a unilateral withdrawal if that's what Israel decides it's going to do.",
        "And what did the prime minister of Israel, Olmert, have to say about that?",
        "Well, interestingly, the Prime Minister seemed to really try to reassure his Egyptian host that Israel was serious about opening a dialogue with the Palestinian leadership.",
        "He said that Israel is committed to the U.S.",
        "backed roadmap to peace and to promoting negotiations with Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas.",
        "He said he was going to meet with Abbas.",
        "That's expected to happen sometime later this month.",
        "However, the Palestinian government is now headed by Hamas, and Hamas has refused to recognize Israel and to respect the former commitments that the Palestinian authority has signed.",
        "So most Israeli officials that I've spoken to say that Olmert is serious about opening a dialogue with Abbas, but without a change in the Hamas position those negotiations really aren't going to get anywhere.",
        "Well, do you think that Egypt is going to have much influence over the Palestinians and Hamas in particular, given that Hamas is this Islamist organization and Egypt barely tolerates it's own homegrown Islamist organization, the Moslem Brotherhood?",
        "Well, on one hand that true and there have been tensions between the Hamas government and Egypt because of Egypt's treatment of the Moslem Brotherhood there.",
        "At the same time, Egypt has tried to mediate between Fatah and Hamas, and the tensions between those two groups have spilled over to gun battles and Egypt has tried to mediate, and Egypt has also been providing quite a lot of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people.",
        "So there may be some room for Egypt to try to convince Hamas to change its position.",
        "At the same time Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said in the news conference that he has no intention of pressuring Hamas."

        "Now Linda I understand that this summit took place under a bit of a cloud.",
        "There was a shooting incident along the border on Friday.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "Well, the circumstances are not exactly clear.",
        "Apparently two Egyptian policemen crossed the border into Israel and at least according to the Israelis opened fire at Israeli soldiers.",
        "Israel fired back killing the two policemen.",
        "It's not clear if they thought the Israeli soldiers were smugglers or exactly what was going on.",
        "Prime Minister Olmert expressed his deep regret over the incident and said that they were going to form a joint commission to investigate it.",
        "At the same time I have to say that I was really struck by the obvious warmth between President Mubarak and Prime Minister Olmert.",
        "President Mubarak called Olmert a man of vision and integrity and Olmert departed from his prepared text and he very warmly called President Mubarak one of the most experienced and important politicians that he has ever had the opportunity to meet.",
        "And I actually had expected that there would be some tensions at this meeting, and in fact the atmosphere was really very warm and friendly.",
        "Later, the news business is in trouble but not for the reason you might think.",
        "But first, the debate over brain-enhancement drugs.",

        "It's very nice to be here.",
        "Now what drugs are we talking about?",
        "Let's define these drugs and tell me what they were originally used for or intended for - their original use.",
        "Yes.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, there's a range of cognitive-enhancing drugs and probably one of the most familiar ones is methylphenidate or Ritalin.",
        "And most people know methylphenidate or Ritalin because it's the most common treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD.",
        "And of course, this is an interesting disorder because it's a spectrum disorder and people with ADHD have problems of impulsivity, hyperactivity and inattention.",
        "And the drug works, you know, quite well to treat these - many people get benefit from it.",
        "So that's one drug and that drug actually works by increasing the chemicals dopamine and noradrenalin in the brain by blocking their reuptake.",
        "There's other drugs like atomoxatine which is another treatment for ADHD and that works relatively selectively to enhance noradrenalin in the brain.",
        "And so that's other one of these cognitive enhancers.",
        "And some people know the cholinesterase inhibitors that are used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",
        "So there's donepezil, Aricept, drugs such as that.",
        "And they affect the chemical, acetylcholine in the brain by enhancing that neurotransmitter or chemical in the brain."

        "What are the effects of these drugs on a…",
        "Well, we've done studies with methylphenidate, Ritalin and we've actually studied Cambridge undergraduates who are already functioning very well, as you can imagine.",
        "But even Cambridge undergraduates show improvements when they take methylphenidate, Ritalin on the different tests that we've used such as test of what we call working memory.",
        "That's a type of thing where you try to remember things for short periods of time because you need that information critically than and then later you've tossed it out.",
        "It's a sort of thing if you looked up a number in a phone book, you might swing the number around in your head while you remember it like 217899217899 and then when you finished dialing it, you chuck it out.",
        "And we showed very good enhancement with methylphenidate - using methylphenidate on these Cambridge undergraduates.",
        "Another drug we used was modafinil which is a new drug.",
        "It's also known as Provigil.",
        "And it was licensed in 1997 here for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness or narcolepsy.",
        "And narcolepsy is, you know, I always say, well, if I'm lecturing and you fall asleep, perhaps I haven't given a good lecture.",
        "But if I'm lecturing and I fall asleep, that is narcolepsy.",
        "Right.",
        "But now, people benefit from that and we've shown that normal, healthy volunteers who come in as subjects for our studies do very well on that and increased their - it improves their memory, their planning ability and so forth.",
        "So people now are using these drugs for what purpose?",
        "Give me an example of why somebody might take one of these drugs?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So we did a questionnaire to some colleagues who I knew were taking these drugs to ask them why they took them and one of - many of the colleagues say they take them for jetlag, to compensate for jetlags.",
        "If they have to give a big lecture and they feel that they've got jetlag, they take the drug.",
        "And they say it improves their ability to attend, it improves their working memory which we just talked about and it also improves word finding which you can imagine for a lecturer is very important.",
        "I have colleagues also in the U.K.",
        "and they say they took it because they want to just increase their mental energy and it improves their thinking when they're trying to have a particularly productive day, so other people are just taking it to improve their performance on that day.",
        "You know, I think when we talk about performance-enhancing drugs in sports or in physical activity we might say that it makes you stronger.",
