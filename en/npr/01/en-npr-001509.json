        "It's a pretty harsh thing if aren't prescribed it and you're not used to it, it can be pretty jarring.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, Murray, thank you so much for calling in.",
        "It's been interesting hearing from somebody who's actually used these kinds of drugs, and I really appreciate your calling in.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Barbara Sahakian, interesting hearing from Murray and what he had to say.",
        "And one thing I'm interested in that I wonder if you can explain - I don't - do they take these like just one at a time when they have a test or is this something that they've been start taking all the time.",
        "I'm not clear how they take them.",
        "And he was saying that it can make you jittery and things like that.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think it's different patterns for different people, obviously, but I think what he discussed is very typical, so it was very helpful that he was, you know, forthright about it because in this \"\"Professor's Little Helper\"\" commentary, we had some letters in response and one of them came from Nora Volkow who is head of the National Institute of Drug Abuse in America.",
        "And her point was that there is quite a large amount of these prescriptions that are being passed on or sold, and that's a concern, obviously, for NIDA.",
        "We have to take a break here and when we come back, we're going to continue with you, Barbara Sahakian, and Dr. Nora Volkow is going to join us in the studio as well as we continue this discussion about brain-enhancement drugs.",

        "Nowadays you might be more likely to pop an Adderall to boost your brain power.",
        "But is that ethical?",
        "We're talking about brain-enhancement with Barbara Sahakian, professor of clinical neuropsychology at Cambridge University.",
        "And we want to hear from you.",

        "And you're in a middle of a thought as we took that break.",
        "Yes, well, of course, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder for which of these - this Ritalin, this methylphenidate is prescribed is a spectrum disorder.",
        "So on the extreme means, people obviously have very severe symptoms but towards the middle, you know, it starts to blend with the normal population.",
        "So when do you decide that you are having problems focusing your attention and so forth?",
        "And so I think that some people will be taking these drugs as part of their normal medication but other people, as you know, as you just heard, are taking them to enhance themselves and then they'll be taking, you know, the odd pill here and there to cram for the exams and so forth, to focus when they really need to complete a piece of work in a short period of time, whereas other people may be taking them more regularly.",
        "Certainly with modafinil, we've found that some people are - people don't seem to take them every day for cognitive enhancement.",
        "They seem to either take them for a jetlag or they take them for particularly important intellectual challenge.",
        "But I have heard of people taking it just to stay up and enhance their attention and performance socially at parties in the evening.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Well, let me turn now to Dr. Nora Volkow.",
        "She is the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.",

        "And Dr. Volkow is with me in Studio 3A.",
        "It's so good to have you with us.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Dr. Volkow, can you tell us how addictive are these drugs?",
        "Are they addictive?",
        "Well, good afternoon.",
        "And stimulant medications are just like actually have an effect that is similar to that of drugs of abuse, which is, Barbara was commenting about it, it increases dopamine in the brain.",
        "And this is the mechanism that is believed to underline the rewarding effects of drugs of abuse that produces addiction.",
        "So yes, indeed, both amphetamine as well as methylphenidate have the potential for producing dependency and we know that in fact they are diverted and that there are people that become dependent to them.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We heard from a caller already who was describing the effect a little bit.",
        "He said, you know, sometimes you get jittery from these drugs.",
        "I wonder if you can expand on what he might have been trying to describe a little bit more."

        "Well, indeed, when you - the responses to stimulant medication varies enormously among people and also the effects of methylphenidate are somewhat different from those of amphetamine.",
        "Over all, amphetamine is a more potent stimulant and its effects are longer lasting.",
        "And because it's stimulating dopamine at much higher levels that your normal physiological responses, these can be perceive by individuals as making them restless and, or jittery, and these can be very, very uncomfortable.",
        "Also, he mentioned that he didn't necessarily like the fact of how he felt after the drug is over.",
        "And that indeed is described by some individuals as feeling like a crash.",
        "They fell with no energy and they cannot concentrate which is of course problematic particularly if you're starting to feel like that just before you're going to go into an exam.",
        "So what we need to understand when you're using these medications is that when you use them outside the prescribed purposes, you are going to be producing adaptation changes in your brain that can be deleterious to performance.",
        "And the other thing that is important for people to know is that not everybody improves when they take a stimulant medication.",
        "There's numerous stories that have actually shown that in some individuals and for certain tasks, the performance can actually deteriorate when they take stimulant medication.",
        "How would they deteriorate - what do you mean, they deteriorate?",
        "For example, one of the things that happens when an individual is taking a stimulant, and was reported by the caller, is you can concentrate much better but that concentration can go to the extreme, to make you actually perseverate on that particular task and being enabled to shift from that task to another one that made your (unintelligible)…",
        "Oh, I see, so you're focusing so intensely on one thing that you're not able to go back and forth and…",
        "Exactly.",

        "Thank you for letting me participate.",
        "I'm a physician and I've prescribed both stimulants as well as modafinil.",
        "And I was with a group of other physicians discussing the ethical aspects of it, and two things came to us in the conclusion.",
        "One was whether or not the drug was addictive which for some of the - it's from the studies from modafinil's not - it doesn't have the same potential as a stimulant; but the other was whether or not there was some direct competition, and in the same way sports players take steroids to enhancing and improve their team's performance.",
        "We thought it was ethically dubious for a student who otherwise doesn't have a diagnosis to be taking a stimulant to improve their test scores.",
        "It made it unfair for them to be in the same arena as students who otherwise aren't taking stimulants.",
        "However, we thought it may not be as ethically dubious for individuals who they're not directly competing such as, say, the physician who has been a resident, who has been on call late nights and he takes modafinil to be more alert the next day.",
        "We have some improvements in working hours but their alert - improved alertness improves patient care or the long-haul truck driver who may be taking it to be more alert will…",
        "But and I ask you a question, Joe, so I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying.",
        "So you're saying, that as a doctor, you're trying to differentiate which case might be one where you would in fact prescribe this drug who someone who doesn't have any kind of condition necessarily physical or mental condition where they need it but that their job might require it, is that what you're saying?",
        "Yes - well, yes and no. Modafinil is indicated for shift workers, and so to me, residents and truck drivers have a kind of shift work.",
        "I wouldn't necessarily prescribe it to someone who, you know, their livelihood or their safety isn't depending on it but - and I actually haven't had - nobody has asked me to prescribe it to them…",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "Okay.",
        "If we look ahead and if it's possible that the unity government won't survive, if it does fall apart, what happens then?",
        "Publishers have a problem when it comes to discussing Amazon.",
        "They may fear its power, but they're also dependent on it, because like it or not, Amazon sells a lot of books.",
        "But lately, the grumbling about Amazon has been growing louder, with some in the book industry openly describing Amazon's tactics as predatory.",
        "Since that we had due to the examples that proponents of using these medications always say, well, about the student with a deficit.",
        "And it's never - I've never argued against using it for someone with a diagnosis of ADHD because that's indication but the students who take it so that they can do better on the SAT, we thought it was unethical and unfair.",
        "But the physician who takes it so they're more alert because they have to be and they can't choose to not work the next day or the long-haul truck driver, assuming they're not using it to go longer than the prescribed or regulated time that that was a reasonable use for the drug."

        "How about toast with jelly that has sugar, a stimulant drug.",
        "The main issue should be whether the substance is safe.",
        "If people can do a better job by eating a good breakfast or taking a drug, who should complain?",
        "Barbara Sahakian, let me ask you to reply - to respond to that first.",
        "Well, of course, as Nora would say to these are much potent than just your cup of coffee and so forth, but I thought Joe's point was very interesting that he raised because it has been suggested that there may be conditions in which we want to encourage people to take cognitive-enhancing drugs, for instance, air-traffic controllers if they're on duty.",
        "We may want them to be alert.",
        "And he also pointed out that thus far anyway, modafinil, because it doesn't act as a classic, stimulant and doesn't have these same effects on dopamine that amphetamine and methylphenidate do, it doesn't seem to have the same abuse potential and this is also true of other drugs such as atomoxatine.",
        "So it is - these things are very interesting.",
        "It maybe that, you know, society would like certain people to take cognitive-enhancing drugs.",
        "I mean, I sometimes joke when I'm giving a public lecture, would we want a president or a prime minister to be on them, would that make a better world for us?",

        "Yeah, and I was smiling about to two things also.",
        "I think that the recognition that giving medications, stimulant medication for people that are on night shift is actually is practiced, is accepted as a medical practice.",
        "At the same time, there has been concern that some of the judgments that have been inadequate when people have been sleep deprived under the effects of amphetamine, many misjudgments have been directly linked with the effects of amphetamine.",
        "So the understanding that amphetamine can increase paranoid thinking coupled with the fact of the actions of sleep deprivation is also detrimental.",
        "So not again, not everybody responds positively to the effects of stimulant medications.",
        "I was smiling at modafinil because indeed, it is a new medication.",
        "It seems to have different effects of stimulant except now the new findings, the new studies done in humans are showing that just like stimulants, it increases dopamine in the human brain.",
        "At the same time, we're recognizing based on the epidemiological data that the rate of abuse of modafinil is significantly lower than that of the classical stimulants that's why I was smiling."
