        "I was going to ask you, what's the difference between this and, say, Dexedrine or what it used to be called, speed, which I think kids used to use before they were studying for exams.",
        "What's the difference between the kinds of drugs we're talking about and those kinds of drugs?",
        "Well, Dexedrine is an amphetamine-like compound and there are two isomers of them, and when you have Adderall, you have the Dexedrine plus the amphetamine, so the most commonly utilized medication right now abused on colleges based on the recent surveys is this combination of the Dexedrine with the amphetamine.",
        "And that's also a very effective medication for attention deficit disorder.",
        "All of these medications are stimulants, strong stimulant medications that will enhance alertness and will improve concentration.",
        "All right.",
        "We're going to take a call now.",
        "We're going to go to Carolyn(ph).",
        "She's calling from San Jose, California.",
        "Carolyn, go ahead.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "Good program.",
        "I just am so concerned at the widespread use of drugs for everything and nothing in our culture.",
        "And you know, Dr. Joe a little while ago was talking about prescribing these drugs for people, the resident who didn't get a goodnight's sleep, frankly, I'd rather be treated by a resident who did have a goodnight's sleep and not by one who's on drugs.",
        "And so my question is, what's next?",
        "Are we going to be drug testing students on the way in to exams?",
        "And I can take my answer off the air.",
        "All right, thanks so much for calling, Carolyn.",
        "Barbara Sahakian or Dr. Volkow, I was wondering that myself.",
        "I mean, are we going to be doing drug testing of students?",
        "Well, I'd like to respond.",
        "First, to the very important point that was made that, you know, ultimately, our drug use is a reflection of our society and we should really be looking at the broader context of why healthy people would choose to use a drug in the first place.",
        "I mean, there are other options for coping with everyday stresses.",
        "We could improve the work life balance or learn relaxation techniques.",
        "And if we have sleep or psychological and behavioral problems, we can address these to other methods including psychological treatments.",
        "And the best way to enhance cognition is through education and other means.",
        "So we have other ways of tackling these problems, so I completely agree with that, Carolyn who called in, I think that's an excellent point that she made.",
        "But yes, we may have to drug-test, I suppose, if people are against competitive - people using it in competitive situations, it may be one of the few ways that we'll be able to tell whether people are on and off drugs.",
        "Dr. Volkow.",
        "Publishers and booksellers are worried that Amazon is going to devour their industry.",
        "The online retailer seems to have its hands in all aspects of the business now, from selling books to publishing them, and that has people wondering if there is any end to Amazon's influence, as NPR's Lynn Neary reports."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there's another aspect that is important to consider which we haven't discussed which is in stories in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it has been shown that kids when placed on stimulant medications they perform better but when they are tested after they are off the stimulant, they actually perform worse than they did before initiation of the stimulant.",
        "This, of course, recovers but there's a period where the performance is actually worse than it was before.",
        "And this is likely to also be happening when people are taking stimulants outside the context of ADHD.",
        "And there's another aspect to that has been discussed extensively with ADHD and which is if it improves your performance in, actually, for example, enabling you to learn over a night of sleep deprivation, to study and pass the exam, what will it be in terms of the outcome two or three months later?",
        "Will you be able to remember as well that information as if you had done it with proper sleep and putting the hours that it takes to learn it without sleep deprivation?",
        "And as of now, I am not familiar of any single one story that has shown a benefit in the long-term effects of that material that is learned, which is the other issue.",
        "You're doing it just to pass the exam, well, that's one issue but if you're doing it to really try to build up the knowledgebase that will allow you to succeed, there, we do not have any information vis-a-vis the effectiveness of these medications.",
        "Okay.",
        "One last call; we just have a couple of minutes.",
        "Andrew(ph) in Nashville, Tennessee.",
        "Go ahead, Andrew.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Hi there.",
        "I was calling just because I had an experience using Adderall in college; and something that I thought just deserved to be addressed on air was that, you know, even if your intention as a student are to use this to benefit you personally with your studying, the potential to then end up using it recreationally, I think, is pretty high.",
        "And I don't imagine my friends and I were the only ones who've had this happen.",
        "And, you know, for anybody who's taken a stimulant to help their brain work better, I think, knows how bad it feels to come off of it and that for us led to recreational Vicodin use which then went to heavier opiates because the comedown from even these, you know, prescribed drugs can be so strong that I think things can kind of spin out of control quickly.",
        "So beyond being an ethical issue, I think, it needs to be, you know, a psychological issue about the health of our students emotionally and why they're using these drugs as if - is their studying an excuse to use drugs, you know?",
        "And I just hope you guys could talk about that on the air for a little bit.",
        "All right, Andrew.",
        "We don't have much time left time.",
        "I'm glad you raised it, I think you raised some things that we've been also been talking about.",
        "And I just want to read one, quickly, from one e-mail."

        "I've been surrounded by overachieving students who use Adderall and other performance-enhancing drugs, it makes it difficult for me to compete.",

        "SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "Scientists say the world's climate is rapidly changing, and we are only beginning to see the effects: an earlier spring in many places, the thawing of permafrost in the Artic, shifts in the ranges of some animals.",
        "Warmer temperatures have even changed the range and migration of fish and affected other organisms that live in the oceans.",
        "But animals aren't the only living things responding to changing temperatures.",
        "The ranges of some plants and trees, these ranges are shifting, too.",
        "And with earlier spring in some places, the delicate balance between pollinators and the plants they pollinate has been disrupted.",
        "So climate change is here now.",
        "What can we do to minimize its effect on plants and animals?",
        "Should we do anything?",
        "For many years we've been setting aside parks and protected areas to preserve habitat and protect endangered species.",
        "Will those areas need to be rethought or managed in a different way during global warming?",
        "Joining me now to talk more about it is Lee Hannah.",

        "He joins us from Santa Barbara, California.",

        "Absolutely, the West has turned out to be second only to the Artic in terms of registering changes here in the United States.",
        "As you mentioned, we're seeing great snow pack declines.",
        "We've got snow packs in the Northwestern part that's about - of the United States - that's about 40 percent of what we had experienced in the middle part of the 20th century.",
        "As that snow pack declines, we're seeing much more larger and more extensive and more frequent wildfires.",
        "We figure there's about a six-fold increase in the area burned in the West since 1986.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "For us in Arizona it means in the last five years about 20 percent of our forested lands here have been affected by fire.",
        "That's big in a place like Arizona.",
        "Mm-hmm, so you're also dry enough to be waiting for more fires to happen.",
        "Absolutely, and, you know, it's not just fires.",
        "We're also seeing things like massive mortality of existing forest stands.",
        "The pinion pine is the first tree that you see as you start to go up in elevations from the desert scrub here, and we've had the drought that many people are aware of, the one that has drawn down lake levels and Lake Powell, et cetera.",
        "I don't think it will fall apart that easily.",
        "I think there are many reasons and many countries and many powers that want it to be.",
        "But if it does fail, we will have what we had for the last 13 or 14 months.",
        "And what we're still having which is a government that has not been able to break the international boycott.",
        "So it doesn't really matter now because the international community still has not understood that they need to, kind of, cooperate or, at least, allow Palestinians and Arabs and other countries to support the Palestinian economy or to force Israel to give up the hundreds of millions of dollars they've collected on our behalf for taxes.",
        "If these clashes continue, what might it mean for the Palestinian authority?",
        "So, it's not just the authority that will be hurt, but the whole Palestinian cause.",
        "Why would people want to support an end to the occupation when Palestinians in the tiny part of Gaza have not been able to rule themselves.",
        "And both Fatah and Hamas and the other groups who are armed now and who are unable to control and rule on Gaza, they have to really answer to the Palestinian public and to the world - why can't they find other ways to share power and to rule.",
        "One thing that's curious is that Gaza slurred up when the West Bank, at least for now, appears to be quiet.",

        "People in Gaza used to travel across the borders to Egypt.",
        "Now, that border is closed and the Israeli border is closed.",
        "So they really cooped up, you know, a pressure cooker - the environment is ripe for tribal fights, personal fights, personal vendettas.",
        "And with people not having enough money but having lots of weapons, that's basically a formula for disaster for all kinds of internal problems.",
