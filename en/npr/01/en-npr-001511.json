        "Thank you very much.",
        "...Professor Reuter.",
        "And, first, on the question of methamphetamine abuse, there is some dispute on the op-ed pages as to what degree there is a methamphetamine epidemic in the United States and to what extent there's an overstated panic.",
        "How do you describe the methamphetamine problem today in the US?",
        "There are some parts of the country in which methamphetamine is clearly the most dangerous drug sort of widely used.",
        "If you go to Los Angeles, it's methamphetamine that is showing up amongst people that are sort of just arrested on the street, much less cocaine and so on.",
        "There are other parts of the country in which it's almost unknown.",
        "And the question sort of is: Will the map fill in, so to speak?",
        "It is a seriously dangerous drug.",
        "It really has very adverse effects, both acute effects and long-term effects.",
        "This is not marijuana.",
        "This is cocaine, maybe cocaine-plus--in fact, almost certainly cocaine-plus.",
        "Unlike cocaine, though, a methamphetamine user can cook it up, can make it at home.",
        "Well, it's made by lots of people who are more like retailers.",
        "I mean, a user could produce it at home, but typically it's made by lots of, you know, small producers using chemicals that they can find easily and cough medicines that they get at the pharmacy.",
        "Which brings us to a key point in the federal government's new initiative and that is stricter limits on cold medications that contain pseudoephedrine.",
        "Right.",
        "Can this work?",
        "Could it work more effectively?",
        "There certainly are things that the federal government could do that seem more important than just sort of ratcheting up the existing regulations a bit.",
        "There are really two things.",
        "One is that pseudoephedrine is used from the manufacture of cold medicines.",
        "Well, you could use a very similar chemical that would not permit the manufacture of methamphetamine.",
        "And that's been around for some years.",
        "There's not been pressure on the chemical companies to move to this.",
        "And one issue is why the federal government doesn't push them further to make this available and basically move pseudoephedrine, the basic chemical for methamphetamine, out of the pharmacies.",
        "The second point is that Mexico is importing huge quantities of pseudoephedrine, which is obviously coming across the border here.",
        "So in some ways we're focusing...",
        "You're saying in excess of what the common cold would require in Mexico."

        "Right.",
        "One estimate is that the Mexicans import about 200 tons of pseudoephedrine, and they only need about 100 tons.",
        "And the system that they have in place, while it looks like serious regulation, it's very leaky regulation.",
        "I'm just expecting that justice will prevail.",
        "Well, certainly the word predator is pretty strong, and I don't use it loosely, but I should also mention that up until probably a few months ago, I've been one of Amazon's biggest fanatics.",
        "Joe Wikert is general manager and publisher at O'Reilly Media.",
        "For a long time, publishers have been complaining about Amazon's pricing policies; they sold e-books at cut rate prices in order to win customers for the Kindle.",
        "And now, says Wikert, they're undercutting their competitors by selling e-readers, like the new Kindle Fire, at a loss.",
        "And I could have sworn at one point we had laws against predatory pricing.",
        "And I just don't understand why that's not an issue because that's got to be hurting other device makers out there in trying to capture part of this market.",
        "But Wikert's also well aware that Amazon has made life very convenient for consumers.",
        "Amazon has built a one-click model - and I do it all the time - where it's so simple and easy for me to get a sample or just to buy the book outright.",
        "I know that there are other options out there, but it requires several extra steps that you have to go through, and that's what's really kind of challenging.",
        "Just before Christmas, Amazon infuriated booksellers with its price check app, which allowed customers to check out prices in brick and mortar stores, then get a discount if they bought from Amazon.",
        "Dennis Johnson of Melville House Publishing has long been a vocal critic of Amazon.",
        "I feel that in the book industry, which is a very timid industry, that was the thing that really got people saying, you know, it's time for us to stand up to this and try to do something.",
        "Melville House Publishing is trying to develop a number of things to help booksellers.",
        "One of them is the shelf talker, a digital display which helps customers browse through print books in a brick and mortar store but buy e-books from that store's website instead of from Amazon."

        "They're magically, immediately at the store's website and they can buy the book within moments.",
        "But such devices bear no small resemblance to the slingshot David used against Goliath.",
        "Johnson would prefer to see Amazon investigated for antitrust violations, but he's not expecting that will happen anytime soon.",
        "And recently he got more evidence of just how many tentacles Amazon has in the book world when none other than beloved librarian Nancy Pearl, MORNING EDITION commentator and darling of independent bookstores, struck a deal with Amazon.",
        "You know, I work in an open office and one of my staffers saw that online and I heard him say, wow, and then he read it out to us in the office.",
        "And we all just kind of sat there quietly trying to take it in, because it was such a surprise.",
        "Amazon has agreed to publish at least a dozen of Nancy Pearl's favorite novels, which had been out of print.",
        "Pearl will provide an introduction, book discussion questions, and suggestions for further reading.",
        "Pearl says much of the reaction to the news has been positive, but not all of it.",
        "There's been pushback that I've gone over to the dark side and allied myself with these people who are destroying the book business as we know it.",
        "The venture, called Book Lust Rediscoveries, is something Pearl has wanted to do for years.",
        "She had reservations about going with Amazon, but says she shopped it to other publishers who didn't pick it up.",
        "Amazon just blew me, my agent - both of us - away with their enthusiasm for doing something so wonderful as resurrecting books that never should have gone out of print in the first place.",
        "So add a curatorial role to Amazon's hydra-like book business.",
        "It makes it just that much harder, says Dennis Johnson, to cut the behemoth down to size.",
