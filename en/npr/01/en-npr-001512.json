        "Like you're still alive, right?",
        "And those of us here at the U of A that have been studying it, folks like Dave Breashears and - at U of A - have shown that we've got anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of the pinion pines dying, not just here and there, but over about a 2.5 million area here in Arizona and New Mexico.",
        "So we're starting to see waves of forest mortality that is - appears to be this double whammy of a drought.",
        "And the drought's, frankly, not unlike things we had in the dustbowl or the 1950s, but it's a hot drought.",
        "We haven't had a global change-type drought before in the 20th century, and it has markedly much more extensive effects than anything we've seen in the 20th century.",

        "Give us an idea of what you can see.",
        "Well, we've looked at the ranges of species in South Africa.",
        "One is Aloe dichotoma, which is a tree aloe, and we found that its range is shifting pole-ward in the south, because it's in the southern hemisphere, and up-slope, and that's one of the first times the whole range shift has been demonstrated in a plant.",
        "And it tells us that plants, just as when we plant our gardens we look at the growing regions in the back of the catalogue to figure what'll grow, well, plants in the wild have climatic conditions they prefer as well, and they'll follow those climatic conditions as the planet's climate changes.",
        "Mm-hmm, let me ask both of you, but let me begin with Lisa, let's talk about the parks.",
        "We're focusing on parks around the world, around the country.",
        "What happens to the flora and fauna in these parks?",
        "Can they move?",
        "Do they shift?",
        "Are they trapped?",
        "What can we expect to see happen?",
        "Well, it's interesting to think about parks, because they were created to essentially sort of draw a line in the sand and say humans aren't going to affect these lands, we're just going to kind of lock them up, and they'll preserve nature for - I believe it's, you know, referred to as the leave it unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Parks are now confronted with the question that they actually need to actively manage these landscapes and the landscapes, more importantly, surrounding the parks in an era of climate change.",
        "So all of a sudden you've got a real sea change among the leadership in the U.S.",
        "National Park Service, where they're looking seriously at how they're going to create migration corridors and ways in which species, you know, refugee species from one park really need to become established in another park.",
        "And that migration might be able to go forth in a somewhat natural way.",
        "It may even need to have assistance for certain kinds of species that have, either because of the way, you know, regeneration occurs or dispersal occurs, they may need help.",
        "Mm-hmm, you're talking...",
        "I just recent...",
        "Yeah, I'm sorry.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "It was interesting, because earlier in the week I was with about 800 National Park Service people at a meeting in Minneapolis, and the - they're seriously rethinking how they're managing parks in the face of climate change, and there's some new thinking, some fresh thinking, and certainly a lot of motivation to take this seriously.",
        "Give me an idea of what they're thinking about.",
        "Well, for instance, they're doing a lot more discussion of how public/private partnerships need to be instituted.",
        "There was a lot of talk about the way in which the Yellowstone To Yukon Initiative, and worked on by our Canadian colleagues, has insured that migration pathways can go unimpeded from Yellowstone up in to the Yukon.",
        "Well, how do we use that as a model for how we might manage parks throughout the West?",
        "Mm-hmm, those would be animals that would be migrating.",
        "What about the plants?",
        "You mentioned the pinion pine disappearing.",
        "There's nothing you could do to stop trees, for example, or plants from moving out of the park or dying off there.",
        "Absolutely, there's very little one can do, and I think there's a real sort of ethical question about how much one should do.",
        "And it's not clear, you know, because, one, you know, mortality is a, quote, unquote, natural process.",
        "I think in the end the bottom-line is great concern about the kind of projections that have come out of the inner governmental panel on climate change, just in the last month, that look at potential for 20 to 30 percent of plant and animal species likely to be at a risk of extinction in the next 50 to 100 years and what does this mean about how you, actually, potentially, even think about a triage scenario."

        "Mm-hmm, Lee Hannah, what are they thinking about in the parks in other parts of the world?",
        "Well, we recently worked with researchers in three parts of the world to look at what climate change means for parks, and our concern was just those that's Lisa's been underlining, which is species' ranges will shift.",
        "We know that's what's happened in the past, and since our protected areas are fixed in place, one of the questions we wanted to answer is, well, are parks even really a relevant conservation response in an era of rapid climate change (unintelligible) human fossil fuel emissions?",
        "And we studied three different areas where large numbers of species had computer models projecting their future distributions and asked whether protected areas could improve the conservation of their future ranges as they shift across these landscapes.",
        "And somewhat to our surprise, I think, we found that protected areas could do a very good job of improving the conservation of these species in their future ranges.",
        "Now this is in the early stages of climate change, up to about 2050.",
        "But at least in that time frame we were finding that additional protected areas would serve very well to capture some of the range that has been lost as species move out of existing protected areas.",
        "Oh, that's wonderful, because that's exactly what - I've been going, whoa, there's not a bee in my garden this spring, so...",
        "So there were two important lessons of that work, I think, one of which is the protected areas, new protected areas, are going to be required because of climate change.",
        "And secondly, at least in the early stages of climate change, even fixed protected areas have enough area and enough scope for capturing the dynamics of species movements that they really can be a relevant conservation response.",
        "I think in the long-term we wind up with such large changes in species ranges that protected areas become less relevant.",
        "Corridors and long distance connections are helpful but maybe difficult and expensive to establish.",
        "So we clearly need to get climate change stopped as soon as possible as well.",
        "Yeah, because you may not be able to expand the range into the places -let's say if things are warming up and you're moving north, there may not be any room there.",
        "Exactly, so there are certainly situations where species are at the tops of the mountaintops.",
        "We're already seeing severe impacts on polar species.",
        "So there are clear limits to what protected areas can do, but it's also clear that climate change is going to increase the need for protected areas in the decades to come.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Lisa, let's talk about - I know you were a Montana resident before moving to Tucson with the park Glacier National Park there.",
        "Really, there's no way to protect a melting glacier, is there?",
        "No, there really isn't beyond just, you know, as Lee mentioned, doing everything that we can to slow down the rate at which we're emitting carbon dioxide and slow down these processes.",
        "We're looking at a pretty sober scenario for Glacier National Park.",
        "Glaciers are retreating.",
        "We've been watching that during the entire 20th century.",
        "And the problem with the glaciers, particularly as it starts to shrink, there's any number of factors that means the melting or wastage of that glacier starts to accelerate.",
        "And under various, very credible scenarios, we're thinking about a park that will be largely glacier-free by 2020 or 2030.",
        "You know, it becomes this irony of the park, you know, sort of formerly known as Glacier National Park.",
        "It's - it really changes a lot of how we think about these areas.",
        "This has a lot of cascading impacts.",
        "The glacier - the streams coming from the glaciers not only, you know, are sort of rich with water, but it's a cool kind of water.",
        "So we're going to see warmer water in the streams in Glacier National Park.",
        "That changes the flora and fauna, particularly the invertebrates that are - that fish species are dependent upon, and we're likely to see a real change in all sorts of species components of Glacier National Park, not just the loss of the glaciers themselves."

        "Wow, Professor Graumlich?",
        "Yeah, Mandy, it turns out that people are more and more interested in citizens who are observing these changes in - we have a sort of odd word for it, we call it phenology, and that's phrenology, like how brain structure - brain, you know, how your brain looks influences your behavior, but this is phenology or the timing of biological events, particularly if they're related to climate.",
        "And I'm actually really excited, having just arrived here in Arizona, that we've actually just recently established a National Phenology Network - it's called the NPN, that's probably a little easier to remember -here at the University of Arizona.",
        "I believe it's npn.org.",
        "And we are actively looking for citizens making observations, whether it's of tomato plants, whether it's bud bursts in either the cultivated species you might have in your yard, or times of sort of insect emergence.",
        "Because we realize that in many ways the way weather has been, you know, sort of documented by citizen observers and has created a really strong record during the 20th century of how climate is changing, we need people like you weighing in about what you're seeing in your own backyard.",
        "So I urge you to look up NPN on Google and get involved.",
