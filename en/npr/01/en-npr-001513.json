        "Mandy, if I can just make a real plea for people like Mandy to get involved because, you know, this whole global climate change, if Mandy just says, you know, something's going on in her backyard, that really isn't evidence.",
        "It's when we accumulate hundreds and thousands and tens of thousands of records of climate impacts that we both start to have scientific credibility but probably more importantly can start to influence people's opinions and perceptions of this issue in such a way that it gains more public support.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It's one of the lines of evidence that really indicates the climate is changing, because people have been interested, for instance, in Europe and the first signs of spring and have meticulously recorded them.",
        "People have looked at the breakup of ice and rivers when it used to be important for navigation.",
        "So those records are one of the lines of evidence that we use to determine that the planet has changed, and they'll continue to be very important in the future.",

        "And I would like to caution you and your guests and the audience that blaming global warming on forest fire increases and more acreages lost I think may not be a very good correlation because we've changed our firefighting techniques so much in the last 20 or 30 years.",
        "For instance, we no longer put fire lines next to the fires.",
        "We go two or three miles away, which means thousands and thousands of acres burn that wouldn't have in the old way we fought fires.",
        "We've also closed a lot of smoke jumper bases who had a mantra which is - every fire out by 10:00 AM the next day.",
        "And they don't do that anymore, and we're letting fires burn.",
        "So since the Biscuit Fire, which you guys may have heard of, they let that burn for three days before they even went after it, and it got away and burnt 500,000 acres.",
        "That's got to change the equation quite a bit.",
        "Professor Graumlich?",
        "Yeah, Malcolm, you know, that's something that's been of great interest to me, in part because I've lived really close to some of those places that have burned.",
        "I urge you to look at some of the evidence, particularly some recent papers published by Tony Westerleen(ph) in Science magazine, with a co-author of Tom Sweatnum(ph), where they gathered over a thousand records of fire in the Western U.S.",
        "They factored in management changes in terms of the ability to sort of - you know, using some of the fire atlases and other kinds of data sources - and could show that even looking at that change in management, we still have a higher number of fires than would be expected just based on those changes in management alone.",
        "But certainly everything that you just discussed about ways in which we've changed the way we've dealt with wildfire is a big factor in how we think about this.",
        "The problem is, boy, that wildfire signal is even surpassing what we would expect based on management changes alone.",

        "Well, as we've talked about today, there's some big challenges out there, and some of them involve management.",
        "We really need to begin to coordinate management and look closely at what management objectives the parks are, because, for instance, with Glacier National Park or you have parks that are set up to protect certain attributes or certain species that may not be there due to climate change.",
        "And as those shifts happen, that's exactly what our work was showing, was that as those shifts happen and you lose a species in one park, then you have to consider where it may be existing in the future.",
        "So as certain high-elevation species disappear around glaciers and in Glacier National Park, you may have to go farther north to find those species, and that may mean that we need additional protected areas to make sure that all species are under the umbrella of protection that we'd hope they have in our protected areas of parks and nature reserves.",
        "There's no thought of changing some of the parks and the species in them into more like zoo-type environments where you would supply them with the things they can't normally get in the wild anymore.",
        "Well, I think the thing we have to be careful about is not trying to turn parks into zoos and not trying to keep things static where they've been.",
        "And that's very difficult because many of our management regimes have looked at the past and said, well, we're going to manage to try and maintain a pre-European contact conditions, for instance.",
        "Well, those sort of benchmarks don't have relevance necessarily as we push climate into places it's never been before.",
        "But we do need to let natural processes unfold and not become obsessed with keeping things frozen in place.",
        "Because this change is coming, it is happening, and we need to figure out how to work with it on broader dynamics, across larger regions, as Lisa was suggesting.",
        "Lisa, any last comments?",
        "I guess one last thing that people can think about is the role invasive species, the species that are coming to us from other continents, might play with this as well.",
        "We know that sometimes those invasive species have a much higher temperature tolerance, and one of the things we're seeing here in the Southwest is that the native fish species have a higher temperature tolerance than - I mean the invasive ones - have a higher tolerance than the natives.",
        "So everything that we can do, not only to combat climate change, but to think about sort of maintaining the ecological integrity of our parks and protected areas in other areas - like invasive species - is really critical.",
        "Once again, that's something - by controlling invasive species in people's yards and in their local parks, that's a real important step to helping us keep parks in an integral part of our landscape.",
