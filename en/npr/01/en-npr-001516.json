        "And so it's the combination of happy experiences and experiences, sometimes, of great suffering that teaches us much more about how to lead our lives, I think - if we really learn to look at that carefully.",
        "Let's bring it down out of the ether for a moment, and say that our own daily experiences in the world help shape how we perceive and define happiness.",
        "But there's a philosopher, Robert Nozick, who created an experiment that tests the question: Is there more to life than being happy?",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "Yes, that's called the experience machine, and it's a thought experiment.",
        "Robert Nozick asks us to think: What would it be like, and would we in fact want to choose to live in a kind of machine where we would always have perfectly happy experiences?",
        "We could choose the kind.",
        "We might, for example, believe that we're a great scientist or a great artist, or have wonderful love experiences or children who love us.",
        "It's just that none of it would be true.",
        "But we would feel that way.",
        "Would we choose to enter that kind of machine?",
        "Now, most people say no. But the interesting thing is that when professors ask this question in various classes, some students say maybe - almost as a just, yeah, why not?",
        "I might try it.",
        "It's like the movie \"\"The Matrix,\"\" sort of...",
        "It is a little like the movie \"\"The Matrix,\"\" that's right.",

        "And I think it's very interesting that you came to the conclusion that just telling people something that wasn't true - as you say, it might make them smile, but it wouldn't necessarily be what you would want for them or for your own happiness.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, are you going to do a national tour on this?",
        "And therefore, to me, when you think about happiness, it really has to do both with yourself, what kind of person you want to be, what kind of life you want to lead - we've now had two callers who have talked about that.",
        "But also, what can you do for other people?",
        "And then, to me, very important, you need to step back and say: Am I really helping them, or do I just think I'm helping them sometimes?",
        "Maybe I'm meddling in their life in ways that I shouldn't be.",
        "Why is that, Sissela Bok?",
        "Are we just socialized into this idea that helping others should make us feel good?",
        "Or what do you think's going on there?",
        "I do think we are often brought up, from the very beginning, to think that we feel better if we help other people.",
        "Now, I think children are often very suspicious of that - you know, the idea it's better to give than to receive.",
        "Well, in the beginning, children are not at all so sure.",
        "And so we need to become much more perceptive, also about that giving.",
        "Are we giving people things that will actually make them happy or not?",
        "And therefore, again, thinking about happiness, one's own and that of other people, involves trying to take the perspective of those other people, and really to try to see what is going to be the best for them.",
        "Well, you do bring up morality quite a bit in the book.",
        "And you're almost suggesting that happiness does not have to be associated with morality.",
        "It's not immoral, but just amoral.",
        "Well, it certainly is true, if we stop to think, that there are a lot of people who seem happy, who are not at all impressive from a moral point of view, so that it's very much too simple to think that happiness and being nice and kind and altruistic - that those two things always combine.",
