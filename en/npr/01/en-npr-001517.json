        "Hi there, Ms. Bok.",
        "You know, I think your comment about choosing to be happy is interesting, and it sort of leads into the two things in my life that helped me to be happy.",
        "I'm 62 years old, and my father taught me at a very young age that I should always live my life in such a way that when I reached advanced age I don't know if I'm advanced age now, but I'm getting there that I would be able to look back and never be sorry for the way that I lived my life, to try to achieve everything that I could achieve, and be the kind of person that I knew was the right person to be.",
        "And then in my teenage years, young teenage years, there was a song that came out by Donavan: Happiness runs in a circular motion, you can be happy if you let yourself be.",
        "And that song throughout my life has - with my father's advice and that song, has just made an incredible impact on the way that I worked and chose, I think, chose to be happy.",
        "I really did choose to be happy.",
        "I mean, good and bad things happened to me in my life, but I worked through them in a way that at the end, I always ended up being happy, and I know that I'm really fortunate for that.",
        "Thank you so much for your call, Carol.",
        "Go ahead, Ms. Bok.",
        "Yes, I'm very interested in your father's advice, and then also in the song and in your combining those two.",
        "And certainly, you can interpret the word choose to be happy in such a way as to sort of consider the way you lead your life.",
        "If you lead your life in a way, in such a way that you can look back and not be ashamed of things you've done in the past, that's already, I think, very comforting.",
        "And then, however, to deal with problems in the way that you mentioned having dealt with them, that can also help.",
        "And yet there must have been times for you when things have been so difficult that you might say, well, I wish I could choose to be happy right now but frankly, I don't think I can.",
        "Let's go to Veronica(ph) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
        "Hi, you're on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hi, my comment is about expectations.",
        "For me, that's where happiness or disappointment stems from.",
        "Growing up like most teens, you know, accepting what you look like, what you sound like, where you're from.",
        "And for me, I have really large teeth.",
        "And one day, I just decided - maybe at 10 or 12 - like, I have teeth, though.",
        "You know, I have so much to be thankful for, and it's okay.",
        "This is me, and I don't know.",
        "From that, it touched everything in my life, and I feel like I'm at peace, like beyond happiness.",
        "I feel like I'm at peace."

        "So I don't know.",
        "To me, it's just about peace.",
        "And that, I think you've touched on something that I think is very important from the point of view of exploring happiness - namely, trying to understand who you are.",
        "That's the beginning of the whole if you really understand who you are and what your expectations are, as you mentioned, then that's already going some way.",
        "And then I also think you mentioned, you know, the possibility of being grateful for what one has.",
        "And gratitude has is extremely important, as many of the writers on happiness mention.",
        "Even then, I think we have to step back and ask: Am I grateful for things that maybe I have and other people don't have, and maybe I'm shutting myself off from understanding them?",
        "But on the whole, yes, being able to be grateful for what you have and being able to accept who you are, that certainly is a very good starting point.",

        "And indeed, that makes some of them happy.",
        "Not others, especially those who might be very fearful, for instance, of what might happen to them in the afterlife.",
        "So I don't think it can be as simple as that, though it is certainly religious views, and they're very important in my book - comparing the different religious views about what makes for happiness and what does not.",
        "Some religious views, of course, say that there is not much you can do about happiness in this life.",
        "You have to wait for the next life.",
        "Others look at it very differently.",
        "Sissela Bok, I want to ask you something that keeps tweaking me in my head, and that is: Is this question really one of privilege?",
        "Are we only able to contemplate this because we are so rich, as a culture, and comfortable?",
        "We start to ask ourselves these sort of philosophical questions because we're not, you know, picking coffee all the time.",
        "Ah, yes, that is a very interesting question, but the fact is that ever since the beginning of time - when people, of course, often have not at all been particularly well off - they have been asking that and sometimes, at times of great misery.",
        "Even now, when we look at research from the world over, the fact is that most countries, however poor, have - in most countries, the majority of people are moderately or very happy, or say they are."

        "And people differ very much from the point of view of how they look at particular circumstances.",
        "At the same time, there's a real danger, of course, in shutting out evidence that might be very important to you because it might disturbing, also.",
        "And there are some people who go through life very cheerfully without noticing, for instance, that they might be making trouble for their children or their husband or their friends, or something like that - simply shutting out evidence, shutting out information that might disturb them.",

        "I had an unexpected experience of joy in my mostly rather dreary life earlier this summer.",

        "A couple of emails along that same point.",
        "From Sheila, in Florida - Jacksonville -we hear: When I finally understood that perhaps all of the unpleasantness I had experienced in my life was a lesson, is when she learned about happiness.",
        "That lesson is to learn the ability to identify and really know what happiness is.",
        "How can you really know what happiness if you've never experienced unhappiness?",
        "And here's an email that I think everyone can identify with.",

        "She's so stressed at work that she can't find the time to explore what would make her happy.",
        "I thought about recommending yoga but with twin children and her two jobs, time is a precious commodity for her.",
        "So, same question, isn't it?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "I'm very interested both in Sheila's and in Brian's, and those - what they're talking about really, again, is trying to explore what it is that makes for happiness, how we can deal - stress, I think, is just something that everybody would agree makes it more difficult to find, sort of, spot of happiness in the midst of terrible pressures.",
        "But it's that kind of exploring, discussing with one's wife, thinking through one's life that, to me, makes me think that exploring happiness is a kind of lifetime undertaking, and one can learn a lot from other people and from oneself.",
        "And it's hard to tell someone with two children and two jobs, oh, just choose to be happy.",
        "Doesn't always works that way, huh?",
        "Right.",
        "I think that is a very good point.",
        "Just choosing doesn't work.",
        "On the other hand, there may very well be things that one can do to improve the situation, once one steps back and says, okay, are all these elements in my life ones that I must have there?",
        "Or can I choose, perhaps, to set some aside for a later time?",

        "What I wanted to achieve very much, by bringing all those perspectives together, was to deepen the perception that people might have - readers and others - of what's really involved in happiness.",
        "But also, very much, I would hope - because I think that we're very much at the very beginning of research and understanding of happiness - I would hope that we could have what you might call a greater and more profound science of happiness that draws on all the different perspectives without leaving out, at all, the ethical perspective.",
        "Are you happy?",
        "Well, I would have to say that I am.",
