        "And anybody can learn to do this.",
        "It doesn't--you know, it doesn't take wild genius to be critical, analytical and careful.",
        "But we used to have, you know--we used to have rock star scientists like Carl Sagan and people like that who used to be out in public and show that they exist, if nothing else.",
        "We don't have those people anymore.",
