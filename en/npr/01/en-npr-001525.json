        "And he walks out of the bathroom.",
        "And she pauses for a second, thinks about it and then continues singing, hang on, Snoopy.",
        "And about a year and a half later, I ended up going to his studio, and the strip I had sent him was framed on his office wall.",
        "Renee, this is incredible.",
        "The only other stuff in his office was his drawing table, a sofa, a writing desk and a bookcase.",

        "JumpStart\"\" is a family..."
