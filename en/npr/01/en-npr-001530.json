        "They're asking themselves why are we saying all these and why are we provoking this international reaction against Iran at a time when Iran needs a lot of allies because of its nuclear program?",
        "So it's all very sort of confused, really.",
        "There are theories.",
        "One theory is that he is trying to rally around him the hard-liners here who are divided whether or not to support him in his hard-line policies.",
        "The other theory is that he genuinely believes that he has a mission.",
        "He thinks that Iran has to go back to the rhetorics of the 1979 revolution, when Ayatollah Khamenei was in charge and the rhetoric was pretty hard-line then.",
        "He believes that Islamic world has been passive about issues concerning it and particularly the issue of Palestinians is a national interest issue here.",
        "Now we should mention that in Iran, the president is not necessarily the most powerful official, and it does raise the question of whether the rest of Iran's government supports what Ahmadinejad is saying.",
        "Well, the reaction to his statements have been low-key, if that.",
        "I've seen the newspapers here, hard-line newspapers supporting his statements, and moderates, the reformist newspapers here, have been basically reporting it without much comment.",
        "I haven't seen many comments against it officially.",
        "The only thing I've seen is a member of parliament who's a member of the national security commission in parliament--he has come out openly and publicly criticizing it.",
        "Are these statements connected in any way to changes in Iran's policies on any issue?",
        "Well, I suppose when you come up with the statements, as he does, you have to follow these things up.",
        "I remember in the last few days, we've had the leader of Hamas, which is a hard-line group in Palestine--he has been here meeting with many Iranian officials and the Iranian officials have been supporting Hamas' line, saying that they have to make sure that resistance to Israel continues.",
        "So I suppose when the president comes out with hard-line statements like these, these will reflect sooner later in the policies.",
        "And when you say that he's going back to the rhetoric of the 1979 revolution, is he actively seeking confrontation with the West?",
        "I'm not sure whether he's actually seeking confrontation.",
        "I suppose these kind of a statements--they have their own consequences, and even if Mr. Ahmadinejad doesn't want to enter on this path of confrontation, sooner or later, there will be trouble and Mr. Ahmadinejad has to basically decide what he wants to do in actual fact, in practice."

        "And if you go to Yahoo!'s home site, you'll also see these displays, these banner ads.",
        "How much would they cost?",
        "So those are priced differently.",
        "Instead of people generally bidding on them, although that can happen, too, here you're paying for a cost per thousand impressions.",
        "So it might be $5 or $10 per thousand impressions.",
        "You know, again, it's going to depend on how valuable the site you're advertising against.",
