        "This, Palmer argued, could be the linguistic route of the American term boogie."

        "And so what this video shows is that what happened to Sandy should have never happened to her.",
        "She should have never been arrested.",
        "And what we get to see in that video is what her experience was like from her personal vantage point.",
        "Texas law authorities said in a statement that this video was not newly discovered.",
        "They said it was part of the investigation.",
        "But Cooper says she had no idea it existed.",

        "But he also should have been charged with assault as well.",
        "I think there was a lack of clarity from all those who saw the dashcam footage.",
        "But I think what this video shows is what happened inside of the car, which you don't get to see in that grainy dashcam footage.",
        "You and your family always believed that the story that was told was not the full story.",
        "But as you were watching the video, what did you feel like you understood?",
        "I understood that she was so passionate about being a part of criminal justice reform and police accountability to the degree that she'd have the courage to tape an encounter that was unpleasant with the full intent, I imagine, of going to file a complaint against Brian Encinia.",
        "She even says it herself in the video.",
        "Let's take this to court, she says.",
        "Doesn't she?",
        "Yes.",
        "She absolutely says, let's take this to court.",
        "And so I think we know that she got out of that car because she felt that if she didn't get out of the car that she would have been tazed to death.",
        "Just the impact of the words, I will light you up - I don't think that Brian Encinia expected to encounter someone who knows their rights.",
        "I think a lot of citizens don't know their rights when you get pulled over for a traffic violation.",
        "What, if anything, do you think would be different if this video had been made public right from the start of the investigation?",
        "I think there would have been an immediate amount of empathy for what transpired in the field and how that impacted her.",
        "So much of the conversation around Sandra's case lied within what happened in the field and what she should have done.",
        "And, essentially, there's a swath of people who felt like she deserved to be there because of what they perceive that she did based off of the narrative that the police officer shared."

        "They made the decision to dismiss the charges.",
        "So while, ideally, we would like to see Brian Encinia held accountable for his actions in the field equally as we'd like to see Waller County jailers held accountable for the negligence that was shown in the jail, what we have focused our efforts on over the last couple of years is to enact action and change in other ways."
