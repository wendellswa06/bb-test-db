        "Yes.",
        "So the more initiatives like this one that openly refute ISIS ideology, especially online and especially through live communications with people online, the more difficult it will be for ISIS to monopolize the perceptions of those vulnerable individuals.",

        "She named the program Every Campus A Refuge.",
        "Then the Paris attacks happened, and the governor of her state, North Carolina, joined other governors asking to block the arrival of Syrian refugees.",

        "It's great to be here with you.",
        "What made you initially think that college campuses could and should be part of the refugee resettlement process?",
        "Well, initially, I had been desperate about trying to be involved in some way in alleviating the refugee crisis, doing something material more than simply educating my students about it, donating or volunteering.",
        "And so when the pope called on every parish in Europe to host a refugee family, I began thinking deeply about that call for cities to become a place of refuge.",
        "And then I remembered that the word for a university campus in Arabic is haram (ph) which means literally a sanctuary or a refuge, a sanctified place where people are safe.",

        "And you're not talking about housing people for years.",
        "You're looking specifically at a 90-day resettlement period, is that right?",
        "Yes, that's exactly right.",
        "When refugees come in, they go through a reception and placement period.",
        "And this is what the resettlement agency does.",
        "It finds them appropriate housing.",
        "It furnishes their apartment.",
        "Most landlords don't want to take a risk on refugees who are coming in, especially because they don't have enough finances, they're unemployed.",
        "And so they're usually having to negotiate with landlords who are not always very hospitable.",
        "And when refugees come in, they're only given a one-time stipend - each refugee.",
        "And that stipend they're supposed to use to pay rent, to pay for food, for transportation.",
        "But if a campus houses them for those 90 days, after which they're supposed to become self-sufficient, then they don't have to use that stipend and they don't have to worry about all the things they need to worry about.",
        "What they can do in those 90 days is focus on adjusting culturally, emotionally, psychologically.",
        "And so a campus can help financially in those 90 days so that a family can get on its feet much quicker then it would otherwise.",
        "Your college, Guilford, signed onto this pretty quickly.",
        "I understand they were pretty enthusiastic.",
        "But even before the Paris attacks, you did hear some pushback.",
        "Tell me about that."
