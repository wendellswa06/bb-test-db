        "Now that it has closed after the federal Medicaid agency pulled the hospital's funding, they have to find another place to go on an already taxed emergency room system locally.",
        "And so that, coupled with a number of other factors afflicting hospitals in general, but also afflicting hospitals in the region, it is taxing hospitals nearby.",
        "Now, some hospitals, the Kaiser Permanente, Cedars-Sinai, which is local, seem to be doing much better.",
        "What's the difference between how they operate and how some of these other emergency rooms operated or operate?",

        "And it is booming.",
        "It's doing better than it has in years.",

        "And, you know, those on the edge appear to be closer to bankruptcy and closing.",
        "Now, if you go to the King/Drew Web site, it basically says, okay, our emergency care has closed and, quote, \"\"If you live within 12 miles of the hospital and need emergency care, please go to one of the hospital locations listed below or call 911.\"\" But some of those hospitals are on the possible chopping block.",
        "What's going on there?",
        "I mean, what's happening is these - exactly what you're saying.",
        "You have these 30,000 emergency room visits a year, searching for somewhere to go.",
        "And many of the hospitals in that area already were facing their own problems and their own issues.",
        "And so they are increasingly turning away patients.",
        "From the numbers we found is that the amount of time it is taking to get a patient from their home to the emergency room has grown from roughly 13 minutes at the beginning of the year to around 18 minutes today.",
        "And so that's a significant issue, especially when you're talking about critical care patients.",
        "Why don't we expand this out a little bit?",
        "I know you've also been looking at the situation nationally.",
        "Is there a similar problem in other parts of the country?",
