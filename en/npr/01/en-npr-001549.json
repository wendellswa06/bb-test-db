        "Chris was a bomb disposal expert for the British Army.",
        "His job was to dismantle those roadside bombs before they exploded, and without getting shot by a sniper in the process.",
        "He writes about his experiences in a new book called \"\"Eight Lives Down.\"\" Chris Hunter welcome to the program.",
        "How are you Madeleine?",
        "I'm fine thank you.",
        "You had a lot of experience doing this bomb disposal before you even went to Iraq.",
        "You were in Colombia, you were in Northern Ireland, but I imagine the scale in Iraq would be a hundred times what you saw in Colombia or Northern Ireland.",
        "What was a typical day like in Basra?",
        "We'd sit there in the detachment room, the phone would suddenly ring.",
        "A tasking message would come through telling us there was an IED, where it was going to be, a rough description of what the device was like, although that was never ever accurate.",
        "So you might as well just make it up.",
        "And you were there in the summer of 2004 right?",
        "That's right.",
        ".",
        ".",
        "And so I imagine it was extremely hot temperatures, well above 100.",
        "It got to a stage actually it was so hot that we couldn't wear the bomb suit, or I couldn't wear the bomb suit.",
        "It was only myself, really, as the operator in the team.",
        "You're carrying net 85 pounds of bomb suit with Kevlar armor, and all sorts of different armor, and fire retardant material, and then you're probably carrying another 85 pounds of kit as well.",
        "I would've ended up probably keeling over from heat exhaustion, and dying before I even got to the bomb itself.",
        "So in some ways it was great actually that it was so hot, because it actually reduced the amount of kit I had to carry by half.",
        "Yeah, but it made it more dangerous.",

        "That's right, yeah.",

        ".",
        ".",
        "That's it, I mean you literally, you arrive there, and the first thing that happens is the team goes straight into their procedures, which is securing the area, checking for secondary devices.",
        "And as soon as I had established what I thought was going to be down there, I'd send a robot down ideally, but much of the time it was impossible to do that because of terrain.",
        "And then I'd go down and do a manual approach, which is what we call the long walk.",
        "And that's where you leave everybody else behind, and you step out of that control point, and do the long, lonely walk down the eerie street.",
        "You're absolutely focused on what you're doing.",
        "And not just the device, but the threat of secondary attack as well, so the threat of sniper attacks, the threat of secondary devices being in place along that route as you're walking up to that device.",
        "You found out that you personally were being targeted by leaders of one of the militias that they knew who you were.",
        "They knew what you were doing, what you're position was, that you were dismantling their IEDs.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Who wanted to kill you, and how did they find out about you?",
        "My particular team, we became very, very adept at, not just neutralizing the devices themselves, but we were tasked to other incidents, too.",
        "I mean in the first two months we were tasked 45 incidents, and some of those incidents were explosions.",
        "But when we got there, you know, we wouldn't just say, yeah there's a smoking hole in the ground.",
        "We would go and painstakingly gather the forensic evidence, and put it together with the intelligence picture as well.",
        "And very, very quickly we started building up an idea of what we call the terrorist signature, the bomb maker's signature.",
        "Specific devices built by specific groups, and then when we fused that with the intelligence we were able to identify the sort of areas they were operating from.",
        "And I was told, basically that we had been effectively, insultingly - because they had been made to look foolish because the devices they were placing weren't detonating because we were getting there quickly and interdicting them.",
        "And those that did, we were building up the forensic piece, and making them look foolish.",
        "So they put a price on my head.",
        "They want that to happen because they know they cannot campaign on domestic policy.",
        "And I went around, I interviewed everybody.",
        "I got unpublished art.",
        "It was going to be the first big and important piece on what was going on back then.",
        "And I sent it in to my editor, and I heard absolutely nothing, which was very, very strange.",
        "And after a few days, I phoned him and I said, did you get it all?",
        "And he said, oh, yes.",
        "I said, well, what did you think?",
        "And he said, well, honestly, Neil, we have a problem with it.",
        "We think it lacks balance.",
        "And I said, well, what kind of balance does it lack?",
        "And he said, well, these comic books, you seem to think they're a good thing."

        "It's comics, and it's its own glorious medium, and it's a combination of words and of pictures.",
        "And there's no limit to how good the words can be, no limit to how good the pictures can be and no limit to what you can do if you're making them work together.",
        "One thing that has changed enormously, as well, 40, 50 years ago, the industry was completely dominated by two companies, and if you didn't work for them, you didn't make comics.",

        "Oh, I think comics - the glory of comics has always been democracy.",

        "Comics tended to be created by people who weren't getting work elsewhere.",

        "Crumb's \"\"Book of Genesis\"\" in there, which is such a glorious fusion of underground sensibility - and, you know, Crumb could arguably be said to have created the underground -with absolute strict fidelity to the \"\"Book of Genesis\"\" that somehow then gets to tell you a story that you can be infinitely familiar with in a way that feels like it's the first time you're ever encountering it.",

        "And I love a good - I love the art, but I need that good narrative, too.",
        "Neil Gaiman, it was interesting, in your introduction to this most recent edition, you said one of the best comics you'd ever read was, in fact, Lynda Barry's introduction to another edition of the - one of the ones that she edited.",
        "It really was.",
        "I think Lynda Barry is right now doing some absolutely marvelous work with words and pictures and storytelling and just imploring people to create, and talking about what she's doing.",

        "And one of the things that's changed over the last 20, 30 years is more and more comics now are being done at length.",
        "More and more comics are big, long, graphic-novelly works.",
        "They're 200 pages or so.",
        "How do you select a scene, a sequence, a bit out of a longer work?",
        "It's like having a book called \"\"Best American Novels\"\" and going in and grabbing a chapter you like or several pages you like.",
        "Well, illustrate that for us by talking about the decisions that went into the excerpt from a book called \"\"The Alcoholic,\"\" which is a -one of those long, difficult books.",
        "And it's not your - whatever - if you think there's an idea of a typical comic, this is not it.",
        "And you had to pick an excerpt.",
        "Well, \"\"The Alcoholic\"\" is fascinating.",
        "I mean, it's published by Vertigo, which is actually one of the arms of DC Comics.",
        "And it's written by Jonathan Ames, a well-known novelist and writer and occasional prizefighter, and drawn by Dean Haspiel very beautifully.",
        "And the section that I wound up choosing is from fairly early in the book, and it leads into the fall of the Twin Towers.",
        "And again, it was that thing of trying to find a flavor of this thing, which is this wonderful, mad, slight... semi-autobiographical, but you're never quite sure how much the title character, who is called Jonathan Ames and is drawn to look like Jonathan Ames, actually is Jonathan Ames.",
        "But it's - again, it's a great big long graphic novel, plays around with themes of obsession, of alcoholism, of all kinds of addiction, and also is a portrait of one life and of New York after the Twin Towers fell."
