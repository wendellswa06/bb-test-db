        "And then they sent me boxes and boxes and boxes and boxes of stuff they thought was interesting.",
        "And what was interesting was their tastes and mine didn't entirely align.",

        "But I think it was a wonderful thing having them just doing the initial selecting process and finding stuff, and then, of course, they had to find me because last year, I was incredibly peripatetic and shooting off to China to research something and then going around America.",
        "So I kept turning up places and having large boxes of comics waiting for me.",
        "It was glorious."
