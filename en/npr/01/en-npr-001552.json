        "And those devices, they're called explosive form penetrators, they are the most lethal IEDs we've ever seen on earth.",
        "To sort of put it into context, in the 30 years that we were fighting in Britain against the provisional I.R.A., the level of sophistication they achieved in 30 years was superseded in Iraq in 12 months.",
