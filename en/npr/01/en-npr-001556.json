        "But there were also many new messages, some heard during a loud and boisterous march at Tehran University.",

        "So Sigmund wanted to help his friend.",
        "He also knew that if he could write this up, he could really become famous.",
        "And so he studied this.",
        "He began studying it in 1884, read the whole world's literature on the topic, and wrote a very prominent monograph called \"\"Uber Coca,\"\" or \"\"On Coca,\"\" that really, you know, excited the entire medical world about all of its medical and therapeutic uses, except for one.",
        "He missed the major use of cocaine as a medical agent.",
        "It is a terrific local anesthetic.",
        "And a few months after Freud got his first shipment of cocaine in 1884, he wrote a letter to his fiancé describing how it feels.",
        "Can you read a little bit of that for us?",
        "I thought you'd never ask.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "It's June 2, 1884 - it's about a month or two after he started dabbling with cocaine - he writes to Martha Bernays, his fiancé: Woe to you, my princess.",
        "When I come, I will kiss you quite red and feed you till you are plump.",
        "And if you are forward, you should see who is the stronger - a gentle little girl who doesn't eat enough, or a big, wild man who has cocaine in his body.",
        "In my last severe depression, I took coca again, and a small dose lifted me to the heights in a wonderful fashion.",
        "I am just now busy collecting the literature for a song of praise to this magical substance.",
        "Pretty racy stuff for that time.",
        "Pretty racy indeed.",
        "And the great thing about Freud is that he's an inveterate letter writer, and you can really track his entire life through his letters to his fiance, to his friends, to another friend named Wilhelm Fleiss.",
        "And he does get rather specific about how magical and exciting cocaine is for him.",
        "We have to take a break.",

        "We're talking with author Howard Markel about \"\"An Anatomy of Addiction.\"\" Before we move on to another protagonist in the in the book, the other - Halsted, the other major figure - let me ask you one question I'm sure that comes up all the time, and you address, is what did cocaine have to do with Freud and his theories?",
        "Did it have any influence, anything like that?",
        "Well, it's a complicated answer.",
        "It's yes and no. I mean, there are points in Freud's early cocaine abuse where he was amazed at how loquacious it made him, how it freed up ideas that he thought were locked within his mind.",
        "Sound familiar?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And of course, that's what - a safer version of that is free association, where you're simply talking about things and going from topic to topic, to try to delve what's in your unconscious or subconscious mind.",
        "But I think he quickly learned - both with his friend Fleischl Marxow, who became not only a morphine addict but also a cocaine addict, and also with another patient he nearly killed while treating her with cocaine, that this was a rather toxic substance.",
        "Nevertheless, his most important dream, the dream that became the model for \"\"The Interpretation of Dreams,\"\" was indeed a dream about cocaine use and the problems that resulted from treating this patient, Emma Eckstein, with cocaine.",

        "Well, he dreamed that he was at a party, and the Emma character came to him - a crowded party - and there were syringes and cocaine and scabs all around.",
        "And she accused him in front of this gathering - you nearly killed me, this was terrible.",
        "And Freud wondered about this and said, well, I had this dream because I'm such a concerned physician that if any of my patients have a bumpy course, I feel it as well.",
        "Well, in reality, Freud had this dream because he was rather upset and nervous that he nearly killed her while treating her, both himself under the influence and while she was taking cocaine, with a surgical mistake.",
        "A colleague of his operated on Emma's nose and left a surgical sponge in the site, and she nearly died.",
        "So talk about dreams as wish fulfillment.",
        "Here's a perfect example of that.",
        "So cocaine did have some impact on his thinking and on his life.",
        "Yes.",

        "Well, Halsted, of course, they - Freud and Halsted probably never met, although they were both working at the Vienna General Hospital at the same time.",
        "I found that hard to believe.",
        "As I'm reading your book and these parallel lives, knowing that, I'm saying they never, you know, bumped into the cafeteria or something like that?",

        "But they must have seen each other.",
        "It's not that big of a place.",
        "But Halsted, of course, read not only Freud's very famous paper on cocaine, but a subsequent paper that came out about a month later by a man named Karl Koller that demonstrated that if you did a cataract operation and you took a dropper full of water and cocaine, you could anesthetize the eyeball.",
        "And so Halsted was fascinated that here is a safe local anesthetic that I could use on my operations, because back then they had ether and chloroform, but those were very toxic and obnoxious drugs.",
        "They made you throw up a lot.",
        "They really caused a lot of sleepiness and sedation.",
        "So he started experimenting with that.",
        "And he used, as many doctors did, his own arm.",
        "He was his own guinea pig, and he was injecting it and very rapidly went down the tubes as a cocaine addict."

        "To the detriment of his patients, you point out.",

        "He stopped writing.",

        "Green is the symbolic color of the opposition movement.",
        "And you also have to remember that a broken leg of that magnitude, where the bone was literally sticking out of the skin, was almost always a fatal case if somebody did not intervene immediately.",
        "And Halsted was so bombed out of his mind on cocaine that he actually withdrew from the operating table and said, I cannot operate, and then went home and skittered away the next several months high on cocaine.",
        "Wow.",
        "And he eventually(ph) had that addiction his whole life.",
        "Well, he did.",
        "Around that period, a good friend of his, William Henry Welch, who became one of the founders of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, promised he would bring Halsted with him and - in this great medical experiment, but only if he got clean.",
        "And first, he tried to take Halsted on an ocean voyage.",
        "That didn't work very well.",
        "Halsted brought along his own supply of cocaine, and then he broke into the first-aid kit when he ran out.",
        "And finally, Welch said, you got to take care of this.",
        "This is a huge problem.",
        "And Halsted admitted himself to an insane asylum, the Butler Hospital for the Insane in Rhode Island, and stayed there for many months to try and rid himself of this problem.",
        "Unfortunately, he gained another problem, because while they were trying to get him off cocaine, they gave him morphine.",
        "So he emerged as both a cocaine and a morphine addict for the rest of his life.",
        "So when does cocaine - sort of the dangers of it get to be recognized, and now it's no longer available to anybody who wants to get it?",
        "Well, that happened rather quickly after this big push that it was the miracle drug of all time.",
        "And that's one of the exciting things about writing about cocaine is that, you know, you don't have a long period of safe use with that drug.",
        "You go downhill pretty quickly if you're abusing it.",
        "And within several, you know, a few years, there was a whole cohort of people - and William Halstead was one of them - who were just wrecked men.",
        "Many of them were doctors, by the way, but they were wrecked human beings.",
        "They were paranoid.",
        "They were thin.",
        "They were jittery.",
        "They couldn't sit still.",
        "And they were true cocaine addicts.",
        "And the medical literature beginning in the late 1880s, and certainly by the 1890s, said, hey, this is not something we should prescribe willy-nilly.",
        "And, in fact, by the early 20th century, the United States Congress passed a law controlling things, not just cocaine, but also narcotics such as morphine and opium and even marijuana, that you could not simply sell the stuff over the counter, that you had to have a doctor's prescription in order to obtain it."

        "And his most fallow periods, in fact - where he couldn't operate at all, where he'd walked out of the operating room or he'd go AWOL from the hospital entirely and no one knew where he was - was, you know, coincident with the time where he was abusing at the most point.",
        "Now, he probably went on binges of cocaine off and on every summer or so.",

        "And he really kept abreast of the medical literature, the latest scientific and medical discoveries.",

        "Oh, no kidding?",
        "No kidding at all.",
        "And so he read \"\"Uber Coca,\"\" and he likely read - because he was interested in eye surgery, he definitely read Karl Koller's paper about cocaine anesthesia and probably played with it a little bit himself.",
        "And, of course, he gave his character Sherlock Holmes, who was based on a doctor - Sherlock Holmes had the diagnostic, deductive capability of a doctor.",
        "And he gave him, as one of his characteristics, a love of 7 percent solution, a 7 percent cocaine solution that he injected in his mottled arm."
