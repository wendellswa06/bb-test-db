        "Yeah.",
        "Howard, we usually have you on as our guest for Science Diction.",
        "You do the origin of scientific words.",
        "And, of course, the theme in your book is, where does the word addiction come from?",
        "You want to give us that...",
        "Yes.",
        "And while - yes, of course.",
        "And while, you know, Freud and Halsted in the 1880s, with cocaine and even morphine, that's the birth of the modern addict, as we understand it, as a - this excessive use to the point of loss of control of a substance, it really - it wasn't that term that - it didn't mean that at all until the late 19th century.",
        "In fact, the word comes from a Latin word, addictio.",
        "And in antiquity, it was an edict of Roman law, so that if I owed you a great deal of money, Ira, and I couldn't pay you back, you would take me before a judge.",
        "And he would make me your addict, your slave, until - I'd have to work for you until I could pay you off.",
        "And that was the nature of the term addiction or addict well into the 1500s.",
        "Later on, it became a term for describing someone's bad habits: if you ate too much, if you were too stubborn, if you smoked too much.",
        "But we don't see its use as, you know, the loss of control due to an exogenous substance that you take until the late 1880s or early 1890s.",
        "Wow.",
        "And it would make sense because the original definition, as you say, is you're basically enslaved to someone.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so you're enslaved to this drug, I would imagine.",
        "The Democrats think government has a fairly large role to play in the health care system, and the Republicans don't.",
        "(Soundbite of voices)",
        "To this drug, yeah.",
        "And now, as we're learning more and more about the science of addiction and what these substances and perhaps even behavior - such as hypersexuality or gambling, or what have you - these stimulate the pleasure center of the brain, the limbic center of the brain in such a way that it really changes the architecture - the wiring, to put it crudely - of the brain so that you lose the ability to say no. And you know it's harming you, but you still do it."

        "But, you know, once you change a cucumber into a pickle, you can't change that pickle back into a cucumber.",
        "So you have to come up with other means, very clever means of medical and psychological treatment to try to help people get off their drugs of choice.",

        "It was a hollow tube made out of cedar or ebony.",
        "And, you know, there's really charming story of how that came to be.",

        "He was late to see a patient, a woman with heart disease, and he was taking a short cut through the courtyard of the Louvre.",
        "And he saw some boys playing on a pile of timber, and two boys were playing with a long plank or a log.",
        "And one was taking a pin or a nail and scratching it on one end, and the other boy could hear it all the way on the other end, you know, as sound will travel through a solid body.",
        "And he said, wow, that's a great idea.",
        "And then he went to see his patient, and he asked for some paper.",
        "He rolled it up into a cylinder, and he put it against this woman's chest.",
        "And he was absolutely amazed at how he could hear the heart in a way that he had never been able to hear before.",
        "Wow.",
        "But even if they could hear, you know, something rattling around in the chest, does - in those days, was there anything he could really knew about it?",

        "They didn't have a lot of treatment.",
        "But what was really remarkable about Laennec is that he figured out so many things about diseases of the chest, you know, things like tuberculosis or emphysema, and also of heart disease, whether they were heart murmurs or other problems of the heart, so that doctors could accurately diagnose these.",
        "And he experimented with a series of tubes, the hollow tubes.",
        "It's about a foot, to a foot-and-a-half long.",
