        "Does it take away its specialness if it's there 365 nights of the year instead of just one?",
        "That was, you know, a matter of internal debate, and people, sort of, were worried about that.",
        "But I don't think so because I think that being able to see it is just a reminder of its role year round.",
        "And it's kind of like, is the Empire State Building less special because, you know, you see it every night and it changes colors?",
        "Oh yes, very much so, and I think that's, you know, the biggest problem.",
        "There are a lot of things that Democrats and Republicans do agree on going forward, but the bottom line is they disagree on the role of government, and that's the hardest part of this.",

        "How did the subject come up?",
        "Almost as soon as I sat down with Phil Spector, he started to talk about his mental state.",
        "One of the first things he said to me was, I haven't been well.",
        "I've been crippled inside.",
        "But I think there's a background to this, and if I could just give the background for a moment.",
        "Spector hadn't given a major interview in something like 25 years.",
        "And I managed to get an interview and I went to the castle in Alhambra where Lana Clarkson was subsequently shot dead.",
        "But I think one of the reasons he did speak so candidly was that he was talking about them very much in the past tense.",
        "And he felt that, I think, that he'd overcome these difficulties now, that they were in the past, they were behind him.",
        "And the other thing that he kept emphasizing to me was, but now I just want to be a reasonable man.",
        "I'm trying to be a reasonable man.",
        "And that was a phrase that he kept using throughout our conversation, talking about his determination to be a reasonable man, which really makes what happened on February the 3rd, just a couple of months later, all the more tragic and ironic, I think."

        "And that was legendarily a very contentious recording session, also involving guns.",
        "Yes, well, unfortunately pretty much all of the records that Spector made through the 1970s were highly controversial, and all of them involved guns.",
        "You know, he was drinking very heavily.",
        "He wasn't a man in control of himself.",
        "And guns had become very much a permanent fixture around the world of Phil Spector.",
        "He would wear guns around the house.",
        "He'd even wear guns when he was making telephone calls to record executives in order to give himself a bit of an edge over them, it seemed, on the telephone.",
        "He'd very often pull guns."
