        "And now the second shot, at least, they have to make a decision whether to hit a longer club over the water; there are also trees up on the right which make it more difficult to just fly your drive down the right-hand side and get a good angle into the green.",
        "So on that particular hole I think it's a change for the good.",

        "As far back as a year ago, he mentioned his father and how sick he was in his acceptance speech here.",

        "But the kind of competitor Tiger is, I'm sure what he will say to himself is, if this is going to be the last time my dad sees me play in a major championship, I want to win.",
