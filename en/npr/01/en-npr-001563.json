        "And whether you go to Harvard or whether you go to Thomson Reuters, there's some facts we know about health care in America.",
        "And the facts we know is one out of every three dollars that gets spent doesn't help anybody get well and doesn't prevent anybody from getting sick.",
        "The second thing we know is, from the Congressional Research Service, that most of the mal-drivers(ph) today in health care come from government rules and regulations.",
        "The government now directs over 60 percent of the health care in this country.",
        "And if throwing money at it and creating new government programs could solve it, we wouldn't be sitting here today because we've done all that.",
        "It hasn't worked.",
        "So what I thought we ought to do is maybe talk about, why does it cost so much?",
        "Because the thing that keeps people from getting access to care in our country is cost.",
        "You mentioned Malia and Sasha.",
        "The fact is, is with young kids going to the ER whether they have meningitis or asthma, they're going to get treated in this country, but they may get labeled with a pre-existing illness after that.",
        "And that's another thing I'll be happy to talk about at a later time.",
        "But the fact is, is we know how to treat acute asthma.",

        "And I'm corrected.",
        "Dr. Coburn, Dr. Senator Coburn, is a primary care physician, though he does deliver a lot of babies.",
        "And Julie Rovner, much of the morning session taken up on this question of containing costs and which party's ideas would do that more effectively than the other.",
        "Absolutely, and this is - and a lot of throwing around of facts that were sort of taken selectively, if you will, from the various estimates made by the Congressional Budget Office, one of the big ones talking about, you know, whose plan would raise premiums and whose plan would lower premiums.",
        "And indeed, there seem to be - at some point, everybody conceded, well, fundamental, philosophical differences on this point.",

        "My question was: Do you think that this is a culmination of Obama's game plan or strategy, that he gave Congress the chance?",
        "He lost popularity, I think, because he did that, and now that he's going to take the reins and push it through.",
        "Well, let's put that Scott Horsley, and again, this is informed by the Clinton administration's experience with health care, when the task force headed by Hillary Clinton came out with their proposal, and Congress proceeded to pick it to death, and then it went nowhere.",
        "This time around, the president said: Congress, you take the lead.",
        "House of the Representatives, the United States Senate, you write the bill.",
        "That's right, and I don't think this is so much the culmination of the president's strategy as what he's sort of been forced to do as the - leaving it up to the legislature has not worked for him.",
        "So it sort of, as a desperation move, he has now said okay, I will step in, I will put my stamp on that, something he has tried very hard not to do, not only with health care but with other bills moving through Congress throughout the last year.",
        "So he's trying to say all right, if this is where we are, this is the last chance.",
        "Yes.",
        "Julie Rovner, this blend of President Obama's, of the House and Senate packages, is this pretty much the Democratic bill?",
        "Well, yeah, this is where that bill was going anyway.",
        "Remember, this is - essentially a lot of the things in this proposal are things that the Democratic leadership in the House and Senate had either already agreed to or were on their way to agreeing to.",
        "The problem with this bill, of course, is that in order to get this through, even if they use the reconciliation, the budget reconciliation process, the House will probably have to pass the Senate bill first.",
        "There's a lot of distrust right now between the House and the Senate.",
        "I'm just talking about Democrats.",
        "I'm not even talking about Republicans.",

        "A lot of political prognosticators said wait a minute, if this goes on too long, past the first of the year, then you're in an election year, and who knows what can happen then.",

        "And Julie was talking about the negotiations that have been going on with the House and Senate leadership.",
        "I mean, the week before the Tuesday election when the Democrats lost their majority, the president was up until 1 o'clock in the morning, sitting there with House and Senate negotiators, trying to hammer out a compromise, all for naught the following Tuesday, when they lost their filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.",
        "Julie Rovner?",

        "The president - and boy is he discovering this the hard way - does not control the Congress.",
        "The Congress controls the Congress.",
        "And you know, he can beg, he can cajole, he can lead, but he can't make the Congress do what the Congress isn't ready to do.",
        "And we're getting sort of a parliamentary glimpse today, when we actually do have the president sitting down with the lawmakers.",
        "This was sort of modeled on what he did with the House Republican caucus a few weeks ago, which the White House thought worked very well for him.",
        "He looked good in that setting, and so they've decided to try it again."

        "There are I don't know how many states, but let's say 20, 21 states currently have high-risk pools.",
        "Out of all those 21 states, about 200,000 people use the high-risk pool.",
        "And the reason is because by just dealing with older, less healthy individuals separately or people with pre-existing conditions, it is very, very expensive.",
        "Tom's point was if everybody's in it because presumably none of us know at any given moment who's going to end up being healthy and who's not, we don't know whether our kids are going to be suffering some sort of disease that we don't anticipate yet, or, you know, our spouses get ill, that if everybody's in it, then that drives prices down cheaper for everybody.",
        "So it's not that I think that the high-risk pool idea is a bad one.",
        "As I said, the House, the Senate bill, the bill - the proposal that I put forward, all use the high-risk pool as a stopgap measure to get to a broader pool, but the goal has to be to get everybody in in a place where those risks are spread more broadly.",
        "And if I just might say, we support high-risk pools and reinsurance with $25 billion in funding.",
        "The House and Senate versions are $5 billion in funding, and because of that robust support, CBO says this will work.",
        "The fundamental difference after that is that the Health and Human Services secretary, in that four-year period when they're somewhat similar, has the authority to raise the premiums.",
        "All of that is brought to Washington.",
        "We leave that authority in the states so that they can manage their state pools.",
        "And then after the bill becomes effective in 2014, the real problem becomes this - the mandate and the costs, the forcing of the purchase of insurance, which many Americans find objectionable, and that - you can avoid that mandate if you continue to design this as we do in the beginning.",
        "And that second voice there, Dave Camp, a Republican congressman from Michigan, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.",
        "And Julie Rovner, let's get a little translation of what they were talking about: the high-risk pools, we're talking about pre-existing conditions here?",
        "That's right.",
        "This was something that Senator McCain, in fact, when he was running for president last year proposed.",
        "This was one of the centerpieces of his health care proposal.",
        "Indeed as Congressman Camp was mentioning, many states have these.",
        "They actually don't work so well.",
        "As the president pointed out, only about 200,000 people who have pre-existing conditions are enrolled in them.",
        "That's because they are very, very expensive, and a lot of them actually have waiting periods of their own.",
        "So if you get diagnosed with cancer, you won't be able to buy insurance, and they'll say you're eligible for the state's high-risk pool, but then they may say you have to wait a year.",
        "So obviously, if you have cancer, it's a problem to then wait a year to get covered in the state's high- risk pool.",
        "And once you get in, the premiums, because they are only for people who are very sick, even though they are subsidized by the states, they're actually usually subsidized by the insurance companies.",
        "A portion of premiums that are paid go to help fund the high-risk pools.",
        "But the premiums are still very, very high, again because they're - they tend to be underfunded.",
        "So the idea here is that while it will take several years before this bill, assuming it was passed, were to take effect, they would have high- risk pools for people with pre-existing conditions in the interim, and there would be a considerably larger amount of money to help fund them."
