        "But if you tell insurance companies you have to cover everybody, then people would naturally not buy insurance until they got sick, and of course, that would defeat the purpose.",
        "So the Democratic answer to that is, well, so you have a mandate.",
        "You require everyone to get insurance.",
        "Everybody buys insurance.",

        "Well, the president is trying, I will say.",

        "You know, here are all the places that Republicans had proposed ideas that we have put into this bill.",
        "But as I mentioned a few minutes ago, the fundamental problem is that there's a - such a big difference in philosophy between what the Democrats want and what the Republicans want when it comes to the role of government.",
        "That even if you take a lot of these Republican ideas and put them in the bill, if the bill is so heavily weighted towards a big government role in health care, the Republicans still aren't going to want to vote for the bill, even if you take all their ideas and put it in them.",
        "If it's overlaid with all this government, it's still not going to be a bill that the Republicans are going to be able to support.",

        "I mean, this is - the Democratic plan is very similar to the plan that the Republican governor, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, endorsed.",
        "It's similar to a plan that Republicans like Chuck Grassley had endorsed years ago, but where the Republican Party in Congress is today, this is a bridge too far.",
        "In fact, the individual mandate that they're talking about now was originally - was dreamed up by Republicans for Republicans back in the early 1990s to counter - originally it was to counter the employer mandate that was being pushed in the 1988 election but also then to - was introduced in Congress to counter the Clinton plan.",
        "And Barbara, your point on, well, chiding Republicans about talking points, let's listen to an exchange he has, the president has here, with Eric Cantor, a Republican of Virginia, the deputy whip, I think, from the House of Representatives.",

        "So - but I do want to go back to your suggestion as to why we're here, and you suggested that maybe we are here to find some points of agreement, to bridge the gap in our differences.",
        "And I do like to go back to basics.",
        "We're here because we Republicans care about health care, just as the Democrats in this room.",
        "And when the speaker cites her letters from the folks in Michigan, and the leader talks about the letters he's received, Mr. Andrews(ph) his, all of us share the concerns when people are allegedly wronged in our health care system.",

        "Democrats keep reading letters from constituents saying how wronged they have been, pulling at the emotional heartstrings, and that's political theater, too.",
        "That's right, it is.",
        "And that's back to the point that I was making originally, that this is definitely a made-for-TV event.",
        "This is not - it's very difficult.",
        "This goes back, I think the origin of - part of the origin of today's event is that the president perhaps not very helpfully promised that the negotiations - when he was on the campaign trail, promised that all negotiations on the health bill would be televised on C-SPAN.",
        "So here we are with this being televised on C-SPAN.",
        "But it's very hard to do serious negotiations on C-SPAN because you end up with a lot of, you know, playing to the cameras, and today is an awful lot of playing to the cameras.",
        "It was a point that Senator John McCain, his opponent in the last election, John McCain of course Republican of Arizona, made in his remarks when he addressed the health care summit earlier this morning, and this is what President Obama had to say in response."
