        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, let's see if we can get a response to that from Julie Rovner.",
        "If the political risk to the president is - well, the American people seem to be opposed to this kind of legislation, and the process that Scott Horsley was talking about just a moment ago, the danger for the Republicans is they're seen as the party of, well, we just want to kill health care and, no, we don't care about a bill.",
        "You know, there's a lot of different sort of factions.",
        "You know, if you just look at it as the Democrats versus the Republicans, that really is not a good snapshot.",
        "You've got liberals who are furious that their - you know, for - not just the people who support single-payer, who have been furious for a year...",
        "They're outside demonstrating.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's right.",
        "The people who want a public option, that's not on the table anymore.",
        "Then within the Republican Party, you've got - as this caller points out - a lot of Republican moderates who would really like to do something.",
        "Remember, this bill looks an awful lot like the Republican moderate bill from 1993, of which there are four senators still in Congress who supported that bill: Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Kit Bond, Bob Bennett - so four Republican senators who were cosponsors of the bill that looks an awful lot like this who are now are saying they don't want any part of it.",
        "Olympia Snowe, who - from Maine, who voted for the bill in the Finance Committee, but now has - at first she said, well, she wanted more time.",
        "But she's obviously had a considerable amount of time and...",
        "And time to see the results for Massachusetts, perhaps.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So - yeah.",
        "There's a lot of - there's some moderate Republicans still around.",
        "And Susan Collins, who - also from Maine who does often what Olympia Snowe does.",
        "So it's hard to know where the, sort of, moderate Republicans are on this.",
        "Well, let's - we just have a couple of minutes left.",
        "And let's see where we think it's going to go if we don't emerge with any grand agreement at the end of the day from Blair House.",
        "Scott Horsley, the president says he wants a bill by the end of March.",
        "Is this - it's an active prospect at this point?",
        "It is.",
        "It's certainly a possibility that they could force this through, through reconciliation.",
        "You know, that - we've got these conflicting polls where people don't like this bill, but they don't want Congress to give up.",
        "And I guess they're maybe hoping that they would do something like the Republicans are suggesting, which is start over.",
        "Well, that's not going to happen.",
        "So it's either going to be this bill, or they give up.",
        "And that's going to be a choice.",
        "And Julie, is there a prospect - not just the political prospect of getting it through the Senate, through that very controversial reconciliation procedure if they have to do that, and that limits the kind of bill they can have.",
        "But nevertheless, are there votes for this kind of a bill in the House of Representatives?",
        "Well, I think, they're going to, you know, have to be cajoled.",
        "But the other interesting thing about the polls is, yes, if you look at the polls, they don't like this bill.",
        "But if you then poll on the individual elements that are in the bill, the public likes those it very much."
