        "I think I got to do it with beautiful writing in that one particular way.",
        "And I really just don't want to spend the rest of my career doing that.",

        "Well, you're right.",
        "I'm trying to be stealth about it.",
        "The thing that I think I'm most excited about the movie is Michael Patrick King.",
        "My partner and the writer and director of this movie wrote a really, really beautiful screenplay.",
        "And I think the thing I can tell you is that it's not what people expect.",
        "It's grand, and it's deep and there's incredible disappointment, and great laughs and still the cheeky, you know, behavior and the ribald talking conversation and language.",
        "But it's really about being a grown up, and what does that mean and how complicit are we in our disappointments and our failures, and when actually friendship can no longer fix things or even distract you the way they could when you were in your 20s.",
        "So many people, men and women, have such strong feelings about Carrie Bradshaw and her friends, but really mostly about Carrie.",
        "Do you find that people approach you differently now?",
        "And do you find, in any way, that you're almost imprisoned by the success of that character?",
        "I definitely think that, you know, people feel very comfortable approaching me, and for some reason I have never felt imprisoned or trapped or that it's affected the kind of choices I've had or even my personal life to some degree.",
        "And I think it's because Carrie was kind of the one character that wasn't an archetype.",
        "You know, the other women played these very specific roles and it was necessary that they do so."

        "But for the most part, it's been just this extraordinarily wonderful thing.",
        "And people, you know, if they're watching this character for so many seasons on HBO and now preparing to watch her on the big screen in \"\"Sex and the City: The Movie,\"\" perhaps they know something about you based on that character because there are obvious similarities — you live in New York, you're of similar age.",

        "It's really about, you know, how is this going to affect my time with my son, because my husband is a working actor and so we just, sort of, are conditioned to take jobs when they come along."
