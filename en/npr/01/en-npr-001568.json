        "And I do want to mention that, you know, even though I didn't mention business and other business disciplines and liberal arts, in terms of the high demand, they're actually doing pretty well out there.",
        "And in fact, a good example is liberal arts is actually looking at one of the highest percent increases from last year, I think almost a 12 percent increase from salaries last year, which is a fantastic thing for our liberal arts students.",
        "Now, in general, you know, during the boom in the late '90s, I guess, up until 9/11, a lot of people were expecting bonuses, that sort of thing, signing.",

        "They were, you know, very different, very kind of outrageous, to some people's estimation.",
        "But things have settled down a bit, and roughly 50 percent of them are offering bonuses, and you know, they're roughly between three and 4,000 dollars typically, a signing bonus.",

        "And in fact, you know, I am among the group of baby boomers who are going to be retiring and also beginning to experience a bit more health-related problems, and as we do experience that, the demand for a workforce including nursing is going to continue to grow.",
        "And you may already be aware of that from some of your own experience.",
        "Yes, I have.",
        "That's one of the reasons that my wife and I had gone into nursing school, is the - more or less the job prospects and the ability of such a portable career, because we hope to relocate, you know, by the time we finish with school.",

        "The House left early Saturday morning, but not before pairing up two of the oldest and most nasty partisan battles we have in Washington: lowering the estate tax and raising the minimum wage.",
        "They put them together in one bill.",
        "So the House Republican Leader said, if you'll give us a permanent cut in the tax for estates, we'll give you that two dollar minimum wage increase you've been talking about for the last nine years.",
        "Nine years?",
        "So will the Senate take that deal?",
        "Well, Bill Frist, the Senate Majority Leader, likes it.",
        "He has made the estates tax, which he of course calls the death tax, a big priority.",
        "And the deal they're looking at would eliminate the tax on estates under five million for individuals, ten million for couples.",
        "That's a lot of millionaires exempt right there.",
        "And bigger estates would still pay a tax, but a smaller one.",
        "As for the minimum wage, the GOP leaders still dislike raising it.",
        "They say it's bad economics, it kills jobs, it helps China.",
        "But it does have the one big selling point that it would take away a big issue the Democrats will campaign on this fall.",
        "So Frist could bring along most of the Senate Republicans, I think.",
        "And if the Democrats resist it, they'll say look, the Democrats want a higher minimum wage but they won't give us a tax cut to get it.",
        "I see.",
        "So is this a political winner for the Republicans?",
        "It could be, if they could get it done in the Senate.",
        "And if then, of course, it doesn't happen, you'd have to ask, how good do they really look, dangling a two dollar increase for the working poor as bait to get a millionaire's permanent tax break."
