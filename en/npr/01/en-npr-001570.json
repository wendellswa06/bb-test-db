        "I would guess you start with a love of beer, and you probably start, like you should do for any job, and was mentioned earlier, is meeting people, networking.",

        "I mean, most college students are already in social networks and start asking around.",

        "Say, I would like an informational interview, or just to meet someone, and start sort of putting yourself out there, meeting people, because that's - for these really dream-type jobs, that's kind of how you get in there.",
        "And I know you did talk about the job of band manager, or I guess that's an elevated roadie, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think you start off as basically a friend of the band who's helping them, and then you really grow with the band.",
        "You know, a band manager isn't all, you know, running around, making sure, you know, the rock star doesn't overdose on cocaine.",
        "It's a lot of being the parent, being the accountant, being the person who makes sure everyone else does their job for the band.",
        "And really the best way to become a band manager - well, there's two ways.",
        "One is, as was mentioned earlier, is to intern at a management company and work it that way.",
        "I can't emphasize enough how much working for free or interning helps when trying to get these type jobs.",
        "It's really the way in.",
        "The other way in is to find bands that you like, that you want to support, and become - just became their manager as they are going up.",
        "That's how a lot of people have done it.",

        "You don't need to go to art school to do that.",

        "Because getting inside the Conde Nasts of the world and showing this portfolio and getting people excited about you, you know, it does take a little bit of knowing people.",
        "But first things first is to start working on the portfolio, making images that show how great you'll be and why people should fly you to Europe to shoot, you know, models eating nice food.",

        "I would gather that most - if someone's going to trust you to a ship that huge, it's probably - you would have experience, and probably the way to get that experience would probably be through the armed forces.",
