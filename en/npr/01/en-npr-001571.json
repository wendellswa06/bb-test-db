        "What you can do, though, is to get a job at that company, and then start networking into that area.",
        "So you could start as the receptionist at Ben & Jerry's, and say, I have a really good palate, you know, I'll take classes.",

        "No, it's definitely, definitely a long-shot job.",
        "And I spoke to Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who did \"\"Little Miss Sunshine,\"\" and also Eli Roth, who shot the \"\"Hostel\"\" movies, and one thing they'll both say, if you do want to be a film director, do go to film school.",
        "A lot of people think of Quentin Tarantino, and they think of YouTube, but the truth is that film school is very, very helpful, because it is networking.",

        "I would have been very surprised to hear that a math teacher did not - was not able to get a job, because I think most of us recognize that there is a very high demand in that kind of field right now.",
        "One of the things that I would suggest that our employers are telling us, for example, is that people really need to think about the math and the sciences and technology in the United States.",
        "And I'm putting a little plug in here for that, for those people who are still out there trying to decide what they want to major in, or if their parents out here are thinking about that for their kids for their future, because we are really in a serious situation related to that.",
        "On the side of education, there are jobs for people in education, but it does depend - I mentioned earlier about some of the geographic differences, in terms of where there is growth.",
        "And obviously, a lot of it has to do with population and where there are opportunities for, you know, schools to be located, and that sort of thing.",

        "I'm trying to figure out where in the country there would be a demand with someone who had a degree in Spanish.",
        "Ah, that's a great question, and I think - I'm sure you're aware of the statistics, since you did major in this, that, you know, increasingly, as time goes on and in not too distant future, a very, very large percentage of our population is going to be speaking Spanish, and we're definitely going to need to be having people who can teach Spanish.",
        "You're saying you're not sure that you really want to teach, but where else could you be practicing the language?",
        "Obviously we know, you know, California is an obvious one.",
        "The Southwest, in general, is good location.",
        "But increasingly, you go to any urban center in the United States, in the Midwest, Chicago, New York, Boston, almost any of those places, you're going to see an increasing number of the population that are speaking other languages, Spanish being one of them.",
        "And I think there're certainly opportunities for that.",
        "The other thing I would tell you is, employers are telling us that they truly do value people who have these language skills, because they are operating more in a global marketplace, and they need people to be out there who have these bilingual skills.",
        "So, I would suggest that it isn't just about practicing in a particular limited geographic area as much as it is thinking about the marketplace, and how to utilize those skills in a broader way as well.",
        "OK.",
