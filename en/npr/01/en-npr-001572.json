        "Well, I'm sure it is.",
        "I'm sure that after the, you know, the blockbuster of an event with Southwest Airlines, I'm sure that everybody started to look inward at themselves and looked at their programs.",
        "And also, then, the FAA followed up with their own inspections.",
        "And as they've went through the process of reviewing what had been done, I'm sure they found paperwork that caused them to be concerned, which at that point in time doesn't mean the work wasn't done.",
        "It just means the paperwork was either misfiled or wasn't filled up properly, or there was some other glitch with the paperwork that caused them the concern.",
        "Now, airlines are required to perform safety inspections, no?",
        "That's correct.",
        "And how often?",
        "Well, it depends on the airplane and the frequency.",
        "But basically, they use a series of letter checks.",
        "An A check is essentially the lowest letter check, and that's typically done at roughly 125 hours.",
        "It varies some with flying hours.",
        "It varies some by different airlines.",
        "And then, you go up to through a B check up through a C check, which is a very extensive check requiring quite a bit of time and tear down of the airplane.",
        "And then, the ultimate is the D check, where you actually tear the thing apart into a very high degree.",
        "And these rules, these inspections vary by airline, I assume also, by the age of the aircraft?",
        "Yes, there are age-driven inspections as well that maybe over and above those letter checks.",
        "The airlines like to have those type of inspections fall within the same time frame as the letter checks, but sometimes that just doesn't work and you have to bring the airplane down just to do the aging aircraft inspections.",
        "So engineers, when they're looking for maintenance problems or doing these inspections, they look for cracks, they look for wires that are frayed, that sort of thing?"
