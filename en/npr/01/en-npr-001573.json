        "Hi.",
        "I was wondering about the inspection process where I was in a flight from Oakland to Southern California recently that one of the valves, I believe, on the brakes was inoperable during the pre-flight inspection, and they got clearance through the FAA to fly the flight.",
        "And I'm just wondering what is the criteria, or how important does it have to be for them to not allow the flight?",
        "We were there on the tarmac for about an hour or so, waiting to get the clearance.",
        "John Goglia?",
        "Well, there is a process and it's called the minimum equipment list, where certain items on an airplane are allowed to be dispatched in a non-working state.",
        "And to get an item on that MEL list approved to be on that list is quite a task.",
        "There are standing committees with the manufacturer, the operators, and it is very robust to get something added on to it.",
        "Many of today's airplanes have dual braking systems, not dual brakes, but dual braking systems, so, one brake is being operated by two hydraulic systems.",
        "So if one of them has a valve problem, you can essentially isolate that hydraulic system, the brake will still operate normally on one system.",
        "Megan, I bet it was an interesting landing, though, as people waited to see what happened.",
        "Well, it certainly was.",
        "It had a lot of turbulence and the pilots face was white after we got off the flight, so I just - and it was a Southwest flight, so it just seemed to me that if they're sending something through the FAA, how were they able to get so many inspections not sent on to the FAA?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Interesting point.",
        "John, do you have any answers for her?",
        "Well, first off, they don't send inspections onto the FAA.",
        "The airline is responsible.",
        "The first line of defense and the first person responsible is the airline.",
        "The airline presents to the FAA a process that says this is how we're going to maintain our airplanes, and the FAA approves that process and then they monitor the process to make sure you are following it.",
        "And that's what we are having today, as the FAAs come in to these airlines and said, typically, show me how you're monitoring and controlling your airworthiness directors, ADs.",
        "And they couldn't answer that question to the satisfaction of the FAA, and the FAA's pushed on them to do more.",

        "Thank you, nice to be here.",

        "Well, I think, you know, first of all the inspections of the last several days and the developments of the last couple of weeks will ultimately shift to a bigger problem, which is all of the outsourcing to foreign maintenance bases where there is an adequate FAA oversight or experienced and certified mechanics.",
        "And when that happens, I think passengers are going to become quite concerned and I think it will make abundant sense to have in their hands the kind of information that will allow them to know where their plane was maintained last, or where it is routinely maintained, so that they can vote with their pocket.",
        "So, let's say for example, I'm planning a flight from, well, Washington Reagan Airport to San Francisco - just to pick a place - and I book a flight on - well, just to pick an airline - Alaska Airlines and they say, well, are you going to fly a 747 and what seat would you like, and all that sort of stuff.",

        "That is not out there at that granular level yet, but the idea would be to move toward that so that a passenger could look at, let's say, option A, where the aircraft was maintained in lets say, Indonesia, a suspected al-Qaida stronghold by workers with no training in a non-secured facility that hardly ever gets inspected by the FAA.",
        "Option B might be, the aircraft is maintained here in the United States by mechanics with 18 years of experience, supervised by licensed airline inspectors with abundant FAA-certified inspectors overseeing the program.",
        "And that, you know, it's kind of obvious to me which option they're going to take.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "John Goglia, is there that much of a difference between aircraft that are maintained as Wayne says in, excuse me, as our guest says in Indonesia or as opposed to in Chicago, for example?",

        "And the airlines have that information.",
        "They have the reliability numbers of airplanes that are maintained out of the country, but they don't share that with anybody, they keep it closed.",
        "So we really don't know, but we do know - through anecdotal means - we do know that many of these airplanes coming back from work that's being performed out of its country have considerably more problems, heating problems, if you will, when they come back into the country than airplanes that are maintained by their own company's own facilities.",
