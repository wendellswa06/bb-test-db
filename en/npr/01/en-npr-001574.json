        "Hi, Mike.",
        "You are on the air.",
        "I've been listening this for the past couple of weeks and this is a line of work that I do in the Navy.",
        "It's specifically called non-destructive inspection.",
        "And what we do on military aircraft, magnetic particle inspection, liquid penetrate - even on radiography, if you'll think back to the Challenger crash, that was because radiography wasn't performed, they didn't see a dry-rider(ph) O ring.",
        "I've got a lot of people who are friends of mine who are getting out of the military and they're having a hard time finding a job when it's very, very specialized training and I've seen why - I'm probably pretty sure that's it's not to that extent, but I see now that, you know, airlines aren't hiring them, they're shirking off the responsibility, every airline should have these people in place to do these inspections for them and, it's not happening, and obviously it's not happening because, look what's happening.",
        "Mike, I'm just trying to read between those lines there, are you suggesting that these jobs are being outsourced overseas for people who work for a lot less than American unionized workers might work for and that's why you can't get a job doing this?",
        "No, no, no. Not me.",
        "I'm still in the military.",
        "I'm still employed.",
        "I have a lot of friends who do this very specialized work who are having a hard time finding employment, and I don't see why.",
        "It seems like it's an integral part of the airline business and safety and inspections, and I've heard a lot of conversation about this, and people aren't calm with it.",
        "We are not getting these non-destructive, and by non-destructive, it means that doing inspections and some metallurgy and it's without destroying the part.",
        "And it would detect these fine cracks.",
        "It would detect all of these stress rises and cyclical fatigue and things that happen to aircraft when they're under these stresses being 40,000 feet in the air.",
        "And, you know, there's just no emphasis put on it - I see why there's not.",
        "Now you have this coming two ahead, where if these airlines would have had these people in place in-house, they would have had these inspections done.",
        "We know how to keep record, they know how to keep this data because they have been doing it for 20 years through the military, the military's a big source, but it's very small in the civilian community.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah, I understand.",
        "John Goglia, do you think Mike's got a point?",
        "Well, to the employment side of it, the airlines did ramp up for all the NDT specialties in the late '70s and early '80s, and those people are still in place.",
        "There's full departments that handle all of that.",
        "And once you ramp them up and get them up to your head count and the focus has been always on hiring younger people, so those people are still in place and they probably have another 10 years to run before they retire and before we'll start hiring into those jobs again, big numbers.",
        "So that's the reason why he hasn't seen the hiring.",
        "I see.",
        "But all those non-destructive techniques that he's talking about are routinely used in the commercial aviation business.",
        "Where they fall down most of the time is the record-keeping portion, not on the hangar floor, but after the paper leaves the hangar and gets into the paper mill, if you will.",
        "I don't think people can appreciate the volumes and volumes of paper documents that are generated from aircraft maintenance.",
        "It's huge.",
        "If a piece of paper gets filed with the wrong airplane or the wrong tail number, you will never find it.",
        "And oftentimes, the airlines find themselves in position where they can't show that piece of paper for a task that was accomplished and it's far easier to go out and accomplish the task the second time.",
        "Kevin Mitchell, I just want to bring you back in, we just have a few seconds left, but I know you work with people in corporate travel departments who have to book employees on flights all the time, do they tell you they're worried?"

        "There's a huge gap between what senior management at these corporations perceive to be the process for aircraft maintenance and FAA oversight, a huge gap between that and reality on the ground.",
        "And it's so alarming that I think, you know, we have an unprecedented partnership now between labor and business to look into this issue and to drive for a fundamental legislative reform of the FAA and how it oversees the industry.",

        "Between his graying beard and his wire-framed glasses, a huge smile had spread.",
        "He'd been watching the radar for weeks, and one of those scattered thunderstorms finally stopped over his farm.",

        "I may walk around with this silly grin for a while.",
        "You know, even a hard rain like this, it looks like, wow, this is a drought breaker, but this probably won't even be an inch when it's all said and done.",
        "In fact, he got seven-eighths of an inch in one hour, not bad considering the area's had less than four inches of rain this summer."
