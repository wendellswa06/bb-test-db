        "Then today on MSNBC's \"\"Morning Joe,\"\" Secretary of Education Arne Duncan was asked whether he thinks gay couples should be able to marry.",
        "He replied: Yes, I do.",

        "Advocates point to steadily growing acceptance in public opinion polls.",

        "This is a president who last year decided that the so-called Defense of Marriage Act, which bans same-sex marriage at the federal level, was unconstitutional and would no longer be defended by the United States government against court challenge.",
        "This is a president who has spoken out against amendment efforts such as the one tomorrow in North Carolina, but also in New Hampshire and Maine and Washington State.",
        "And also this is a president who has publicly come out in favor of a bill to repeal the so-called Defense of Marriage Act that's being sponsored by California Senator Dianne Feinstein that would completely repeal DOMA.",
        "So for someone who's evolving, he's pretty much evolved.",
        "The only difference is his words saying I support same-sex marriage, he won't say them.",
        "But the actions that he has taken pretty much say that he does.",
        "Well, yet there are some political reasons why he might not want to.",
        "If you look at the poll results in North Carolina, there are a couple of big groups for whom the president will be relying on votes come November who oppose gay marriage.",
        "They would include Hispanics, and they would include African-Americans.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I understand that.",
        "And that's the luxury of being an opinion writer.",
        "I can say what I think he should do, but I also am mindful of a lot of the calculations that are involved that would, you know, force him and his re-election team to say, you know what, hold back a little bit, particularly in North Carolina, where the last poll I saw had support for Amendment 1 - that would be the amendment to ban same-sex marriage in the Constitution of North Carolina - has 55 percent support.",
        "North Carolina is a swing state, a state that the president won in 2008, and he was the first Democrat to win that state in a very long time.",
        "It's also the state where the president's nominating convention, or re-nominating convention, will be held later this summer.",
        "So there - as you mentioned, there are a lot of constituencies that aren't comfortable or as comfortable as Secretary Duncan, Secretary Shaun Donovan at Housing and Urban Development, or even the vice president with same-sex marriage.",
        "So while I am pushing the president to take a stand, to have his words match his deeds, I certainly understand the reticence.",
        "And you say would ban gay marriage.",
        "That would be its effect.",
        "It in fact would define marriage as between one man and one woman."

        "One thing that I want to point out: North Carolina already, as a matter of state law, bans same-sex marriage.",
        "What Amendment One would do is attach an amendment to the state's constitution.",
        "So this would basically be piling on.",
        "The other thing that this amendment does...",
        "It would make it very, very difficult to undo.",
        "Correct.",
        "But the other thing that this amendment does is that it would make civil unions and domestic partnerships also illegal.",
        "So it goes a lot farther than just a simple constitutional amendment.",
