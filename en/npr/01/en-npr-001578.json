        "Okay, Matthew, thanks very much for that call.",
        "Actually I was wondering, I mean, did you yourself go out and how do you get enough, what kind of sample do you get from the cougar to be able to tell what kind of virus it's got?",
        "It's no different than a pharmaceutical giant whose people are more interested in selling pills, as opposed to truly making patients healthy.",
        "I think we're going to see this in company after company - that their business models aren't exactly tracking to a world where it's all personal.",
        "Prop 8.",
        "And Amendment One here in North Carolina, it's ridiculous.",
        "It's not about anything except love and commitment to another person.",
        "And the fact that if I have someone in my family who is in a committed relationship, and they happen to be gay or lesbian, they are unable to get married or have a civil union.",
        "That, to me, is sad because it's about the respect and the mutuality of the bond between people.",
        "It's very frustrating.",
        "After having lived through it in California, and now we're going through it again now in North Carolina, it's just dumbfounding to me.",
        "Jonathan Capehart, if the president chooses - should this be a political issue?",
        "It's also coming up - and, Kim, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Should this be a political issue to be resolved by the ballot in referenda, by state legislatures, or should it be an issue to be decided by the courts?",
        "Well, look, I think if the courts step in and say to a state that you must honor and respect gay and lesbian relationships because the state legislature won't do it, I am perfectly fine with that.",
        "If a state legislature, the duly elected representatives of a particular state pass a bill and it's sent to the governor's desk, and the governor signs it or doesn't sign it, that is the proper way to go.",
        "But as we saw in New Jersey, where the state legislature signed it, passed the law in both chambers, sent it to Governor Christie and he vetoed it, saying that he thought that this - that the effort should be or the question should be given to the voters through a referendum, quite frankly I think that that is the wrong way to go.",
        "The rights of a minority should not be put up for public referendum.",
        "If that had been the case in the 1950s, in the 1960s, if people in America in general, in the South in particular, were asked to judge whether African-Americans should have the right to vote or the right to equal public accommodation, I don't think that vote would have gone the way we think it would today.",
        "Let's go next to Michael.",
        "Michael is with us from Fayette in Alabama.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "If I give my opinion on President Obama's - oh, how I wish the caller screener last week had allowed me when that wonderful, you know, sociologist and economist about living on...",

        "Personally, I am against homosexual marriage not just because of the first chapter of Book of Romans in the New Testament, but also because they tend to - these marriages tend not to last long enough.",
        "I've read that they tend to have easy, quick divorces, which can be devastating for children which are involved.",
        "However, having said that, we must make homosexual marriage legal, complete with all of the benefits.",
        "Punitive laws will not lead them to Christ.",
        "We got - if we say we love them, we have to prove it by our actions.",
        "And, unfortunately, you're going to hear a vastly different opinion in Christian - let's put it, be honest, Protestant broadcasting.",
        "However, is it wise for...",
        "Not just Protestants, Michael.",
        "There's a few Catholics who are opposed to it as well, but thanks very much for the call.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "Here's an email we have from Mike in Cookeville, Tennessee: We just had a first and very successful Pride in the Park celebration in my middle Tennessee town this past weekend.",
        "It was successful and peaceful beyond anyone's expectations and attended by about 600 people.",
        "Attitudes and times are changing.",
        "As the father of a lesbian, America needs to allow LBGT individuals the pursuit of their own happiness.",
        "And, Jonathan Capehart, that - in terms of changing people's opinion, as people began to understand, as more and more people came out, that this was their family, their friends, their co-workers, attitudes began to change in various places.",
        "Right.",
        "Attitudes began to change.",
        "People started talking more openly.",
        "You can go back as far as the AIDS crisis in the '80s and the '90s when people started coming out and talking about who they are.",
        "You add, on top of that, what was happening culturally in terms of plays, movies, and in particular, television.",
        "Vice President Biden gave a lot of credit to \"\"Will & Grace,\"\" the NBC show that ran from 1998 to 2006 featuring an openly gay male lawyer and his best friend, straight female roommate and then their, you know, hyperly(ph) flamboyant friend Jack, who, through those years of television, were able to, through comedy, teach people about the issues facing and concerning gays and lesbians in America.",
        "And, you know, you can't discount the power of comedy, the power of television and the power of seeing people and learning about people through that lens, which then allows people to have their eyes open more fully and allows friends, neighbors, relatives, co-workers, colleagues be able to talk about these issues more openly.",
        "And you know, the first questioner, Kim, who said she moved from California to North Carolina, that is also playing a part in sort of greater acceptance of gays and lesbians because you have people who are moving from so-called progressive states like New York, California, Northeastern states and moving to places like North Carolina where there are jobs and opportunities, places that...",
        "Just to remind that California did approve Proposition 8.",
        "Well, true.",
        "Well, true.",
        "But remember, Kim, you know, was fighting Proposition 8 in California, and she gets to North Carolina where Amendment One is there.",
        "There are a lot of people like Kim in North Carolina who find Amendment One offensive and appalling and even though this amendment probably, if you believe the polls, will pass tomorrow, it says something that there are a lot of people in North Carolina who are vigorously fighting this effort.",
        "This is not something that's just going to pass easily."
