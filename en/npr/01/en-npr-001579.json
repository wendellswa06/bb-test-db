        "We just chose cougars because we knew this system, this particular virus that infects them.",
        "So that's what led to that, but we're really thinking of testing something that could be applied to a wide range of taxa and to see, basically, provide a new means to test whether they're affected by habitat fragmentations or the reverse; to see, if you implement a habitat corridor, whether it is used by animals.",
