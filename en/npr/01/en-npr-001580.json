        "Yeah, that's a very good question.",
        "The name comes actually, FIV was first found in domestic cats and it does cause a form of feline AIDS in domestic cat species, but in wild cats we see related forms that are specific to individual cat species.",
        "So, there's a cougar FIV, there's an African lion FIV and in those species we don't see disease, so it doesn't seem to cause them any harm.",
        "They probably have (unintelligible) with those viruses for a long period of time.",
        "So, I guess I'm still a little unclear, if the virus is changing clearly, but I mean, all you really know when you look at two different strains of the viruses, well, one's different from another.",
        "So, how do you actually use that to track the animal?",
        "How does the virus change tell you something about where the animal's been?",
        "Well, it doesn't tell us where the individual animal has been but we can look at the distribution of different viral, we don't call them strains, we call them lineages, but it's genetically distinct types of the virus and we can use genetics to distinguish those.",
        "And if we look at the distribution, then individual virus lineages are only found in certain areas, so it's almost like you can tell where a cougar is from by which virus it's infected by.",
        "And given that cougars are really mobile and we know that their movements aren't restricted very much currently, the question was basically why are the viruses not occurring anywhere.",
        "If the cougars move around so much why don't their viruses?",
        "So, we think that this is really related to cougars being rare in the recent past where they probably survived in certain refugea and a lot of the viruses disappeared, they became extinct from a lot of areas, but where the viruses survived they were able to expand again.",
        "And actually we see evidence of this spatial expansion in the virus population that coincides with the period when cougar populations expanded again.",
        "I got it.",
        "Okay, let's take a call now and let's go to Matthew in Washington, D.C.",
        "Matthew, welcome to the program.",
        "Hello.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I was wondering what your, I might have missed this, but I was wondering what your methods for obtaining strains of a virus are and how this is more efficient than just simply tracking the cats themselves?",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah, so we used genetics.",
        "We basically, we sequenced a fairly big part of the virus genome and we use the virus sequences to basically create a family tree of all the cougar viruses we found in the area.",
        "And then within this tree, we found eight groups that we could readily distinguish, and then we looked at the distribution of those groups, but we also used, the tree actually contains a lot of information about what happened to the virus population recently, whether that virus population was increasing or decreasing for example.",
        "So, there is statistical tools available to analyze the genetic data to inform us about things like the dynamics of the virus Yeah, and then we matched it up with the spatial distribution.",
        "Okay.",
        "Now the question about wouldn't that tell us compared to marking the animal itself, those studies exist and of course we can do that.",
        "We could put radio collars on them but you're very limited.",
        "I mean, it's an expensive technique and usually you can only do it in a certain area, because you have to go around and find those animals again with the radio collars.",
        "And so once they leave the area you may not see them again.",
        "There's alternatives, which are GPS collars but those are very expensive and you're even more limited to the number of animals that you can mark.",
        "Yeah, I did not get out in the field myself.",
        "We had a lot of people helping us with this.",
        "We had researchers that had ongoing study projects in Yellowstone and other parts of Montana and south of there.",
        "So we got a lot of samples from live cougars from them and those are usually blood samples."

        "And then we worked also with hunters in Helmsman, so cougars are hunted in Montana and actually the entire area that we sampled.",
        "And so we worked a lot with those people that kill cougars and told them which kinds of samples to collect.",
        "And there's certain types of tissue that we could use and we also gave them a certain type of filter paper that they can basically blot a little blood on.",
        "And then we could analyze the blood for the virus.",
        "Sounds to me a lot safer to sit in a lab than to cozy up to a cougar.",
        "Yeah, I miss that aspect of the work sometimes but actually I did go out in the field with people and that was very exciting.",
        "It is a lot of work, so I really couldn't have done both, I think, so.",
        "Yeah, so do you see any future application for this for wildlife management?",
        "Well, yeah, we definitely think that this could be applied to other cats and that it could be, it's certainly a complimentary tool.",
        "It won't replace any of the tools that we have available but it may be a complimentary tool in to look at issues like habitat fragmentation and connectivity.",
        "But I think that the limiting factor here is really that we know very little about infectious organisms.",
        "And especially those that don't cause disease; we have little reason to look for them right?",
        "So we really have to look harder to find other infectious organisms that we could use in this context.",
        "But I also think the bigger picture here is that we really don't know very much about how viruses and microbes are transmitted, how they are moving through animal populations in the wild.",
        "And that goes beyond just using the virus as a genetic tag as we did in our study.",
        "But if you think of you know those viruses that are actually a public health concern, we're also really interested in how do those viruses spread and how can we learn about the patterns of spread and over what time scale, over what spatial scales does the spread occur.",
        "Yeah, I'm just quickly, do we know how the virus spreads from cougar to cougar?",
        "Yeah, we do and it's important to know that it requires direct contact between cougars.",
        "So we know that mothers can pass it on to the offspring and we also know that they can pass it through contact.",
        "Probably biting, potentially mating but they have to be in close contact.",
        "I mean we all know that you can only transmit HIV for example through exchange of body fluids and it's very similar in cougars.",
        "Dr. Biek thanks very much.",
