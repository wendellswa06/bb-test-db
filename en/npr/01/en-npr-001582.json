        "This fit into a whole pattern of thinking in Enlightenment France that went back for 50 years before that.",

        "And so really, by 1810, all working scientists in Europe believed that the Earth was very, very old, but they still were creationists in the sense that the various species, Cuvier explained, must have been created, because they're so complex and they're so delicately balanced.",

        "He took Lyell's first book with him on his voyage of the Beagle.",
        "And Lyell was also a creationist, but yet a different type: ones who believed that, over time, different species were created in different centers of creation over the world, and then gradually spread out.",
        "So Darwin, when he went to the Galapagos, was actually looking at the Galapagos as possibly a unique center of creation.",
        "And what did he see there that changed his mind or convinced him that evolution was occurring?",
        "Well, he actually didn't notice that at the time, but he made collections because, as Niles commented and as you commented, he went on not as really a trained naturalist--he only had an undergraduate education--he was sent as a collector, really, and he collected quite a few specimens from the Galapagos, as he did from other places where the voyage of the Beagle stopped over its five-year trip.",
        "And then he was stud--it takes a long time in an old sailboat to get back from the Galapagos all the way to England around the Horn of Africa.",
        "And he was looking over his specimens, and what really struck him was that the mockingbirds were different on different islands.",
        "And also, there were quite a few different types of finches, and he wasn't sure if those came from different islands because he hadn't collected them properly.",
        "He hadn't marked them properly.",
        "But if they were, then he simply couldn't believe that these had just been cre--that God would have created all these different similar species in basically the same archipelago.",
        "Rather, he thought, it must have been that a pair of mockingbirds and a pair of finches, or a few of each of the same type, had come there and then evolved to fit on the various islands.",
        "And he had that idea--it's pretty well documented in his diaries--on the last leg of the trip back to England, and that's what made him think that, `If, when I get back, the great--the different specialists in birds'--when they get back--and it happened to be a person named Gould, the great ornithologist of the day who looked over his specimens--`If it turns out that these are, indeed, different species and not just varieties, then they must have evolved.'",

        "The first one was collecting fossils.",
        "Long before he got to the Galapagos, he found extinct forms of armadillos and sloths, and he knew that there were modern armadillos and sloths, of types of organisms that just only occur, basically, in South America.",
        "So he said, `We have this pattern here of extinction and replacement by members of the same group.",
        "What is that all about?",
        "What does that really mean?'",
        "Another extremely important pattern he saw was the replacement--he made it a general replacement, but he actually only had one example.",
        "Two kinds of ostrich-looking things, rheas down there, the greater rhea and the lesser rhea.",
        "And they'd replace each other geographically.",
        "They'd meet in one place.",
        "They don't interbreed.",
        "He saw that they were separate species.",
        "And again, they're all--not found any other place in the world.",
        "And `What is going on here?",
        "Why are there two behaviorally very similar, ecologically very similar organisms replacing each other?'",
        "Then he gets to the Galapagos and, you know, that story's basically right.",
        "He does notice the mockingbirds there.",
        "He actually does see that and he sees--he thought there were four varieties or species there, and he also then heard from the governor of the Galapagos that anybody who lives in the Galapagos can tell you what island produced what shell.",
        "He showed him the shell of a tortoise.",
        "And that was very interesting.",
        "So that's right.",
        "We have that document in the exhibition, where he writes in his ornithological notes--he talks about the tortoises.",
        "He talks about the mockingbirds.",
        "And, indeed, that was still while he was on the Beagle.",

        "When he finally told the botanist Joseph Hooker--we have that letter--in 1844, he said it was like confessing a murder.",
        "That's how seriously he thought he would be, in effect, punished if this got out, what he was really thinking.",
        "He was really that fearful of the reaction.",
