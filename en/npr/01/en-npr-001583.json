        "What's a five-letter synonym of wrath?",
        "Darwin had always planned to publish his ideas.",
        "What he was doing during those 20 years was he was trying to get it right.",
        "He was trying to, as we'd say today, dot every I and dot every J and cross every T, because this idea had been being discussed throughout the scientific community in Europe for 50 years, and the proponents of evolution had simply been savaged because they didn't have a mechanism.",
        "Linnaeus was savaged, so were a whole series of scientists--Lemarque--after that when they'd suggest evolution.",
        "And Darwin wanted to get it right.",
        "He didn't want to suffer the attacks of Richard Chambers, which was a very traumatic experience in the 1840s in England.",
        "And so he kept searching, studying barnacles, studying coral reefs--I mean, all these different aspects--studying pigeon breeding in England--to pull all these ideas together into one long argument, as he said, that would be persuasive.",
        "Well, he probably would have kept doing that for another decade when another great scientist, Alfred Russell Wallace, who was a collector and already a committed evolutionist, a published evolutionist--he was a naturalist who went around the world collecting specimens and also writing papers.",
        "And while he was over in what's now Indonesia--in fact, during the height of a malarial fever in a native's hut over there--he had a breakthrough, and a brilliant breakthrough, that Malphus' idea of struggle for survival, struggle for existence--that there's not enough food to go around and that only the fittest will survive--that that, indeed, could be the mechanism that explains evolution.",
        "So he wrote up a beautiful paper explaining his idea, and then he had to send it off.",
        "And he knew Darwin was thinking about evolution; sort of offhand he knew that.",
        "And he admired Darwin's other writings, and so he sent it to Darwin and said, `What do you think about this?",
        "What do you think about this?",
        "And if you think it has merit, pass it on to Charles Lyell and see if you can get it published.'",
        "Well, Darwin read it in 1858 and was just floored.",
        "His--he had been pre-empted.",
        "He had been scooped.",
        "Somebody else had come up with his idea before he'd published.",
        "So he took his earlier writings about it, the essays that he'd pulled together about it and the articles, the stori--the accounts he'd written to friends, and gave those and Wallace's letter to Charles Lyell and said, `What should I do?",
        "And Lyell and Hooker got together, and they said, `We'll publish them jointly.",
        "And those were published in 1858, and then immediately Darwin took all of his notes for this grand book he was writing and put them together, because the idea was now out: evolution by natural selection.",
        "That's what makes Darwin special, that idea of natural selection.",
        "And then he publishes it in that--in his book, his famous book, on \"\"The Origin of Species\"\" in 1859.",
        "Interesting.",
        "1 (800) 989-8255 is our number.",
        "If you're a regular listener to this program, you know we talk a lot about this latest creationist challenge to evolution and natural selection called intelligent design theory.",
        "And the proponents of ID say that the Earth's creatures are too complex to have arisen through evolution and natural selection, so they must have been designed by someone or something--God, aliens, you take your choice, because they don't say what it is.",
        "And the intelligent design camp has been successful in getting their message to the public, so successful that, according to my next guest, increasing numbers of visitors to science museums are asking about intelligent design, and museum volunteers are sometimes getting caught up in heated conversations pitting science and religion.",
        "And Warren Allmon has come up with a solution.",
        "He's the director of the Paleontological Research Institution and the Museum of the Earth in Ithaca, New York.",
        "He's also an associate professor of geology and biology at Cornell University.",
        "And he's put together a program to train museum staff and volunteers on how to talk to visitors about evolution.",
        "Thanks for talking with us today, Dr. Allmon."

        "Well, I'm not sure that it's a new problem, and I don't know--if it is, I don't know how big it is.",
        "And it might not be accurate to call it a problem.",
        "Museums are all about being there for people who walk in.",
        "Most people don't come into museums to learn things; they come in to be entertained.",
        "And it's also self-paced learning and it's self-motivated learning.",
        "And so museums have to be prepared for all kinds of things.",
        "And I'm sure the Darwin exhibit is a terrific example of that.",
        "And so people come in with all kinds of questions that--maybe they've been thinking deeply about them and maybe they've been thinking hardly at all about them.",
        "And now, since intelligent design is so much in the news, more people are coming into natural history museums with more questions and, inevitably, some of those are on the challenging side of the spectrum.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Right.",
        "...here in Ithaca, and we--and most of them do not have formal science training, so we put this little guide together at their request to help them have the information at their fingertips so that they can answer these questions.",
        "And the questions are coming more numerously now than they did, say, before the Harrisburg trial started this summer or before the Kansas situation erupted, and so we wanted to give our docents just more information so that they'd be better equipped.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, that's what I was meaning before when I said there was a problem; the problem being how do you explain it to the people who are coming in, who are asking these questions?",

        "And right now, since it's in the news, lots of people come in, they bring clippings or they bring questions; `I just heard it on the news,' that kind of thing.",
        "And we do have a permanent exhibit about evolution in the museum and every exhibit is somehow connected to evolution.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I--and these days, science teachers in elementary schools are so ill-equipped to teach science, you would hope that they might have a place they could take their kids for a day trip or something to actually get some facts on the issues.",
        "And that's exactly the idea, and then to do so in a non-threatening way and a respectful way, if they do feel challenged by it, but to also be an authoritative source of information if they're looking for information.",

        "Would it be an interesting idea to just supply this to any teacher who needs it?",
