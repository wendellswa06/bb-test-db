        "He just shoves the problem back down further to the molecular and the ultrasmall level.",

        "He was a great botanist at Harvard.",
        "He was one of the four people that Darwin had shared his ideas with before it was published.",
        "And Asa Gray was an evangelical Christian, Trinitarian Christian--which was unusual at Harvard at that time, and he remained so to the end of his life, and he remained close with Darwin.",
        "So--and he was pulling Darwin one way; you had T.H.",
        "Huxley pulling him another way.",
        "You had Lyell and Wallace who remained very spiritual and religious in their own way, and of course, they were deeply involved in debating evolution.",
