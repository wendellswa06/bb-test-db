        "I am a geology major so I know that in the sciences that you have to take chemistry and physics and biology is definitely part of it, and part of the key fundamental theories of science, not theories but actual facts of science, are evolution.",
        "And I'm curious, and you touched on it a few moments ago, that what is it going to take to get the theory of evolution to be confirmed into law, and you also touched on Einstein.",
        "I'm just curious--is there a hesitancy or just some reason why we are so adverse to making laws of nature nowadays.",
        "Well, nobody disputes in science that evolution in fact is a fact if you define evolution, which is the general way of doing it, that all organisms on the face of the Earth are descended from a single common ancestor in remote geological time.",
        "And so everybody agrees that life has evolved; it is a fact, it is a law, if you will, in that sense.",
        "But as evolutiona--theory pertains basically to how does evolution happen, and it's a growing, ongoing body of knowledge that's not entirely settled.",
        "I mean, I'm still engaged in some arguments with some of my colleagues about precisely how the evolutionary process works, so it's a theory in that sense.",
        "But it's not a dirty word to call something a theory; it's a body of really intense and hard-fought and hard-won knowledge about the world.",
        "Ed Larson, add anything to that?",
        "I agree with Niles in the sense that when scientists use the term `theory' they mean a tested naturalistic explanation that's gone through a whole body of work and when we talk about a theory in this case, what scientists are talking about is not the theory of evolution really, it's the theory of evolution by natural selection.",
        "As Niles stresses, it's the process, it's the mechanism that remains a theory.",
        "Niles, with Stephen Jay Gould, have contributed to those ideas; there's new ideas coming in about mutation.",
        "And there's new ideas coming through about gene flows, so it's a very dynamic area.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that part's a theory.",
        "What would be a fact that most scientists would maintain and Ernst Meyer was a good expositor of this idea, that common descent--that's what people talk about as a fact.",
        "You know what I find interesting is that in everyday life usage, everybody calls it a theory of evolu--when we talk about the bird flu, everybody will say, `Well, if and when it evolves into something that can affect human beings..."

        "Mmm.",
        "Well, I--may take is that...",
        "...people will believe what they want to believe is really what it is.",

        "That is the only objection I have, and I object to it because we need better science education in this country, not worse.",
        "We need an informed electorate and of course we need to crank out more scientists if we're going to stay number one.",
        "And I'm not so sure if people have been getting this for years because from my work as an historian in this area, I think there are many places in America that--many school districts, many schools that have never taught evolution.",
