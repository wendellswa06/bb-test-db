        "I'm sorry.",

        "If Darwin had--uses his voyage on the Beagle and to the Galopagos to look at the finches and the other things, what did Wallace do?",
        "Did Wallace never...",
        "Wallace set out in I think it was 1848 with Bates--correct me if I'm wrong--and--to collect.",
        "Right.",
        "He was not a wealthy person like Darwin was, so he was making a living as a collector.",
        "But the thinking is that he was already convinced of evolution as was Bates; didn't know about natural selection."

        "He went out to test one of the great ideas--he thought he could prove evolution if he could show that closely related species lived right next to, right on the fringe, like adaptive radiation, right on the fringe of old populations.",
        "Yeah, OK.",
        "And so he went out to the most remote places of South America and Indonesia to look for new species right on the fringes of orders(ph), and then he continued to do that throughout his very long life.",
        "He lived into the 1900s and he continued writing and he became very significant as a biogeographer.",
        "Well, you say he didn't believe in natural selection.",
        "Well, no, he didn't know about it.",
        "Well, and then what he did is he did not know how evolution worked and he knew that was the problem.",
        "Everyone knew the problem with evolution was no mechanism.",
        "And then when he had that brilliant moment of insight in Indonesia just as Darwin had that moment of insight--similar insight--both thinking of Malthus and then they become convinced that natural selection could do it.",
        "It was a separate discovery, and that's one of the convincing things about it, that two people could come up with the idea independently.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "There's two morales there.",
        "If you have a good idea publish it, and secondly, if there's any value to the idea, it means somebody else will come up with it, absolutely.",

        "Who would you say would be the great protege?",
        "I mean, Huxley barreled on.",
        "I think all the young people were convinced of evolution.",

        "Not all organisms that are born can possibly survive and reproduce; there's just too many organisms born each generation.",
        "And that was the big `a-ha' because Darwin thought that just enough were born to replace the parents, but there's far more born.",
        "And so the ones that are best suited will tend to be the ones that reproduce and they will pass those advantageous variations on to the next generation.",
        "Environment changes and you're going to get a different look to the population.",
        "Right.",

        "Darwin did.",
        "He had it for 20 years, didn't really tell anybody much, and then Wallace came up with it and everything broke loose.",
        "You agree, Ed?",
        "Sure.",
        "That was the way it worked.",
        "People were thinking about evolution but before you could become a plausible mechanism, there were so many arguments on the other side that without a plausible mechanism, people wouldn't switch over.",
        "But once that mechanism was offered, it was like a dam bursting.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's remarkable how quickly the acceptance of evolution swept through the scientific community, and it did so for a variety of reasons.",
        "For most people, it just simply--most scientists it made more sense than the alternative, and further, it offered them new questions, new ways of looking at nature and new ways, then, to exploit nature--that is, you could take these evolutionary mechanisms and apply them and use them and that's what science is all about really, down at the bottom level.",
        "Science is how we exploit nature.",
        "So Darwin's book was a bit hit when it came out."
