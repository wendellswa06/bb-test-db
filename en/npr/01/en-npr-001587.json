        "Wow.",
        "Couldn't keep up with the printing.",
        "It sold out that first day, as Niles said.",
        "Everybody was waiting for it because the idea had been thrown out a year before with those joint published papers by Wallace and Darwin.",
        "It was reviewed.",
        "It wasn't just reviewed in science journals.",
        "It was reviewed next day in The London Times, in all the popular media.",
        "There were cartoons about it in Punch and the other British magazines.",
        "Immediately copies were spirited over to the United States immediately for publication here.",
        "It was a major cultural as well as a scientific event.",
        "Well--yeah.",
        "Was there advanced buzz on it that it was coming?",
        "I mean, the publishers...",
        "Certainly.",
        "People...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...because the basic idea had been sketched out in Wallace's beautifully written paper and also Darwin's old papers that were published by the Linnaeus Society of London a year before--that's when the idea was announced--so everybody knew it was coming, and Darwin then scrambled that year to pull together all the pieces of what was going to be his grand book into this--what he called his short book.",
        "It's not very short, and it's a beautifully written book.",
        "So people knew it was coming.",
        "Advance copies had gone out.",
        "Reviewers had advance copies.",
        "It was arranged just like any other literary release.",
        "It's hard to remember--it's important to remember that Darwin at the time was already very well-known and a popular writer because his \"\"Voyage of the Beagle\"\" was a best-seller.",
        "It was a very popular book.",
        "So this would be like a book coming out by a Stephen Jay Gould or an E.O.",
        "Wilson or Richard Dawkins, a writer and a scientist who was known and whose words were being waited for.",
        "Now especially it was popular because evolution was such a titillating idea.",
        "It had been around, people had been debating it, and now here was coming a book that a already respected, leading member of society, sort of a culturally acceptable scientist, was putting it altogether, so people were waiting for this and you could have read the review the next day.",
        "Just like a new \"\"Harry Potter\"\" book coming out...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...you could review it on the front page of The Times the next day."

        "He was one of the most senior members of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad's regime, which has recently come under increasing international scrutiny following the assassination of a former Lebanese prime minister.",
        "Kenaan's death comes less than two weeks before the release of the UN's investigative report on that assassination and just hours after a radio interview in which Kenaan denied allegations of corruption and bribery.",
        "Joining us now to talk about his death is Rami Khouri, editor at large for The Daily Star, a Lebanon-based newspaper, also an internationally syndicated columnist based in Beirut.",

        "And, Rami, nice to talk to you again.",

        "But in this particular situation, the centrality of this fellow, Ghazi Kenaan, and his role in the security services has dom--his role in running the Syrian intelligence in Lebanon for almost 20 years--he's been a central character in Syria's role in Lebanon and Syria's dominance and control of the system in Lebanon.",
        "So for him to suddenly commit suicide raises huge questions.",
        "In either case, if he really committed suicide or if somebody killed him and just said it was a suicide, it's bad news for the Syrians.",
        "If the Syrian government was involved in the assassination of Rafik al-Hariri, was this man involved?",
        "Well, he worked with Hariri for many years and the Syrian security system in Lebanon was extremely in control of almost all aspects of Lebanese political and economic life.",
        "And Kenaan worked with Hariri for many years and much of the success of Lebanon's rebirth after the war is--part of that success obviously has to be given to the Syrian role, but the Syrians just spent too many years.",
        "They stayed 15 years longer than they should have and therefore the Lebanese wanted them out and got them out.",
        "But Kenaan worked with Hariri, and there's a lot of skepticism about whether he would be directly involved in a plot to kill Hariri.",
        "This is one of the theories that is going around.",
        "And we'll know in a couple of days when the UN report next week or in about 10 days comes out, the Dakhlallah report investigating the Hariri murder, because the investigators talked to Syrian officials including him.",
        "Well, President Assad has said of course that Syria has had no role and of course if any Syrian official was involved, they were renegades and traitors.",

        "Oh, I don't know.",

        "You may argue with the science of when something's happening or why or even whether it's happening, but to just dismiss it because you know it's not right, or you have a political agenda that says it's not right, that really is intellectually dishonest and dangerous.",
        "And I think in this country, we're going unfortunately - while the rest of the world is focusing on teaching kids science and math and the skills for the new world, in parts of this country we're not teaching science anymore because the issue is intelligent design or creationalism or, you know, I mean, and even science teachers today are under attack.",

        "There's an old hospital, we're moving the patients out.",
        "We've built a new hospital.",
        "It's a valuable piece of land but not for everybody, and creating a competition and offering it to a university.",

        "They were the right ones to win it.",
        "They were so far better than anybody else in terms of coming up with a proposal that fit the needs of the city.",
        "Without even asking, they said, well, of course we're going to train 200 science and math teachers in the public school system every year.",
        "Of course we're going to train 10,000 kids.",
        "Of course we're going to have a venture capital fund.",

        "So they're big in biosciences.",
        "The competition had some schools that were big in the social media.",
