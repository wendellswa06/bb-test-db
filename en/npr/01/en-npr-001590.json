        "Also a suicide bombing in Kaam(ph), a rebellious city near the Syrian border, destroying a police station.",
        "And many more bodies were also found, as they are almost every day, shot execution style, some showing signs of torture.",
        "Peter, every interim, provisional, temporary government to date has put security at the top of its agenda and there's been almost no discernible effect.",
        "Does this government, with its four-year term, really have something new to offer to solve the problem?",
        "Well, we're not going to find out right away, unfortunately for some.",
        "If today's address by Mr. Maliki is any indication, he's going to take a month to unveil his detailed program of governance.",
        "That's on top of this five-month delay we've just had.",
        "Obviously, his first week will be taken up trying to get permanent seats, permanent people in the defense and interior ministry seats.",
        "He's trying to avoid people with close ties to sectarian or ethnic militias and then we will see if he's serious about trying to integrate those militias into other jobs.",
        "What about priorities beyond security?"
