        "April, the mom, can imagine what that feels like.",
        "She says at times staying in Parkland felt suffocating.",

        "So you put on this facade that you're OK, you're strong, you're going to get through this.",

        "You do feel like that.",

        "And what made the hard days even worse was learning about all the things that went wrong leading up to the shooting.",
        "The warnings to the FBI tip line about specific threats the shooter had made.",
        "Tips that fell through the cracks.",
        "The long chain of security failures at the school and the flawed response by law enforcement once the shooting started.",
        "The more the Schentrups learned, the angrier they got.",
        "And do you find that there are some people who just say, you know, I don't want to take a government handout?",
        "Anger?",
        "Well, you know, it means that if they want to call a spade a spade, that they certainly can.",
        "You know, it's almost a cliche for media organizations to say that what they do is that they connect the dots, and they help readers or listeners make sense of the world.",
        "To me, though, it's not fair to say that that's true in every case, except when it comes to racism.",
        "When it comes to racism, we're just going to find the dots, put the dots out there, and you can go ahead and make sense of them on your own.",
        "Mike Oreskes, what's your direction to your staff on this?",
        "The great thing - the great thing about guarantee of an independent press is we can be independent from each other.",
        "And I don't think every journalism organization has to have the same rules, but I think our rules are really quite clear.",
        "And what they're based on is actually our bond with the audience.",
        "The more intense and the more angry and the more name-calling politics become, I think the more careful we have to be to not sound the same.",
        "So even if you believe, as I take it Ben Smith at BuzzFeed believes, that Donald Trump is a mendacious liar, even if all the facts could somehow be garnered to defend that, I still think that's a characterization that's for the audience to decide.",
        "Because why?",
        "Because our job is to be open to as many different kinds of listeners and readers as we possibly can reach.",
        "And the more you sound like you're calling someone a name, the less people will listen to you."

        "I want everybody to be listening to us.",

        "Yeah, and I actually - I disagree.",
        "I believe that - in fact, our moral role in society is to provide as much information as many people as is possible.",
        "To that end, Susan Glasser, I wanted to go back to something that you said earlier about the sense of what most people believe.",
        "Why is this so hard for people?",
        "Is it because we really don't agree on what racism is or because we really don't agree on what's outside the boundaries of appropriate public discourse?",
        "Well, look, I think actually the public polls suggest that that's not the case.",
        "And you should remember that when you see a poll that says that 30 or 36 percent nationally support Donald Trump, that's 36 percent of a potential Republican primary electorate, which is by no means a majority, even of a minority party in this country.",
        "So that's very important.",
        "Ryan, I'm going to do this 'cause there has been the suggestion by some - I would say - progressives that there be sort of a media fast around Donald Trump because his campaign is essentially fueled by attention.",
        "What do you think about that?",
        "I think that he's tapping into something that does exist out there.",
        "And he would be getting some of that support whether or not the media was giving him all this free air time or not, but these are not exactly normal times.",
        "The kind of Tea Party that was unleashed in 2010 has now kind of gotten out of the control of the GOP establishment, and Donald Trump is running away with it.",
        "And so in extraordinary times like this, it is, I think, the obligation of a free media to speak out."

        "Us moving him from one vertical to another, stunningly, you know, did not prevent his rise.",
        "Had the entire media landscape done the exact same thing, perhaps we wouldn't be where we are today with a major party leading candidate who has already called Mexicans rapists saying that Muslims should be blocked from coming into the country.",
        "Where we go from here isn't clear.",
        "One misconception, I think, needs to be taken on is all of this is a sign of the weakness of the media, not the strength of the media.",
        "The media didn't create the Trump phenomenon, and the media won't stop the Trump phenomenon.",
        "Because - why do you say that - it's about the weakness of the media, not the strength?",
        "The weakness of the media - you see this all across the board - that the pressure on media to speak out more, to be more noticeable, to be louder, to put editorials on the front page - it's not a sign of the strength and commitment of the media.",
        "It's a sign of how hard it has become to get traction.",

        "We are looking at a political environment in 2016 where we're dealing with a very fragmented society.",
