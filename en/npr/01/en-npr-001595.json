        "This includes shooting at suspects as they ran away, even when they presented no immediate threat and using excessive force against children.",
        "The report also finds that excessive force was concentrated in black and Latino communities with a police officer being 10 times more likely to use force against someone who is black compared to a white suspect.",

        "St. Augustine's will remain open for mass on Sunday with a rotating roster of priests, but there'll be no more baptisms, weddings, or funerals that the church's Treme neighborhood is so accustomed to.",
        "In the interim, parishioners continue to resist the scheduled merger of their parish, and each service is treasured as if it's the last.",
