        "It's - it consists of that closed area which has been evaluated on a daily basis to make sure that if oil was present, the area was closed in a precautionary way.",

        "But are you finding that on your part and on NOAA's part, that perhaps some additional outreach or PR, for lack of a better word, will be necessary to convince folks, like the gentleman that we just heard, that what we're telling you is really true?",
        "I think that both FDA and NOAA have recognized that getting the information out, communicating that in a consistent and continual way is very important, because for people to understand that we have this program in place -yes, it's been a big event and people are concerned, but we need to continually communicate the actions that the U.S.",

        "And we also even have the enforcement side of it to make sure that - checking boats as they come in, that they have not been in the oiled area.",

        "And one portion off of Florida that never had any real appreciable oiling, if any at all, has been reopened and that was about 26,000 square miles.",
        "And then we will be working in smaller areas than that to reopen, as we go forward, based on, as I mentioned, the - how long oil had not been there, the degree of oiling that occurred in that area during the entire spill, and then any likelihood that it could be re-oiled.",
        "And we will work our way through that in a precautionary way to ensure that all the sea - that when we do reopen, that we're very confident that the seafood is very, very safe.",

        "When the media, which was, you know, a lot of TV media took this, and when EPA couldn't answer questions and NOAA wasn't speaking to the media, you created this perception that there was no testing being done.",
