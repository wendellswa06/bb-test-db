        "In 2008, researchers excavating in a cave in Siberia found a tiny, human finger bone, and they probably think it's probably a child's pinkie, about 40,000 -40,000 years old.",
        "And writing this week in the journal Nature, a team of researchers reports that it's analyzed the DNA found in the finger, and they analyzed the mitochondrial DNA, that's the kind that can trace maternal relationships through the years.",
        "And what they found, really, was a surprise.",
        "They found that the finger bone, the DNA in it, indicates that the ancestors of that hominid did not come out of African with Homo erectus, the predecessors of modern humans; and also, it didn't come from Neanderthals.",
        "In fact, the DNA evidence suggests that this hominid may represent a whole separate branch of the human family tree.",
        "And joining me now to talk about it, help put this find in context, is Ian Tattersall.",
        "He is curator of anthropology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, and author of several books, including \"\"The Fossil Trail: How We Know What We Think We Know About Human Evolution.\"\" Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Tattersall.",
        "Thank you.",
        "How significant is this finding?",
        "Give us a perspective on what it does.",
        "Well, this really a wonderful find, although I think what I describe it as is more unexpected than as being really surprising.",
        "Okay.",
        "Unexpected because this - it comes from Siberia, southern Siberia, which is a part of the world that's very poorly known from the point of view of archeology and the search for early hominids - but not really surprising, because we already know that there were multiple lineages of hominids living in various parts of the old world during the ice ages, when this was found.",
        "And so what does this do?",
        "Does it say that there might have been lots of different human-like species living at the same time in different parts of the world?",
        "It does indeed.",
        "It reinforces the very strong signal we've been getting from the fossil record that the evolutionary history of humans has been sort of one of experimentation, of producing multiple species that succeeded or failed in the ecological arena, rather than a single, slow progression from primitiveness to perfection."

        "And so what we're saying here, if I hear you correctly, and what the article is saying is that whatever group this hominid of hominid that this finger belongs to seems to have migrated out of Africa at a different time than Homo erectus or Neanderthal.",
        "Yeah, I think that is certainly the implication of the age that they've derived for the split-point between this hominid and the one that led to us.",
        "And the fact that it was living in Siberia, does that mean it had to really put up with some terribly cold weather?",
        "Well, it did.",
        "I mean, it was living not that long before the peak of the last ice age, and it would have been, you know, a fairly marginal environment for any hominids; although our own ancestors, by about 20,000 years ago, when the environment was coldest, had actually got all the way up to the Arctic Circle.",

        "Is that really, is one bone enough to change our views and say there's possibly a new species, or do we have to wait for a few more bones to be discovered?",
        "Well, I think the signal that they're getting from the genome, the mitochondrial genome of this individual, seems to be pretty clear.",
        "Whether it's a new species that we don't know about is another question because we only have genomes from Neanderthals and from ourselves, modern Homo sapiens.",
        "We don't have them yet from any other hominid that we know, but we do know a lot of fossil hominids.",
        "So it's possible that this finger bone, which is not really by itself diagnostic to any particular species, might actually belong to a species or at least a group that we already know in the fossil record.",
        "Oh, because we have no other DNA to compare it to?",
        "That's exactly right, yes.",
