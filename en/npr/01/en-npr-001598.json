        "And the difference is that child I suspect?",
        "The child, and also I'm not as proud as I was in my 20s.",
        "Though was it a difficult decision when you thought about it?",
        "No, no, because of the child.",
        "It's good for my family.",
        "We're able to eat nutritious food that we wouldn't be able to afford otherwise, and I just want to give my son a heads-up.",
        "And the other - there's no sense of stigma attached to it anymore?",
        "No, I'm not ashamed of it at all.",
        "All right, and as you go ahead, do you have any advice for those who might be concerned that, well, people are going to notice this?"

        "It has.",
        "You know, to give you a sense of it, the food stamps have been rising since the early 2000s, but then even rising faster since the great recession in 2008.",
        "And there's a lot of economic and policy forces at work here, which we should get to.",
        "But just to give you a sense of the growth first, so there's been a lot of talk about the growth in the last few years focusing on just the last few, you know, focusing on the last few years.",
        "I think it's helpful to get a longer perspective.",
        "In 1975, eight percent of all Americans received government-paid food assistance.",
        "Up through the '90s, that level hovered between about eight percent and 11 percent.",
        "Then in the '90s there was a really steep decline, down to about six percent.",
        "But starting in the early 2000s, it steadily started to increase, food stamp use, then it really started to spike in about 2008, right when the great recession kicked in.",
        "And now food stamp use is up to unprecedented levels.",
        "Almost 15 percent of Americans are on SNAP, or about one in seven people.",
        "Now you talked about both policy and economic reasons.",
        "The economy, it's been bad.",
        "Right, exactly, and that's what had some people scratching their heads a little bit recently because now, you know, in the last few years, the economy has kind of started to improve, and unemployment is starting to decline, and yet the growth in food stamp use doesn't seem to be yet.",
        "And so there's a lot of pontificating and trying to figure out exactly why that - why those things aren't sort of going in line right now.",
        "And the policy reasons?"

        "Right now, Siberian oil fields are in decline, and an increasing part of the Russian budget, federal budget, is dependent on oil revenues.",
        "So it's kind of also in a place that it needs Western expertise if it wants to get access to more oil, and thus more federal revenues.",

        "Vladimir Putin, the prime minister, makes this announcement, not President Dmitry Medvedev.",
        "There's a presidential election next year.",
        "Are politics at play here, that Putin comes out and makes a big deal of this?",
        "Well, I think Putin's already - has been seen as the man ultimately in charge, not Dmitry Medvedev.",
        "He was also the man to give the blessing to the original oil deal between Rosneft and BP in January.",
        "When that fell through, it made everybody look bad, including Vladimir Putin.",

        "On Sunday, the union's House of Delegates voted to continue the weeklong strike until they have more time to read the outline on of a tentative agreement.",
        "That vote was a setback for union President Karen Lewis and her bargaining team.",

        "But he still wasn't sure what he's supposed to reject or endorse.",
        "We got our information late Monday night on what was in the contract and it was only a small part, 'cause the contract is still not being written.",

        "No is it ever going to be?",
        "No, but I feel like we have to, at this point, sort of appreciate what we've gotten and hope for the best.",
        "Sears says her confidence in union President Karen Lewis though is not as strong as it once was.",
        "And Sears wonders was Lewis tough enough in negotiating a fair contract.",
        "And what will she do if the union's 800 voting delegates turn down the latest proposal and remain on strike?",
        "All I can do is just trust that she's looking out for our best interests.",
        "Until now, few teachers have suggested that Lewis has not done enough.",
        "But as public support for the strike slowly fades, some teachers wonder whether she's the best person to take on a much tougher task once the strike is settled; turning, what they call, a politically polarized school system, dominated by politicians and corporate interests into a system that respects teachers."
