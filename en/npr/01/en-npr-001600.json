        "A lot of people appreciate, though, but appreciate it, well, that's really good for other people.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "And until we came to a point where we had to make the decision that we needed to go down and go through the steps to apply and utilize the program, you know, it didn't really set in just how important it really is.",
        "It was - it's an incredible program, and we feel extremely fortunate that we were able to utilize it.",
        "It was for about six months.",
        "We're small business owners, and we started our business in about 2009.",

        "And I wanted to add this email in, this from Sam(ph) in Illinois: When I ran for state Senate in Illinois in 1986, I advocated the Senate taking action to encourage people to be eligible for food stamps, get on them.",
        "The reasoning was: one, it brings more money to Illinois, stimulates our economy; two, Illinois sends more tax dollars to Washington than it gets back in benefits, this would help right that imbalance.",

        "The states pay for half of the administration costs, but of course the bulk of the money goes into actually paying for the benefits.",
        "And so meanwhile you have states who are trying different ways of recruiting more people to use them because they don't want this stuff to go unused.",
        "It also is useful for states because it actually brings federal money as a sort of economic stimulus to grocery stores and to farmers who are making more food.",
        "So there's a bit of a kind of - I don't know if conflict of interest is the right word, but on the - states have a lot of incentive to be increasing the number of people on food stamps.",
        "Meanwhile, they don't have to pay for a lot of the pain that that puts on - sort of on our budget.",

        "OK.",
        "Now for some health news.",
        "Right, and actually there's a lot of legislation in the works that is looking at different ways of cutting the costs to SNAP, and that has a lot of food security and sort of, you know, hunger advocates very worried.",
        "There are a couple - the Farm Bill is about to be marked up in both the House and the Senate, probably in - early next month.",
        "And both versions, at least last we heard, were looking at cuts anywhere from a few billion to several tens of billions of dollars in cuts.",
