        "Washington Post reporter Eli Saslow recently profiled Dillie Nerios, a benefits coordinator for the Treasure Coast Food Bank in Fort Pierce, Florida.",
        "One of Dillie's jobs is to make sure those in need in her region know that help is available and know how to get it.",
        "Dillie Nerios joins us now from member station WKCS in Fort Pierce.",
        "Nice to have you on TALK OF THE NATION today.",
        "Yes, hi, Neal, thanks for having me.",
        "And as you do your outreach, Dillie, what do you find?",
        "Do most people who are eligible for SNAP even know that they are?",
        "Well, some people that I approach, most of them feel like - well, they're not sure.",
        "We - it's on a, you know, case by case, and most of them when I first approach them aren't necessarily sure.",
        "But when we start talking a little bit about their income and their expenses, it can become pretty clear that they really should be on the program.",
        "And that Washington Post story had a really interesting account of your outreach toward the elder community, people who are - we talked about a greater percentage of those eligible now applying for food stamps, but in fact in the elderly community it's - most of those who are eligible do not apply.",
        "And you've got an interesting approach.",
        "Can you describe it?",
        "Well, I've always had a connection to that population, and so back in 2010 the Treasure Cove Food Bank, who is a partner, of course, with Feeding America, started this mobile outreach program, and that's to go out within - throughout our four-county area, with the help of our partner agencies, our food pantries, to go out and reach the areas that are underserved and those who don't - who come to the pantries.",
        "So in doing so, then I can go to the pantry, spend some time while their hours of operation are - when they're open, and speak to the people that come through the lines.",
        "And this is how I have found that there is a lot of seniors that'll take the time to come through, you know, a food line, a food pantry line, but they won't connect to the food stamps.",
        "That's exactly what they say.",
        "They say no, no, that belongs to the poor people, or that - you know, I get a check.",
        "I think a lot of them believe that because they get a Social Security check, they won't qualify, and that's not true.",
        "So - and again, it's all on a one - a case by case, and that's what we strive to do is to talk to everybody that walks through the line during the pantry hours that, you know, when they're open."

        "Yeah, I graduated college in 2011, and I - I mean I grew up in a middle-class family, and I worked on Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, but when I graduated from college, I had student loan debt, and I was unable to find a job that could really - so pretty much at the end of the month I didn't have enough money to really buy good, nutritious food.",
        "And so last April I looked at the SNAP application and was really considering it.",

        "I couldn't believe that I was in this position, and - but I knew that it was something that I needed to.",
        "But ironically I applied for a job with the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, and I got a job working with food insecurity and helping people apply for SNAP.",
        "And because of that, I didn't have to myself go on SNAP, but every day I see people that struggle just like I did.",
        "And it's not something that is just for people that are poor.",
        "It's for anybody, really, that is struggling with a financial situation that just needs help and assistance.",

        "Yeah, yeah.",

        "So we have four SNAPmobiles that travel around the state, and Arkansas is a very hungry place.",
        "A lot of people struggle with food insecurity.",
        "A lot of people - like she was talking about, the elderly, they think that - because like she said - they're getting a Social Security check, so they're getting money or that that if for some reason they take SNAP, that other people aren't going to get it, which just isn't true."

        "It's overcoming those barriers and the stigma and the lies that people believe about SNAP.",

        "I wonder if I could ask you: As a younger person, well, if people like you, just out of college, if they're unable to find a job, well, this is a government program.",

        "Yeah, I mean, it - thankfully I grew up with the awareness of food stamps and SNAP.",
        "And I mean it wasn't very hard for me to figure out how to apply for SNAP, but I'm sure there are people that - I mean I know that there are people that really do have a challenge with that.",
        "So yeah, and especially we see in Arkansas people that have come to the country illegally, they are in desperate need of SNAP, or even if they are citizens here, they feel (unintelligible) go into a government office to apply for SNAP, or they don't know how to read, the application is a real challenge for them.",
        "So I'm thankful that where I live, that people influenced me to go apply for SNAP, And it still wasn't something that was an easy decision to do.",
        "There was a lot of stigma there, and I just had to get over it and accept that it was an OK thing, and it was something I really needed.",

        "So they're afraid of computers, or they're - they just - they have no knowledge of computers, and so they don't really get the exposure.",
        "But this is why it's so good to have the - to partner with our agencies, where you can go and meet these folks - again, one on one - and speak to them and open up that avenue for them and make it easy.",
        "So we get these clients, and I'll schedule myself out there, go out there, and then I'll ask them to bring, you know, the appropriate documents, and then we'll sit down and do their application.",
        "The most wonderful part of this is when they come back to you with their EBT card, which makes it so much easier now - it's much more dignified than the old coupon - to activate them.",
