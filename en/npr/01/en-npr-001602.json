        "And of course, it's four million years old and represents a very early stage in the history of the human family.",
        "This specimen, being only about 40,000 years old, plus or minus, represents a much more recent relative of ours, and it's very it's very tantalizing because it's distinct from Homo sapiens, and yet, clearly, it's not in the region today.",
        "The same thing happened in Europe where the Neanderthals, Homo sapiens comes in right around that time, 40,000 years ago, and pretty soon, the Neanderthals are gone.",
