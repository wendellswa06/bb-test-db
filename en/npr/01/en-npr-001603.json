        "Richard, if the Recording Industry of America offered you this deal, would you take it?",

        "I strongly doubt that I was on any kind of industry radar, just because the volumes that I was downloading were so, so small.",
        "It was really an occasional song or two a week, but it was a scare nonetheless when the school said, look, we know what you're doing and we've been contacted by the industry and we advise you to stop.",
        "Did you stop?",
        "Yeah, I guess I did stop because of the, because of the scare.",
        "Nicole Williams, if they said to you we have your email address, it was downloaded to your computer, we want to make an example of people like you, so we'll settle for, say, $1500, wouldn't you take that?",
        "I don't have $1500 to do anything, let alone to give to the RIAA for something this sort of frivolous.",
        "It doesn't seem frivolous to them though.",
        "I've looked at their figures on CD sales over the last year, and you know, they are down.",
        "Now it's true, their figures for digital sales are hugely up, but there's a lot of money on - in CDs that they think they're not getting.",
        "Right.",
        "And I mean I understand that their sales are down, but I kind of look at it as the fault of the industry.",
        "Because when this whole digital downloading option was coming out, instead of sort of jumping on the bandwagon with it and taking the right steps to make it very feasible, easy, and fair for the consumer to download music and pay for it and pay a price that the consumer believes to be reasonable, they just sort of took this authoritarian stance.",
        "So really the digital revolution just sort of took off without them and they missed it."

        "Well, what if you were in live music and were selling your performances and then people were giving them away and, and you didn't get the revenue for that?",
        "I think that there are things that you can do about it to curb it, but I don't think that suing a bunch of college students is necessarily the way to go, because it's a really bad PR move and it's just isolating an entire generation of people who theoretically will be buying music for the rest of their lives.",
        "I bet that the last thing they want to do is actually sue a bunch of college students, except that they say these are the people who are doing it.",
