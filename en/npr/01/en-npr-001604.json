        "Hey, how you doing?",
        "1-800-989-8255 if our number, if you'd like to play along with us, and I'll read one or two if I can get the time for it of 65 more short mysteries, and maybe you can answer the question or solve the mystery of how somebody knew that.",
        "And I like the way the book has always been set up.",
        "You have the mystery on one page, and then you turn over the leaf, and you see the answer to the mystery on the next page.",
        "E.",
        "YODER: Yes, we tried to do that so there's kind of an immediate reward, especially for children, rather than for example putting all the answers in the back of the book and making them fish around for them.",
        "We find that kids like to read several in sequence, and just having them page after page like that I think really encourages them to keep reading.",
        "Natalie, as you say, when we first met you back in 2009, you were in high school.",
        "And now you're off at college.",

        "I'm studying communications and political science.",
        "But I am taking writing-intensive classes, and in the future I would like to do writing for PR or marketing.",
        "So this has definitely helped.",

        "OK.",

        "You say you're selling a lot of them.",
        "But do you know if they're being received in high schools or middle schools?",
        "Are kids being introduced to them through classes in schools at all?",
        "E.",
        "YODER: Yes, we've heard from many, many teachers both directly and through comments sent to the publisher that teachers like to use them to reinforce what they're teaching in the classroom.",
        "Sometimes they use them as homework assignments, sometimes as warm-up assignments during the class period or as maybe extra-credit assignments."

        "We're ready.",
        "OK, here it goes: Ivan's father had bought a new smoke detector six months earlier, putting each one of them on each level of their house, one in the laundry room downstairs, one in the sunroom on the main level, one in the upstairs hall between the bedrooms.",
        "The smoke detectors sent wireless signals to an alarm system.",
        "Ivan's father had asked him to replace the batteries and looked surprise when Ivan brought the smoke detectors to him, where he was working at his tool bench in the garage; that was where they kept the fresh batteries.",
        "You didn't have to take them off their bases, his father said.",
        "You could have just taken the new batteries, opened each smoke detector where it was and switched the batteries there.",
        "Sorry, I guess I didn't understand what you meant, Ivan said.",
        "Can't we just change them here?",
        "Well, to do that sure, but we have to put each smoke detector back in the same place, or the alarm system won't work right, his father said.",
        "They're - and they're all the same except that the color of one is more faded than the others, and one has dark spots.",
        "At least that tells us what we need to know, doesn't it, Ivan asked?",
        "And so I guess the question is: How do they know where to put them back?",
        "Dante and Erica, where do they know how to put them, or which one goes to where?",
        "Any answers to that?"

        "The second book, of course, was stories based on more mathematical principles, and of course this one is science again.",
