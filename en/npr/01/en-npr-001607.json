        "We were in the BMI Musical Theater workshop and the final assignment the first year is a 10-minute musical.",

        "So from the first days of these public performances people were coming up and talking about their personal stories.",
        "So, certainly we didn't see it happening on this level, especially with a story like this.",

        "Hmm.",
        "Well I think that without giving too much away, I think that the ending is not necessarily a fully happy ending in the tradition of Broadway musicals.",
        "As my mom says, hymns doesn't go home to hymn's mama.",
        "But the ending is what we actually had wanted it to be from the beginning, which is an ending that is true to the sort of destructive nature of these diseases.",
        "And of the fact that a family dynamic sometimes can't overcome them but at the same time also true to the thought that if we open up our lives and look at these issues in the light of day and take them head on, there is an opportunity to begin the heal.",
        "And I think - I hope that's what the ending of our show says.",
        "What were - what did you think, Tom, what were some of the biggest challenges in creating a musical about such a serious subject?",
        "Well, certainly the subject matter and getting the show exactly right because we don't want to create a show that people find so heavy and emotional that they wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people or, if they look back on the experience, they didn't necessarily feel positive about it."

        "It's interesting because there are two doctors, two MDs in the program.",
        "There's a Dr. Madden, who's a psychopharmacologist, and the - Diana, the character, stops seeing him because she doesn't want to take the meds that make her feel numb, and Dr. Fine is a psychotherapist.",
        "You had to walk a fine line between the distinction between the two.",
        "What was your motivation in adding two different doctors here?",
        "Well, there were originally actually more doctors in the program because we spent more time exploring the different treatments that Diana attempts.",
        "And over the course of sort of the story evolving, we realized that it was much more about her experience of the illness and how it impacted her family.",
        "So we ended up spending more time with her family than we did with her doctors.",
        "We decided to have two because we felt that we wanted to, as you do, you start a story at the latest possible moment.",
        "So we wanted to start the story at a moment where she had been stable and had been relatively healthy, you know, give or take, for a number of years.",
        "And oftentimes the experience of being relatively stable comes once a psychopharmacologist or a psychiatrist has been able to balance a cocktail of psychotropic drugs.",
        "And so that's where we found her.",
        "And then as the show sort of opens, a number of things occur to her, and she realizes that with that stability for those years has come a certain kind of numbness that she would like to get rid of.",
        "Alice Ripley, the actress who plays Diana, won a Tony Award for her portrayal.",
        "How much work did she have to do to get this character right?",
        "I think she did a tremendous amount of work.",
        "Certainly having seen the show, you know how much music is in the show and how many places Diana's character goes just in terms of the composition of the score.",
        "So I think that Alice had to really do a lot of work just to get the piece in her physically.",
        "And then on top of that, I think she did a lot of research, a lot of reading, you know, and she has said that she really took to this character right away, and it was something that she wanted to explore and bring out in herself.",
        "One of the things I think has helped Alice tremendously, and certainly helps Tom and I in developing the show, is that people do want to tell us their stories.",
        "And so there is not only sort of an ability to really come into contact with many different people in different kinds of ways of having this illness in your life but also really sort of understanding at a deep level what it is.",
        "And I think that, you know, Alice has worked so incredibly hard and such a deserving Tony.",
        "And also, you know, she, as were Tom and I, was guided by Michael Greif, who was our director, and also did a tremendous amount of research and really took pains to get the details of the experience right.",
        "All right, we're going to take a break, come back and talk lots more with Brian Yorkey and Tom Kitt, who are a terrific writing team.",
