        "And then when I heard the song clip, it was very, very heart-wrenching.",
        "And I guess I'm just sort of wondering, is this the kind of thing that is sort of recommended, would you consider it sort of a therapeutic thing for somebody that's been involved in it to go see, or is it something they should maybe stay away from?",
        "I guess that's sort of what I'm wondering.",
        "Okay, good question.",
        "I think that - that is a good question, and I think that our experience has been, by and large, it's very therapeutic.",

        "We just got a letter today from a 17-year-old girl who has been severely depressed and has a few other mental illnesses and had been hospitalized with suicidal ideation and discovered the recording of \"\"Next to Normal\"\" and found it a tremendous source of solace and hope.",

        "And we said to them, the civilians in this play may make some bad decisions.",

        "And I think that's the eternal struggle of prescribing medication that does work but the dilemma that people have to have of saying, my God, I need something because I can't be without it.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "How much, as writers of the play, did you have to decide you were going to make medication the good guy or the bad guy here?",
        "That's an excellent question.",
        "You know, we went through many different sort of attempts at writing, for instance, one of the early numbers of the show, which is called \"\"My Psychopharmacologist and I,\"\" because we very much wanted to write a woman who decided to go off her psychotropic drugs, which is a decision many people in our life had made.",
        "And we wanted to explore what happened when that happened, but at the same time, we wanted to do it without in any way trying to be an anti-medication screed because I think Tom and I both feel very strongly, as do, I think, all of us working on the show, that medication is essential for many, many, many patients with bipolar and other mental illnesses.",
        "And so it was a tough line to walk, and I think in this case, as in all others, we tried to have the show present both sides as clearly as possible and to make very clear that the choices being made were the choices of these specific characters in this story and not necessarily meant to be sort blanket statements in any way.",

        "It seems that - I mean, we had one evening where there were a number of doctors in the audience, and we had a talk-back afterwards.",
        "And the response was really positive, and I think that, you know, a lot of doctors have been like that second caller, who are glad that these issues are out, that some of that taboo is being taken away, that they're not being sensationalized and that a true, emotional story about these issues is being told.",

        "And that was the case at Second Stage, when we were off-Broadway, as well.",
        "And I think certainly, a large part of that is the brilliant work of our design team, led by Michael Greif, because if you see the show more than once, you catch different things.",
        "There's all - it's so multi-layered in terms of the visual that seeing it again I think is a different experience, but I think also people get - like we've talked about, they're very into the subject matter and the emotions of the piece, and they want to experience it again.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And then that person next to that other person says something, and you all realize that this is something that is more universal than you thought.",
