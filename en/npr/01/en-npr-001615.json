        "He was onstage, trying out new endings for La Boheme.",

        "So it's very rough, still, but that's what we're working on at the moment.",
        "I asked Jim Bryant how he felt about the Positive Opera Company as a permanent addition to culture on Cape Cod.",
        "Well, I think it's quite a challenge.",
        "As you know, we've only produced children's opera up until now.",
        "So tackling some of the powerhouses of the grand opera world is really quite a daunting thing.",
        "But it's very invigorating at the same time.",
        "It's a very big challenge.",
        "But Hamilton has just been so wonderfully optimistic and enthusiastic about the whole project that it really is infectious to all of us who are involved in it, and of course we're very grateful to have the funding that we have.",

        "He joined a club team that practiced and played 11 months out of the year.",
        "All right, appreciate it.",
        "Yeah, that's true, and I think part of my motivation for this is, you know, we all come to this world, and we're offered a few religious stories to choose from, and they're all extremely basic and too simple to really be meaningful.",
        "And one of the concepts that pervades all these stories is that you're either good or bad, that there is Heaven or a Hell, and in fact, humans are much more complicated than that.",
        "And so, I think, if you can't tell which of these are Heaven or Hell, I think that's great; it means I've done my job correctly, because everything is somewhere between."

        "I mean, there are a lot of religions that will talked about that, that we're one with God, but it's not really religious - I mean, in your version, God doesn't even know we exist.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Right, that's the left turn that this story takes, is since God doesn't know we exist, as we pass microbes from our fingertips to a salt shaker and so on, these are statistical fluctuations that he can't understand.",
        "He can't understand why some of his congregants are disappearing and ending up in other places, and He decides He has no control over parts of the universe.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, let me ask you, what got you started thinking about the afterlife and wanting to write about it like this in the first place?"

        "I've spent my life in science.",
        "I'm a scientist, and that's what I do.",
        "What's interesting to me is that the tools of science only extends so far, and then beyond that there are plenty of things we just don't know the answer to, and in our brief twinkling of a 21st-century lifetime, we probably won't know the answer to them.",
        "What's always struck me is strange is that people walk around with such religious certainty, and they feel like the story that their parents and their community has taught them is - has to be true and that everyone else's religion is patently untrue and false.",
        "And I feel like what the scientific temperament teaches you is a certain tolerance for holding multiple hypotheses in your head at the same time.",
        "And so, I've always liked the idea of saying, I have no idea what this is all about; I've no idea what's next.",
        "And the point of this book is really not to make any serious proposal about an afterlife, but to shine the flashlight around the possibility space and to say, you know, there are so many more stories about what's happening out there than anybody's talking about.",
        "and now that we know so much about DNA and biology and computers and quarks and black holes and everything else, why isn't this part of the lexicon that we're using when we talk about what we're doing here?",

        "No.",
        "In some sense, they're all making fun of concepts that are embedded in religion, but I do want to say, it's not meant to be an anti-religious book.",
        "And so far, the religious groups that have read this have really loved it, and what they've said is, it stretches you mentally and spiritually, and I think that's sort of the best outcome I could have hoped for from this book, is just to allow people to think outside of the bounds where they normally are thinking.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I was wondering, too, as a scientist, you know, many scientists don't believe in God at all.",
        "You know, there's a sort of a strong atheist movement going on right now, particularly strong among scientists.",
        "But you do not partake of that.",
        "Well, it's an interesting - it depends on what we mean by that.",
        "So, I used to be an atheist when I was a teenager, probably like many teenagers.",
        "But I realized in retrospect, it was really - my drive for it was just getting people to try to think outside of what they had been taught.",
        "And what happened from spending a life in science is that I decided I couldn't exactly be an atheist anymore, just in the sense that what you learn is the vastness of your ignorance; you learn in the life of science, everything about what we don't know.",
        "And so, I sort of feel like you walk to the end of the pier of science and what lies beyond that is everything else.",
        "And so, what exists in that space beyond the pier is a lot of possibility, and what we do every day in science is we have multiple hypothesis that we hold in our heads at the same time, and that ambiguity is accepted as part of the enormity of the mysteries that we face, And these are the terms of the agreement we have with Mother Nature.",
        "So, in that sense, I call myself a possibilian(ph): I'm open to a lot of ideas that we don't have any way of testing right now.",
        "OK, what is a possibilian?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "A possibilian is somebody who is into the possibilities, who thinks that it's silly to commit to any particular story.",
        "And my colleagues, Dawkins and Dennett and Hitchens and Harris, have done a great job of going through and showing that it's pretty easy to poke holes in somebody's particular religious structure, and in fact, these are stories that were written by people thousands of years ago who didn't have access to DNA and biology and computers and didn't even have access to other cultures nearby.",
        "And so, it's sort of no surprise that those stories end up being a little bit small-thinking when you compare them to the - to everything we now know in science."
