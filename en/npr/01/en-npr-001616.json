        "Hello.",
        "Good morning - I mean, good afternoon.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "I think this book is a really - a good exercise for a lot of people, because I - me, for myself, I tend to be atheist, but I - in the end, I think the only reason that a religion or any belief is valid is because people believe it and that person believes it.",
        "And I think this is a way of telling - of helping people to realize, regardless of where you're at, that their belief is really not that much more valid than the others and that would go a long way at stopping the injustices based on religion, because I think it only happens because people think they're so right.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for your call, Richard.",
        "Is that a part of what you're trying to get across here?",
        "Yes, that's exactly right, and I really appreciate that comment.",
        "Dawkins points this out in his book, \"\"The God Delusion;\"\" he points out how funny it is that people will believe their own religion so strongly, and when they look at someone else's, they think, oh, well, that's patently absurd that somebody could believe that.",
        "So, he says, you already know what it's like to be an atheist, because - just think about how you look at other people's religions, and then, you know, see if you can include your own in that.",
        "And I think it's really important because people tend to be quite inflexible about their views, and the problem is, they're the ones voting and determining your children's education and so on, and if nothing else, it is a useful exercise for people to realize that they live in a community that has a varied set of religious beliefs.",
        "I'd like to ask you a little bit about the writing in this book because you have these different notions of what an afterlife is, and as you said, you don't really mean them to be that serious, but they're pretty interesting.",
        "In one, you know, God's not in charge of the afterlife; a committee is, a bureaucracy is.",
        "You know, in another, it's - you're in a dream, but you're in the background of the dream.",
        "So, where did you begin?",
        "Did you like - did you, like, think, OK, a dream, and then go from there?",
        "I mean, how did you even come up with these little conceptions you have?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Good question.",
        "There are 40 stories and each of them sort of had its own genesis that came about a different way, but I just wanted - sometimes it was a way of addressing a particular concern, for example, what I mentioned earlier, about how Heaven and Hell are sort of silly in their categorization.",
        "But in other ways, I was exploring from the point of view of a scientist ways that we just might be able to think about these things in a different way.",
        "So, for example, in one of the stories, God is a species of dimwitted creatures that builds us to be able to answer the questions that they couldn't.",
        "And in another one, we are mobile rovers that are built by a species of cartographers, planetary cartographers, and our job is to use our legs to walk around the planet and turn our compact lenses of our eyes onto things and suck up planetary data.",
        "And they're disappointed because all we do is clump together and look at each other, things like that.",
        "So, with all the stories, there are different ways of exploring ideas, ways of exploring how you might actually incorporate science into a religion.",
        "Again, I mean, all these stories are not meant to be taken as serious proposals, but what is serious is the exercise of looking at many different possibilities.",
        "All right, let's take a call from Michael.",
        "He's calling from Richmond, Indiana."

        "Doing very well.",
        "Hello.",
        "Thanks for joining us.",
        "Hey, I chanced on this discussion and was quite intrigued, wanted to posit a (unintelligible) - one of the foundations of all religions is that God is greater than our experience, and yet it seems like the author here is guilty of the position that he put in the story excerpted in \"\"Microbe\"\" of reducing this being greater than ourselves into something that we should understand, when most religions under - posit that God is beyond our understanding.",
        "So, I'm wondering how you would respond to that.",
        "It turns out that not all of the stories take on the point of view that He's less great.",
        "One of the stories is called \"\"Giantess,\"\" and it turns out that we come to understand God as being essentially the cosmos, and there's a planet that tries to communicate with her by sending signals.",
        "We're essentially atoms in her body.",
        "And so, this planet tries to communicate with her by sending signals, and it takes millennia for those signals to reach her consciousness.",
        "And what happens is a shower or meteors rains down and destroys the planet, and nobody is sure whether that was just an immune-system response on her part or she was scratching an itch or she was unaware of it entirely.",
        "And what they realize is that meaning varies by spatial scale in that we don't have anything interesting that we could say to her because our spatial scales are so different.",
        "It would be like if you tried to read Shakespeare to a bacterium; it would have no meaning to it.",
        "So, not all of the stories have to do with God being lesser, some, they're greater, but it's all about the sort of unexplored possibilities of the consequences of that.",
        "Michael, I have to say, this is a book you've got to read to understand it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I guess.",
        "I guess, I - my question is, taking that infinite concept and just putting it into concepts that humans have experience with seems to be a limiting factor in the discussion of God, and you know...",
        "All right, that's interesting.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "Thank you for - let me hear you respond to that.",
        "That's an interesting point he's making, which is that you're limiting the possibility of God.",
        "I mean, you, who are saying everything is possible, are limiting the possibility of what God is.",
        "Is that - it seems to me what Michael is saying."

        "Well, maybe I'll need to write 40 more stories.",
        "But I think there's no limitations in this book.",
        "The idea is - I actually wrote 76 stories, and I narrowed it down to the 40 that gave a mental stretch in all of the optimal directions, so that in the end, you've really expanded the landscape of how to think about God and the stories that you grew up on and what that would mean.",
        "And none of these should bear...",
        "And also...",
        "None of these bear much relation to the stories you've grown up on, right?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I would have to say...",
        "Well, that's exactly - I mean, that's exactly the point, right?",
        "They're all - they take nuggets of what we grew up on and it stretches them in very different ways and explores, OK, well, what if that really did happen?",
        "What if you really did end up in Heaven with a toga and angels strumming harps?",
        "It would be awful.",
        "You'd be stuck there for eternity.",
        "And the people to your left are playing bridge, and there's nothing much to do and - so, the idea is to take these and expand then just a little bit further than we've thought about.",
        "The last thing I'll mention, by the way, in answer to that comment is most religions also do their best to try to personify a god, and so, there's nothing unique about, sort, of trying to understand it in human terms.",

        "Good afternoon.",

        "But you know, I look at - and the afterlife for me as a Christian is - who is a little bit set up with religion nowadays - is that life is really a series of questions and how we answer those questions on why we're here and then, you know, the next question, of course, being what's our afterlife going to be.",
        "And I think, every - even Christians, if you really nailed them down, would tell you different versions of what they expect the afterlife to really be like for them.",
        "So, maybe this series of rooms, or maybe you're an artist or maybe, yeah, you carry on something you really love into another life, you know?",
        "And who we perceive God to be, I think if you ask each person, each Christian, what they expect God to be, they'd give you a whole different - they'd be painting a different picture.",
        "So, this is very intriguing, and yes, to me it's a possibility.",
        "So, whether you're atheist or Christian, I think everybody's got a multitude of answers.",
