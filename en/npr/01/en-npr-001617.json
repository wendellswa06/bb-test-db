        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "I think if you surveyed all the Christians, you would get a varied size of the response.",
        "So, this tries to take it even further, much further than anything that could even fit into a traditional structure, but I really appreciate your call.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's take a call now from Jeri, and Jeri is calling from Chico, California.",
        "Hi, Jeri",
        "Hi, thank you for taking my call.",
        "I was raised as a Catholic, and at some point, I was trying to prove to somebody that Jesus Christ was God; went on to study philosophy; I'm now an agnostic.",
        "And I think that the big thing is that when you're taught in religion, you're taught truth: This is the truth.",
        "And there's a big difference between truth and beliefs.",
        "And what his questions are - the things he's doing, he's showing us that these are beliefs.",
        "And when you - you have to really recognize the difference between truth and belief.",
        "Does that make sense to you, David?",
        "I'm totally onboard with that.",
        "I think that's the perfect description.",
        "Thank you, Jeri.",
        "All right.",

        "And here is an email from Audrey from Arizona.",
        "She's saying, my question for the author is, while it's understandable to want to consider the different possible afterlives, isn't it important to have unity in life?",
        "Even if you are intellectually capable of thinking about the alternatives, should we choose one to believe in for the sake of giving our lives a purpose?",
        "And that's really what religion is about, I think, don't you think?",
        "I mean, organized religion, I mean, I think they would argue that you have to have a belief in one thing because it does help organize your life and it does give your life some kind of meaning and purpose.",
        "Well, maybe that's true.",
        "There are a lot of motivations for organized religions beyond what would be best for the individual constituents, but I would say it sort of depends on the person whether you want to commit or not.",
        "As I said, spending a life in science teaches you a real comfort with being able to not commit to a particular story if there is no reason to privilege it over any other story.",
        "And so, when you look at the world's religions - I mean, I've talked to plenty of people who say, OK, well, if my religion, it turns out, is the best for the following three reasons - and several ones got their own stories they tell, but in fact, we don't have any evidence that weighs in to say which story is better than another.",
        "And when you really look at it, there are hundreds of thousands of new, better stories that you can make up on top of that.",
        "So, for my own temperament, I'm perfectly happy and comfortable to keep all the hypotheses in my head at the same time without committing to one.",
        "Well, what is the most surprising idea that you thought about - when you think about endless possibilities, what's the most surprising idea you yourself have ever come up with or thought about?"

        "I don't remember money being...",
        "Well, not directly, but in one of them you find that the afterlife is essentially suburbia and you're living there and you have neighbors and you have a job, and you come to realize that all of the good people - all of the saints and Samaritans and so on - those people aren't there; only the sinners are there in the afterlife.",
        "And you start wondering why only the bad people are rewarded of life after death.",
        "And it turns out that God himself is - we're created in his image, and he is always trying to figure out how best to spend his time, and it turns out that time is drowning him because he's been around for eons.",
        "And so, those he dislikes, the sinners, are condemned to immortality.",
        "They're condemned to live with him throughout the time.",
        "And so, the answer to your question is if you're a sinner then you still have to deal with money.",

        "What people often mean when they agnostic is they mean, I don't really know whether the guy with the beard on the cloud exists or doesn't exist, and to me, that's sort of a milquetoast philosophical position.",
