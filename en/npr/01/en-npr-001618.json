        "It's basically a type of magnet resistance effect that has been a very contribute -a very important contribution to the storage capacities of computers.",
        "So one analogy that I'll try to paint here is to say it's like a little bit like Polaroid filters for light that if you cross Polaroids, you don't get the light passing through.",
        "While this effect has been exploited by manufacturers of hard disc drives, which are used in iPods, and essentially, it's giving consumers benefits, maybe with having faster boot-up times, a more capacity for storage, and then other applications that the GMR is created is a thing called magnetic random access memory.",
