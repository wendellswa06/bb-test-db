        "And when we talk about these errors, how big or how large are we talking about?",
        "The vast majority of them are very small.",
        "We didn't regard spelling mistakes as errors.",
        "However, if someone's name was misspelled, like an important person in the context of the article, just about qualified as an error.",
        "Some of them are very simple errors about dates.",
        "However, in a few cases, just a handful of cases, there were sort of more significant conceptuaries where it was clear that they didn't really understand what it was that they were describing and they'd sort of missed the whole point of, say, how a field-effect transistor works.",
        "So the upshot is that the error rate for Wikipedia is not that much different than Encyclopedia Britannica.",
        "Were you surprised by that?",
        "I was.",
        "I must admit I expected Wikipedia to have more errors than Encyclopedia Britannica.",
        "What I found more surprising was just how many of these sorts of very tiny errors were found across both encyclopedias 'cause you don't really expect them, particularly not in Britannica, which, like I said, is regarded as the gold standard",
        "So is this good news for Wikipedia or bad news for Encyclopedia Britannica?",
        "Well, I don't think you should be seeing this bad news necessarily for either of them because, obviously, both strive for quality.",
        "But I think it is particularly good news for Wikipedia because it shows that their model of doing things, where anybody can contribute to this freely available encyclopedia--that model is working.",
        "It's not producing complete garbage; it's producing something which is--you know, it's in the same ballpark at least as Encyclopedia Britannica.",
        "Mark Peplow, you work for an esteemed scientific journal.",
        "Would you recommend consulting these encyclopedias on scientific topics?",
        "I think they're both a good place to go for a first look at a topic.",
        "I don't think I'd ever regard any encyclopedia as sort of gospel truth on anything, but they're a really good place to go for a sort of first look at any scientific subject to get your head around it, really.",

        "But Jack was as adamant as a 10-year-old can be.",

        "He published a paper in the \"\"Journal of Sports Health\"\" examining the impact of early, specialized training.",
        "And if you look at all sports, there is - two types of sports which specializing early leads to greater success later.",
        "Gymnastics and diving, he says, because you have to compete before becoming fully mature.",

        "And there's a silver lining.",
