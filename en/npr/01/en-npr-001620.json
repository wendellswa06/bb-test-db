        "Bush then spent time talking about new technologies that can be used along the border, like surveillance drones and infrared cameras to monitor illegal activity.",
        "He said there's also a problem when it comes to non-Mexican immigrants.",
        "Mexicans crossing the border illegally can be sent home immediately in most cases, but because of a shortage of space at detention centers, Mr. Bush said, four of five non-Mexicans detained on the border are given a court date and let go, and most never show up for their hearing.",
        "The president called this practice catch-and-release, and he said it must end.",
        "But he also touted what his administration has already done to beef up Border Patrol.",

        "I just signed a bill last month that will enable us to add another thousand Border Patrol agents.",

        "These are the kinds of statistics Mr. Bush is hoping can win over some of his traditional allies so they support his temporary worker program, which he finally spoke about at the end of this speech.",
        "(Soundbite of speech)",
        "This program would create a legal way to match willing foreign workers with willing American employers to fill jobs that Americans will not do.",
        "Workers would be able to register for legal status for a fixed period of time and then be required to go home.",
        "This program would help meet the demands of a growing economy, and it would allow honest workers to provide for their families while respecting the law.",
        "Before finishing, though, the president made sure to give his critics some more of what they wanted to hear.",

        "There were three networks and TV was called the tube because the screen was lit by a huge cathode ray tube.",
        "Then in 1968 a sleek new invention was revealed - we now see it every day on our cell phones, our iPods, even those impossibly skinny TVs bolted to living room walls.",

        "Well, it was flat, it was simply two pieces of glass with some liquid crystal material between them.",
        "And we demonstrated that with relatively low voltages - and by relatively low I mean something in the ten-volt range -we could essentially change the imagery on the display or control the imagery on the display.",
        "And that was quite an event because cathode ray tubes required thousands of volts.",
        "How does the LCD work as opposed to a cathode ray tube?",
        "Well, liquid crystals, that name confuses people.",
        "In many respects they're like a liquid, that is they fill the shape of the container that they're in but on the other hand unlike other liquids, the molecules tend to align.",
        "And if you apply a voltage to them they align almost perfectly.",
        "And in that alignment process you can see visible effects of the changes and those changes that were driven by low voltages were essentially the basis upon which a display was made possible.",
        "And it doesn't need a cabinet the size of a dresser drawers.",
        "No, it really doesn't.",
        "And it doesn't need high voltage and a lot of power.",
        "So, it really is a very, very flexible technology and you can see that by the diversity of applications that have emerged over the years.",
        "Um-hum.",
        "Did you ever imagine back then, George Heilmeier, that your invention, the LCD screen, would just be everywhere a few decades later?"
