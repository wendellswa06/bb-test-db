        "It enters into its final dive next September.",
        "That dive will end with a deliberate crash into Saturn that will destroy the spacecraft.",
        "During its many years in space, the Cassini has sent back some spectacular photos, most recently a picture of Earth.",

        "So Mayor Emanuel raised an awful lot of money.",
        "Chicago's own president of the United States came to campaign for him just before voting.",
        "How did he fall short?",
        "Part of it was that in four years, there are some voters who believe he was tone deaf, too arrogant, too bossy, not collaborative.",
        "But you're right - he raised $30 million over the last four years.",
        "The president came in and gave him what everyone called a bro hug, and all of the newspapers endorsed him, including The Chicago Defender..."

        "Would there be any reason or any scientific basis for him to think that HGH would help his elbow heal faster?",
        "I'm not sure there's a scientific basis.",
        "There is certainly a theoretical basis.",
        "And that is the issue of growth hormone being a tissue promoting hormone, and so you are anabolic or laying down tissue and also anti-catabolic, that word catabolic means tissue breakdown.",
        "So you are preventing tissue breakdown and promoting tissue healing.",
        "It makes sense to me that one might do that, there are clearly no data that show that, and to use it for only two days absolutely doesn't make sense.",
        "This would be probably week's worth that would help promote healing if that's what it did.",
