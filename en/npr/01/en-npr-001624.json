        "Yeah, I did.",
        "And it was more so like the young lady was saying.",
        "I was in a relationship with a woman that I really loved, but I was, you know, a younger guy.",
        "She was really into church and she wanted - we had sex, but she was really conflicted about it and she wanted to get married.",
        "Well, of course, you know, being a young guy at the time, I said anything I could, you know, just to have sex with her.",
        "And we broke up, and I realized that that sister was probably the best thing that ever happened to me at that time.",
        "And so, in order to prove myself to her to get her back, I started to going to church.",
        "I'm a Christian; I believe in Christ.",
        "I began to realize that I needed to be in the church in the first place, regardless of a relationship.",
        "Then I really started looking at, you know, preserving myself.",
        "Because when you look at several relationships, a lot of men and women don't know how to be friends first.",
        "You become attracted, you give yourself physically.",
        "In the end, if things happen, people don't understand the spiritual soul ties that you have to a person.",
        "So I made the decision that the next woman I was going to have sex with was going to be my wife, because I'm single, never been married, don't have any children.",
        "And I want to be married.",
        "I want to have children.",
        "And the gift that I want to give my wife is to let her know, for the last 12 years, you have been the only woman that I have had sex with.",

        "You have to learn how to communicate.",
        "You're going to have to have a sense of humor.",
        "So I think as a man - and then for sisters, any man that really can curb his sexual appetite is really a man that can be focused to achieve a lot.",
        "But that's not necessarily saying people who can't do it are bad people.",
        "That's just not the case.",
        "You have to look at what you want.",
        "And what I want is to be married to a mighty woman of God.",
        "And in that relationship, because I've been in maybe two relationships, it gets tough.",
        "And so, sometimes you have to break up your relationship because a person really doesn't want to go that way.",
        "But pretty much, for me, it was just wanting to be married and not having sex with a woman not knowing if she was going to be my wife.",

        "But it sounds like this is also a campaign.",

        "And are you doing this for anyone?",
        "I mean, are you doing this just for yourself?",
        "Are you doing this for God?",
        "Are you doing this for the community?",
        "Why are you making a point?",
        "I mean, 12 years is a long time to go without what most people consider, or many people consider, a typical form of intimacy?",
        "Well, the first thing is I go across the country and I talk to young people in singles groups.",
        "(Unintelligible) young people about, you know, waiting and focusing on their education.",
        "But you have a myriad of young adults who are single that want lasting relationships and they want to be married.",
        "And they're tired of the same old, you know, meeting somebody in a sexual relationship and nothing happens.",
        "And, you know, I kind of talk about those issues.",
        "As far as the campaign is concerned, you know, I don't go out publicly, you know, well you need to do this, you need to do that."

        "But, you know, it's the sense of letting women know that there are men out there.",
        "If you choose to not want to be intimate as far as having sex and you want to wait until marriage, there are some men out there that can respect that and can adhere to your wishes.",
        "But when you get involved in any kind of relationship, you just have to be very careful that you don't cross the line, and hopefully you can end up into a marriage.",

        "I'm fascinated by what you said about younger guys, because it sounds like - and Darren correct me if I'm wrong - you were one of those younger guys who was able to date an older woman.",
        "And Audrey, why did you turn down the younger guys?",
        "You know, I think some of it has to do with my own background, Farai.",
        "My father was 10 years older than my mother.",
        "I have been married.",
        "My husband was eight years older than me.",
        "So I think probably subconsciously I've been conditioned to think that a man should be older than a woman.",
        "I also know that females develop faster.",
        "So I think I always thought if I was with a much younger man, and I have been with younger man, but if I was with a much younger man, say 10 years or more, he would always be kind of behind me developmentally.",
        "But a lot of it was just conditioning.",
        "Yeah.",
        "At this point in time, just we're kind of closing in on the time.",

        "But before I do, do you feel as if you are making different choices now?",
        "And what are those choices you're making today?",
        "Is that a question to me, Farai?",
        "Yeah, it is a question to you.",
        "Am I making different choices today?",
        "Right.",
        "Are you dating and - I mean, has your thinking changed?",
        "Well, you know, my thinking has changed a little bit.",
        "I really - Cee Cee's story really resonated with me, because I know when I was younger, pregnancy was a big issue.",
        "And I have to say, now that I'm in my menopausal years, not having to worry about pregnancy has really freed me up sexually.",
        "On the other hand, you now have worry about disease.",
        "So that's tempered my freedom."

        "But I think for young women - and I also, you know, what Darren said resonated - I'm a baby boomer and I'm of the generation that made love not war, so sex was more recreational for my generation.",

        "So I'm more selective as an older woman.",
