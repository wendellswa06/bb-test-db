        "But my question is this, I live in an area - I'm actually a snowbird here in California and I live in New England where there are many bumper stickers on cars - a relatively liberal part of America, right?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We see very few conservative bumper stickers back in New England.",
        "And I'm wondering if your guest - have you found, Patti, that - have you wondered why - have you answered why there are not as many conservative stickers and people that are more conservative wearing bumper stickers?",
        "Or is this a regional difference and in a more conservative parts of the country, are liberal bumper stickers hard to find?",
        "Anyway, your response, Patti?",
        "Well, I think there's a couple things at foot there.",
        "There's a concept called the spiral of silence, which means that if you might hold a minority opinion, you might be more reserved about expressing that opinion if you feel that others around you are going to, you know, distance you for your opinion.",
        "And so rather than to, maybe, risk getting your car keyed in a parking lot, in a more liberal area or something, maybe a conservative person just does not want to risk that kind of public, you know, display of their own political opinion.",
        "That's...",
        "And they might want also resell that puppy someday.",
        "You might want to do that.",
        "I think that there could be a regional difference too.",
        "I think taking a look at regionally, if you counted cars with bumper stickers in parking lots in different, you know, mall shopping centers, regionally, on a particular day of the year might be an interesting thing to figure out where do the most cars with bumper stickers seem to show up.",
        "I'm not sure that there's a lot of research money out there to conduct that study, but I would bet that there's somewhat of a regional difference."
