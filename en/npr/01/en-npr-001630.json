        "Oh, yeah.",

        "Indeed, most of those were full of anachronisms, unsuited to a mid-20th century society.",
        "Instead, we chose to model ours after the most progressive, inclusive constitution we could find in the 48 states, and that happened to be, in our collective opinion, that of Oregon.",
        "Why shouldn't other emerging democracies find more modern examples?",
        "We certainly have no regret.",

        "We should celebrate whenever a minority breaks through a barrier that has historically excluded them from participation.",
        "Love to Rosa Parks, Jackie Robinson, Tiger Woods, Lin, the Williams sisters and everyone else who contributed to say, yes, I can and did.",
