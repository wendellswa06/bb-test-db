        "Well, I think there will be.",
        "Actually, the president actually has even supported that in the past, in last year's State of the Union message.",
        "This fund that the new legislation that passed the House yesterday is designed to create would be targeted for that.",
        "And the government actually has poured a lot of money into some of those areas, certainly solar and wind, for a couple of decades and it's actually had some impact.",
        "Other areas like tidal energy are newer.",
        "I think that will be increased.",
        "I think again, the bigger problem has not been the research, although we certainly need more funding in that, it's that there hasn't been a concomitant effort to create incentives, sufficient incentives for people to actually buy these things.",
        "Well, you know, we've had farmers - we've done a lot of shows on wind energy, for example.",
        "We've had farmers who are being paid $3,000 to $5,000 per wind turbine on their farm, making more money as farmers farming the wind than farming their cows or the wheat that may be growing around.",
        "Right.",
        "There's a number of those in upstate New York.",
        "And they're multiplying.",
        "I mean upstate New York - Kansas, I'm talking about, Oklahoma, Texas, upstate New York absolutely.",
        "And they tell us we could put many more of these up, and we would love to, and the utilities would like us to.",
        "We just can't get to the grid from where we are.",
        "You have to be within five to 10 miles of the grid to feed the power back.",
        "(As Anne Elk) Much, much thicker in the middle...",
        "And hopefully, you know, this committee again that the speaker's setting up and also just the general thrust of attention in both the House and the Senate will look at some of these problems and not just at - beyond just looking at a global cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide and beyond the ideological debates that have basically hampered the energy debate or a long time.",
        "And hopefully, that will focus more of the public attention as well, and media attention.",
        "Energy legislation has traditionally been one of the most under-covered issues there is, and yet the entire economy rests on it.",
        "Even the Department of Energy recently said that in just three states, I think it was - I don't remember.",
        "I think Kansas, Texas and North Dakota.",
        "Those three states have enough potential wind energy to fuel, to power the whole country.",
        "Right."

        "Electrical demand.",
        "And there are - again, there are policy tools that would focus people's attention more on this, such as renewable portfolio standard, which requires, you know, a certain percentage of electricity to be generated from alternative sources.",
        "If those kinds of requirements started being imposed, then that focuses people's attention on, OK, where are the bottlenecks?",
        "What's preventing us from reaching those levels or even higher levels?",
        "And then people will start looking at real problem solving on the ground.",
        "Unfortunately again, the energy debate has been not very focused on solving real problems on the ground and much more on scoring ideological points.",
        "Talking with David Goldston this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "You've spent, what, six years on the Hill?",
        "Well, more like 20, but six in the last position.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "As chief of staff on the House Committee on Science.",
        "Can you tell us about the new incoming House chairman or the committee chairman, or how he might look at science as compared to Sherwood Boehlert, your old boss?",
        "Sure.",
        "The new chairman is Bart Gordon from Tennessee.",
        "He's a fairly centrist Democrat.",
        "He's been on the committee for years.",
        "He's someone who likes to have an activist agenda, and he has stated very publicly that he is going to try to sort of follow in the footsteps of Mr. Boehlert in terms of trying to run the committee in a way that's both activist and bipartisan.",
        "He's even hired some of the staff who worked for Mr. Boehlert.",
        "So I'm very optimistic about what the committee is trying to do.",
        "I mean they definitely have a focus on these energy issues.",
        "Mr. Gordon's introduced a couple of bills on energy and he's also been very active in pushing the idea of having a new agency within the Department of Energy that would specifically try to look at long-term energy research that could really sort of get beyond sort of incremental changes and into more substantial changes in alternative-energy technologies."

        "Where do you think the first changes will come in - as you say, the cap - sorry, capping the CO2 is a long-term.",

        "Where might we see the first real changes happening?",
        "Might they be in the CAFE standards, although that's…?",
        "I think some of the easier ones that might come first might be more on the tax-incentive side, although it's a little early to know.",
        "I mean I think the folks who are actually doing this work haven't fully figured out the agenda yet.",
        "But tax incentives tend to be easier to write.",
        "The problem is you have to find out - find an area to make up the lost revenue, and also tax bills tend to become magnets for other tax provisions, which get more politically complicated.",

        "I mean, again, it was very hard to get debate even on the floor.",
        "Mr. Boehlert managed, along with Mr. Markey, to get their bill debated as an amendment several times.",
        "In the Senate, there was much less debate on fuel-economy standards.",
        "And now a number of bills have been introduced that were more ambitious than the bills that couldn't get anywhere before.",
        "So I think that issue is up for grabs again, which is important because the transportation sector is really one of the few sectors of the economy that's less energy efficient than it was 30 years ago.",
        "Do you think that this can actually become a political issue in the next election, two years from now?",
        "I think it can.",
        "I mean I think the way that both bodies in Congress are looking at it, and supposedly the president is going to be talking about this in the State of the Union message as he did last year, indicates that people think that the public is worried about climate change and about energy issues in general.",
        "The problem is so far most of the political effort has been focused on rhetoric and to try to actually talk tough so as to distract from the fact that not much was really happening.",
        "What's different now is it looks like there may be some real efforts to make real changes in things like fuel-economy standards, renewable portfolio standards and gradually moving toward a cap on carbon-dioxide emissions and other greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Well, we'll keep watching, as you will, David.",
