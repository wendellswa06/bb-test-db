        "Thanks for joining us today, David.",
        "Hi, Lynn.",
        "And we should mention that the hearings have resumed from lunch break.",
        "We're going to go over what happened during the morning session and we're going to begin with some tape.",
        "Here is Republican Senator Arlen Specter.",
        "(Soundbite of audiotape)",
        "Judge Roberts, in your confirmation hearing for Circuit Court, your testimony read to this effect, and it's been widely quoted: \"\"Roe is the settled law of the land.\"\" Do you mean settled for you, settled only for your capacity as a circuit judge or settled beyond that?",
        "Well, beyond that, it's settled as a precedent of the court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.",
        "And those principles, applied in the Casey case, explain when cases should be revisited and when they should not.",
        "And it is settled as a precedent of the court, yes.",
        "You went on then to say, quote, \"\"It's a little more than settled.",
        "It was reaffirmed in the face of a challenge that it should be overruled in the Casey decision.\"\" So it has that added precedencial value.",
        "I think the initial question of a judge confronting an issue in this area, you don't go straight to the Roe decision.",
        "You begin with Casey, which modified the Roe framework and reaffirmed its central holding.",
        "So, David Savage, we hear that the issue of abortion comes up almost immediately.",
        "And we hear the nominee say that Roe v.",
        "Wade is settled precedent.",

        "What I take from that, Lynn, is that he's telling the senators that he will not overturn Roe vs. Wade lightly.",
        "And that's all I would take from it.",
        "He talked quite a bit about the importance of precedent and he just described the various things the Supreme Court has said in the past as to what--how it views precedent.",
        "That is, it's not enough to just say that a previous ruling is wrong.",
        "You've got to decide it's unworkable, that there's a great division on the court, that it has been eroded over time, people no longer believe its sort of central premises.",
        "He cited all those and then he cited a series of cases where the Supreme Court has said things like that, and I was sort of paying attention to the cases because some of them are well known, some are not, and about half of them were cases where the court had upheld a disputed precedent and the other half were cases where they had overturned a disputed precedent.",
        "So I think Roberts was basically saying to them, `Precedent is important but it doesn't carry the day all the time.'",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do you think that the answer that he gave--and I imagine he'll be asked about this again, will he not be?",
        "I mean...",
        "Yes.",
        "...is that answer going to satisfy those who are really interested in the issue of Roe v.",
        "Wade?",
        "I don't think it'll satisfy them in the sense that it'll reassure them that he really is going to stick by precedent.",
        "It's probably the best we're going to hear from him, though.",
        "He seemed to have this answer pretty well rehearsed in his mind; when they came back to it later he said some of the same things.",
        "So I think he knows exactly what he wanted to say here, which is: Precedent is important.",
        "Usually we stick with precedent, but not always.",
        "Do you expect him to be pressed on this more in the coming days?",
        "Yes, sure.",
        "I mean, it seems to me that's the single, simple most important question facing Roberts right now in these hearings.",
        "I think the public interest might be: Are you going to vote to overturn Roe vs. Wade?",
        "There's a lot of people who don't like Roe and there's a lot of people who think it's an important precedent and should not be touched.",
        "It's a big division in the country.",
        "And if he stays on the court 30 years, he'll certainly have time to face it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Senator Specter also asked Judge Roberts about his views on privacy.",
        "How does that fit into this discussion?",
        "Well, the Roe vs. Wade case cited a right to privacy as the basis for it, so one of the minuets we've gone through in past confirmation hearings is that senators don't want to say, `Do you support Roe vs. Wade?",
        "and so they say, `Do you support the right to privacy?",
        "And Roberts said very clearly he did think there was a right to personal privacy in the liberty clause of the 14th Amendment.",
        "And that, again, I think, tells you something but not everything, 'cause I believe Clarence Thomas said something like that as well; that is, he thinks there is a right to privacy, but then eight or nine months later, he turned around and voted to overturn Roe vs. Wade.",
        "My question--I know that George Bush has stated several times that he wanted a strict constitutionalist judge.",
        "My question is, does that mean he wants a judge that's going to roll back everything since slavery and interpret the Constitution the way it was originally written?"

        "I assume when he uses the phrase `strict constructionist,' which is one of the phrases he's used--Richard Nixon used that--that means basically interpret the Constitution sort of close to its words.",
        "Don't be too expansive; don't go off the deep end.",

        "I thought he asked a fairly simple question, which is, if Congress has the power to declare war, which they do--the commander in chief then carries it out.",
        "If Congress says, `As of September 1st, we want to end this war,' doesn't that mean the war ends on September 1st?",
        "And Roberts said, `No, I really can't answer that question.",
        "And there has been sort of a conservative doctrine that shows up in a number of places, including some of the memos written, the so-called torture memos, where lawyers have basically argued that the commander in chief--once a war begins, it's entirely in his prerogative and Congress can't interfere.",
        "And I would have thought Roberts would have said something like, `Yes, Senator, that's just obvious or just a truism that if Congress can pass a law overriding the president's veto and say the war ends, then the war ends.",

        "David, something interesting that we've been hearing over these two days that I find interesting, I'd like you to talk about a little bit--Judge Roberts talked a lot about judicial modesty, judicial humility.",
        "He compared the role of a judge to an umpire.",
        "What does that tell us about his judicial philosophy?",

        "It is something that echoes what Republican senators said yesterday and a lot of conservatives have said for a lot of--a long time.",
        "I suspect a lot of ordinary Americans think that it's an appealing thought, which is judges shouldn't be making the law.",
        "Roberts today said something like, `You can't imagine the framers getting together in whatever--1787 and saying, \"\"Why don't we let all the hard questions be decided by unelected judges?\"\" But that's not the way a democracy should work.",
        "And he wants to continue to say, `I view judging as a very limited role of applying the law, not making the law.",
        "And it's--and I want to bring, you know, modesty and humility to the job.",
        "And I think a lot of people around the country would instinctively think that sounds pretty good.",
        "We don't want the Supreme Court deciding all the big questions of the day because they are fundamentally unelected people and they don't represent views, and if you get a decision you really disagree with, there's nothing you can do about it.",
        "And so I think it's something that he feels strongly about.",
        "He says it over and over again, and it's certainly something that the Republican senators echo over and over again.",
        "Now the judge is--Judge Roberts is--he's a very measured man, I think, in the way he's responding, which--of course, yesterday Republican senators were urging him to be measured in his responses, which may be causing a little bit of frustration on the part of Democrats.",
