        "Well, you're right.",
        "He's--Roberts is saying the least possible on some controversial matters, basically saying he can't state an opinion because some of these cases are going--some of these issues will come back before the court.",
        "I'm not sure exactly what--Biden questioned him for about a half-hour and got increasingly irritated at Roberts and one time called his answers misleading.",
        "They were really debating a series of civil rights issues early in the Reagan administration.",
        "There was--you know, one of the ones was this Grove City case.",

        "Title IX says something like `Any institution or program receiving federal financial funds may not discriminate based on sex.",
        "So what about a private college that doesn't get federal funds but some of its students get federal aid?",
        "That was the issue.",
        "The liberal view as those colleges, even those private colleges, should be covered entirely.",
        "The Reagan administration took the view, and the Supreme Court agreed, that the college is covered only to the extent of its admissions office.",
        "Well, that really limited Title IX in private colleges because, say, for example, the sports program wouldn't be covered.",
        "So Congress went back and changed the law, the so-called Civil Rights Restoration Act, and said, `If you get any money, the entire college is covered.'",
        "And I think some--Senator Biden, and to some degree Senator Kennedy, wanted John Roberts to say something like, `Well, I think I really regret some of those views I said--you know, wrote about 25 years ago and I've sort of changed my mind.",
        "But Roberts stuck to his opinion.",
        "He gave a very legal argument.",
        "He didn't budge and didn't move at all and basically said, `I was arguing the position the administration took, and that was their position and it wasn't mine.'",
        "Well, clearly the Democrats want to be tough with the nominee.",
        "On the other hand, do they run some risk of looking too partisan or of badgering this person who seems to be a very reasonable person?",
        "I mean, how effective are they being with these--this tough questioning?",
        "That one's a hard one for me to answer because, to some degree, it depends on the eye of the beholder, but I think you're correct to say that they do look like they can be badgering him, and not very effectively.",
        "Most of the senators are better at talking than they are at answering questions.",
        "They seem to give a...",
        "Or asking questions.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Pardon me?",
        "Asking questions.",
        "Yes.",
        "They talk a lot.",
        "You know, they've got 30 minutes to ask questions and they spend 10 or 15 minutes doing a lead-in to their first question and then say, `Judge, could you comment on that?",
        "It's more effective if you ask sort of a pointed question, listen to the answer and then follow up.",
        "And so a lot of the Democrats have been sort of frustrated.",
        "They've been giving speeches and they haven't been able to pin down Roberts and get clear answers and it's just unfortunate that some of these--the older senators have been in the Senate a long time and doing a lot of talking and they don't have that prosecutor skill of sort of asking tight, crisp questions that demand an answer.",
        "Prosecutors or journalists.",
        "We'll have to give them some lessons, huh?"
