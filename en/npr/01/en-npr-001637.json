        "When Clement did know some bad facts, he usually managed to persuade the Bush administration to take preventive action in the nick of time.",
        "For instance, on the eve of the argument in two terrorism cases involving American citizens, the government finally, after years of lawyerless detention, allowed the defendants to see their attorneys.",
        "His peers say Clement is incredibly quick at digesting information.",
        "Supreme Court advocate Tom Goldstein notes that he recently hired Clement to argue a case for a client.",

        "So we went to Shintaro Okamoto's ice sculpting studio in Queens, and he is an ice expert for sure.",

        "I didn't even know there was such a thing as an ice research lab.",

        "Then, last year, he agreed to represent congressional Republicans in defending the constitutionality of the controversial Defense of Marriage Act.",

        "And in April, he will defend Arizona's aggressive immigration law.",
        "At the same time, in the lower courts, he has a bunch of cases that will likely end up in the Supreme Court, including one on minority voting rights and the Defense of Marriage Act.",

        "It turns out that it's tiny air bubbles trapped in the ice that makes the difference between cloudy and clear ice.",
        "So cloudy ice has these little bubbles trapped and that scatters the light.",
