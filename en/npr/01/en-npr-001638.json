        "And if you cut into it too quickly, it will crack and burst, and that's because as it's warming up, the outer layer is actually warming up faster than the inside.",
        "And as it warms up, it expands, and so it creates this strain between the outer skin of the ice and the inner part.",

        "He said, for example, that a man accustomed to using contraception may reduce women, quote, \"\"to a mere instrument of his own desires.\"\" And a conservative minority is saying the widespread use of birth control did lead to promiscuity.",

        "She spoke recently at a conference on \"\"Humanae Vitae,\"\" saying, if we knew 50 years ago that the sexual revolution would bring more broken marriages, even abortions, fewer Catholics might have objected to the encyclical.",
        "Those of us living today now have access to something they didn't - 50 years of sociological, psychological, medical and other evidence about the revolution's fallout.",
        "In an interview after that speech, she said she finds the \"\"Humanae Vitae\"\" encyclical richly prophetic.",
