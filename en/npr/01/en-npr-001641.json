        "We, as a family, we have focused on giving back, remembering where we came from, which, across the board, very modest means, and trying to seek ways to lift and raise the sights of African-Americans.",
        "And many of the things that we have done have been focused in that area, focused specifically on youth.",
        "Youth is the future.",
        "And if we can give youth hope, give youth exposure, give them some means of getting out of poverty and a situation, then that's kind of, I think, the future.",
        "The other thing that we've focused on is connectivity between the majority community and the African-American community.",
        "And we have found kind of unique ways, grounds of common interest cultural institutions, that are in serious trouble in many cases.",
        "Museums--you know, the audiences are declining.",

        "We're speaking, of course, about the Federal Communications Commission's vote tomorrow on whether to open up the broadcast airwaves to deliver high-speed wireless Internet access.",
        "Tech companies like the idea, but they're facing opposition from some broadcasters, religious leaders, and entertainers, as Joel Rose reports.",
        "Allen Orivits(ph) lives on the top of a mountain in western North Carolina.",
        "He moved here for the natural beauty, but there are some things about the country life Orivits does not like.",

        "He says that in February, the nation's TV stations will switch from analogue to digital broadcasts.",
        "Since the new signals will be more efficient, there will be lots of what are called white spaces between the channels.",
        "Bowen and others want to use those empty airwaves to deliver high-speed wireless Internet access.",
        "Broadcasters will only be using about 30 percent of their allocation, which leaves a very powerful, efficient spectrum with which we can basically solve the rural broadband problem.",
        "Bowen says the service would be like Wi-Fi, only a lot stronger.",
        "Engineers for the Federal Communications Commission released a report several weeks ago saying the technology basically works.",
        "But that report hasn't convinced Dennis Wharton of the National Association of Broadcasters.",
        "There's a very brief executive summary which finds that everything is going to work well.",
        "But if you actually read the full 400-page report, which is quite dense, it raises some serious questions about the potential for interference.",
        "Broadcasters are pressuring the FCC to allow time for public comment before voting on the proposal, and they're not alone.",

        "That photograph, now known as The Afghan Girl, ended up on the cover of National Geographic and became one of the magazine's most widely recognized.",
        "To get that shot, McCurry used an icon in its own right: Kodak's Kodachrome slide film.",
        "Last year, Kodak discontinued Kodachrome and gave the last roll ever produced to McCurry.",
        "He crossed the globe for those final shots and he came into our New York bureau to talk about them.",

        "I mean, what was the pressure like to have just essentially 36 frames and the last 36 frames?",
        "The pressure, it was really nerve-wracking because, you know, you load it in and, heaven forbid, somebody opens the back by mistake.",
        "You know, going through security, I was so worried that the X-ray machine in Istanbul, in Italy, all these airports that I went through, I was worried sick that there was going to be X-ray damage, or, you know - and then, you know, the right moment - am I getting the right moment?",
        "And then, is it in focus, is the exposure right?",

        "So, I'm actually quite pleased with what we came back with.",
        "I'm from Baltimore myself, I should say, and I think that, you know, I come from a family that's always taken advantage of things, like the library and the cultural institutions.",

        "Thinking about what Eddie just said about getting younger people interested in entrepreneurship, start out by telling us about your journey and also the kinds of outreach that you do to young people.",
        "Well, I'm an old man, and I'm 21 years old.",
        "And I think it's important, looking at the journey that I've traveled in, coming from the Robert Taylor projects on the South Side of Chicago, growing up very poor, and I started my first business at six years old painting rocks and trying to convince people that these rocks that I was painting were bookends and paperweights and door-stoppers, and ultimately, I made my first million at 14, and by God's grace, I'm a multimillionaire now that I'm 21.",
        "And I think that what pushed me and what drove me--and I think that we really, as a community, should focus on the fact that when we look at statistics--growing up in the projects, according to statistics, I'm supposed to either be in prison or dead, not a successful entrepreneur.",
        "So many times, we have to understand, as young people and as youth, that we may want entrepreneurship, but we need entrepreneurship, because many times, jobs are not made available for us, and many times, we will not be able to just walk into somewhere and say, `Hey, hire me,' because it's just not like that.",
        "So we have to realize that we're going to have to take up entrepreneurship, and when we look at the fact that two-thirds of the job force are provided by entrepreneurs, that we have to create and make our own jobs and create our own monumental unmatched platform to really address our issues in our community through entrepreneurship and through unity, I think, is very important.",
        "Now, Farrah, there are entrepreneurs all over, but a lot of times, the entrepreneurs you see as somebody coming into the nail salon selling CDs, somebody else braiding hair in their house, low-level entrepreneurship, which I love.",
        "You know, I love, you know, going and getting my hair done in somebody's house, but really, what you're talking about is a much larger scale.",
        "How did you realize that you could go from selling rocks, small-time business, to big-time business?",
        "Well, for example, I'm thinking small scale ultimately becoming big scale.",
        "I just left the Virgin Islands last week, and I mean, if you had a goat, then they would turn a goat attraction--I saw one guy, he put sunglasses on a goat and had people wanting to take pictures with his goat.",
        "So entrepreneurship--I saw everything.",
        "If you could cook, you had a talent.",
        "If you could ride a bike, then you were--he was trying to hook other people up to the bike and turn that into an attraction.",
        "So I think that entrepreneurship is important in finding whatever your natural gifts and talents of what you may be able to see as an opportunity with.",
        "And entrepreneurship on a larger scale was something that I went after because I felt--and I think the first thing we have to discuss is the confidence, believing in ourselves that we can achieve whatever it is that we want to achieve.",
        "And that's what I think is really rough for us.",
        "Many times, we only emulate entertainment because that's all--those are the examples that we see in front of us.",
        "And I would encourage some of the people that I work with in the entertainment industry to also highlight entrepreneurship as a career alternative, because we only, many times, have the confidence to be whatever we see as far as if we see 30 or 40 people make it in one industry, and we all follow, and God knows we know not everybody can rap and not everybody can..."

        "Who did you look up to when you decided to go into being an entrepreneur?",
        "I think for me, growing up, you know, everybody around me was in some sort of business, and so, you know--and so once I decided to go on my own, I just looked at it as I have to look around and see what common problems are there and what solutions can I provide for it?",
        "And in order to take entrepreneurship, as you were asking, on a larger scale, basically you look around you and say, `What problems can I solve with my skills?",
        "which is what I did.",

        "So there's only one lab.",
        "If you want your Kodachrome film processed, you've got to go to Dwayne Photo in Parsons, Kansas - that's it.",
        "And after December this year, they'll no longer be processing it.",
        "Lastly, most of our listeners know your Afghan Girl shot.",

        "But you know if you did it...",
        "So, it's the smell.",
        "Well, my service is--you know, it's for everyone.",
        "So it really--today in America, you have 50 percent of the demographic that is single, so it's a more wider scale, you know, issue that it's addressing.",
        "It's not just specifically for the African-American community, and, you know, it's just looking at it and saying, OK, America has gone from being, you know, married to now being single.",
        "What can I do to help with the process?",
        "And so even in addition to the dating service, now you have other things such as other companies that are looking to create diversity programs for their single employees, because 42 percent of the work force is single, that have now turned to the publication, that have now turned to my business and said, `Well, how can you help us better serve the single employees that we have here?",
        "So it's something that started on a very small scale, you know, addressing the basic issue, and then now it's grown because that's the current that, you know, is--it's the undercurrent of America right now.",
        "Farrah, let me ask you about this question of isolation.",
        "A lot of people can be judgmental in the African-American community about wealth.",
        "If you're too poor, there's one stereotype about you, and we talked about that on this program on Tuesday.",
        "If you're too rich, you're seen as a sell-out.",
