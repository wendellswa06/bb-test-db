        "Well, I think that the suspicions are well-deserved, so I personally don't take it personal when people get a chance to meet me or read about me.",
        "They kind of get an idea of my personality and what my mission and my goal is, so they kind of say, `Whoa, you know, he's definitely one of us and someone who has his people's best interests at heart.",
        "And I think that the most important thing is to realize that if someone is biased, it's not unfair.",
        "The majority of those who do become successful, they do sell out.",
        "They do get what I call selective amnesia and forget where they came from.",
        "I created the Farrah Gray Foundation where I give a percentage of my personal income to after-school inner-city literacy programs, to scholarships.",
        "I just signed on as the spokesperson for the National Coalition for the Homeless, because I realize that the large majority of those who are homeless are black people.",
        "So I think that the biasness is fair, because mostly when people get money, they get this whole--they get all booji with their suits and ties and their credit cards and their new positions, and I always jokingly say they start to eat their chitlins with a toothpick.",
        "So they want nothing to do with struggle.",
        "They want no connection to it.",
        "So it's more of those than it is people that have the people's best interests at heart, so I say that it is fair with those thoughts that they have about them being sell-outs because the majority of them are.",
        "Eddie, what do you think about that?",
        "Do you think that it's fair to call most black wealthy Americans sell-outs to the race?",
        "You know, I don't think so.",
        "I think there's some of that, but I think if one remembers--and we don't forget--you know, if we kind of keep in touch with those that are less fortunate and have a real passion of helping them, you know, for example, you know, I got to the ghetto to get my hair cut, you know.",
        "I talk to the people.",
        "And I think as long as we can connect to the situation and the desperation of the people and kind of connect to them and not act, you know, bourgeois, you know, I think that can kind of break down some of the barriers.",
        "And that's what I personally and my family have tried to do.",
        "And, Eddie, let me lead you to what I think will be our final question, which is how do you get more African-Americans into the ranks of those who are comfortably well-off, if not wealthy?",
        "There was a study that came out in 1998 that found that while 14 percent of all Americans spent more than their income, 24 percent of African-Americans spent more than their income.",
        "That's a pretty significant difference, and it's huge in undermining the wealth-building in black America.",
        "What can be done to change that fact?",
        "You know, I think we'll have to get away from the mind-set of get rich quick schemes.",
        "It's really a longer term and persistent savings and accumulating and compounding your savings that will kind of get you there.",
        "The other thing is to try to get into an employment situation where there is kind of an entrepreneurial environment.",
        "For example, with my firm, I've tried to create an environment and mechanisms for people to create wealth.",
        "And I think we, as African-Americans, as we start businesses, as those businesses are successful, we should make sure that we, within our own companies, through retirement plans, through stock purchase opportunities, you know, to help our fellow employees create wealth.",
        "Let me ask you, Mary, the same question.",
        "What can we do collectively to make sure that more African-Americans have the opportunity to build wealth?",
        "I think reach-out programs are very important, going back and really, you know, letting people know that entrepreneurial paths are, you know, in fact, a viable option, and then also getting to the root of, you know, our spending.",
        "Why are people spending so much in all the wrong places?",
        "And I think once we address that and get more comfortable, the more comfortable you get with yourself, you're not going to be out there, you know, spending as much, because the, you know, bling-bling culture, I think, lends, you know, itself to buying Prada shoes and doing this and you're nobody unless you're driving this and that.",
        "Once we started looking at, you know, a lot more of that and, you know, once we start getting away from a lot more of that, I think more people would be able to, you know, be on the path of entrepreneurship and also being--you know, successfully saving.",
        "Farrah, there have been a lot of books that talk about how millionaires actually spend less than a lot of people with more--with less money.",
        "Millionaires can be frugal and build up their wealth that way, but we are faced with the bling culture.",
        "What do you tell the young people that you talk to about defying that expectation?",

        "But I think investing--I had a friend one time that came into some money and bought a Rolex watch and was living at his grandma's house catching the bus.",
