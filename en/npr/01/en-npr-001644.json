        "But it's a real stretch and I mean, it's - in a way, it's a sort of tribute to the human brain that were able to do it at all.",
        "But what we're doing is putting one thing on hold while we shift our focus to the next thing and then we're switching back.",
        "And every time you switch, there's a little big of a lag.",
        "You lose a little something.",

        "Well, I think that John's point is well-taken and reflective of a lot of research, which indicates that we really can only focus on one thing at a time.",
        "There are some studies showing that sometimes, it might be possible to divide our attention between two things.",
        "But for the most part, what's happening in our brain is that we're switching back and forth between two different things.",
        "And so that means what in terms of you're doing one task and then you move to another one, you really just can't complete what you've just done or you can't do it well?",
        "Well, it sometimes means that while we're supposedly performing two tasks at the same time, much as Sheila kind of mentioned when she's driving home and she's talking on the cell phone, we think that we're kind of performing these two tasks at the same time.",
        "But often times, we have to switch our priorities between these tasks.",
        "So for example, if Sheila starts to get engrossed in a conversation on her cell phone, she might stop attending as well to the road in front of her.",
        "In fact, some research at the University of Utah, that David Strayer's lab has been doing, shows that talking on cell phones while people are in a driving simulation, results in reduced attention to the road in front of them.",
        "They have less memory for say, billboards that kind of went by during the simulation.",
        "And even shows that driving while you're talking on your cell phone, is kind of like driving drunk.",
        "There's a lot of common commonalities there, where people are much slower to respond to things that happen on the road when they're both drunk and when they're talking on their cell phones.",

        "Looking at what different brain regions contribute to attention in general and to this ability that we have to switch between different tasks.",
        "And some of those studies indicate that giving people advance preparation to switch between tasks, sort of allows the brain to prepare and to therefore perform a task better.",
        "So this actually a study that Heliane Slagter(ph) and I and other colleagues, including Marty Welder for Duke University performed.",
        "And we just showed that different parts of the brain became active when subjects were instructed that they would have to switch to a new task in the near future.",
        "More recently, we've been doing some work here at the University of Michigan, which tries to look at how brain activity and even communication between different parts of the brain relates to our ability to switch quickly between tasks.",
        "The idea being that more activation or communication between the different parts of the brain than enable us to switch attention should have facilitate or help us to switch between different tasks.",

        "Well, the neural scientist I talked to say that like almost everything else, you can learn to do things better.",
        "People who multitask a lot seem to get better at, it's probably task switching, but they're getting more competent at it.",
        "So, you know, you can say you can practice but for a lot of people, the answer is probably to try to eliminate some things.",

        "It's interesting that you were talking before about what people can do to sort of improve their ability to multitask.",

        "You know, it is true that younger people around, you know, in their teenage years are certainly getting exposed to all sorts of multitasking situations and that they're good at.",
        "It turns out though that there is some research, notably by for example, Art Kramer and his colleagues at the University of Illinois, that shows that if you give older individuals enough practice that they can actually improved their task-switching abilities to the point where they're indistinguishable from those of younger individuals.",
        "Now, it turns out the if you strain older adults cognitive abilities by increasing various other demands of the task, like how many things they have to remember while they're performing it.",
        "Then that turns out not to be as true.",
        "But nonetheless, the idea is that, older adults it's not the case that they can't multi task that if you give them enough practice then they can certainly can.",
        "And you'll have to remind me about.",
        "I was just saying that I feel like there is certain situations in which I am comfortable with the idea of multitasking, others where I really when it's a big project where I really want to just be concentrating on one thing.",
        "Well, I think, you know, you're getting in a central issue here which is how demanding are the two tasks that people are trying to switch back and forth between or trying to divide their attention between.",
        "If they're not very demanding then you can perform them both well even if you're switching back and forth or at least, accurately.",
        "But if one of them really takes all of your attention, then it might be difficult to kind of, you know, stop doing it or put it on hold because that might result in an error or a poor performance.",
        "One thing that actually, very early researchers like, Gersel, in 1927 reported, was that it's easier to switch back and forth between two tasks when those tasks involve different stimuli.",
        "So, for example, if you're switching back and forth between writing an email and talking on your cell phone, that might be easier than switching back and forth between one email and another email, because you might get the two emails confused.",
        "And so, sometimes the decision about whether to multi task or not depends on how hard the two tasks are and also how confusable they are.",
