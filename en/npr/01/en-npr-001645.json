        "Well, I think what you're maybe talking about there is closely related to some of the studies they've done on multitasking and learning.",
        "And a lot of learning, of course, has to do with moving things from short-term memory into long-term memory, and multitasking seems to disrupt that.",
        "Perhaps Dr. Weissman would care to elaborate on that a little bit.",
        "Well, oftentimes, when we're trying to multitask, what we're doing is effectively not paying as much attention as we could be to any particular task.",
        "And it turns out that there's a lot of work indicating that we tend to remember what we attend.",
        "And so often times as well, we remember things that we encode in all sorts of different ways.",

        "There's a lot of individual things you can associate with me to help yourself remember me.",
        "And when we're not paying attention well, it turns out that these sorts of more elaborated processing that lead to better memory are less likely to happen, right?",
        "Because we're not paying full attention and therefore, we spend less time encoding whatever it is we're attending at the moment.",
        "And so, it becomes less durable and more susceptible to forgetting.",

        "I don't think we could have kids without multitasking.",
        "So is there a gender difference, Jon Hamilton?",
        "I mean, are women better at multitasking?",
        "There certainly is a perception that there is and in fact I asked several neuroscientists about this in the course of doing the study.",
        "And the best answer I got was that when you actually start testing, it's not obvious that there's a great gender advantage.",
        "However, there was a little bit of research that suggested that maybe what's going on is that women are a lot more tolerant of doing multitasking than men are.",
        "Men will simply refuse to, whereas the women will go ahead and try to accommodate all these different tasks, and perhaps that's what's going on.",
        "Because we have no other option.",
        "We can't refuse when we're taking care of our children, running our home, you know, have full-time jobs.",
        "There's no really other option there and I think if it's not natural in us and we've learned to do it quite well because there are millions of us out there doing it every day.",

        "I keep trying to figure what - where to go with that.",
        "Well, one thing that sort of strikes me a little bit about the last caller's statement is that, you know, there's a lot of research showing that the strategies people use when they're trying to coordinate multiple tasks are really critical to determining how successful they are.",
        "So, for a long time, there was work by Hal Pashler and his colleagues showing that it wasn't really possible to at the same time, program two different responses that is for you to make a decision about what you're seeing at one moment and then I presented the subject with another stimulus that they had to make a decision about very soon thereafter.",
        "There seemed to be this bottle neck wherein essentially, the second decision had to wait until the first decision was finished.",
        "But subsequent researchers, like Dave Meyer at the University of Michigan, were able to show that depending on how subjects were instructed to coordinate these two tasks, that sort of bottle neck in response selection could either be present or absent.",
        "And what this makes me think about with respect to men and women and gender differences and multitasking is that men and women may have very different strategies and approaches that they use when they're trying to coordinate different tasks.",
        "And so, if in one study it turned out to be the case that women were better than men or if in another study it turned to be the case that men were better than women, it might just be that they're using different strategies.",
        "They both mowed down favorite teams along the way.",
        "In fact, the Royals are the first team in history, Steve, to begin the playoffs with eight straight wins.",
        "Right.",
        "Now this has things modern that I recognize: the little tracks where balls go, the ramps, the kind of in and out, and down and above.",
        "I mean, this is really bells and whistle.",
        "And what would really be interesting for future research, I think, is to try to understand whether these gender differences are due to something hardwired about men and women - you know, men's and women's brains.",
        "That just can't change.",
        "So that women can do in something and for example, men can't.",
        "Or if it's just that women, you know, do something and men don't even if they could, if they were encouraged to adopt a different strategy.",
        "And I think that a lot of research that goes on needs to or would be better if it focused on these various strategies that people use to perform these different tasks.",
