        "Giving people the opportunity to actually come here and ask questions they may have, satisfy their curiosity was what the goal was.",
        "That's Abigail Opiah, one of the organizers.",
        "But, ironically enough, we haven't gotten any non-black people really coming here to engage.",
        "We've gotten a lot of responses from black people - black women, especially.",
        "There were hardly any white people who came up to touch the hair of the women with the signs saying they could - perhaps shyness, white guilt.",
        "Slavery, discrimination.",
        "For much of American history, black hair has been considered bad hair.",
        "Black women felt pressure to straighten it to look presentable.",
        "During the 1960s and '70s, having natural black hair was a political statement.",
        "Today, with dreads, braiding, hair extensions, styles are abundant, but black women often find their hair provokes unwanted comments and touching without consent.",
        "It's kind of like when people feel they have the right to touch a pregnant woman's belly without even asking.",
        "Some women, like Angie Moore, who describes herself as a Brit of Caribbean descent, said it wasn't her job to educate people about black hair.",
        "I'm not interested in the hair debate, but I'm very concerned about anyone who would - any woman who would invite someone to come into her personal space and touch her.",
        "I don't see that as a racial thing.",
        "I see it as a gender thing.",
        "I see it as a safety issue.",
        "Many women who came to protest the event said it reminded them of Saartjie, or Sarah Baartman, a South African black woman who was displayed in France and England in the early 19th century like a circus animal.",
        "She was called the Hottentot Venus.",
        "I asked Joliana Hunter-Ellin how she felt about the protests of their event.",
        "These women are very adamant about people not touching their hair, which is completely understandable, because I don't want people to touch my hair unless I give them consent.",
        "But there were clearly mixed messages.",
        "Union Square was filled with groups of black women arguing.",
        "Here are Stacey Sargeant, Adepero Oduye and a number of other women laughing.",
        "And of course, we'll take questions from members of the studio audience here at the Newseum.",

        "Neal, thank you so much for having me.",
        "And the changes - why is Raul Castro doing this, after so long, when all of this seemed to be frozen?",
        "Well, Fidel Castro formally resigned, and Raul Castro became head of state about six weeks ago.",
        "And at that time, really, the clock started ticking.",
        "There is an awareness at the top levels of the Raul Castro government that the demands from the Cuban people for more freedom and for a better material life both are real and palpable, and he's starring to deliver.",
        "And is this - do we know how his brother - what his brother thinks of all of this?",
        "Well, no, we don't.",
        "But we assume - there are lots of reasons to assume that his brother has given his blessing, and that his brother understands that really these changes have to be made and his brother is incapable of governing because of his physical incapacity, but nothing Raul is doing, my guess is, he's doing against Fidel's objection.",
        "Mm hm.",
        "Nevertheless, a lot of people are going to say, well, first of all, this is incremental and nowhere near enough.",
        "Well, of course not.",
        "Look, if anybody thinks that the narrative is going to unfold as Jimmy Carter going down and monitoring a multi-party election, and the IMF going down and restructuring the economy, that's wrong.",
        "But incrementalism is about all that that regime in order to stay in power will allow.",
        "And the Cuban people are quite cautious, but they are desiring change, and this step-by-step little process over time.",
        "And there are more measures, that we can talk about that you didn't enumerate, are going to deliver, I believe, real change within the framework of socialism.",
        "And that's what's really important to understand.",
        "Within this framework of socialism, yet our experience of socialist states, once they start introducing seemingly minor reforms, is that it's sometimes the top of a very slippery and steep slope.",
        "I think that's right and this socialist state also observed, over the last 20 years, and 20 years ago as the Berlin Wall fell, and observed that incrementalism, carefully controlled, is critical.",
        "And I think that's why the pace of change will continue to be deliberate and slow, and some of it will have a psychological effect, such as allowing the cell phone purchases.",
        "Now, not everybody can buy those, but knowing now, as a Cuban, that I have a right to buy them changes by frame of mind and my relationship to the state, in my view."

        "Now, this leaves the question open about the Internet access.",
        "Yes, it does.",

        "And specifically put on the table is the issue of the access to Internet.",
        "This is a moment, now, where Cubans are talking more freely about dissent, about freedom of speech, about the meaning of democracy than they really have in 50 years.",
        "So, I'm not sure they know where this is going, but the computer issue, the Internet issue, the move to a single currency.",
        "They lifted the cap on wages.",
        "They're also going to, I believe, privatize.",
        "They don't use that word, but they're going to begin to allow Cubans to get out from under the weight of the state by opening their own businesses.",
        "All slowly over time, but again, the idea is preserve - make sure not too much inequality grows as a result of this, because that's a firm piece of this revolutionary ethos, but also, get the state out of the way so that the state can worry about paying for the social welfare system that all Cubans believe that they're still entitled to.",

        "Perhaps she may - she failed to mention a major change, which has to do with agriculture.",
        "That's mainland people who work in and produce food because production of food is key for Cuba.",
        "So, that will be a major part of the reform, but of course, like she said, all the changes are seen by Cuba with a positive eye because they constituted sensitive prohibitions that are now being removed.",
        "So, Cubans in general (unintelligible) welfare.",
        "I am a Cuban (unintelligible) to start with and I welcome them.",
        "It's - curiously, the cell phones in the new system in Cuba seem to work about as well as our cell phones here, a lot of the time.",
        "So we're having a little difficulty hearing you.",
        "Nevertheless, is this reform being greeted with open arms by a lot of people?",

        "Why (unintelligible) someone who sells it to you without any guarantees when you can buy it directly from a shop?",
