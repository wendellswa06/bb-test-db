        "Americans can't because American law bans tourist travel to Cuba for reasons that have to do with domestic politics, but that may change, because Raul Castro's changes are prompting a discussion here in Washington, I think, among both political parties, especially after this election, about exactly how useful our sanctions, including against travel, are in this new environment.",

        "So maybe the footage he's seeing is old stock but the stores - the images I thought of - saw on news stores were all kinds, but I don't understand the technology and I'm pretty sure they're going to introduce the new phones."

        "I was wondering, with cell phones, I read that the contracts alone cost about half a year's salary, and so a lot of people are relying on foreign relatives to pay for these contracts and cell phones, because on a state salary in Cuba it's so expensive.",
        "Are people going to not feel equal like they want them to feel anymore?",

        "OK.",
        "It's a very tough question.",
        "I can't answer if people don't want to feel equal, but I think, as I said, preventing too much inequality is a pretty big part of the Cuban ethos of this population that's still on the island, and yet freedom also brings inequality.",
        "We saw it in the transitions in the socialist bloc.",
        "We've seen it in the transitions in other developing countries away from, sort of, state-run monopolies on economic activities.",
        "So I think this a choice and there is - willing to tolerate a bit more inequality in order, in Raul Castro's language, to create wealth.",
        "You don't hear Cuban revolutionaries talk about productivity, efficiency, and the creation of wealth, but that's the kind of language that's getting thrown around right now because there's a realization that you can distribute impoverishment equally, but also, perhaps, commit suicide politically.",

        "Well, yes, I do.",
        "But I think the Cuban government is absolutely expert in managing the dissent and in challenging - and in channeling the dissent.",
        "And we see, not only, for example, with that Writers and Artists Congress, the findings of which in proceedings with were broadcast nationally and printed nationally.",
        "But we're also seeing the newspapers having a lot more space to do investigative reporting, to report on powers, depredations, and on corruption and on bad and nasty bureaucracy.",
