        "I've forgotten how much, but it was thousands of dollars in new, crisp $100 bills.",

        "And that led us into a discovery, for instance, that the $100 bills actually came from a Florida bank, and they were the fruits of a check for $25,000 which had been contributed to the committee to re-elect President Nixon, the so-called CREEP, committee to re-elect.",
        "And that was vital information.",

        "And we were back in the office in five minutes.",
