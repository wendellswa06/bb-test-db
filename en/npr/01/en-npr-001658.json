        "Michael White, how strong is Tony Blair's political position at home these days?",
        "It's weaker than it was before he went into the deserts of Iraq.",
        "As your listeners will know, he was re-elected with a parliamentary majority.",
        "This is a parliamentary system, so the president and the Congress aren't separate in the way that they are in the US, with a majority of 67 rather than a hundred and sixty.",
        "On the other hand, it's his third term, and most governments would consider that pretty good, and his critics in the Iraq War, which is a great dividing issue in Europe for the last three or four years, Chancellor Schroeder and President Chirac of France, dare I say it, are in much bigger trouble themselves.",

        "The 10:8 vote was hardly a victory for the Bush administration.",
        "While all the committee Republicans agreed that the president's pick should get an up or down vote on the Senate floor, some made clear they see him as a problematic UN ambassador.",

        "So how much is the central government function in government - how much does it actually control?",

        "In the eastern city of Tobruk, we have a parliament that was elected in national elections in June.",
        "And then in Tripoli, we have a so-called government, which was basically formed last month after the airport changed hands by a failed former prime ministerial candidate, who was asked by the Tobruk parliament's predecessor, the national congress, to form what they called a national salvation government.",
        "So now we have a situation where two bodies - claiming to be the legitimate government of Libya.",
        "Can you clarify for us with all of these factions and even different countries at play here, is this fighting about religious ideology or is it about the country's resources?",

        "It's more to do with the competition between old elites and the new elites that were created after the 2011 revolution.",

        "But I think the problem is that I think the United States is much more willing to put more sanctions on him than the Europeans are, and yet these sanctions won't work well if the Europeans aren't on board with a lot of them.",
