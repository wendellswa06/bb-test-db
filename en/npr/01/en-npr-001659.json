        "intelligence officials tracking what's going on in Syria are watching one group in particular: al-Qaida's affiliate in Iraq.",
        "An interesting detail about that group is that its early members weren't just Iraqis.",
        "For the most part, they were Syrians.",
        "Zarqawi, the once-leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, had recruited heavily from the ranks of Syrian fighters to create his northern Iraqi faction of al-Qaida.",

        "Weapons, material, people are flowing back from Iraq into Syria.",
        "Assad allowed that rat line to flourish, and he fed the jihadi beast in Iraq.",

        "U.S.",

        "That's why intelligence officials are looking for more subtle signs.",
