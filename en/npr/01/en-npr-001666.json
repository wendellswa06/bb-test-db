        "That's according to the Monitor Group's Michael Zielenziger, who's written on the topic.",
        "To me, 80,000 Ph.D.s coming home from the States, from Europe, to work in Chinese laboratories is a pretty impressive number, especially when you consider that when it comes to things like clinical trials, you can run a lab bench in China for 20 cents of the dollar it costs in the United States.",
        "And official spending on science will only increase, even as U.S.",
        "budgets are cut.",
        "China's R and D spending will be hiked to 2.2 percent of GDP in 2015 - from 1.7 percent now - with a focus on specific fields like nanotechnology, clean energy and stem cell research.",
        "They're putting a lot of money into this area.",
        "So I'm amazed how much money.",

        "I'm rocked.",
        "I really am rocked with what this country can do in such a short time.",
        "Imagine, the next five years or next 10 years, and I would think it's very likely that the science here will be the dominant science, probably in the world.",

        "And so a proud technological achievement has become an embarrassment.",
        "Speaking before the accident, Denis Simon told NPR that China's leadership was unsure their investment in science and technology was bearing fruit.",
        "The anxiety, I think, that exists at the central leadership levels is that after spending all of this money and buying all this equipment and training all these people, they're still not seeing the bang for the buck, as we would say in the West.",
        "There is this kind of trepidation to break the mold, so we don't see a lot of radical innovation in China.",
        "So what's holding China back?",
        "One answer could lie in a recent scientific scandal - a leading geologist sacked after accusations he embezzled $1.5 million of research funding to spend on his three mistresses.",
        "Indeed, the Chinese Academy of Sciences admitted it spent $44 million last year on overseas trips, official cars and conferences.",

        "It's a pleasure to be on the show.",
        "Now what does that mean, extreme male brain?",
        "Well, in the general population, we find differences between the typical male and typical female.",
        "For example, males seem to be more interested in systems and females seem to be more interested in people and particularly people's emotions.",
        "So if you take an extreme of that, it would be somebody who's very, very interested in systems but maybe has difficulty reading other people's emotions.",
        "And those, in fact, are the symptoms of autism.",
        "Well, that's right, so that's why we're beginning to look at whether autism might simply be an extreme of the sex differences you see in the general population, an extreme of the male brain.",
        "You have looked at both the physical and the psychological differences in the male and female brains.",
        "How do you map that?",
        "Well, we measure this through a range of difference psychological tests, and males tend to report they're more interested in systems like maps or mathematics.",
        "And questionnaires relating to empathy, like, you know, how quickly you can pick up on what somebody else is feeling or thinking, where women tend to score higher than men.",

        "Sure.",
        "I mean, socialization is bound to be important in shaping these sex differences.",

        "And do you posit that that may come from prenatal testosterone, particularly that the more prenatal testosterone the fetus is bathed in, the more prevalent the signs of autism?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, we've done some research using amniocentesis where you take some of the amniotic fluid from the womb, and as you say, you know, the more testosterone the fetus is producing, the less eye contact the child makes after they're born and the slower they are to develop language.",
        "Well, what about environmental factors?",
        "Many parents think that mercury, for example, might be a cause of autism.",
        "Yeah, and I'm following that research; it's mostly coming out of the States, and it's very interesting.",
        "But over and above that, my theory suggests that the parents of children with autism may be strong systemizers themselves, and the idea here may be that when two strong systemizers marry and have a child, that may influence the risk that the child will have autism.",
        "So the mother would exhibit these traditionally male characteristics, as you describe them.",
        "That's right.",
        "And how would your theory lead to a cure?",
        "Well, I would use the word `intervention' and `support,' because many people with Asperger syndrome, for example, would become resistant or even offended by the idea that they need to be cured because they simply want to be recognized that they're different.",
        "But having said that, individuals who are much more disabled--they may well be very positive about the idea that treatments could remove some of these more disabling symptoms.",
        "You would simply remove some of the testosterone?",
        "Well, I think we should be clear at the moment that the testosterone research is really aimed at trying to understand the causes of the condition.",
        "But you're right that in years to come, if that theory is confirmed, it could lead to a hormonal treatment.",
        "But my own perspective is that this would be ethically very controversial because it could lead to an intervention in the womb where changing an individual's hormone levels could change the nature of their personality and the way they think."
