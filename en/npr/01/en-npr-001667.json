        "You know, I think - I agree with Faye that time will tell.",
        "I also think that throughout the process since June 5th when the official primary season ended, many of her supporters, not all but some, have been looking for an opportunity to express that support.",
        "So, they've started rallies and organizations to trying to impact the role call.",

        "But it does raise the question, does it not Faye, whether or not Hillary could have guaranteed victory for the Democrats had she been on the ticket?",
        "Well, I don't think anyone can guarantee victory for any candidate.",
        "But let me just respond to something that was said about not seeing any anger.",

        "Before yesterday's speech Hillary actually addressed a group of women, Women Count, and those women they were angry.",

        "Masterfully brilliant, and what I mean is she knew she couldn't get up there and talk about Barack Obama's experience, or his ability to be commander in chief, or anything about that.",
        "But what she did was she turned this fight into the Democrats versus the Republicans, and she said look, OK, I'm not your therapist.",
        "I know some of you are upset that I lost, but check it out, it doesn't make sense if you are a Democrat to go from me to John McCain.",
        "If you're a Democrat and it was about the issues and not about me, then you need to vote for Obama and not McCain.",
        "It was brilliant.",

        "I know that the McCain camp and I know the Republicans are going to be ready to say, OK, that was nice and beautiful and everybody played on everybody's emotions, but where is the beef?",

        "So, had he had this in the normal setting, they'd say, oh what?",
        "He doesn't have the confidence to address a larger crowd?",
        "Why is he not letting more people in?",
        "So, he opens up to have tens of thousands of more involved, and all of a sudden this would feed the Republican meme of his celebrity status.",

        "Well yeah.",
        "It will stick.",

        "But let me say this.",
        "I think that there is maybe more to her speech than meets the eye.",
        "Well, actually did meet the eye.",
        "That perhaps there were some dog whistles.",
        "Some coded language.",
        "I was struck by the orange.",
        "You know, Hillary is known for three colors, black, pink and yellow.",
        "But yet she turned up last night in orange.",
        "That's also the color of Women Connect - Women Count rather, the group with which she met with before the speech.",
        "Also in her speech she talked about Harriet Tubman and keeping on.",
        "That could be a signal to her supporters to keep on, keep up the good fight because for them the sexism and gender bias in the political process, which is now incorporated in the Democratic platform, those are issues that matter to her supporters, to a lot of her supporters.",
        "Well, I'll tell you what.",
        "We've talked a lot about Hillary's speech last night, and that's what we wanted to do, but tonight is the night of another two speeches that are also important.",
        "The vice presidential running mate Joe Biden takes the podium, but it's the speech of former President Bill Clinton that is the most anticipated event of the evening.",
        "So, Baratunde, given what Hillary said last night and how the convention floor reacted to her, do you think that will have any bearing on what Bill is likely to say and do tonight?",
        "I think that the best thing Bill Clinton could do is just repeat Hillary Clinton's speech.",
        "She did that well, and he has had a very tortured and troubled relationship with a lot of Democratic voters, especially African-Americans, but not only.",
        "I think that he can do the most by just not doing any worse.",
        "Let me follow that up with you with this.",
        "The mano-a-mano relationship between Bill and Barack Obama has been an ongoing storyline of the campaign since the early days of the primary battle between Barack and Hillary.",
        "Can one night's speech really change any of that?"
