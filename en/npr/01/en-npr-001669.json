        "Today, about 9 percent get grades of less than C, and in 1969 it was 25 percent.",
        "So grades have really shot up.",
        "However, 45 percent of these kids are taking remedial courses, and 60 percent, three out of five, think their grades understate their intellectual abilities.",
        "And the reasons for it are, in part, that this is a generation that was brought up never having skinned their knees.",
        "Their parents have been very protective, and a lot of kids have won awards.",
        "They've all won awards, is the way deans of students described it.",
        "They said: You may have won an award for the best trombone player born on April 5th.",
        "But they've all won awards.",
        "And that...",
        "So they expect applause for the things they're doing, and grades below A-minus don't count for applause.",
        "And that parental involvement, perhaps interference from time to time, that is also continuing.",
        "That's amazing.",
        "When we asked deans of students what the biggest change they experienced was in the last decade, the answer, overwhelmingly, was parent involvement.",
        "And we're having now is kids calling their parents - 40 percent call their parents at least once a day, or text or email.",
        "One out of five calls at least three times in a day.",
        "And what's happening is parents are also much more involved in college life, so that for more than a quarter, the parents have intervened with a professor or an employer.",
        "And for one out of five, they've intervened with a roommate.",
        "So these parents are much, much, much more involved than the parents in the past.",
        "We're talking with Arthur Levine about \"\"Generation on a Tightrope: A Portrait of Today's College Student.\"\" That's the name of his new book.",
        "But we're also talking about the pressures that so many students face these days, the pressures to succeed, and how all those pressures can change college from what they expected."

        "And from - my fiancee's in a similar position, and most places around, especially in San Antonio and South Texas, are looking for people who already have several years of experience, and no entry-level jobs, or at least very few are willing to train.",

        "And what would you have done as a civil engineer?",
        "I would have hoped to have gone into infrastructure, but be - especially from transferring from the community college level to the four-year college level, if you don't have a 3.5 or above GPA, there's no way that you're going to get in any school that's of note.",
