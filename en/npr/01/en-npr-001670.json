        "Hello?",
        "Hi, Devon.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "Hey, how are you doing?",
        "Basically, I'm a first-time student, 25 years old.",
        "So I'm not like the freshmen in terms of being 18 and under.",
        "I kind of just was - whenever I came into it, I don't know, like I was - it definitely was not meeting my expectations in a way, mostly in terms of - just in terms of I'm going for a BFA degree, a bachelor of fine arts.",
        "And the first thing I noticed was just in terms of how many hours you have to take to get a BFA is, of course, you know, it's obscenely large.",
        "I unfortunately don't have my parents, you know, providing for me in any way, shape or form.",
        "So I'm mostly going to - I'm working fulltime and trying to juggle getting an art degree, which, of course, it's really frustrating because it's like, you know, trying to juggle these studio classes that are straight-up three-and-a-half-hours long and worth the same amount of credits that, you know, like a one-and-a-half-hour class is for all business students, or such and such, and then finding myself, you know, struggling to be able to either make the class on time because of either I'm working overtime or having to be late to work because I'm in class.",
        "You know, on top of that, doing projects for art - which, of course, is a lot longer than, you know, just writing an essay.",
        "So it's just, like, I don't know.",
        "I was, I guess, expecting a little bit more foundation for those of us that don't have a lot of things that are being provided for us by our parents and things like that, because the loans - as huge as they are, because they are huge - they're still not nearly enough to survive off of, and they're still not nearly enough to cover everything that they've got to cover.",
        "And so your expectations were that you'd get some more support from the college, at least in terms of practicality.",
        "Well yeah, in terms of, like, you know, I'm working, like, a $7.50, you know, job.",
        "Like, I'm not making a lot of money.",
        "I have to work a severe amount of hours just to be able to survive.",
        "And, like, you know, I'm not getting any grants at all.",
        "There's no grants being provided, even though I'm sure I qualify for them and I've applied for them.",
        "And the loans themselves just aren't helping.",
        "So for us art students who, you know, have those courses that require just so much time and so much extra time compared to, like, writing an essay or something like that, you know, it's just a situation where, you know, you have to - I don't know.",
        "It just gets very, very overwhelming very quick.",
        "I will defend essayists and point out that a good one takes some time to work out, too, but I get your point.",
        "And we wish you the best of luck."

        "Actually, students are more satisfied with college now than they've been any time in the last 30 years, which is kind of a surprise.",
        "But Devon's experience is the experience students are having.",
        "It's not only older students.",
        "It's younger students who are having to work more than they've ever worked before and are finding that it's just harder.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's harder to do the work the college requires because they're so busy on jobs.",
        "It's harder to take as many classes.",
        "So it's harder to graduate.",
        "It's an incredible stressor.",

        "Well...",
        "And by the way, that's another issue.",

        "And then they see him with a trained therapist, myself, and work in that way.",
        "But we also have outreach programs where we can work with many students at a time in classroom settings or in their residence halls, working on kind of stress management.",
        "What is a session like with a therapist and a dog?",
        "It kind of depends on what the goal for that client is.",
        "Each client meets with me and Sherman first, and we set up goals related to animal-assisted therapy.",
        "So if it's, you know, communications styles that are getting in their way, or that the anxiety is really high and making it hard to make decisions and move through a day, those kinds of things, then we make goals for that.",
        "If somebody's having a trauma reaction, and they just need a kind of supportive figure to kind of support them while they talk about that trauma, then Sherman will just simply lay his head on their lap and sit with them and be with them emotionally to support them while they talk.",
        "If it's something where somebody's really feeling really stressed out, and they're having a hard time even just taking deep breaths and thinking through the problem and making a sound plan about what they want to do next, we'll work through those kind of experiential things with the dog and help them kind of focus in one thing at a time.",
        "How did you - I'm not sure how this program originated, but let me ask: How did you convince the university that they needed a therapy dog?",
        "Well, it kind of came - but like a lot of good ideas come, by accident.",
        "We had this beautiful dog that I got as a rescued animal that was kind of supporting an older dog in my home.",
        "And while we were training him, everybody - the trainers kept saying he really has a personality to be a therapy dog.",
        "So I started looking into it and looking into the research and what that means and what kind of training they would need and what kind of help they can provide.",
        "And once I looked through that, then I talked to my boss, Joe Abhold, and he said get it all together, you know, make a statement about what you want and how that could be helpful for our students and our community on campus.",
        "So that's what we did.",
        "We really looked deeply into the research, and then presented that to the chancellor and then started writing procedures and what we wanted it to look like.",
        "And then that's how it kind of got rolling."

        "And if it fits in with the scope of what Sherman can do, then we go ahead and start making goals and do that.",
