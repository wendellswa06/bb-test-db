        "So, I am a active duty military in the U.S.",

        "So for me, the college experience has very much been a front-loading, heavily instead of taking the traditional 12 to 15 credits, doing 18 to 20 a semester (siren going off) to complete on time.",
        "And I was just listening to the program here and talk about students who are incapable of handling sort of the adult life, how - that one day when they run into these stressful situations, taking 12 or 15 credit hours and they just completely shut down.",
        "And then they turn against the curriculum of the professor, the syllabus.",
        "And it always got me just sitting in class listening to them complain about the workload assigned.",
        "And then usually the professors, I've noticed a lot of them would cave to the pressure of the students because they would just sort of build into a mob mentality in a class of complaints over the workload.",
        "And, of course, your workload is a lot higher.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And just - I mean I don't know if that had to do with, like, my military background being used to the higher workload, but students today, I (unintelligible) a lot of the younger people, they have a lot more opportunity growing up and a lot more - but I - personally, I think the financial resources available to them are fairly decent.",
        "It's just their work ethic, I think, that for the current on pressure on sophomores that I deal with is a lot lower than what I would use to dealing with in my own job experience in the Navy.",
        "So, in a sense, your expectation was it was going to be harder.",
        "Yes.",
        "I though it would be a lot harder.",
        "I mean, I was always a good student in high school.",
        "You know, worked hard, do the extra, go the extra mile.",
        "But I found a lot of students that I dealt with, their expectation was that, I'm paying - and a lot of their biggest complaints is how much it cost for them to go there and the fact that they're having - the biggest complaint was like, why is this - why are we doing this?",
        "Why are we doing so much work for this?",
        "Why is this so much harder than - I just think they were very spoon-fed growing up, I got the feeling, and then when they got to college and were expected to put out the effort, they just couldn't do it.",
        "Paul, thanks very much for the call and for the perspective.",

        "They really do want vocational skills.",
        "But, on the other hand, students need to leave - given they're going to live in a world of dramatic change - with creativity, critical thinking, continuous learning because whatever they know, it's going to have a really short half-life and they're going to have to learn throughout their lives.",
        "One final email question from Michelle in Ann Arbor: As a student at the University of Chicago, I always assumed doing well at such a prestigious college would more or less guarantee me a job.",
        "Once I got there it seemed much more important that my schoolwork was the endless search for internships and other opportunities.",

        "That may be, but the detentions also had another affect: They frightened many of those who had been mildly interested in Shiism who hurried home to burn their books on the subject.",
