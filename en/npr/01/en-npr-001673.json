        "Now, see, that's the question, and that's an interesting one because it was raised yesterday by John Conyers, who's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.",
        "Conyers said he does not believe that executive privilege would extend to any communication that was under the umbrella of the Republican National Committee because that's not in the White House and therefore not official White House business and not related to someone who's a senior advisor speaking privately with the president.",
