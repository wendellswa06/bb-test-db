        "And fortunately my voice was in good shape.",
        "His voice was in bad shape because of the weather and he was, could hardly speak.",
        "You know, so it was difficult for him to do the debate.",
        "Jefferson lost both times he ran for mayor.",
        "Still, as a state senator, and an increasingly powerful lawyer, he was seen as one to watch.",
        "At the same time, though, critics were starting to whisper about William Jefferson.",
        "They accused him of using his political position to funnel work towards his law firm.",
        "They talked about questionable real estate deals and tax problems.",
        "And they christened him with a nickname.",
        "Dollar Bill Jefferson.",
        "Ed Renwick directs the Institute for the Study of Politics at Loyola University in New Orleans.",
        "He says taken individually, none of the ethical scrapes William Jefferson got into seemed to amount to all that much.",
        "In 1990, Jefferson was elected to Congress and if there were any nagging ethical questions he seemed to leave them behind in the dust as he headed to Washington.",
        "Renwick says in subsequent years, it's helped that Jefferson never faced a real re-election challenge.",
        "If we had a place where each time a race came up, it was very contested, well, then people would be much more aware of all of these things.",
        "How long's it been since Jefferson's had an opponent for Congress?",
        "Sixteen years, to be exact.",
        "During that time on the Hill, Jefferson's made a name for himself.",
        "He's headed the Congressional Black Caucus, he sits on the powerful Ways and Means Committee.",
        "Loyola's Ed Renwick says Jefferson appeared to have it all together until just a few weeks ago, when the FBI released an 83-page affidavit accusing him of bribery.",
        "I couldn't imagine him doing such a thing.",
        "I mean, the gamble.",
        "If you're intelligent, educated, successful, making money and powerful, why do you want to gamble all of it?",
        "According to the FBI, to benefit his five children the document alleges he tried to cut his kids in on shady business deals and to line his own pockets.",
        "The affidavit also alleges Jefferson took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes, some of the cash ending up in the freezer of his Washington apartment.",
        "Here in New Orleans, long-time critics say it's just Dollar Bill at it again.",
        "His constituents, however, also here in New Orleans, actually seem more suspicious of the FBI than they are of their congressman.",
        "For the record, Jefferson maintains his innocence.",
        "If you think about it, William Jefferson's life is a classic American story.",
        "He rose from a poor town in the segregated South to Harvard Law School and on to the heights of power.",

        "President Trump is demanding to meet the whistleblower whose complaint prompted the impeachment inquiry.",
        "That complaint led the president to tweet, quote, \"\"Like every American, I deserve to meet my accuser.\"\" As NPR's Sarah McCammon reports, the president appears to be referring to part of the Constitution that gives criminal defendants the right to confront their accusers in court."

        "Of course, we're not talking about people in Alaska and various other places.",
        "But in the continental U.S., why do over 13 million people still describe themselves as hunters?",
        "Well, I guess that depends on how you describe necessity, or how you define necessity.",
        "You know, I'd argue that, and my research shows as well, I mean, the link between hunting and rural life, while it may not be a necessity from the standpoint of pure sustenance, you could certainly argue that many small, rural communities in Wisconsin and other places as well, it becomes something fairly close to a cultural necessity, where an awful lot of the traditions, the rhythms of the community, revolve around it.",
        "Tell us a little bit more about that.",
        "Well, um, and it's interesting because I actually grew up outside of that culture and I study it now, but it can be quite amazing in some of these small, rural communities, as you point out.",
        "Schools close.",
        "Businesses close.",

        "There are the rural places that are sort of the hot rural places, where people are wanting to move to, and those, typically, have lakes or mountains or coastlines or views of the Rocky Mountains in the background.",

        "Often hunting season can become something that really defines the year for these communities.",

        "I'm a great cook, and I like to cook the meat that I have harvested and tell the mostly true stories about the harvesting of the meat when my guests eat.",
