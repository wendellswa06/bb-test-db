        "We want to get a lot of listeners in and a lot of audience members here in Wausau involved in the conversation.",
        "If you'd like to be with us: 800-989-8255.",
        "That's 800-989-TALK.",
        "Our e-mail address is: talk@npr.org, and let's go to the phones first, and this is Craig and Craig's calling us from Oakland, California.",
        "Yeah, one of the things is that I grew up hunting in Idaho and Utah.",
        "And of the things is the cost of hunting.",
        "Like skiing and everything else, the professionals have taken it over, and you just can't go and do it on just the cheap as we used to, my uncles and nephews.",
        "Another thing, I think, is everyone has other interests and other things to do.",
        "In spite of that, we're a real complicated society now.",
        "People have got other things to do and I think, certainly, you know, I know if someone invited me out hunting now at this stage, with the movie Brokeback Mountain out, I'd never go.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I'm not sure, well, we're going to leave that alone, there, Craig.",
        "We're just going to leave that alone.",
        "Enjoy the Oscars, Craig.",
        "Thanks for the call.",
        "But I did, Richard Stedman, want to address Craig's first point, and that is about expense and, indeed, you look at some of the least prices that private landowners are charging for rights during hunting season.",
        "That's a lot of money.",
        "Yeah, one of the really interesting findings that we see is, even though there are many fewer hunters, the amount of expenditures spent on hunting have remained relatively stable.",
        "So that means each hunter who is participating is actually spending more money than he or she used to, and loss of land is, and loss of free access to land, has been a big issue in that.",
        "I know in the state where I am now, Pennsylvania, places that are up, for example, in the Northeast part of the county, Pike County, which is within commuting distance to suburban New York City and parts of New Jersey, the land posting rates where it's posted against trespass are up around 90, 95 percent of all private land is posted.",
        "So, hunters are increasingly having a more difficult time finding a place to hunt and, of course, we tend to turn to the free market for solutions like that.",
        "And if there's a market for it, then landowners are finding a way to capitalize on what's really, I think, more of a lack of social connection issue.",
        "If you're well connected in rural areas, chances are you know someone where you can get on to hunt for free, if we're talking primarily about cost of access.",
        "But in some places, that relationship seems to be broken.",
        "Christine Thomas, also, perversely the number of hunters is declining because of that more private land being unavailable or unless you've got a lease on it.",
        "You're having the public hunting land becoming more and more crowded.",
        "Well, that's absolutely right.",
        "And I think what you're seeing in places where there isn't a lot of public land, in Iowa may be one of those places, actually, as opposed to Wisconsin where we've got more than a million acres of federal forests, we've got state forest, we've got county forest.",
        "There's a lot of public land here, but it is very crowded.",
        "If you go to the Chequamegon National Forest, the most remote place that we have in Wisconsin, the least eroded place that we have in Wisconsin, any time during the fall, and I'm there a lot during the fall, any place you can pull a pickup truck off the side of the road, there's one sitting there.",
        "They're bird hunting.",
        "They're bear hunting.",
        "They're bow hunting."

        "Good afternoon.",
        "My name is Todd Paunke from Wausau.",
        "My question is, why won't more urban areas open up to bow hunters to help curb out of control deer populations, especially when we have tax dollars?",
        "We use tax dollars to pay for the sharp shooters.",
        "Mm Hmmm.",
        "Richard Stedman, I'm going to throw that to you.",
        "Any idea?",
        "Well, I guess a couple of different things are at work.",
        "I mean, one, clearly, there is, if not absolute safety issue, there's the perceived safety issue.",
        "There's the concern that people are still sort of run amuck in neighborhoods with bows, no matter how committed we know those hunters to be.",
        "I guess, though, my other response to that is that I think part of what you're suggesting may be part of the cure for what's going on.",
        "I mean there are a number of people who are arguing, really, if you want to save hunting, hunters need to re-articulate their role as wildlife managers and really the only predators that are capable of controlling deer populations or other populations of animals that suffer from over abundance at times.",
        "So, I mean, I think you're on the right track, from the sense of at least asking those kinds of questions and trying to figure out how it is that hunters can think of themselves and talk to society about their role as resource managers.",
        "As far as why there isn't more of that actually going on, you know my guess is, it probably comes down to one word, which is liability.",
        "Maybe the bottom line and concern about liability.",
        "Lawsuits, yeah.",
        "Let's get another listener on the line.",
        "And this Bob.",

        "I've raised two sons and both of them I've taken out hunting.",
        "One's 16, the other's 20.",
        "Ever since they've been able to walk, I've taken them out in the woods, and from these experiences they've learned everything from environmentalism to conservation, to overwhelming sense of spirituality.",
        "And the whole process of hunting and the appreciation and the respect of the animal and the reality of what killing something really is, is something that nobody can apprehend other than a person who actually does it, and you'll never get that from a video game.",
        "You'll never get that from a TV show.",
        "It just gives you an overwhelming sense of your-the symbiotic relationship that you have with the earth, itself.",
        "And that's what we have to pass on to all the hunters and all the non-hunters that don't understand what hunting is all about.",
        "And do your sons continue to hunt, Bob?",
        "One is 16 and has hunted ever since he shot his first squirrel and grinned from ear to ear.",
        "My other one is 20, who after he shot his first squirrel, actually broke down and sobbed, didn't hunt for eight years.",
        "Never forced him to, and now he is training to become a law enforcement officer and this is his first year that he's decided to go back into hunting whitetail deer.",

        "He's also with us here at the UW Marathon County Theater.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Wisconsin's Department of Natural Resources relies heavily on hunters to control the deer herd, and for money, as well.",
        "What's going to happen to wildlife management if the number of hunters decline?",
        "Well, it's a very real concern.",
        "Our deer population in this state is somewhere around 1.5 to 1.7 million deer.",
        "We have about 650,000 deer hunters in the state.",
        "If that would decline, say in the next 30 years, to half, the deer population in the sate would be out of control.",
        "It's a rapidly expanding population and, in fact, as was mentioned previously, hunters are the major wildlife management tool for deer management in the state of Wisconsin.",
        "Mm hmmm.",
        "Talk to us a little bit about the politics of hunting.",
        "Obviously, in Wisconsin, I don't think it's a party issue, but broadly speaking, do hunters fall squarely into the Republican camp or the Democratic camp?",
        "Well, you know, I look at the demographics of our membership.",
        "I mean, clearly, there's hunters across the political spectrum.",
        "I think it's a rural, urban issue.",
        "I think there's higher populations of deer hunters per capita in rural areas, which tend to be more Republican or Independent, but it is not, in terms of why people go into hunting, it is not a political issue.",
        "Well, you'd think hunters get support from Republicans on gun issues?",
        "Really, it's, the parties, there are wedge issues being used by political parties in various issues.",
        "And you see the gun issue being used as a wedge issue, habitat protection may be going the other way.",
        "Yeah, that might be more a Democratic issue.",
        "More regulation, that type of thing, so it has been interjected the last ten years, but I think that most hunters, they don't view this as a partisan issue; this is a cultural issue."

        "We are opposed to Assembly Bill 586, which would lower the legal hunting age in Wisconsin from 12 to eight years.",
        "This isn't an anti-hunting stance.",
        "It is a stance based on public safety.",
        "There are certain developmental milestones, certain developmental stages through which children go which cannot be accelerated simply by changing a legal age.",
        "The National Farm Medicine Center has done a great deal of research into what sorts of jobs children can safely be given to do on farms.",
        "And out of that research comes a great deal of evidence that children who are eight and nine years-old lack physical strength, lack coordination, lack the ability to perceive their environment in a way that would make them safe hunters, regardless of their supervision.",
        "Moreover, training courses have not been shown to be consistently effective.",
        "Very intense behavior modification courses with a great deal of feedback may be successful, but education materials courses, such as the Eddie Eagle course that the NRA promulgates has not been shown to be effective.",
        "And the final thing is, that the, if you did have an effective course, the legislation does not mandate that anyone participate in it.",
        "The eight to 11 year-olds don't have to participate, nor do their mentors.",
        "And that is setting up a scenario for tragedy.",
        "George Meyer at the Department of Natural Resources and the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation, do you have a position on this?",
        "Yes, Wisconsin Wildlife Federation does support the bill you're talking about.",
        "Let me tell you why, because I can tell you from my background and I'm responsible for hunter education program in this state for years, the last thing we would want is an unsafe hunt.",
        "Let me tell you why we believe there will be.",
        "In this state, there is an age of 12 years old for hunting.",
        "That went into place in 1973.",

        "Please, go ahead.",
        "There are 30 states in this country that have no minimum age, not even the eight year-old that's proposed in the Assembly Bill.",
        "The safety record from those states is the same as the safety record in the state of Wisconsin.",
        "Most of the youth eight years-old or nine years-old, probably are not going to be deer hunting or big game hunting.",
        "They're going to be doing the squirrel hunting, the rabbit hunting.",
        "Now .another fact that really doesn't come into play, most hunters in the state of Wisconsin got into hunting before the 12 year-old limit came in place."
