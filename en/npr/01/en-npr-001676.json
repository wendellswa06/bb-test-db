        "I started hunting when I was eight and nine, and I would venture to say the majority of hunters over the age of 32 in this state, hunted before they were 12 years-old and, in fact, it is one of the safest sports there are.",
        "It was mentioned, in the old, there's one out of seven citizens in this state goes deer hunting.",
        "The opening day of deer hunting season in this state, there's 650,000 to 700,000 people out with rifles and shotguns hunting in this state.",
        "That's as many people as in the active army.",
        "And in this state there's, what, ten to 15 accidents, firearm accidents a year, probably over a million days of deer hunting in a deer hunting season.",
        "It's extremely safe.",
        "If you look at all the safety, more than just the gun related accidents, but people breaking legs or whatever, it's a safer sport than aerobics.",
        "It's the 29th safest, in the list of sports, cheerleading and aerobics are more safety conscious.",
        "The bill has several protections.",
        "You either, if you're under 32, you, as a mentor, you have to have hunter education or otherwise you're probably a more experienced hunter anyway.",
        "And you have to teach hunting safety principles to the youth.",
        "You literally have to be in the grasp, the youth has to be being touched by the adult, and in fact there can only be one firearm.",
        "So it's a true learning experience.",
        "I'm very convinced it's going to be a safe experience.",
        "It surely has been in the other states that have, in fact, don't have a minimum hunting age.",
        "Thanks very much for the question.",
        "Let's get back to our callers and this is going to be Tim.",
        "Tim's calling us from Charlottesville, in Virginia.",
        "Yeah, hi Neal.",
        "I'm just calling because I wanted there to be one voice at least as an advocate for the wildlife.",
        "You know, I grew up in a hunting family, and was taken out hunting when I was a kid.",
        "But I, it never felt right to me, and I've heard one of your callers equate it with a spiritual experience with their children, and then one of your guests called it harvesting animals, but, you know, basically it's nothing more than taking a high powered gun, a weapon, and killing birds, deer, rabbits, whatever, who have no, you now, have no defense.",
        "It's, they're, it's hard to call it a sport when it's, you know, I just see it as a very brutal thing.",
        "I'm doing everything I can to protect the environment and animals that live in that environment, and I just thought it would be good to call and, you know, speak up for them.",
        "Christine Thomas, I wondered if you had a response to that.",
        "Well, first of all I think it's not for everybody, and I think that one of your callers actually showed that.",
        "I think you're caller has a political viewpoint and a personal philosophy that works for him, and I just don't happen to share it.",
        "Is there an element of cruelty?",
        "Do you, what do you think about the animals that you kill?",
        "Do you have an emotional relationship with them?",
        "Oh, I, I would say that yes, I do have an emotional relationship with them, and I don't think it would be unusual at all for a hunter to have the reaction that the caller, one caller's son had, as an example.",
        "And I think it would be very sad if you didn't have some feeling, because in fact you are coming face to face with your role in the ecosystem, in the way that you never come face to face with your role in the ecosystem if you don't participate."

        "That's right.",

        "I think there's broad, moral consensus that subsistence hunting, for example, is justifiable.",
        "There's also a broad moral consensus when you look at statistics and surveys that trophy hunting, canned hunting, those sorts of things are not justifiable.",
        "It's when you get into the middle ground that it becomes blurred and difficult and hard to deal with.",
        "One of the things that I think about this issue that's interesting is that you really don't have two groups of people--one of whom claims not to respect nature or animals and another that does.",
        "You have a controversy between two groups of people, both of whom claim a certain kind of respect for animals.",
        "And we've heard that today, we heard it in one of the callers and the panelists today.",
        "And, I think what you run into is you have two very different models for what it means to respect an animal.",

        "The anti-hunting model typically is a model of respect that is similar to that that we use when we talk about respect for human beings.",
        "We respect them as individuals with a certain kind of autonomy.",
        "We respect the fact that they are maybe mentally complex, socially complex, and when you extend that kind of respect, things like interfering in the life of an animal, killing an animal, seem intuitively wrong.",
        "I think the kind of respect that hunters claim to have is a different kind of respect.",
        "Often I think it's a respect that looks at an animal not so individualistically, but more in its ecological context.",
        "And when you start to think of a deer not just as maybe psychologically or socially complex, but as prey, which is part of the way that a deer is defined in its ecological role.",
        "Then it starts to make more sense to say that you can respect an animal, you can treat it in accordance with its ecological role.",
        "So hunting starts to make more sense.",
        "The real issue, I think, is that in recent years, maybe more than previously, and probably not in an area like Wausau where hunting still has a lot of hold, but the burden has really fallen on hunters to explain what they mean by respect.",
        "Because it's not what most people mean by that term, although I think hunters feel it very deeply.",

        "Why not?",

        "Hi Neal, I'm a student at the UW Stevens Point, just south of Wausau, and my question is that I think all of us would agree that killing an animal such as a deer or any mammal is a rather weighty moral question.",
        "And it would be hard enough, I think, for an adult to decide whether or not they want to kill an animal, but when we ask an 8-year-old whose intellectual facilities and their emotional faculties aren't fully developed yet, it seems like it would be rather hard for that 8-year-old to make that moral decision."

        "My question for Chris Diehm would be, are 8-year-olds really capable of being moral agents or not?",
        "And beyond that, there's the moral question about the deer dying from 8-year-old hunters.",
        "As a trap shooter shooting clay targets, I don't hunt but I shoot trap with a 12-gauge shotgun, you often hear hunters telling stories, and sometimes the hunt goes poorly, and a deer is crippled and it runs off crippled and they don't find the deer.",
        "And you hear these stories relatively often, and I think as an 8-year-old being a small person, guns being heavy, their skills not fully developed, it seems like it would hard for an 8-year-old to harvest a deer with a rifle or a 12-gauge shotgun.",
        "Well, even small game with a 20-guage shotgun, it's a heavy weapon.",
        "I would be afraid that the animals would be wounded and crippled and that seems like a moral problem.",

        "Yeah, Jim, you're right.",
        "You raise two questions, one is about what's happening to animals; the second is about whether or not children have moral faculties.",
        "In some sense that's a psychological question, but, if you were to treat them separately, I think it is often the case that parents raise their children according to a standard of morality that children themselves don't understand.",
        "So on that issue, I don't know that it's any different than any other complex moral issue that parents are trying to educate children about before they really fully understand the severity of it or the importance of it.",
        "It gets more complicated, right, because in this particular case, the way that you're framing it is that it's not just about parents teaching children something but that there's a third party, which is the animal, that may or may not suffer as a result of the child's skills.",
        "And so, that complicates it I think, and makes it different than other sorts of parental, parent-child moral issues."
