        "Yes, and, I think there's a perception that most 8-year-olds are going to be out deer hunting.",
        "What this really is, is parents will be making choices, and, looking at their child, if the child is interested in going, and taking them hunting.",
        "I would predict that, of the people that hunt-youth hunt at eight, most of them will not be big game hunting, deer hunting or bear hunting, because of the things you talked about, size and weapons or whatever.",
        "Most youths start, historically started small game hunting with small caliber weapons; you know, rabbits, or squirrels, or some other birds.",
        "I think you'll find some turkey hunting.",
        "I think you'll find, actually, a very small percentage of children that are 12 will be hunting at, that would have hunted at 12 would be hunting at eight.",

        "And good luck, apparently you impress your professors.",

        "You're on the air, go ahead please.",
        "Well, I just wanted to say I wanted to thank Christine.",
        "I started about five years ago, hunting, because of the Becoming an Outdoor Woman program in California, Northern California.",
        "I am neither white, nor male, nor did mother or my father take me out hunting.",
        "I'm an African-American woman from Philadelphia.",
        "But I found that the program was very supportive and the people, the guys who were affiliated with the program who actually took us out and taught us how to shoot and also how to be in the woods were very supportive of the program as well.",
        "And so, I have found a group of people who I really enjoy, who I probably wouldn't have never met any other way except for in this setting."

        "And what do you like about it most, Grace.",
        "I'd have to say the camaraderie.",
        "I mean I, you know, I have to say that I really enjoy the getting up in the morning.",
        "I enjoyed the being with people who I may not necessarily have anything politically to say to, but have very, you know, emotional ties to.",
        "And there's also, I don't know whether I'd call it a reverence or not, but there is something and I never actually thought about the meat that I eat until I started hunting and realizing that whether I'm, you know, buying it in the store is very sterile way of doing what I do when I go hunting.",
        "It, there is something to be, that really hits you in the face when you have, when you've shot a bird and you have to clean it and cook it.",
        "I mean, I, you know, I think there's something very different than going off to your local grocery store and picking out something that doesn't look at all like an animal.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Bye bye.",

        "Let's sort of return to that question, but, on the morals of hunting, but, do you think buying a chicken at Walmart morally superior to shooting a flying bird?",
        "And what about those of us who, myself for instance, see that eating deer venison, grouse, pheasants, woodcock, ducks, whatever it might be, as a way of independence in the same way that maybe cutting firewood or picking berries, or growing a garden.",
        "And I don't know who wants to field that one?",
        "Well let me throw it to Richard Stedman, because again, few of us pick our own berries these days, we tend to go down to the Giant or the A&P.",
        "Yeah, I think there's definitely something to be said for that connection; connection to our food, connection to the land, and I think more generally, I guess I'd argue that a lot of hunters have a special connection to place too.",
        "They come to know a landscape and a particular setting very, very well, and I guess, certainly I'm not a philosopher.",
        "I'll defer to my colleague at the end of the table.",
        "But when it comes to issues of morals, I think there's certainly an intellectual honesty that's to be gained by being an active participant in these multiple aspects of your life--whether it's how you heat your house, whether it's how you get your food, and these, and a number of other things.",
        "So, I tend to agree."

        "It has to stop being such a male preserve.",
        "Well I, obviously I agree with that.",
        "We didn't start the Becoming an Outdoors Woman Program to solve the recruitment to hunting issue, and as we got going with Becoming an Outdoors Woman, we discovered that it was even more than teaching women outdoor skills, it was about self esteem and rising self confidence and becoming part of a community.",
        "And I think Grace communicated those things to us.",
        "That transfer into human relevant pathogens is what we're worried about.",
        "However, women are 52 percent of the population, and historically state resource management agencies have ignored them as a public.",
        "And from a standpoint of the agencies who need--wildlife management is financed by hunters.",
