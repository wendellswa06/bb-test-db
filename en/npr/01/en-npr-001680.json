        "So, liberals who had lived in more conservative districts were more likely to now live in more liberal zip codes, and vice versa for conservatives.",
        "So basically, what the data is suggesting, Steve, is when liberals find themselves in a conservative zip code, they're more likely to get up and move.",
        "When conservatives find themselves in a predominantly liberal area, they're likely to do the same.",
        "OK.",
        "This is really interesting because the question is how is it when Americans move so much that we don't just end up with a giant salad, with a giant mix where things are ideologically very similar from place to place.",
        "And it's because people, by choice or otherwise, are moving to live closer to people more like themselves.",
        "Yeah.",

        "This is not a new idea.",
        "There was a book called \"\"The Big Sort\"\" by Bill Bishop that explored it some years ago.",
        "The idea was that people were somehow deliberately, or nearly deliberately, sorting themselves ideologically.",
        "But does this research prove that that is why people are moving to live among people who are politically similar to themselves?",
        "Well, Nosek and his colleagues tried to figure out if there was an experimental way to test this.",
        "And it's very tricky to test this experimentally, Steve, because when someone moves, is it because of their ideology or is it because of something else?",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "He gave people a questionnaire that was designed to trick them into feeling either more liberal or more conservative than they really were.",
        "Oh.",
        "So he asked people, for example: Do you think abortion should be legal under all circumstances?",
        "Now most Americans don't think abortion should be legal under all circumstances.",
        "But answering no to that question made volunteers feel more conservative than they might've been.",
        "Oh, even if you're pro-choice and you feel like you're a liberal, by stating this really, really far out liberal position, you feel kind of conservative by comparison.",

        "Now if you also ask other people: Do you think abortion should never be legal?",
        "Most Americans don't believe that either.",
        "But answering no to that question made people feel more liberal than they may have been.",
        "He then gauged how moving people's ideology, what effect this had on their willingness to move, and he found that when people sense that they were living among the enemy - so to say - they had a greater desire to pick up and leave.",
        "So in other words, this research suggests that your ideology, when you compare it with your neighbors, actually will influence you to move or it may be one of the factors that influences you to move.",
        "It might be one of the factors.",
        "And, you know, I asked Nosek whether he thought this was a good idea or a bad idea, and the interesting thing was he said it might be both.",

        "If I am in a place where I feel like I belong, where people are like me, then there's good evidence that my health outcomes will be better, that I will get along better with other people, that I will actually perform better on tasks because I'm feeling like this is a community where I fit in, I feel like I'm part of the community.",
