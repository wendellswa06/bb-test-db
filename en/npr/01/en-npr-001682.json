        "Once a year, Facebook holds a splashy conference for developers called Facebook F8.",

        "Hey there, Laura.",
        "Hello.",
        "So you heard this speech Mark Zuckerberg gave today.",
        "What was the tone?",
        "Well, I would say that overall, he was trying to balance being optimistic with apologizing for some of the things that have happened.",
        "You know, Zuckerberg came up on stage, and the first thing he addressed was what happened over the past few months, which was that an app developer gave information of some 87 million Facebook users to Cambridge Analytica, a firm that was working with the Trump campaign.",
        "He said they've already changed their privacy policies, and he said that what happened would never happen today.",
        "That said, they're still making sure no apps are giving anything away.",
        "And he said no one should expect perfection.",

        "And they will have consequences, and we will need to fix them.",
        "But what I can guarantee is that if we don't work on this, the world isn't moving in this direction by itself.",
        "And what he means there is that no one else out there is going to connect the world the way Facebook can.",
        "So he's trying to keep this balance between getting everybody excited about the mission of building Facebook and bringing the world together, which is what he always talks about.",
        "How did developers respond?",
        "You know, I spoke with a few of them, and some of them have actually lost customers since the whole privacy scandal began.",
        "One developer, Pete Haas, who helps small businesses on Facebook so that they can reach the right advertisers said many of them have pulled back, and they have a kind of wait-and-see feeling about the whole thing.",
        "He's concerned that if there are more controls on privacy, it's going to make it harder to target the users he thinks might buy their products.",
        "We use Facebook as the identity provider of the Internet and so that when you log in with Facebook, you can just do that easily.",
        "And when that happens, you request certain features.",
        "I just hope that they don't restrict those more."

        "Did they do that today?",

        "Well, a prominent Muslim seminary here basically said that because of the old fatwa against \"\"Satanic Verses,\"\" and because the book is banned, that Rushdie could not come, even though he was not coming to talk about \"\"The Satanic Verses.\"\" And they threatened protests.",
        "The organizers said they tried really hard till the very last moment to ensure there was enough security for Rushdie to be able to come.",
        "But then on the first day of the festival, they said they had been given information by intelligence bureau that three hired assassins were on their way from Mumbai to Jaipur and Rushdie decided that he couldn't risk it and he decided not to come.",
        "Is it possible that these threats were just a hoax?",
        "Well, Rushdie certainly thinks so.",
        "He's tweeted now that he had been lied to because the government basically did not want him to come to the festival and cooked up this story of these assassins.",
        "The Mumbai police said that they didn't really have any record of it, but the festival says that they did get the names of three assassins.",
        "So the net result is, hoax or not, Rushdie did not come.",
        "Even though he was not there, \"\"The Satanic Verses\"\" did play a role.",
        "I understand there were some authors at the festival reading from the banned book, which is illegal in India.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, they were asked to desist by the organizers because the festival says it was threatened with closure, and policemen showed up.",
