        "To what extent do they feel they represent people with irreconcilable differences on this?",

        "The ideological middle is dead in Congress.",

        "Russia and China are--while supportive of US goals on opposing terrorism, have certainly never been comfortable with the presence of US forces in Central Asia.",
