        "However, Steve, it's important to note that courts are in conflict on this very issue of what the legal standard is.",
        "There's no clear cut answer.",
        "And Federal Appeals Courts all over the country have issued conflicting rules about this.",
        "So depending on what state you're in as an investigator, you may have a different rule.",
        "Without going through all the nuances of this, what are some of the different rules that are out there right now?",
        "A federal appeals court in California has ruled that the FBI does not need a search warrant, or a judge's permission in advance of placing one of these devices in a suspect's car.",
        "However, more recently, a federal appeals court in D.C.",
        "has ruled that you do need a search warrant because these GPS devices amount to a search or a seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.",
        "Which bans illegal search and seizures.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And are there other parts of the Constitution that get involved in the court cases here?",
        "Attorneys for criminal defendants say the First Amendment may also be implicated here, because the First Amendment deals with the freedom to associate.",
        "And these GPS devices are so sophisticated that they can track a suspect going to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, to a rendezvous for an extramarital affair, to all sorts of things, like a church service, for instance.",
        "And they say through a mosaic of these data points you can track a suspect's daily life in ways that are extremely intrusive to someone's privacy."

        "Supreme Court?",
        "It does indeed, Steve.",
        "Because the federal appeals courts around the country have conflicted on this issue, that's one of the things that makes a legal issue very attractive for the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court down the line.",
        "I just want to ask one other question about this, Carrie Johnson.",
        "We have this issue about whether you can, without a warrant, slap a GPS device on somebody's car.",
        "This is the technological equivalent of just tailing them.",
        "Can the FBI right now just follow somebody without a warrant and see where they go?",
        "In some cases it can.",
        "However, the standard with technology is somewhat different.",
        "The Supreme Court first addressed this issue of technology and privacy back in 1983 in a case that involved a beeper device placed in a suspect's car.",
        "In that case the Supreme Court ruled that it was not an illegal search or seizure to place a beeper device in somebody's car without a warrant.",
        "However, in that case the high court ruled that more sophisticated electronic surveillance devices may require warrants.",
        "And defense lawyers and other folks in the privacy community believe that a GPS device may be just that.",
        "NPR's Carrie Johnson, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The delegate count goes from a trickle to a gusher this evening, and the results of today's primaries and caucuses will give us a much stronger idea of where this GOP presidential contest is headed.",
        "NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson joins us now.",

        "That's Dr. Charles Wysocki, another Monell scientist, who is investigating genetics and smell perception.",

        "But we did speak with them in the days after the shooting.",
