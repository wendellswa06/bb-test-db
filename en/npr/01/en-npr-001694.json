        "Now staying here in Florida, residents may be spared a direct hit from Dorian, but forecasters say dangerous storm surges, hurricane-force winds and power outages are still expected.",
        "For Floridians, the memory of Hurricane Irma two years ago is still fresh, in part because at least 84 people in the state died as a result of the storm.",
        "Twelve of those deaths occurred at a nursing home in Hollywood, Fla., near Fort Lauderdale after the storm knocked out power to the facility's air conditioning system.",
        "On Tuesday, four employees of the center were charged with aggravated manslaughter in connection with those deaths.",
        "That tragedy raises the question of whether the state is better prepared today, especially in caring for vulnerable residents.",
        "A Miami Herald report found that hundreds of nursing homes do not meet new requirements put in place since Hurricane Irma.",
        "Miami Herald reporter Elizabeth Koh is with us now from Tallahassee to tell us more.",
        "Elizabeth, thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Thanks for inviting me.",
        "So, Elizabeth, has the state taken steps since Hurricane Irma to ensure that facilities like nursing homes can continue to care for residents in the event of a major hurricane?",
        "Are they ready?",
        "The biggest thing that the state did after Irma was to pass regulations last year shortly after the storm hit to say that nursing homes and assisted living facilities needed backup power, specifically for their air conditioning, which is where the Hollywood Hills nursing facility failed.",
        "The regulations call for additional fuel storage in addition to powerful generators that can keep those temperature facilities running.",
        "And that was supposed to go into implementation at the beginning of last year's hurricane season.",
        "Last year's hurricane season - so did it?",
        "I mean, are these facilities ready?"

        "Hundreds of facilities needed more time.",
        "They cited delays with local governments that required additional permits, backlogs and contractors, difficulty getting the equipment installed.",
        "When we're talking about large nursing home facilities, we're talking about some pretty powerful, substantial generators that need concrete pads to sit on, things like that.",
        "So the state gave them an extension until the end of the year.",
        "So do you have a sense of whether the staff at these facilities and the families of the residents - do they feel prepared for the storm?",
        "That's something that the state is trying to check.",
        "Unfortunately, as we learned in Irma, that's something that can be difficult to determine with full certainty.",
        "The Hollywood Hills nursing facility, as we discussed, is a facility that had a generator on the premises.",
        "It just didn't power their air conditioning.",
        "It had an emergency plan, like a lot of nursing home facilities have now.",
        "But that was a plan that wasn't very thoroughly vetted by county officials.",
        "So the question of how safe nursing home facilities actually are - that's something that we're seeing local officials do site checks and calls to see if they can establish generator statuses at various facilities and ensure the safety of residents.",
        "But if you are concerned about a family member who is at a facility, it's worth calling and checking and asking how they're preparing for this storm.",
        "Are there any other lessons that the states learned from the tragedy that occurred in Hollywood Hills?",
        "Is there any - are there any other steps that they're taking to give the public confidence that something like this won't happen again?",
        "Well, there's been a big push by Senate Democrats in recent days, and again after Mueller's testimony, to press Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to allow votes on bipartisan election security legislation.",
        "Well, they're 419 delegates at stake.",
        "Georgia might have the most, but Ohio is certainly the biggest prize and the biggest test for Mitt Romney.",
        "We'll see, tonight, how well he does with white, working class voters.",
        "Ohio is a must-win state for Republicans in the fall, and he's had trouble winning over white working class voters.",
        "Santorum's done very well with that constituency.",
        "But, Romney has superior organization and resources, and he's been outspending Santorum on the air in Ohio by six to one and the polls are now tied.",
        "Well, if Ohio is, as you say, a must-win state for Mitt Romney, is it also a must-win state for Rick Santorum?",
        "And does Newt Gingrich have a must-win state, let's say, in Georgia today?",
        "Well, I think it is a must-win state for Santorum.",
        "If he's gonna slow Romney down, since he missed the opportunity to win Michigan, he does have to win Ohio.",
        "I think he'll also do well in Tennessee and Oklahoma.",
        "Gingrich has said, himself, that he has to win his home state of Georgia.",
        "But I think Romney, as the frontrunner, actually doesn't have to win Ohio.",
        "He has to do as well as he can there."

        "He probably will win Massachusetts, Vermont and Virginia, where he's the only candidate other than Ron Paul on the ballot.",
        "He'll also probably win Idaho.",
        "But winning Ohio, for Romney, would be a pretty good way for him to return to a project that he had started, but then had to drop a while back - which is convincing Republicans that he is the inevitable nominee.",
        "And even if they can't fall in love with him, they should fall in line behind him as soon as possible.",
        "Well, let's say he does well enough to be able to make that case.",
        "I assume there would then be pressure on the other candidates to drop out of the race.",
        "There will be pressure, but as long as there are superPACs and proportional primaries, there's not much effective pressure.",
        "You have seen, in recent days, Eric Cantor, Tom Coburn, other members of the Republican establishment coalescing around Romney, endorsing him.",
        "They want this process to end soon so that Romney can turn his attention to Barack Obama and the fall.",
        "It's very hard to see, after tonight, how anyone else could become the nominee, but because of the process that the Republican Party designed for this year, all the candidates will still have a pretty long hard slog to go before anyone gets 1144 delegates.",
        "Let's look ahead then to the general election campaign in the fall.",
        "How does that look right about now?",
        "Well, the general election looks OK for the president, at least for the moment.",
        "You know, he was asked today at the press conference what message he had for Mitt Romney on Super Tuesday and he said, good luck tonight - and then kind of chuckled.",
        "He's been very disciplined.",
        "He doesn't want to get into it with Romney just yet.",
        "He won't mention him by name, although he has plenty of indirect mentions of those folks on the campaign trail.",
        "But the head-to-head polls do show that the president is beating all of the Republican candidates by a couple of points.",
        "Not super comfortable for an incumbent, but not bad.",
        "Polls show also that Republicans have paid a very high price for this long nasty primary.",
        "Every single one of them are viewed negatively by more and more people as the primary has gone along.",
        "So the president has benefited by having his opponents engaged in a circular firing squad.",
        "Right now, he's enjoying a bit of a honeymoon, but all that might change as soon as Romney and his superPAC feel that they have the nomination at least in sight and can turn more of their resources toward the general election and to the president.",
        "And I think that will happen pretty soon.",
        "Well, we'll see later tonight if that has happened on Super Tuesday.",

        "And we've got Saleh of Yemen, who has been taken off to Saudi Arabia and hospitalized and seems to be under a kind of form of house arrest or detention by the Saudis in another country.",

        "Well, if you could speak for the best interests of the Libyan people and could figure out what the best thing to do with Moammar Gadhafi would be, what would you choose?",
        "The problem we have in Libya is that's not probably going to be possible because Gadhafi is under indictment by the international criminal court.",
        "So any country where he appears, other than Libya, is going to be under enormous pressure to put him on a plane to The Hague.",
        "And so, I think it's unlikely that Gadhafi will be able to find another country to take him, even if he could get out of the country at this point.",
        "There are conflicting impulses here.",
        "On the one hand, the billions that Gadhafi controlled, the new regime will want to get control of very quickly.",
        "On the other hand, there are old scores to settle and there are people whose parents and brothers were imprisoned by Gadhafi and want some sense of closure about the old regime.",
        "Which is why I think that the best approach really is the one that the Latin American countries and South Africa followed in their turn, which is to have a thorough investigation of all crimes, to have a truth commission, to make reparations to victims, but on the whole to avoid prosecutions of the leaders and the former regime in the short term."

        "The trial and execution of Saddam Hussein contributed to the sectarian war in that country, because it came too quickly and was done too poorly.",
