        "I think my sister and I, who are both biracial, made a little bit of a hipper walk for my Caucasian parents, but it wasn't that difficult.",
        "I think the biggest thing growing up as a kid was explaining that, OK, my mom's white and my dad's white.",

        "Which is kind of truth, because my birth father is black, so it is not a full lie.",
        "Then dad comes home, at like six o'clock, then he is going to have to explain it, and then it's all good, and then, you know, for the rest of the play time, you know, you don't have to worry about it.",

        "But those two instances are really the only race related things that I ever had to run across.",
        "My mom is my mom, and my dad is my dad, and there is nobody else that could take that part, and even though I don't look anything like my parents, I'm more athletic than my parents, it just, it never comes across my mind unless I'm talking about the issue of adoption, that these are my adoptive parents.",
        "What did your parents teach you about race?",
        "And I mean everything from black history to attitudes about race, and then, what do you think you taught them?",
        "Well, one thing they didn't teach me was how to pick my hair.",
        "Dad used a comb and that's pretty fun, because you know when white people get their hair wet and you put the comb through it, you get the nice little streaks.",
        "When black people get their hair wet, you know, you might get a little bead of water at the top of the fro, but that's about it, so that was a fun learning experience of them, because I always wanted the white people's hair.",
        "My sister and I tired to mousse our hair back like the people on MTV and my mom always wanted our hair so that she could pick it and it would stay like in one shape and what not.",

        "You know, the biggest thing that my parents did was to raise my sister and I in a very diverse neighborhood.",

        "You know, the study that came out I think is scaring people in thinking that you're going to have to through like a two year master program to learn how to have black kids, if you're white parents.",
        "And it's honestly, you could probably knock it out in two hours.",
        "It's really not that difficult, there's a few things that you should know.",
        "And bringing your kids up in a diverse neighborhood is the most important of that.",
        "And then, you know, if you have friends that are the same race of your kids, you just, you ask them for questions, and it's helpful to have them as a resource, it's something you definitely want to keep next to you when you're raising your kids.",
        "My sister and I made my parents cooler by bringing in some color to the Stigger family.",
        "And that's the benefit of it.",
        "It is a little more work as parent, but you get so much more out of it.",
        "And it definitely helped me and my sister to have the viewpoints of two white people and still have the viewpoints of us as biracial kids."
