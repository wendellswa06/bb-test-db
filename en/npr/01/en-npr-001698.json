        "Is there currently any legislation on tap that addresses foreign interference that we think has a chance of becoming the law?",
        "Not under current circumstances.",
        "And one of the major reasons for that is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has said that these measures are just not necessary.",
        "He and other Republicans have said that the relative lack of interference in the 2018 midterms signal that law enforcement and the intelligence community have basically all the tools that they need, although midterms and presidential elections are kind of a different animal.",
        "But Republicans have said and pointed to the fact that Congress has passed Russia sanctions in 2017 and the fact that Congress has already allocated nearly $400 million in election security grants to states over the last year.",
        "Essentially saying, at the moment, we're doing enough.",
        "Right.",
        "They're saying we've got enough; we don't need these specific, tailored pieces of legislation to protect the election in 2020.",

        "And the one thing that I thought would be nice was if you had a device that could be switched between the two.",
        "The problem with the voluntary closing devices is that you have to maintain pressure on them to continue to hold onto anything.",
        "And if you forget for a second, you drop it.",
        "So you could certainly imagine times when you might want either one of those and you don't want to have to change hands or arms in order to do that.",

        "We wanted not just to publicize our own designs but to invite other people to share their own as well.",
        "So is the idea of I guess what you call the Open Prosthetics Project that people have in mind exactly what they need in an arm or a leg, what activities are most important to them, and the design follows?",
        "You know, that's the hope.",
        "We haven't fully realized that on the current Web site, but our hope is that we could create a community where people could share needs and desires they have and then other people could potentially volunteer to create design ideas to solve those needs.",
        "I'm intrigued by a quote I've seen attributed to you.",
