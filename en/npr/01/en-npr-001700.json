        "And one of the things that my neighborhood Oak Park did, which is a suburb of Chicago, is to create a group called Project Unity, and it was just a whole bunch of trans-racial families that got together every once in awhile and had picnics and just talked and it was just nice to see that there are other biracial kids out there, other kids that had white parents or parents that were different colors than them.",
        "And that was really it.",

        "Well, yeah.",
