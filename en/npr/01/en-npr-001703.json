        "Once the programs were passed by Congress and signed by President Johnson, you were involved with running Medicare as part of the job as commissioner of Social Security.",
        "What issues did you run into in putting Medicare into place?",
        "Well, it was a fantastically massive job.",
        "The--Part B of Medicare, the coverage of doctors, is a voluntary plan.",
        "We had to try to reach every elderly person in the United States, like 19 million elderly people, and get an informed reaction from them.",
        "They had to file a claim if they were for it, and the way we set it up, they had to turn it down if they didn't want it.",
        "So that we sent punch card applications all over the country.",
        "We followed up three different times.",
        "We had groups interviewing them.",
        "And one of the most remarkable things about this job, not just beca--getting in touch with all the elderly, had to prepare the hospitals, and explain to them what conditions they had to meet, all the doctors had to be talked with about their responsibilities, and many, many things like that, setting policy.",
        "We had to expand to about 8,000 new employees all in a very short time, set up 100 new offices.",
        "All these things, the most remarkable thing, in my career, really, was the cooperation that we got everywhere.",
        "Other government agencies all put--pitched in to make this work.",
        "It ran from things like the US Postal Service truck having on the side of the truck that `Remember the deadline to sign up is March 31st.",
        "We had the Forest Service looking for hermits in the woods, even.",
        "We had everybody helping.",
        "All the welfare agencies in the country looked through their rolls for people over 65.",
        "All the nursing homes, the hospitals, and both private and the public agencies just were fully cooperative.",

        "Robert Ball, we appreciate your time today.",
        "Thanks very much for joining us.",
        "Robert Ball worked under President Lyndon Johnson to implement Medicare and he joined us today by phone from his office in Mitchellville in Maryland.",
        "Joining us now on the phone is one of Medicare and Medicaid's chief opponents in the 1960s.",
        "Edward Annis fought against the socialized health-care programs as president of the American Medical Association and he's with us now from his home in the mountains of northeastern Alabama.",
        "Good of you to be with us on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you; it's a pleasure.",
        "Now you vehemently opposed Medicare and Medicaid through both the Kennedy and the Johnson administrations.",
        "Tell us why.",
        "Well, the American Medical Association, and I spoke for most of the doctors of this country, believed that anybody in this nation who needs medical care should have it when they need it as long as they need it, whether they can pay for it or not.",
        "We opposed the program that would put a tax on young workers of America to pay for everybody just because they had a birthday, millionaires as well as paupers.",
        "We indicated that many young people, raising a family, when they have an accident or an illness, they often would need help because of inadequate income.",
        "And so our whole feeling was that the programs that should have been implemented and should have been carried on was one that started and operated under President Kennedy.",
        "It had been signed in law by President Eisenhower as one of his last things before he left office.",
        "That was the Kerr-Mills bill."

        "If they merely had inadequate income, it was working, and working well, and I reported it for the Ways and Means Committee in Washington on November 21st on the great progress of the Kerr-Mills bill to help the elderly who really needed it, but, unfortunately, that was the day before the assassination of President Kennedy, who had not opposed our presentation before him when I met with him in the Oval Office.",
        "Well, you just heard Robert Ball say that Medicare has fulfilled his fondest wishes for it 40 years later.",
        "Have you changed your mind at all?",
        "What do you think?",
        "No, my position is that today Medicare is a--being controlled and run and doctors are being dictated to by non-medical people.",
        "Managed care, for example, has made multimillionaires.",
        "Each year they make more money.",
        "And they're ripping off hundreds of millions of dollars that should go for health care.",
        "Now these are people who are limiting doctors in the time they can spend with patients, limiting doctors to 15 minutes, for example, in my area.",
        "For visiting a family physician, they want to limit 15 minutes to a visit.",
        "No doctor can practice good medicine that way.",
        "And it's the limitations from non-medical people that jeopardize not only Medicare but the general health of the American people.",
        "In retrospect, Robert Ball was also mentioning this was a fall-back position, that, really, the idea that they'd hoped to get through was a national health-care plan.",
        "A lot of people might say they regret they didn't get that done back in the Truman and, later, the Kennedy administrations, or the Johnson administration.",
        "Got you.",
        "Well, having visited the so-called universal health-care system in both Canada and in England, I can tell you that in England they always left it open for private patients.",
        "Patients could still go to their own doctor instead of a national health service.",
        "In Canada, however, no one can go to anyone except those that are dictated to by government.",
        "They limit the amount of money every quarter to the various provinces.",
        "And as a result of that, millions of Canadians have crossed the border into Michigan, into Detroit, where I was born and raised, to get health care that are denied them because of long waits under the system.",
        "What we opposed on that universal system--because wherever it has been tried, it is has led to less than quality medical care.",

        "For example, another one is wages.",
        "Globalized nations tend to have the highest manufacturing wages.",
        "So the more open you are to the rest of the world, the higher the wages of your workers.",
        "That was true of international adoptees as well.",

        "Many people seem to feel that children adopted at an older age are more likely to experience increased emotional problems.",
        "But Juffer compared children adopted under the age of one to children adopted between the ages of one and four and found no differences.",
        "There was no risk, not for the older adopted children, not for the young adopted children.",
        "Juffer says that this work, combined with a series of earlier studies which demonstrated that adopted children usually catch up to their non-adopted peers in physical, social and intellectual development, should change the way that people see adopted kids.",
        "There's a stereotype idea that an adopted child, it means problem.",
        "But if you look at it and you look at all the studies, then you see a quite different picture.",
        "But Steven Nickman of Harvard Medical School, who recently did a review of the adoption literature, says that while Juffer's study is careful and methodologically sound, there are some limits to her research.",
        "They don't talk about the kids who were multiple placements.",
        "They don't talk about the kids who didn't stay in the adopted families.",
        "They talk specifically about kids who stayed in adopted families and grew up in them.",
        "Essentially, Nickman says, the study doesn't include many of the most difficult cases.",
        "And as someone who works with adopted kids, Nickman knows that not all adoptions turn out well; some are incredibly painful.",
        "Still, he says, he finds Juffer's work encouraging.",
        "The hopefulness that they're presenting is relatively new and gives us additional reason to hope and to reassure our families that if they stick with it, the kids are likely to turn out feeling pretty good about themselves.",
        "And for Juffer, there's another lesson embedded in the results of her study.",
        "Part of what she feels the study demonstrates is that psychology's recent focus on the importance of very early childhood might be a little overdone."
