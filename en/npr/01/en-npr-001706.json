        "And people were yawning already by that time, and they had more - more missions to go.",
        "I think it would be a totally different story today, because of - it seems like the press agreed to go wrong with the story in a lot of ways, that these were happy family men.",
        "And none of their - none to the extracurricular activity, shall we say, that are alluded to in the book came out during that time.",

        "So my grandfather's contention is that Slick broke the sound barrier several years before General Yeager did, and when the Air Force took it over, of course, for public relations, they had General Yeager as the man on the record books.",
