        "It'd be my strong assumption that those FDA employees would be allowed to stay.",
        "So really the decisions have to come down to those fine details about whether an individual's presence on the job is truly essential to carry out that activity or whether you can in effect return to that activity whenever Congress and the president agree on whether to provide funding or not.",

        "He is president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union.",
        "Employees apparently are going to be told to report to work Monday, then they will be released.",
        "And those who are non-essential, non-exempt, will be released, and the other ones will be told to stay.",
        "Gage's union filed suit against the Obama administration this week, demanding details of the agency's contingency plans for a shutdown.",
        "Federal employees who work during a shutdown will be paid eventually.",
        "It will be up to Congress to determine whether those who are furloughed will be paid.",
        "Military personnel who remain on the job are certain of being paid, but just when is unclear.",
        "Many could miss a paycheck if the shutdown continues for any length of time.",
        "Gage says none of this is fair to federal employees.",
        "People are really steaming about this.",
        "They feel it's political theater and they are not only concerned about their jobs, their mortgages, their bills, their paycheck, but they also know how devastating these shutdowns are to programs that they believe in.",
        "Still, with so many federal agencies deemed essential, it's unclear whether most Americans will even notice if the government is shut down.",

        "Too often, when we watch, for instance, the news accounts of Mardi Gras and a sense of trying to get back to normalcy--while we want that to happen, not only for the city and its residents but for America to a great degree, with one of its great cities on its knees to some, to coin a phrase--we also want to be careful in knowing that those pictures can fool you.",

        "We are now six months out from Katrina, so somewhere along the way, it should have occurred to officials that they had a problem.",
        "You've got defendants--in some cases, they're just merely suspects who maybe haven't even been arraigned yet--who are entitled to speedy trial.",
        "We have a phrase here that comes out of constitutional law: Justice delayed is justice denied.",
        "They should have found a way to, by now, bring in extra lawyers.",
        "If their public defenders system can't handle the load, they could have brought in private lawyers to help out.",
        "They could have moved some of these suspects to neighboring counties that are in better shape.",
        "So this just, once again, shows that somebody down there...",
        "How do we do that, E.R., if there is no money in the till?",
        "Because all of those things are going to take money.",
        "Well, not necessarily, in some ways.",
        "If you put out a call to private law firms, this is an emergency, lawyers are obligated to do good work for the community, pro bono, public help.",
        "You can get some of them to volunteer to take on some of these cases.",
        "If they use their wits, they can find aggressive ways to probably plea bargain most of these--particularly, as you said, the pothead-type cases.",
        "There are options that don't require New Orleans to shell out that much money, and the notion of taking some of these people to neighboring counties that are in better shape--well, that's something the state can help with, and it doesn't seem to me it costs that much money in any other surrounding counties' budget.",
        "Well, I don't.",
        "I bet there'll be some argument there in terms of just manpower and the like, but I think you're right in the sense of the pro bono work and maybe thinking, as we clichely say, outside of the box.",
        "George Curry, when you think about the release of 4,000 suspects--and that's one of those headline grabbing things--but here's a reality: 42 lawyers, six investigators, six office workers and a $2.2 million annual budget before the storm is now down to six attorneys, one investigator, one office worker and, many people are saying, almost no money.",
        "Yeah, and the problem with transferring them to surrounding areas--a lot of them are already overcrowded.",
        "I mean, so that's the problem you have.",
        "I agree that lawyers are officers of the court, and they can perform some of these functions, but you're talking about an office here that got 75 percent of its funding from traffic court fines.",
        "Well, you haven't had--not only haven't had traffic court, you haven't had traffic in New Orleans--so it's a serious money issue that has to be addressed.",
        "The issue here, certainly, is for the--everybody's presumed innocent.",
        "So therefore, they are entitled to some kind of legal representation, even if they can't afford it.",
        "And that really is putting a burden on the prosecution's side because if you can't provide--if the state can't and city can't provide the lawyers for the people who can't afford them, you're going to have to let them go.",
        "Marcelo, do we have to--America, when I say we--have to look at this situation and understand that even though Katrina essentially destroyed a city almost overnight, the rebuilding of New Orleans will not happen overnight?",
        "Systems are very fragile, Ed, and this is really a paradigm of the, how, the ease with which a beautifully functioning model can be destroyed very, very, fast--and how difficult it is, all of the issues that we've been discussing to really build in a synchronic way, in a functional way, to bring back a functioning, working city.",
        "Cities are fragile systems and they need a tremendous amount of planning or thought, ingenuity, imagination and this is the challenge we face now.",
        "All right.",
        "We'll turn our attention to something that clearly is not as serious on one level as the rebuilding of New Orleans, but it's interesting to note because it speaks to Hollywood and the changes and lack thereof.",
        "We see that Tyler Perry's Madea's Family Reunion which is a comic drama, the genre that many of us see on stage across the country now.",
        "Black stage plays are very lucrative in the entertainment business--but Tyler Perry showed with his first movie, Diary of a Mad Black Woman, that made close to $100 million, is now the number one movie in the country."

        "We saw the black coaches be successful in the NFL and we thought a lot of them would be hired and we didn't see, only one who was kind of recycled, Art Shell.",

        "Now, they will be concerned about the money.",

        "I mean, it's not even close and there's a lot of money to be made and I'm sure people will be trying to find ways of making it, but I just don't know any significant way it's really going to expand black participation.",

        "And they are funny up to a certain point; but they seem to always tell the same story.",
        "But people who are church people, people who are very much family oriented find they like taking their families to events, whether stage plays or now movies, that have a moral to the story and indeed in this case, it's sort of a Christin moral to the story.",
        "There's similar kinds of shows touring the country that have done so for many, many years, but they're kind of underground as far as mainstream.",
        "There's concern.",
        "Now mainstream will be paying attention because of what's going on with Tyler Perry, so we may see something like Your Arms too Short to Box with God or some equivalent turned into something that Hollywood can make money off.",
        "Marcelo, we should note that Tyler Perry is not without his critics.",
        "Many people suggest that these movies and plays are very, very stereotypical.",
        "I'm curious, when you look at something like this that is stereotypical, that hits a gold mine, does that undermine the ability to try to move away from stereotypes because Hollywood will certainly attach the idea that, well that's what blacks want to see or that's what, in the case of Latino or Asians if a movie is stereotypical and it makes a lot of money, they'll say, well that's what they really want to see and they'll close down the other avenues.",
        "Sure, there's a problem.",
        "In other words, the more successful the film is, the more there is momentum or an impulse to try to replicate, especially the box office, if it does well in the box office.",
        "But, they have to understand that it's only a certain type of black audience that this kind of film will attract.",
        "There's still an audience for the kinds of film that did not do as well at the box office as they should have, such as Antoine Fisher.",

        "And, Marcello, I want to you to finish up your point though: the idea that while it's great on one end, it does become a double-edge sword.",
