        "OK.",
        "We should say some people have heard a lot about taking a knee in the political sense during this NFL season.",
        "In this case, taking a knee was just sort of ending the play and deciding not to kick this extra point.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's basically telling the referees, like, we're not running this play.",

        "I mean, is this an evil side of sports to have so much riding on something that might seem so meaningless?",
        "Or is this actually, on the flipside, make sports more fun for gamblers?",
        "I mean, if it's, like, a 19-point spread, you have what seems like a blowout of a game.",
        "But everyone can keep watching until the very end to see if it's like a 19-point win or a 20-point win.",
        "I mean, some people think that gambling is evil.",
        "So if you believe that, then, yeah, it's evil.",
        "But I see it and I think a lot of people who bet on sports see it as enhancing the game and making it way more fun because now in a game - and playoff games are different because everybody's invested in that because they want to see who goes to the next round.",
        "But in a regular season game, if there's a meaningless two teams that, you know, you don't want to watch - suddenly, you have money riding on it.",
        "Like, that's a game you want to watch.",
        "So it definitely is an enhancer.",
        "And I think that's why people bet on sports all the time.",
        "But was this game particularly crazy because it came down to an extra point, which is so routine in the NFL after a touchdown, and a team just decides to not kick it?",
        "Oh, absolutely, 100 percent.",
        "Teams have to kick an extra point.",
        "This is just what they do.",
        "So to see that kind of end that way is extra heartbreaking, I think, for gamblers.",
        "Well, I know you're a Giants fan.",
        "I'm a Steelers fan.",
        "Neither of our teams are still in it, so try to enjoy the rest of the playoffs as much as you can.",
