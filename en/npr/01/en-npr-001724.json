        "Well, thanks.",
        "Tell us what these seven funeral directors were accused of.",
        "Well, the seven funeral directors were paid a thousand dollars per corpse by Michael Mastromarino, who's the ringleader of this alleged band of ghouls.",
        "They provided the corpses.",
        "Mastromarino and his cutters - those are the technicians who surgically remove the tissue - would cut open the corpses, remove the bones, slice off and shear off the skin, take out arterial valves, spines and other material and sell them to three or four publicly-traded companies that in turn sold the material to hospitals, doctors and other healthcare providers for transplant into the living.",
        "Like an ACL, you know, anterior cruciate ligament for somebody who had torn the ligament in the back of their knee.",
        "Or they'd be used for hip replacements or fillings...",
        "(Unintelligible) was made into a paste used in dental implants, skin used for burn victims, fatty tissue used for cosmetic purposes, and so forth.",
        "So tell us more about this ringleader.",
        "Who is he and what is he exactly thought to have done?",
        "But today, in today's Daily News, a story which I'm proud to say I have exclusively, they actually had a plan to buy bones and other body parts from dead Russian prisoners from a prison in Russia.",
        "And Mastromarino in 2002 traveled to Russia, met with a prison official who was more than happy to do business, but in the end it was determined that the process would be too unsanitary.",
        "How big is this alleged scheme?",
        "How many people does it involve?",
        "How many corpses?",
        "Well, so far the Brooklyn District Attorney's office has identified about 1,100 corpses in their case.",
        "And at this point, you know, they're finding examples of, you know, more bodies, more corpses every couple of weeks.",
        "But the body parts went to thousands, more than 20,000 people throughout the United States, Canada, Great Britain and other parts of Europe.",
        "And the question is whether the body parts that went into the living were contaminated.",
        "And thousands of people have been tested for HIV, syphilis, hepatitis and other communicable diseases.",
        "And the Food and Drug Administration says the danger is minimal, but it is there.",
        "William Sherman is a reporter with the New York Daily News, and doubtless we'll be checking in with you later on as this story progresses.",
        "Thank you, William."

        "But whatever the political effect maybe, the speech also challenged us to talk about race.",
