        "I looked up to General Petraeus as a model of what an officer should be.",
        "But the fact that anyone could view his conduct as purely personal conduct to the matters between him and his wife really, I think, discredits the military and what we stand for.",

        "But something else kind of came up in our discussion here today, and this may be more to the point for military person like yourself.",
        "I'm not, in any sense, dismissing your serious reservations.",
        "What about judgment?",
        "What does it say, you're asking someone to make many, many judgments?",

        "This shows extraordinarily bad judgment from someone who we trust to make some of the very most important decisions, whether as CIA chief or a military leader.",
