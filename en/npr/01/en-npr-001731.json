        "And, you know, whenever something will come back to her, you know, in what she wants to do or what the country needs to do, she's got it all kind of, you know, down to the dollar figure figuring out what exactly she wants to do.",
        "And one of the big things that we've noticed in polling is that people are saying that if they had a magic wand and they - Democratic voters - if they could pick someone, never mind if they could beat Trump, they are going - they would want someone like Warren.",
        "And that's a big opportunity for her to show that she can be presidential tonight.",

        "Do you - as you've been surveying these candidates, is there anybody you're keeping an eye on who you think might get interesting tonight?",
        "Well, you know, I don't know about tonight necessarily, but I think about somebody like Pete Buttigieg, anyway, to figure out, you know, if he can sort of deal with what he's been dealing with back home as the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and this police shooting where a white police officer shot a black man in South Bend.",
        "And he's had to deal with protests.",
        "You know, he's had kind of a charmed political campaign so far.",
        "And whether or not he can sort of bounce back and deal with some of that adversity, he's going to have an opportunity to speak to his broadest audience yet.",

        "Well, you know, striking that balance is pretty tough.",
        "I mean, there's really a split in the party between the sort of super-progressive wing that's grown frustrated with the politics of comity and tired of what they see as, like, empty unity talk...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...Versus the pragmatists, you know, who do believe that the country doesn't need a massive - who believe that the country, you know, maybe doesn't need this, like I say, massive pendulum swing the complete other direction, but that the last election was won at the margins and what's needed is a, quote, \"\"return to normalcy.",
