        "What I wanted to - what I wanted to bring out was - I'm biracial.",
        "My mother is white, my father's - and my father's black and I was raised by my white mother, lived in a black neighborhood and the whole complicated, convoluted situation with that.",
        "And I really talk about race very often.",
        "I talk about it at work, I talk about it in my home life because it's very important to me.",
        "It was made very important to me by society that I was raised in.",
        "Now I found in my experience that it is - that even though I am biracial, it's quite obvious, that white people still look at me as being black.",
        "I have other features than just my skin tone that made some people think that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Yeah, as part of the surge.",
        "And - but I found that they will be more prone to talk in a more intellectual way where they're this passionate.",
        "Whereas, the black people which I am related to as well will be much more, you know, relational, much more sympathetic and you'll be able to talk more about the things that have happened.",
        "It's clear to me that there's been a big divide in that view as for impact as well because blacks will - even if you deny it, eventually you will realize there is racism affecting you whereas the white people in my family, and white people that I have known, they actually believe that racism is gone or…",
        "And do you find that they or you approach this subject on eggshells?",
        "I know that when the Cincinnati riot happened back in 2001.",
        "On the next day, I went out into the street because I knew people had to talk about race.",
        "I went down to center of the city and talked to - just approached two strange middle-aged white guys to me and just started talking with them.",
        "And they were very hesitant, and they were very removed and distant.",
        "They were shocked that I had approached them, and in fact there was a lot of that.",
        "But in the same vein, I was part of a group that gathered a bunch of liberal-minded Jews that were willing to talk about it but they also has this limit that they wouldn't talk anymore where, you know, once I started talking too much about it, it was no longer in their interest.",
        "But, of course, when I was talking with black people in the same situation that I was, we could talk for months.",

        "I do."

        "Yeah.",

        "Although I have to say we live in a - in a mostly black neighborhood, so that's interesting, you know, in one sense.",
        "But, you know, I think Roy brings up a very good point.",
        "This has to do with context.",
        "You know, depends on who you're talking too, you know, if you're talking to whites who are - you know, you have to kind of feel them out.",
        "Are they sympathetic or not, you know, how far can you go?",
        "Do you even bring it up?",
        "We're constantly having to make those decisions and even if they are sympathetic and even if it's your own family because, yes, I do have these - you know, my family is, you know, my in-laws are white.",
        "I tend to talk more theoretically about race opposed to my experiences.",
        "That I talk about with, you know, my black family and friends.",
        "And so very often there's not that connection you make, that you make as, you know, a black person to connect your experience with, you know, with, you know, something more analytical.",

        "I'm not sure that's a good thing.",
        "(Unintelligible) that.",
        "Well, if I could add, real quick, to that, it's my belief is that the reason why it's - they would rather talk about that intellectually is because it's not, in effect, what they feel",
        "Right.",
        "…it's something that they see.",
        "Not part of your experience."

        "And I wanted to add one more thing is that actually I do get to see both sides in the situation that I'm in because will hear one side say how ridiculous the other side is being, no matter which side it was.",
