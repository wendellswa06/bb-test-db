        "Well, it's difficult in some sense, but of course, it's easy because in the dominant position, one can take on these questions quite easily.",
        "What I found is, it's actually much easier in some sense for me to talk about white supremacy than for some of my black colleagues and black friends, because they are going to be labeled as whiny and angry, and I can do it, and push the envelope further.",
        "So, in one sense, of course, many white people for emotional reasons are fearful.",
        "But we also have a kind of latitude to speak more bluntly and more honestly, and I think we should take it.",
        "Well, when you use expressions like white supremacy, I seem that you get (unintelligible) out of some white people.",
        "Yeah, because I think we have to recognize that white supremacy is the dominant ideology of the culture.",
        "And here I'm not talking about clan members and neo-Nazis, the overt white supremacist, but to recognize that we still live in a white supremacist society that, you know, ideological terms, the way have been, the knowledge of this culture structured - open the course catalogue of the University of Texas in Austin where I teach and you'll see white points of view reflected predominantly.",
        "And of course, in material terms this is still a white supremacist society.",

        "That's a white supremacist society.",

        "Right.",
        "I think there's a lot of fears that work within us who are white.",
        "One, as you point out, is that we realize at some level that some of the material goods we get in this culture, as white folks are connected to that racialized disparity, so there's a fear of loosing actual things.",
        "There's the fear of losing status.",
        "There's a fear of those kinds that are tangible outcomes if that was a more racially just society.",
        "But there's other fears working for white folks; I think at some level white people know that some of what we have has nothing to do with our own hard work, our own brilliance.",
        "It has to do with living in that position of privilege.",
        "And we're afraid to confront that.",
        "The other thing I've noticed and this was a very painful process of coming to terms within myself, is that white people especially us, good liberal white folks, those about who are suppose to get it also carry around within us, of course, a lot of racist training.",
        "And I think a lot of white people again, especially liberal white folks are afraid that somehow that racist training is just going to emerge.",
        "And especially people of color are going to see it and their going to mark it.",
        "So I think part of the hesitancy to talk about race on the part of white people is a fear of stepping out into this what seems like very dangerous territory on the possibility that people of color might see you or more appropriately perhaps see through us and recognize the lingering effects of that racist training.",
        "But again, we have enormous privilege in this culture as white people, and we have an obligation, as other callers and guests have said, to step out and mark the nature of white supremacist society and to work against it.",

        "And I say mom, you really must watch it.",
        "You know that's not right.",
        "There must have been a moment, I don't know if you heard the senator's speech, but when he was talking about the inability to disown his own grandmother…",
        "Yeah, I know.",

        "Well, yes, but we are blood, and while I am trying to correct mom and dad in the way they think, and now, you know, there's no getting around it.",
        "I, in my way, in my relationship with my daughter, teach her that the way grandma and grandpa feel is wrong.",
        "And she knows - as she sees, she is the only mixed race child in our family, and you know, we are all white with blue eyes, and my lovely daughter has a tan skin with very dark eyes, and she knows there's a difference, of course, she's 12-years old.",
        "And sometimes she refers to that.",
        "She refers to - she wishes that she was white.",
        "She doesn't like to go out in the sun because her lovely skin gets darker.",
        "But - and she just sometimes feels badly about that.",
        "And I tell her that the problem that she's going to have in her life probably will have people take advantage of her beauty, rather than worrying about that she's mixed race.",
        "I suspect - let's hope that's true.",
