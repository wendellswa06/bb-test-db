        "trial, you found you found yourself on a panel sitting next to a black man.",
        "Yeah, it's one of those times when I have to confront my own fears.",
        "So there I was the expert white guy who's supposed to know things about this.",
        "And I realized that in public, I was afraid that my colleagues sitting next to me, a very good scholar and a very decent human being was going to somehow see through me, see that I haven't fully dealt with my own racist training.",
        "And I did get that very intense racist training that's so common in this country.",
        "And it was confronting that fear that helped me, and that was maybe a decade ago.",
        "Of course, if you're honest as a white person, you face these things all the time, it's the constant learning experience.",

        "Appreciate it.",
        "You're most welcome.",
        "And I think the only thing that I can testify to you is that, if one does that, one not only becomes a better person in some sort of moral or political sense that life gets a lot better when you shed fears, you move through the world in a much more productive and in satisfying ways.",
        "So for those of us who are white, I think there's both an argument from justice in a sense that we should be confronting white supremacy and racism because it's the right thing to do.",
        "But I also think we have to talk honestly about what I suppose we could call an argument from self interest that our own lives become richer and more meaningful when we have the courage to confront these things.",
        "And these things come up every day.",
        "I just came from class where a similar kind of incident reminded me much less traumatic perhaps of how important it is to just speak honestly in public about these things.",

        "Well, I think we have to address race and talk about race differently, and that was the uniqueness of the Obama candidacy up into the point of his speech on race.",
        "And that, you know, this notion of mixed races - that's a racial idiocy.",
        "We all belong to the same race, that's the human race.",
        "And if civil rights community in particular understands that we believe in absolute equality and that race ain't what it used to be and we fight all the time against stereotypes and group think and putting people in racial boxes, and our effort has been to remove narrow constrictions of the mind; to extrapolate prejudice, to broaden one horizon so that we are fighting stereotypes based on race, on gender, sexual orientation, and we must begin in our language to treat people as individuals and regard them as individuals and to judge them as individuals and based on what as Dr. King used to say, the content of their character not their skin color.",
        "So, you know, when Obama has started talking about groups such as whites who resent affirmative action against the gay, you know, there are plenty of whites who supported affirmative action and that support for affirmative action is not a racial test or opposition to affirmative action.",

        "But it comes out in many different forms: internalism, outright discrimination, racial nonsense, prejudice, stereotyping, tokenism, class feelings; and therefore, I believe that when we have to have one standard.",
        "And so when ministers such as the Reverend Jeremiah Wright talks racial nonsense and speaks as bigot, then we have to condemn that as bigotry when Louis Farrakhan speaks as a bigot, we must condemn it as bigotry.",

        "Well, that's what this implication is.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think there are people who understand bigotry.",
        "And my point is that I believe that we share one nation that is united not around racial fiefdoms and tribalism, ethnic polarization, ethnic chauvinism or whether or not one is married black and white and whether or not you're a hybrid - all that is racial nonsense, all that is old hat, all that is dysfunctional thinking, all of that is group think which must be fought against.",
