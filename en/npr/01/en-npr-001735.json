        "And so there's sort of a diversity of some of the opinion, but at the same time, I think, one major issue is really about a solidarity and how much are we willing to sort of be willing to listen to one another's experiences.",
        "I mean, I remember one - I have two really good friends from North Carolina and they're Caucasian.",
        "And but then when I first met them, they really would (unintelligible) on you and say, you know, would you tell me about your Asian-American experience because we have no idea what it's like when you were growing up?",
        "And that was a very refreshing sort of conversation.",
        "And that gives us sort of the opportunity for this kind of conversation.",
        "I wonder when Americans do talk about race on those occasions, do you feel that they're talking just about blacks and whites, and not so much about Asians and Hispanics?",
        "Oh, yeah, especially for Asian, I think, even for Asian, there's - that the term of professional foreigners continue to come up for us.",
        "I remember multiple times in either business functions or social functions when I meet Caucasian people and they will immediately say hello, you know, I've been to China or, you know, or something like that.",
        "I'll actually - well, you know, I've never been to China before.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "You know, I grew up in the U.S.",
        "and - or they would make some assumptions.",
        "And I think that largely is result of the fact that people are uncomfortable talking about race issue, uncomfortable to talk about culture issues.",
        "So, when they do get into those situations, they don't really know how to start and they - conversation very awkward.",

        "Do you find that an effective approach?",
        "It's been very affective.",
        "I've been doing the column now for about three years.",
        "And many people e-mail me and love the fact that I do use satire to debunk so many stereotypes that people have - in my case specifically about Mexicans, not Latinos, specifically Mexicans, not other groups and so forth.",
        "And I have found it affective because when it comes to stereotypes, here in the United States, we have such a rich, I say, sarcastically, tradition of stereotyping the others, stereotyping minorities, and the best way to fight them - I could whip a mono about them or I could poke fun at the idiots who are perpetually in those stereotypes at me.",
        "Yeah, and - but nevertheless, does - is humor affective, do you think?",
        "Again, absolutely.",
        "I could tell you anecdotes where people say hey, because of the humor that you use now, I could go back at people.",
        "And when they criticize me or try to stereotype me, I could just hit them back with the debunking that you showed them to be.",
        "I don't have empirical evidence that could say that but just from my experience, it's been much more effective than me writing a serious op-ed piece because I also do write op-ed pieces where I'm a little bit more serious.",
        "But I've found that my pieces for Ask a Mexican are much more powerful and get much more of a reaction, a positive reaction than anything serious I could possibly hope to write.",
        "And just going back to that conversation we had with Mike, the caller from Boston a moment ago, is this conversation, when America does talk about race sometimes go right past Hispanics and Asians and other people or just to focus on African-Americans and Caucasians?",
        "I think that's how it's historically been but, really, in the past 10 to 15 years when illegal immigration has been such a hot topic in this country.",
        "Now, you have the - or the topic of Hispanics or specifically Mexicans going into the dialogue about race.",
        "And down in the southwest United States, of course, that's been - the dialogue has been going on since the United States won the Mexican-American war back in 1848, so…"

        "And those are not arguments about illegal immigration.",
        "Those are topics about immigration.",

        "Mm-hmm, and…",

        "And one of them, kind of, looked at me (unintelligible), you know, obviously, was shock by it considering I've known her since we were kids.",
        "I mean, they kind of - we grew up in the same neighborhood, same town, same church, respected, you know, respected our elders who happened to be Caucasian.",
