        "And all of this has happened, I think, since - mostly since 2001, since we went to war.",
        "People just simply cannot understand, I think - and you know, what strikes me about this, this kind of reaction is at the same time people are saying this, as I look around me, I see all around me symbols of America in the fast-food stores, in the clothing stores.",
        "I mean, lots of people have commented that the French people are now no longer the fashionistas that they were.",
        "They are dressing, you know, as casually as Americans.",
        "So you have that on the one hand, and yet out of people's mouths comes this - you know, this real hostility.",
        "I think that's such a shame that this great country that has been so generous to so many finds itself on the defensive, and the person traveling with an American passport suddenly finds himself or herself having to explain.",
        "As you look from your perspective - though, as a teacher and writer living in New York and living your life - is the state of the union doing well?",

        "And, of course, things have changed in the years since I've been in the university, meaning that we have watched it go from a free university to a university of tuition, now to just, you know, a tuition that in some ways makes it very difficult for people to pay.",
        "And then on top of that, there are all kinds of systems now put into place that do not allow - do not give this kind of assistance you need to students who need - who either come with another language or may, indeed, come with English language, but certainly with a different culture.",
