        "So we're - I think that openness to the world was part of what gave us our economic strength, our intellectual strength, our cultural strength.",
        "And I think that it's still there.",
        "I think people still do feel that it's important to be open to the world.",
        "I wish more Americans were able to travel more, and I wish more Americans were able to listen more, I think, to the voices in the world, because I think - Elizabeth Nunez was talking, I think, rightly about the fact that there is a lot of anger and hatred of the United States in the world today.",
        "And part of it, I think, is inevitable if you're a powerful nation.",
        "But I think part of it is not necessary, and it flows from our failure to demonstrate respect for the views and concerns of other people, our sense that we're in the right always, and that other people just have to listen to us and do what they're told.",
        "And if we knew more, if Americans - not just American leaders, but ordinary Americans - were more aware of how we look, which we could - which we could do now by listening to other people, by watching movies from other places, by going on the Internet and seeing, you know, Web sites that don't have dot-com on after them but have some other countries saying - I think if we open ourselves in those ways, we can continue to be strong, and we can continue to bring people back to - we'll change.",
        "We could also, I think, deal with the problem of the way in which we are perceived in the world, which is as kind of contemptuous and disrespectful of other people.",
        "We're speaking with Kwame Anthony Appiah.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I was interested when you were talking about America being more open in the previous century.",
        "This was in America, of course, that barred most immigration from, what?",
        "Mid-1920s to the mid-1970s.",
        "Right.",
        "No, the openness that there was though, the - did make a big difference.",
        "And I think the openness that began with the changes in immigration law in the late '60s and the early '70s has been good for us.",
        "And I hope that in the discussions about immigration as an issue at the state of the nation, we'll continue to recognize a great deal, as I say, of our intellectual, our cultural and our economic strength comes from our openness -comes from the fact that we let people in and that we send people out, that we send our goods out into the world.",
        "That our business people go out into the world to sell things.",
        "And in order to do that, you have to have that kind of openness or willingness to listen, as well as to dictate the terms of what goes on in the world.",
        "And I've been going around the country sort of talking about cosmopolitanism, and I find that there is a real resonance for that idea in many, many places.",
        "Many young people, in particular, feel, yes.",
        "We need to understand the rest of the world better.",
        "We need to be more respectful to the rest of the world.",
        "And not just because it'll make our politics safer, because a world of people who hate you is not a safe world, but because it's also exciting and interesting to learn about other places and to be in interaction with people in other places.",
        "And we've been strengthened in our politics, you know, people like Colin Powell, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright - to mention three secretaries of state who have either came from abroad or had parents who came from abroad.",
        "I think we have that strength that comes from this openness, and I believe that that is still a real, an important part of what America - most Americans, many Americans, anyway feel, and something that I hope - something that's, in a way, positive about the state of our nation.",
        "And it has - as I say, in my particular little bit of the world, in the university world - meant that we do have these terrifically good universities.",
        "When people worry about our being taken over by China or India in the coming century, I have to tell them that they simply don't have the resources, the intellectual resources to challenge us for a very long time, because they don't have the kind of university system that we have.",
        "Kwame Anthony Appiah, thank you very much for your time today."
