        "Pretty good.",
        "In fact, better than I think most people are led to believe by the national media.",
        "In fact, I got so exercised about it, I just finished writing a book called \"\"The Divided States of America?\"\" - question mark - \"\"What Both Liberals and Conservatives are Missing in the God and Country Shouting Match.",
        "I just got so tired of being interviewed for national programs - not NPR I'm talking about here, but other national programs - where, you know, they would say well, you know, you're not quite what we're looking for.",
        "Your view's too nuanced.",
        "And what they do is they get the two most extreme positions they can find, they put them on together and let them yell at each other for half an hour, and then they think that's balanced journalism.",
        "And I think it leads the country to believe that the country is more divided than it actually is.",
        "Now we do have serious disagreements about the direction of the country, but I think there's far more common ground than Americans are led to believe that there is by the national electronic and print media, and I find this everywhere I go.",
        "I'm in literally hundreds of Baptist churches all across the country every year, and I find a lot more optimism than you would suspect from listening to the national media.",
        "Sure.",
        "And I find that people are pleased with the progress our country's making on lots of different fronts and are very confident that the country could make a lot more progress if the people in Washington would catch up with the rest of the country.",
        "This is one reason why I have a Washington office, but I live in Nashville.",
        "I live in the real world, and I go visit Washington because I find that - for instance, on the immigration issue, the country is way ahead of where both parties are, way ahead of where the government is.",
        "And it's time for the government to catch up to where the people are and to demand a comprehensive immigration policy that would secure the borders, would deal fairly and justly with the people who are here and give them an opportunity to work their way toward permanent resident status, set up a genuine guest-worker program that would allow people to be able to come in and go back home and visit and come back and take care of their families.",
        "We have jobs that are available in this country, and we have people in other countries who want to come do them.",
        "One of the shocks that people find when they start examining this issue is that about 30 percent of the people who are here illegally really don't want to be permanent residents here.",
        "They would like to have a guest worker status where they could earn money and send it back to Mexico, for instance, and after a certain number of years, move back to Mexico and start a business, you know.",
        "And the ones who want to stay here, if they abide by the law and they work their way off of a probationary status through paying fines and learning to read and write and speak English and want to stay here, we're lucky to have them.",
        "This country is a nation of immigrants, but more than that, we're a nation of settlers - people who came here to invest their lives in this country and to become part of the American dream.",
        "And our immigrants of all different ethnic stripes have been a tremendous contribution to this country."

        "I lived in England for three years when I was doing my Ph.D. at Oxford, and England's a country that most people in the world would think would be a great place to live, but it is such an incomparably boring country compared to the United States.",
        "And the reason is the rich tapestry of all of the contributions of our various immigrant groups that have come to this country that they've made to our language, to our music, to our cuisine, to our literature.",
        "Immigration has been a tremendous blessing to this country, and most Americans know that.",
        "We have to move on, but I did want to get to one last thought.",
        "You talked about all the things that Americans are optimistic about, the ones you meet.",
        "Give me a for-instance, a for-example.",
        "Well, for instance, for religious people, there's a tremendous upsurge in church attendance in Evangelical and conservative churches, particularly among young people.",

        "The number of mission volunteers, both foreign and domestic, is at record numbers.",
        "And so people in the Evangelical world see a tremendous upsurge, a growing upsurge in people who are finding meaning and purpose in their lives through an Evangelical understanding of Christianity, and that encourages them for the nation's future.",

        "This is Kendall, Kendall with us from the Eastern shore of Maryland.",
        "Hi, yes, I am a college student and a mother, and the comment that I wanted to make was that I see our country going to more of a collaborative effort, more of a willingness to compromise and to come to the realization and a - I guess an agreement that we are not the greatest country in the world, and that we need to start looking outside the box."
