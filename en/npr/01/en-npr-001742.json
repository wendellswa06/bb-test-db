        "Anytime we're in a period of martial strife, such as the war in Iraq, it's also a time to maybe acknowledge or recognize those serving or those who have served, or perhaps those who are in the military, although that's not the intent of Flag Day.",
        "But we kind of lump those together.",
        "Now, I'm wondering, you said that you have a 13 star flag, flying outside your house now.",
        "Are there any rules about what kind of, what version of the flag you're allowed to fly?",
        "No, any flag, regardless of the number of stars, that was ever a U.S.",
        "flag, is still considered a United States flag, and should be honored as such.",

        "It doesn't look like the other things that we think look good.",
        "What it looks like, of course, is other flags.",
        "And flags have a kind of weird set of internal rules that determine what they look like, and it doesn't have a whole lot to do with looking good.",

        "Or is it, it just is, and people accept for being the American flag?",
        "You know what?",
        "It probably would have made it a bad advertisement for the United States of America, once upon a time.",
        "But now, of course, it has so much symbolic weight attached to it that it works just great.",
        "That's of course one reason that contemporary artists, pop artists in the 1960s, chose to make images built around it.",
        "Because it worked as a symbol of what the United States had come to mean.",
        "Of course there were other people making art in the 1960s who made stuff that had some of the same weird energies as the flag, that in fact, didn't quote the flag directly at all.",
        "It wasn't about the flag, it just so happens that by the 1960s the kind of weirdness that you get in the flag, you also were starting to get in contemporary art.",
        "Okay.",
        "When did the, I mean - when did the flag take on a military sense, as opposed to some other sense, do you think?",
        "Well, my impression is, I'm not a flag expert, but my impression is that that's where it started.",
        "That in fact, it started in the world of military signals, really, right?",
        "The function of a flag, almost the only function of a flag, was to tell us from them, to know who was fighting for who.",
        "And that's where the thing got started.",
        "When you look at the records of the Continental Congress, on June 14th, 1777, when the flag was made official, our current flag that is, something like the Star Spangled Banner.",
        "It's quite clear that they're just conducting government business, that this is a relatively minor affair; it's just choosing a symbol that the army can fight under.",
        "It didn't, at the beginning at least, have the kind of popular symbolism that it came to have rather later in American history, when the country really needed a symbol to unite it, when symbols mattered, maybe, more than they did in 1777.",
        "When there was a clearer sense that it was a united country and not 13 separate colonies, then the flag becomes something that the ordinary citizen waves.",
        "Okay…",
        "Before that…sorry.",
        "Well, I was just going to say, I'm afraid we're out of time.",
