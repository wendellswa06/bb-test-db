        "You heard Ron talking there about the inevitable comparisons to Watergate which prompted us to wonder how valid are the analogies between what was happening back in the early 1970s and today?",
        "So to answer that, we've called someone with firsthand knowledge of the Nixon White House, John Dean.",
        "He was White House counsel to President Nixon.",
        "By the time of Nixon's Saturday Night Massacre in 1973, Dean was out of the White House.",
        "He pleaded guilty to crimes related to the scandal and was soon testifying against other key figures.",
        "He served 120 days in custody for his role in Watergate.",
        "In the decades since, he has served as a banker, an author, and he's become something of an expert on presidential ethics.",
        "John Dean is on the line from his home in Beverly Hills, Calif.",
        "John, thanks for joining us.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "I have to ask what went through your mind as you watched this week's events unfold?",
        "Well, it's kind of been several weeks where we've had echoes of Watergate at the Comey firing, of course, raised memories for many of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre.",
        "There was a difference, but there are some stylistic similarities.",
        "The difference being that Archibald Cox, the Watergate prosecutor was openly defying Nixon.",
        "And so he finally decided he would just shut down the special prosecutor's operation.",
        "Trump obviously was not anywhere near that stage in an investigation.",
        "He hadn't told Comey to stop the Russian investigation, and so it's really - I think style is what's more important here because Comey could have been given the right to resign, rather than had his head chopped off as occurred.",
        "President Trump warned Jim Comey yesterday via tweets that Comey had better hope there are no tapes of their conversations which, as you know, one of the legacies of Watergate is that since then, presidents have avoided taping their calls, taping their conversations because they can be subpoenaed.",
        "Were you surprised to hear President Trump raised the possibility that he may be taping his conversations?",
        "Trump must know - he's old enough to be aware of Watergate that by saying exactly what he said, he's raising that whole specter again.",
        "And it's just another comparison with Watergate.",
        "And that isn't a comparison most presidents seek to put on their presidency."

        "As a trained lawyer, what legal questions were raised for you this week?",

        "I haven't seen a technical violation of any of the statutes, the obstruction statutes or what have you.",
        "I have seen a parallel with what ended up in Nixon's articles of impeachment where he was charged with interfering with the FBI investigation.",
        "Obviously, removing Comey is not a direct blocking of an investigation, but given his attitude or what he says was in his mind, he was unhappy with the investigation.",
        "He knew it was going to have some impact on how the FBI perceived it.",
        "We last talked to you back in February when everybody was talking about the Monday Night Massacre, which would be when Trump fired than acting Attorney General Sally Yates.",
        "Are we going to have a Monday night, a Tuesday night, a Wednesday night...",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "I mean, is there a point where the analogy gets overblown?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That being noted, do you know anything about the substance of this case?",
        "Substance is that in the beginning they have under pressure, she had made some statements and later when they questioned again, she denied, said that those things that she had said were not right.",
        "And, again, when there was a court hearing, Roxana again denied to what (unintelligible).",
        "So there was -and it was written in the statement she signed that all those things that she had said before, they were not right.",
        "But they apparently, in the case, they didn't consider.",
        "They didn't consider what she had - her denial, yeah.",
        "This is a difficult question to ask, Mr. Saberi, for all the obvious reasons, but do you have reason to think she was coerced into making statements at any point?",
        "Yes, I have.",
        "I have reason and she has herself said that, yeah.",
        "(unintelligible) was also deceived.",
        "She was deceived to talk - they told her that if she says like this they will free her and then they didn't free her.",
        "Later she found out that it was a trick, yeah."

        "For the rest of the hour, we're going to talk about what the melting ice - what of ice melting around the world and these glaciers - what some of that ice might tell us about the origins of life on Earth.",
        "Because locked in the ice in Antarctica is sort of a biological catalog.",
        "It's a record of the microorganisms that inhabited this icy climate thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, millions of years ago.",

        "You know, what about global warming?",
        "If all these ice starts melting, would the organisms locked in the ice come back to life?",
        "To find out, researchers collected samples of ice from glaciers in Antarctica.",
        "The ice ranged in age from a hundred thousand years old to eight million years old.",
        "They took the ice samples back to the lab, melted the ice, to see if they could get any of the ancient organisms trapped in the ice to grow.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, joining me now to talk about what they found is Kay Bidle, assistant professor of marine and coastal sciences at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey.",

        "Thanks for the interest.",
        "Well, I started you off down there.",
        "Tell us what happened when you melted that ice and started to grow, what was in it?",
        "Well, we actually examined a couple of different types of ice ranging in ages.",
        "Well, the youngest was about 100,000 years old and the oldest was about eight million years old, which represents the oldest ice on Earth that we know of.",
        "And so we were interested in looking to see if we could find microorganisms encased in the ice and if they were potentially viable.",
        "So we melted both of these ices, after, of course, we decontaminated them from potential surface contamination of microbes that are around today.",
        "And we first looked to see who was in the ice and who could grow.",
        "What we found is that the organisms that were in the ice were a variety of organisms that you would find are closely related to organisms that we find in soils and in ice - a variety of ice environments today.",
        "So they're closely related to those.",
        "And what we also found was that organisms in the young ice were much more viable, they grew faster.",
        "We could recover them easier.",
        "The organisms in the old ice, we also saw some evidence of growth, but they were severely retarded.",
        "Very, very slow growth, doubling - dividing about once every 70 days, which is quite slow for a bacterium.",
        "And that was quite a difference, wasn't it?",
        "Yes, of course.",
        "And we sort of expected that type of difference because these two ice samples differ quite dramatically in the amount of time they've been frozen and locked up in the glaciers.",
        "And then with that, they would be exposed to different levels of - or doses of cosmic radiation that comes in to the Antarctic.",
        "And that region receives the highest cosmic radiation flux on the planet, along with the Arctic.",
        "So the cosmic rays sort of disrupted DNA and chop it up."
