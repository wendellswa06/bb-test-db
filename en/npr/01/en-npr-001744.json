        "So one of the things that we looked at in the paper was to examine the state of the DNA locked up in ices of various ages ranging from those 100,000 years to 8,000,000-year range.",
        "And we found that the longer you are exposed over geologic time, you do have much more degraded or deteriorated DNA.",
        "In the old ice, the average age or size was about 200 base pairs, which is 200 of the genetic code letters - A, T, C, G - strung together.",
        "Just for comparison, the average bacterium would have something like 3 million base pairs.",
        "So that argue - the argument is made in your paper that possibly the theory that's been around for a while, circulating around, that life on Earth might have been seeded with bacteria or life forms from outer space.",
        "Right.",
        "You sort of have thrown cold water on that a bit because the DNA is so disrupted after all those years, or the exposure to all that cosmic radiation."

        "That's right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So what we were able to do in this study was to at least get a relationship for the rate at which DNA degrades over geologic time.",
        "And so what we were able to get is sort of a half-life or a time over which a piece of DNA would be chopped in half.",
        "And that was about 1.1 million years, based on our data from the variety of ice samples that we collected over the entire age range.",
        "And so what we like to do is extend that to organisms or genetic material that might be locked up in icy comets.",
        "Comets are essentially dirty ice balls.",
        "Right.",
        "And our buried glaciers in this environment are also dirty ice packs as well.",
        "So, what that allows us to do is severely constrain the possibility that a comet from a different solar system may have traveled into our solar system and it would, of course, have been exposed to even higher levels of cosmic radiation in outer space.",
        "And the time it would take to do that would essentially degrade all of that material and essentially sterilize it.",
        "So it couldn't seed - sort of seed life here on Earth.",
        "Right.",
        "So one of the things that we argue in the paper is that it's still possible for life to have come from, you know, other planets within our solar system, for example, but it constrains the possibility of things coming in from outside of solar system, for example.",
        "Now, the fact that some of the - the hundred-thousand-year-old DNA and the organisms are pretty viable.",
        "Right.",
        "Does that mean we're going to see, as these ice - polar ice caps melt, or ice around the world melts in different places and different glaciers, a pooling and mixing in of these ancient bacteria with modern day bacteria?",
        "Yeah, very, very likely.",
        "So in those ices of different ages, you do have both viable microorganisms that we detected and actually show in the paper, but as well as a whole mix of genomic information.",
        "And in the paper, we sort of refer to these things as gene popsicles.",
        "So basically, you would have encased ancient DNA of some age period that once these glaciers would melt ultimately can end up in the oceans.",
        "And then it would provide a source of new genetic material, for example, which can then be taken up by current microorganisms.",
        "And this is - we know that this happens a lot in natural microbial communities.",
        "It's called lateral gene transfer.",
        "And it's a mechanism by which microbes can take up new pieces of DNA that may contain useful information, incorporate it into their DNA.",
        "And then it can confer some advantage or it can be deleterious.",
        "It's up to natural selection to sort that out.",
        "But this is one of the primary ways by which microorganisms on the planet gain new traits and evolve.",
        "So this melting would not only potentially add viable members to a community, but also significantly affect the tempo of microbial evolution on the planet."
