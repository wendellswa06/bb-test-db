        "But functionally, it's very similar.",

        "But the important thing to realize is that these processes of glaciers forming and melting have happened many times over the course of Earth's history.",
        "So this isn't something that Earth hasn't seen before.",
        "And it's very likely that these processes have affected the tempo of evolution and the diversification of species over geological time.",
        "And in fact, we do see some of that evidence in the fossil record.",
        "But with microorganisms, you don't - they generally don't leave a fossil record.",
        "So we've never been able to really assess what processes might influence their diversification and proliferation.",

        "How far down?",
        "I mean, will they just naturally melt out now in puddles, flow into the ocean?",
        "Well, the actual - so the ice that we obtained, the ice was actually collected by a co-author on the paper, Dr. Dave Marchant from Boston University - he's a geologist and he studied this particular region for some time, both its age and its formation.",
        "And so his team has been going to the Dry Valleys region of the Antarctic.",
        "So that's up in high altitude.",
        "But ultimately, all glaciers - and of course there have been a lot of glaciers and ice that have already disappeared from the Antarctic continent, and they ultimately end up in the oceans.",

        "In fact, he already does have a job for life because he's a federal appeals court judge, but some have pushed for judicial term limits, arguing that judges can become out of touch with ordinary citizens.",

        "And joining us to discuss this is Dahlia Lithwick, the legal analyst for the online magazine Slate.",
        "And, Dahlia, when and where did Roberts make that argument?",
        "Well, Madeleine, he made it in 1983 when he was a young attorney in the Reagan White House and he wrote a memo to then White House counsel Fred Fielding in response to a Senate proposal for 10-year term limits for federal judges, saying, quote, \"\"Setting a term limit of, say, 15 years would ensure that federal judges would not lose all touch with reality through decades of ivory tower existence,\"\" end quote.",
        "Ironically, he's now poised to sit on the court for 30 to 35 years.",
        "Well, the main reason for lifetime appointments was to keep judges beyond the reach of everyday politics and the push and pull of public opinion.",
        "So are people now rethinking that idea?",
        "Yeah.",
        "In fact, a lot of very well-respected legal scholars on both sides of the political spectrum are rethinking it.",
        "And certainly I think if the judge has a political agenda or ax to grind, the notion that they can sit on the bench for 30 years and really reshape the judicial landscape is an alarming one.",
        "The whole point of not having term limits for judges, the point of having no way to remove them unless they behave extraordinarily badly, is that the judiciary's not supposed to be beholden to the masses.",
        "They're certainly not supposed to be beholden to majorities.",
        "And so this criticism that they're, quote, \"\"out of touch,\"\" you know, that they're better judges if they know who won \"\"American Idol\"\" or if they're reading Archie comics is a little bit, I think, disingenuous, a little bit of sort of anti-elitist demagoguery.",
        "Well, what do people mean when they say out of touch?",
        "Do they mean out of touch as you say with the popular culture or do they mean just really too old to sit on the bench?",
        "I think they mean both things.",
        "I mean, I think one very legitimate complaint is that judges are now serving a lot longer than was intended when the framers were around.",
        "Judges are serving on average 10 years longer.",
        "And as a consequence, I think there is a feeling that they're simply there too long, they become old and senile and there's no way to remove them.",
        "But as I said, I think there's another strain of the criticism which is they're elitist, they're liberal, they're not aware of what the vast majority of the populace wants, and I think that's a sort of dangerous way of talking about the judges as out of touch.",
        "So what do you think the ultimate effect would be if we did have shorter terms for judges?"

        "I think you'd suddenly have the appearance of a judiciary that's much more beholden to the people.",
        "It's important to sort of think back to what Alexander Hamilton wrote in \"\"The Federalist Papers\"\" when he said the reason to have lifetime appointments is because, quote, \"\"nothing will contribute so much to the independent spirit in the judges which must be essential to the faithful performance of so arduous a duty.\"\" I think what he was saying is that the judiciary is simply different.",

        "So when I add - if there is, I mean, mold on top, I scrape it up, but I still use it.",
        "I scrape it up, cut everything, put it in the food processor, you know, a couple of clove of garlic, some white wine, a lot of ground pepper and we make into a paste that become fromage fort - strong cheese - that you serve on bread with a salad, or you put it on bread and put it under the broiler to beautifully glaze it, too.",
        "And certainly, it's very important because cheese are very expensive.",
