        "And in the bottom, it says Derry Klan number 147, which I think is a Klan group in Indiana.",
        "And the Ku Klux Klan, this banner is from the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s.",
        "And the history is fascinating.",
        "That you have the Klan that we all think about that comes out of Reconstruction that really fights against black agency during Reconstruction.",
        "That Klan is basically curtailed by the federal government in the late 19th century.",
        "But then this Klan in the 1920s is a Klan that on the one hand comes out of fear not only of African-Americans, but of Jewish immigrants and immigrants generally.",

        "Marine Le Pen, when she took over the party in 2011, decided that what she wanted to do with that is win the presidential elections one day and sooner than later.",
        "And for this, she knew she had to detoxify, if you want, the negative image of the party and make it more mainstream in appearance.",
        "And for this, she has softened the rhetoric of the National Front, and she has tried to position herself in favor of state intervention to kind of seduce a popular electorate, which has been disappointed by the left and does not know where to go anymore to cast their votes.",
        "Do you think she's actually changed the party or remade the party, or do you think that she's put some makeup on it?",
        "You know, you can put lipstick on a pig; it's still a pig, as people say.",
        "And the fact is I did this book, which analyzes 500 public speeches by the father and the daughter to try to answer that very question and see their real difference in essence between the two politicians.",

        "And more importantly, the political platform that is proposed to the voters has not changed at all.",
