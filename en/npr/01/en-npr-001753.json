        "But do you go back to high school reunions?",
        "I've been to one, yes, and everybody wanted to know what I was doing with singing, not how are my kids doing."

        "And that is another reason that these polls are diminishing in popularity, fewer schools are running them.",
        "Let's see if we can go - really, fewer running them, not just most likely to succeed, but most mischievous too?",
        "We've launched in six countries - four in Africa, in Colombia and just a couple of weeks ago in India.",
        "Yes.",
        "There are - more schools are cutting them out because some of the legal and ethical sensitivities.",
        "You know, for example, one young woman came back and sued her high school after she was voted worst reputation, among other things.",
        "They can - you know, school can be kind of tough and there can be some mudslinging sometimes even in good humor.",
        "And if that goes up on somebody's Facebook page, it can haunt them later.",
        "So that's one reason that the number of schools doing this has been declining.",
