        "You know, it's been a little, well, 11 years now.",
        "And I definitely am not where I thought I would be, you know?",
        "At 16, 17 years old, I thought by now I'd be graduated from college with a master's degree, on my way to working on a, you know, solid family.",
        "And here I am still feeling like I'm stuck.",
        "You know, I didn't graduate from Virginia Tech yet.",
        "You know, I'm working as a manager in a restaurant, doing the best that I can.",
        "But, you know, barely holding my head above water.",
        "And a lot of the things that she was saying about, you know, your definition of success is different now than it was in high school, I've had to really try and define what it is for me for success, and that whole feeling of being lost, really trying to come into my own at this point.",

        "It's not their fault, you know?",
        "It's my own, but it's also one of those the things that the sheltering nature of high school and the structured nature of high school is so much different than the way that the real world is.",
        "You get in the world and it's not exactly the same way as the regimented go to class, go home, do your homework, go to class, go home, do your homework.",
        "So...",
        "One of the things that's different, Holly, though is the timeline, which is, of course, in high school, everything, as you say, is very regimented.",

        "It varies person to person.",
        "You may be just on a slightly different arc than everybody else.",
        "That's what I hope.",

        "So...",
        "That is the way to approach it, Holly.",
        "And look at it this way, you could be busing at that restaurant.",
        "Yes, I could, instead I'm managing and doing a little better than that.",

        "OK.",

        "One young woman who also received that label in high school said she tried to start a business, and it was taking her years and years to get it off the ground instead of the two years she projected.",
        "So you're not alone in that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's one of the things too, from high school, I thought that college would be the answer.",
        "It would somehow show me the path for what I was supposed to be, where I was supposed to go.",
        "And in reality, I needed to find that within myself.",
        "Like, Virginia Tech was going to make that happen for me, you know?",
        "I had to find it.",
        "And I'm still searching for it, but, you know, I'm getting there.",
        "So...",

        "And that was in the first place one of the many reasons why people voted for Hamas.",
        "I mean, many people voted for Hamas, not because they liked Hamas, but because they wanted to defeat the system of nepotism.",
        "So reconsolidating into large scale is not going to be a real solution to the problem.",
        "That's why I see that the world community and the United States have made a very huge mistake by not supporting the national unity government which could have preserved Palestinian democracy, human rights, the rule of law, Palestinian unity and would have given us a very, very, very good opportunity for initiating a process of reform."
