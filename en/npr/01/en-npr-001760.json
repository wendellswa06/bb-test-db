        "...constraints among - rules - global rules that people have operated in.",
        "And I've always been concerned from the beginning - I hear where he's saying that al-Qaida's not the norm, okay, but if we operate in the way that goes against what we believe and what we have on the record believing -what our law says - well, how do we expect people to treat our men and women when they are captured?",
        "I mean, that's what I don't understand.",
        "I mean, it's not just al-Qaida at play here; it's the entire world.",
        "And so you have not only to demonstrate to the al-Qaidas however you want to deal with them, but also to people who are in the rest of the world, how are we, America, going to stand up and follow the rules as they have been outlined?",
        "All right, let me take a...",

        "...for a new paradigm, a paradigm that's increasingly obvious, will require of us an increasingly multi-lateral approach with a kind of ability to manage the flexibility, the ambiguities, the complexities that this new global security counter-terrorist activities - if you don't want to call them warfare in the old-fashioned sense of the word - will require."

        "...what you're saying Marcelo - real quick, though, Callie.",
        "The idea of what Marcelo suggests is that America, being on the world stage, and as you suggested, the eyes of the world on us even more intently than ever before, every step we take really has, far and away, more magnitude than it has in the past.",
        "Go ahead, Callie.",
        "And then to be reminded, because of this North Korea thing, that superpower we may be, but we really need China and Japan to step up here and try to corral what's going on there.",

        "Let's see what they've done here with a political action committee ad that was taken out in the Michigan Chronicle, which is the African-American newspaper in the Detroit area, and Voice to Vote is the PAC.",
        "And the ad, full page, had a picture of Jennifer Granholm with, also pictures of - and images of Adolf Hitler and a swastika, criticizing Democratic leaders including Clinton, going back as far as Johnson and Carter, talking about the Democrats taking African-Americans for granted.",
        "And the fact that because this is the case, blacks should not vote Democratic this time around.",

        "But they've yet to file a single campaign statement with the state, and that's required by law to show where their moneys come from and how they're spent.",
        "The group owes $4,000 in state fines.",
        "Robert George, we should also note that within the ad it claims that the Democratic Party leaders have relied on blacks to be, quote, \"\"foot soldiers\"\" and that their reward has been a dependency on welfare, high unemployment, and a disproportionate number of black men locked up in prison.",

        "It just seems like a rather - I can understand this kind of hardball kind of ads in, like, maybe in the '80s and into the early '90s, but in the context of where politics are in the 21st century, where Republicans are trying to bring in, say, black religious voters and things like that, it just seems like a rather foolish move.",
