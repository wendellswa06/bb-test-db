        "Why the cold shoulder for Detroit?",
        "As Michigan Radio's Sarah Cwiek reports, this lack of love is not new - and it's complicated.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And the reason he was so successful is because he tackles race very directly and very honestly, and audiences, both black and white audiences, respond to it.",
        "And to me, it is sort of the ultimate--in a sense it's the ultimate justice for his work, but this was the issue that sort of threw the whole thing into turmoil.",
        "Are there mutterings that, you know, if you don't get back on the set soon, we are going to drag your but in court?",
        "He's cut a bunch of the skits already for the new series.",
        "What he hasn't done is the interstitial--when he introduces the pieces in a kind of a little bit of a stand-up routine.",
        "Comedy Central is trying to figure out if he doesn't do that, how are they going to stitch these skits together.",
        "And didn't he threaten to walk away for good if they did the piecemeal job?",
        "So it's kind of like Comedy Central is damned if they do and damned if they don't.",
        "Yeah, they're in a real fix here, because on the one hand, the last season it was their best rated show.",
        "So, it really isn't in their interest to be really, really aggressive about this.",
        "What they want to do is define a sort of happy medium to say, do you want your own staff?",
        "Do you want more say over the content?",
        "That said, there are a lot of other bigger issues.",
        "I mean, when you get as rich as he got, people tend to attach themselves to you.",
        "And he thought these people were just eating away at him.",
        "What about Dave Chappelle's Block Party.",
        "That's a movie that he did in collaboration with Michel Gondry, who was the French music video director and the guy who created the fabulous images in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.",
        "What does that film represent for Chappelle?",
        "It went into motion before he left the show?",
        "What's clear from the movie is that he was pondering a lot of these issues about who am I as an African Artist; how do I fit in with the whole Hollywood machinery?",
        "And what he did is he intentionally surrounded himself with people in that movie who had reached the point that he had reached, and the best example is Lauren Hill, and he spent some time with her.",
        "She was extremely powerful and famous, and really at the peak of her power when she decided, I can't take it; I've got to take a breather.",
        "And what price do you think he's going to pay if you are caught in a situation where the very profession that calls you or brings you joy has soured for you and you decide that you have to make a break like this?",
        "What cost will he incur?",
        "To me the question is, what do the fans think?",
        "Do the fans think that he did a gutsy thing, or do the fans think that he burned them?",
        "And I think if he plays it right, he can come back, and especially if he comes back with sort of--not a mea culpa, but explain and say, look, I know it looked weird, but here's why I did it, and I hope you understand, but if you don't, there's not much I can do about it, but it was the right thing for me.",
        "Let's move on and let's make each other laugh again."
