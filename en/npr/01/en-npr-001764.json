        "And we are aware of so many children who as you described languish in the foster care system.",
        "And I think also as openness in adoption becomes more and more important and prevalent, there are a lot of misconceptions about how it functions and what it means.",
        "And let's also be honest the idea as to not paint the black community as uncaring for children.",
        "We see often in black America what I call non-formal or kinship adoption."
