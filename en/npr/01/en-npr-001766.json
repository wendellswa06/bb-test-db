        "Like many people who have come to Spence-Chapin, I had fertility struggles and, you know, decided that parenting was something that I really wanted to do.",
        "We felt that it was something that I had to do in my life.",
        "My husband and I prayed and talked and prayed and talked and made the decision to have a family.",
        "And we never looked back.",
        "How big of a decision was it for you even though you struggled with infertility to take on as many people in the black community will suggest \"\"someone else's child,\"\" quote, unquote?",
        "For me, of course, it's a huge decision to come to adoption, and like Toni(ph) explained there, you know, a lot of emotional work had to be done on our part before we even got to the agency, but that emotional work continues.",
        "I have relationships with both of my children's birth parents where we communicate regularly and we're learning as we're going along.",
        "You know, it's certainly not a relationship that life prepares you for.",
        "It's not an experience that life prepares you for.",
        "Most people believe somewhere in them that at some point when they want to have children, they're going to give birth to them.",
        "Nut when you're faced with that challenge, you know you have another path.",
        "And because it's a different path, you're still--you know, it's a path that you have to walk daily.",
        "So I'd say it's something that we're still learning, still growing, still pursuing, still--I can't--I don't know.",
        "We're still learning.",
        "We're growing every day with it.",
        "Ms.",
        "Williams, let me ask you this.",
        "And if I...",
        "One of the things that we see and Ms. Epperson talked about it is the new day of adoption to a great degree.",
        "Often in the past, the idea that a child was adopted, was hidden not only often from the child but from the community...",
        "Right."

        "...but we see a more open society and a movement to incorporate and blend all of the people involved.",
        "Right.",
        "And we've learned over the years most places like Spence-Chapin are what we call full-service agencies and we provide services to people who want to surrender their babies into adoption, people who want to adopt and adopted persons over their lifetime.",
        "And what we've learned through adult adopted persons is that hiding adoption doesn't work for anybody; that somehow often these young people who are now older adults but were placed into adoptive families as infants under the closed adoption system learned in the worst of ways that they had been adopted and ended up feeling betrayed by their families.",
        "So that was one act of adoption that we learned just did not work and does not work for anyone.",
        "We learned from birth parents as they became more vocal over the years that the closed adoption system left them guilt-ridden, wondering if their babies had been well taken care of, and it left adoptive parents looking over their shoulders constantly about where this birth parent or when this birth parent might emerge.",
        "So they...",
        "We should also note that for young black kids in the adoption system, there are a disproportionate of African-American children in the system because unfortunately when it comes to adoption, whether it be the hurdle of the cost of adoption or something other, the stigma that continues in the African-American community, many of these children are bypassed, and as I said, just stay in the system through adulthood.",
        "What does this do, Ms. Williams, to them psychologically?",
        "Well--excuse me--I think what you're talking about now is the foster care system, and although that's not where my expertise is, I am aware that children--I think research now shows that babies benefit from early permanence, that within--it's seen that children need permanency within the first months of life to build good mental health.",
        "And I would imagine that for any person who even if they find themselves in a family system but that family has for whatever decisions--usually economic in the foster care system--decided not to embrace them as a full family member permanently that that would leave them feeling somewhat less than.",
        "Spence-Chapin established a program with the New York City Child Welfare System that we call Collaboration for Permanency where we looked at the population of infants who came into the foster care system with a goal of foster care two years later were still in that system now with a goal of adoption.",
        "And almost half of them had been in more than one foster care home in that short two-year period.",
        "So we identified that population as ideal for our services.",
        "It looked to us like those birth parents may be people who would benefit from what we call option counseling at Spence-Chapin.",
        "And, Lisha, let me ask you before we let you go the idea of what these two children have brought into your life.",
        "Often we think about providing for them but don't look at the returns.",
        "Certainly they provide to those who are now raising them new sunshine, I would imagine, in your life.",
        "Oh, certainly.",
        "I tell everyone that I am living my dream, and I certainly believe that my children in some way have saved my life just as in a way that I may have saved theirs.",
        "It's been miraculous.",
        "Well, do you believe--had you been able to have children of your own, you would have ever looked to the idea of adoption?",
        "I think I might have and that maybe I'm unique in that respect.",
        "But when my husband and I were dating, we talked about, you know, having biological children and we talked about adopting.",
        "So when we were faced with this struggle, it was a natural progression for us to just jump right into adoption.",
        "Well, you can contact a place like Spence and come to an information meeting.",
        "Our information meetings happen every month, and they're not only for people who want to parent and who want to go through adoption but who want to learn about adoption.",
        "There are a number of books that you can access online or in the library about adoption, but I would say it may be best to start at the source and go to an adoption information meeting.",
        "All right.",
        "Antoinette Williams is assistant director of domestic adoption for New York's Spence-Chapin Services and Lisha Epperson, a mother of two.",
        "She adopted her kids through Spence-Chapin, and she and her husband are lovingly rearing those two little monsters I'm sure we'd say affectionately."
