        "It was the sense that they didn't take the time to get the facts before rendering a judgment.",

        "Can you just explain, for those who don't remember, the gist of the allegations?",
        "I mean, it centered - the primary one came from a woman named Leeann Tweeden.",
        "Right.",
        "She said that when she performed in a skit with Al Franken, back when he was still a comedian, in 2006, for a tour that the USO had, that he forcibly kissed her against her will and stuck his tongue in her mouth.",
        "And then when she rejected his advances, that over the course of that two-week trip, that he subjected her to kind of a campaign of harassment that included taking a humiliating photograph of her while she slept that looked almost like he was groping her breasts.",
        "She was wearing a flak jacket.",
        "But it was sort of a, you know, kind of a mock picture of a leering, lecherous man.",
        "So after her allegation came out, seven other women came forward with their own allegations about sexual misbehavior or what they perceived to be sexual misbehavior on the part of the Senator.",
        "Did you, in the course of your reporting, discover that these allegations were not true?",
        "Well, so what I tried to do was (laughter) take a second look at the case, since Al Franken had never gotten the Ethics Committee investigation and hearing that he asked for.",
        "The whole thing happened very, very fast.",
        "It all happened within three weeks.",
        "His first accuser came out; three weeks later, he resigned.",
        "And so I thought it would be interesting to go back and sort of see if an investigative reporter could do the kind of the second look, see what the facts were, and that's what I was trying to do.",
        "And we don't still have all of the facts because not every witness was willing to speak up."

        "But I did take a close look at as many of these allegations as I could.",
        "And, you know, what I found was that his principal accuser, Leeann Tweeden, who is a conservative talk radio host, had a ton of holes in her story.",
        "It didn't hold up very well, and it turned out that she had never been subjected to any fact-checking.",
        "She had never produced any corroborators.",

        "Most of them were in the military, and they were right there, and they just didn't see it the way she saw it.",
        "So Jane, just in the last 24 hours, though, since your piece came out, there's been a lot of pushback.",
        "Several writers were critical of your reporting on this story, including an opinion piece in The Washington Post suggesting that your piece seeks to explain away Franken's behaviors and to call into question this one accuser's motives.",

        "Were you prepared for that kind of critique?",
        "Yeah, I figured that we were sort of, you know, poking a stick in the hornet's nest.",

        "So the thing is, for me, this is not so different from the work I've been doing for decades.",
        "I wrote a book about Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas.",
        "It took me three years to figure out the facts then, and I try very much to do the real reporting and to approach it with an open mind and to let the facts sort of guide me to where things are - you know, where it makes sense, where the truth seems to lie.",
        "And so all I was trying to do was the same thing that I've always done, which is just do the reporting, talk to all sides, put out the facts.",

        "What do you think your story, your investigation of these facts, says about the #MeToo movement?",

        "She's the lawyer for Christine Blasey Ford.",
        "Her name is Debra Katz.",
        "And so she is as good a supporter of the #MeToo movement as exists in this country.",
        "We should just remind people, Christine Blasey Ford was the accuser against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.",
        "That's right, yeah.",
        "And so Debra Katz says - and I thought that it made a lot of sense - was that, for the #MeToo movement to not be turned into something trivial, it's important that it keep in mind proportionality and due process and fairness and take into account the context of the various kinds of allegations that are being made.",
        "Jane Mayer, staff writer at The New Yorker, thank you so much for talking with us.",
