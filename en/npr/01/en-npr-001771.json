        "Right.",
        "And as a matter of fact, there was one poll that came out in, like, 1963, '64 that called him the fourth least popular of among all the senators, and it really hurt him.",
        "But you know, I mean, he made a car--he made a point of being an iconoclast and a maverick.",
        "His last time he ran for re-election, in 1982, he paid--he spent $145.10 on his re-election campaign, which he won with 60 or 70 percent plus.",
        "I think right now they pay $145--they spend $145 per minute in current campaigns.",
        "It's obviously a different era.",
        "Well, is there an heir to Proxmire or the kind of person that Bill Proxmire was in the Senate?",
        "I mean, I think he actually did inspire young people to go into politics because he made it look like a good business.",
        "He did.",
        "You know, he's always said that politics is his life, but he was all over the map.",
        "It wasn't that liberals liked him or conservatives liked him, because as a liberal he fought hard for environmental laws and civil rights laws, but he was a hawk on Vietnam throughout Lyndon Johnson's presidency.",
        "He didn't become an opponent of the war until 1970, which was late for a lot of Democrats.",
        "If you look at today's Senate, maybe you look at a John McCain, who is not the most popular guy among his fellow Republicans and his fellow conservatives.",
        "But McCain has also touched a nerve that if you look at national polls, he may be the most popular Republican in the country.",
        "You know, coming from Wisconsin, which has always been an independent state, you had Robert La Follette, who was in independent voice in the early 20th century.",
        "You have Russell Feingold now, the only senator who voted against the Patriot Act.",
        "So Wisconsin seems to put out these kinds of mavericks.",

        "He writes the column Political Junkie at npr.org.",

        "More in a moment from DAY TO DAY.",
        "I'm Alex Chadwick, back with DAY TO DAY, where contributing writer Annabelle Gurwitch sneers at all the extroversion of our contemporary lives: the obsession with celebrity, television as confessional, blog as public diary.",
        "Yes, Annabelle sneers even as she finds herself reveling in this.",
        "Yes, sadly, I have fallen prey to what I refer to as `celebrity slowing,' a horrible affliction gripping this nation that is a close relative of `spectator slowing,' the term that refers to the inability to turn away at the scene of a car accident.",
        "We cannot seem to avert our attention from the minute and lurid details of the lives of celebrities.",
        "Now I first noticed this need to share everything with the public even before Bennifer One held this nation's intelligence hostage.",
        "It was right after the tragedy unfolded at Columbine High School, and, as I remember it, several of the parents were quoted as saying they had done interviews on TV as a way of finding closure.",
        "Now I'm not trying to judge the grieving rituals of others, especially people who have lost children in such a horrible way, but I remember thinking at the time, `Didn't people used to talk to God, their spiritual advisers, write in diaries to find closure?",
        "Now we need to go on television.",
        "It's as though if it's not televised, it might not have any meaning.",
        "As a culture, we no longer value privacy or private thought."

        "If Tom Cruise really thought about the future of his relationship, perhaps, well, just perhaps, he would think twice about declaring his love in public after a mere eight weeks of dating.",

        "I was walking through Washington Square Park and I overheard a man engaged in a deep philosophical conversation on his cell phone about the nature of God, politics and the intersection of the two.",
        "He sounded really intelligent, and so I decided to ask him a question--I love talking to random people on the street.",
        "But as I got closer, I realized he was speaking into a Cinnabon.",
        "Uh-huh, a Cinnabon.",
