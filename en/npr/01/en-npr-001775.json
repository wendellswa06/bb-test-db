        "We didn't have any significant conversation.",
        "I mean he's working on his speech for the night.",
        "So that was OK, but I didn't go there for that.",
        "That wasn't my intent.",
        "It's just something that happened.",

        "She doesn't know HBCUs.",
        "And so this is an opportunity to educate her.",
        "So that was a great opportunity that I just felt like was missed.",
        "What was the message that you were bringing the administration?",
        "So one of the ones I wanted to focus on was the Pell Grant Program.",
        "Over 70 percent of HBCU students are recipients of the federal Pell Grant.",
        "So the thing I say - you have basically under-resourced institutions that are the ones that are trying to serve the most under-resourced students and families.",
        "Investing in that program really can change generations.",
        "And so that was very important for me to share that with the secretary of education and some of the key areas that were represented.",
        "Office of Management and Budget was there as well.",
        "But that's very important, so we've got to invest in our young people.",
        "I mean we invest in everything else, and usually education is last.",
        "This comes on a day that President Trump is giving a speech where he is expected to make the case for taking money from domestic programs, including education, to spend more on defense.",
        "Do you feel like you're talking to a receptive audience?",
        "Yeah, we'll see.",
        "I'm really curious to hear what's going to happen with the speech tonight.",
        "And then when the budget starts to be released next month, that will really show whether, you know, the meeting that we had was really productive or if there's still some work that needs to be done."

        "She was looking for a common point.",
        "But of course, as you know, it didn't (laughter) really go over well.",

        "And her phrase this time was, your history was born not out of mere choice but necessity.",
        "So I think there was an acknowledgment that the phraseology wasn't the best.",

        "What were the promises?",
        "Well, that this administration is going to fully support HBCUs in the work that we do; we value HBCUs.",
        "All of that was said, and you know, for me, the proof will be in the budget.",
        "So if we see a cut in programs like Pell, what we were told then is inconsistent.",

        "The public is pretty happy with 85 percent spending cuts and 15 percent tax increases and that should be a great deal for Republicans.",
        "Again, I'm not sure why they don't take that deal.",
        "And the public actually has been very sympathetic to 50/50 proposals with a lot more revenue.",

        "David, to what extent is this impasse, do you think, about let's say tactical politics of who does how well in the 2012 election and who does how well in the polls, and to what extent is it actually about fundamental ideas about government and what the parties stand for?",
        "But fundamentally, it's about an unaffordable welfare state where we have aging populations, medical technologies driving - in Greece, in Western Europe, in Japan - driving all of these countries toward bankruptcy.",
        "How do we deal with that?",
        "And they, E.J., the Republicans, want the Democrats to put something on the table that addresses that problem, as they see it.",

        "And he came back after his regular speech and after a question-and-answer period, and he said he'd like to add some remarks, he said, spoken from the heart.",
        "I'll quote him here.",
        "He said: I must tell you that I find occasional comments from some of your leaders hurtful and inappropriate, when Americans who are serving in your country at great cost, in terms of lives and treasure, hear themselves compared with occupiers enlightened to the brutal enemies of the Afghan people.",
        "They are filled with confusion, and especially at a time that our economy is suffering and our needs are not being met, the American people will ask for our forces to come home.",
        "It was a very clear warning to Karzai that he has to tone down this anti-American rhetoric, which many see as inflaming the insurgency here.",
        "Was there anything in particular that Karzai said that made Eikenberry so upset?",
        "I think it was just coming at the end of two years here as ambassador, during which President Hamid Karzai has become more and more vocally anti-American.",
        "He constantly criticizes the U.S.",
        "for civilian casualties, and they sometimes do apologize for those cases.",
        "But sometimes, the comments he'll make - even, for example, yesterday when inside the capital city of Kabul, three suicide bombers killed 11 people right in the center of the city, and Karzai was instead condemning the coalition forces who are here, essentially, holding up his government."
