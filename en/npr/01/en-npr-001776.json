        "The perfect technique, actually, is a combination of two, at the moment, extreme opposites.",

        "Well, let's take a cubic millimeter of brain, which is about the size of the smallest point you would see in an image taken with this technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging.",
        "So those images show you where blood flow in the brain goes up when you think, and they're very highly resolved.",
        "A cubic millimeter is the voxal size, the three-dimensional pixel size.",
        "And one voxal of an FMRI image, if we imaged that with an electron microscope to see all the synapses with sufficient resolution, that would be about 1,000 terabytes of data or one petabyte.",
