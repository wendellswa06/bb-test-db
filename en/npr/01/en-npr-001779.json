        "Well, I think the core of the song is this idea that, you know, we all make mistakes in life.",

        "And then it's kind of put in the frame of a love story.",
        "You know?",
        "And within a relationship, there's always going to be times where, you know, where you do each other wrong, you know?",
        "Part of the song is where this kind of not holding grudges against people.",
        "You know?",
        "Because I really do see everybody in my life as teachers, you know, who bring - who have important lessons to teach me.",
        "And ultimately, I - whether they're teaching me through hurt or through joy, I ultimately am really grateful to every single person like that.",

        "And Mar was on the other end of the phone, we were chatting and she was like, oh, I wrote this new song.",
        "And she played me the song on the phone, and I was really devastated by it.",
        "I thought it was really amazing.",
        "And at the same time, I was like…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…it was kind of prophetic, you know?",
        "What do you mean it's prophetic?",
        "When Mar wrote, forgive me, lover, for I have sinned.",
        "I've loved you wrong and I've let you go, that was a year before we split up.",
        "So it's, in a way, that's, you know, just to sort of put it straight, it's that thing, like, you see it coming.",
        "But even so, the song sees it coming.",
        "It's almost like you don't logically see anything.",
        "But for some reason, if you're honest and you allow the stuff to come from within and you don't edit, and you really just allow whatever is coming through you to come through, oftentimes, you're predicting the future, you know?"

        "There are interconnections between nerve cells and thousands of target cells, and thousands of different target cells impinge and talk to each nerve cell.",

        "And can we learn anything from, let's say, a network of networks like the Internet, that may apply to how the brain works?",
        "Yeah, I mean, one interesting thing to keep in mind is that the network of the Internet is connecting the brains of individuals together.",

        "There must be some structural substrate, a trace, if you will, of that memory, but we have very little idea now because these tools are just now being developed to actually map out what that would look like.",

        "I think these - my laboratory and a number of other labs are working very hard right now to generate tools that have the speed to generate these images quickly enough.",
        "I'll just give you an example that when we started about five years ago, we were obtaining information at about 1 million pixels of brain image per second, which sounds like a lot, but that's actually quite slow.",
        "To do a cubic millimeter of imaging at that rate takes about 140 years, and to do let's say a rodent brain would take about 7,000 years at that rate.",
        "And over the past five years, we've sped up about 100-fold, and we think in the next two years we'll be at about a billion pixels per second.",

        "The little part of the mouse nervous system that we looked at to completely wire - get a wiring diagram of, from one animal to the other, even from the left side to the right side of the same animal, where the function should be quite similar - we found every single instantiation of this wiring diagram was unique.",
        "And I think a lot of people take that to mean what's the point of doing this at all, with all this variation.",
        "It's worth saying that if you watch two football games, or you watch two chess games, you'll find that every game of a particular sort is different from every other one, but after watching one game of chess, for example, you could infer the rules, so no other game would really be surprising to you.",
        "And I guess that's the same thinking we have here, that there will be certain motifs, certain strategies of connectivity, if you will, of the way nerve cells are connected that from learning from one brain, would allow us to extrapolate in other brains.",

        "Yes, I think this is an extremely important point about our primitive knowledge of the brain.",
        "Compared to other organ systems, where most abnormalities have a physical, histological trace that you can see in a microscope, for most brain disorders, we don't have a physical trace.",
        "And I think this is largely a sign of how low-level our imaging is, relative to the questions.",
        "At the moment, we're far away, to be perfectly honest, from getting a physical manifestation of something like post-TSD, but I think at some point, one would hope that mental illness, learning disorders and other kinds of behavior problems will be amenable to these kinds of studies."
