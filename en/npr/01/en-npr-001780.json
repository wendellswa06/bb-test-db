        "And then I would imagine you need to be able to see a large part of the brain to see how that might originate.",
        "Yeah, of course, one doesn't even know where the problem is.",
        "And this is this problem of size, the big and the small.",
        "You have to be able to accommodate a big area but at very high resolution, and that gives rise to datasets that are just at the moment so large that no one would know exactly how to work with them.",
        "Do you need a supercomputer, you know, like the old Cray or any, put a bunch of them together to get a giant computer to do this?",
        "What kind of computer power do we need?",
        "Give us an idea.",
        "I think what people - there's one thing is to generate the data, and then you need to store it in a large place.",
        "So you need storage capacity that exceeds what most people are used to, you know, many petabytes of storage, tens or hundreds of petabytes.",
        "And that is already one far end of computation.",
        "But that's not sufficient.",
        "You then have to analyze this data to turn these pictures into an actual map, and that requires a kind of computational image analysis that is being developed right now but is very computer intensive.",
        "And the way this is done is typically with clusters of computers that parse this large problem into many small, little pieces, and so thousands of CPUs or even GPUs working simultaneously are necessary to do this.",
        "(As Larry) ...on the TiVo?",
        "Well, this is one of the - yes indeed.",
        "I think one of the ideas, just as the Galaxy Zoo has been very potent as a way of analyzing images of deep space, my laboratory and a colleague of mine at MIT, Sebastian Seung, and another colleague of mine, Hanspeter Pfister in the engineering department here and several other groups, as well, are thinking about ways of recruiting interested parties to help us do this tracing and mapping out.",
        "So not only your computer but your visual system we would take advantage of, as well.",
        "Yeah, because we know that people are much better than computers at visually taking things apart and putting them back together.",
        "Yeah, I mean, one of the great ironies of this work is that we are trying to get computers to do something that humans do quite trivially.",
        "Any five-year-old can trace these wires.",
        "Computers have a hard time doing this.",
        "And what we're trying to trace is the wiring diagram that explains basically how humans do this."

        "My question is this: If I think a thought in an image, like if I think of an old dog I had when I was a kid, and that image is in my mind, and we know that it comes from brain cell activity, right, but if a surgeon cut into my brain, he would not find a little picture of my dog.",
        "He would simply see the neural activity, right?",
        "The surgeon wouldn't - yeah, go ahead.",
        "Right, so do you have any sense where the actual image is, the picture of that dog that's in my mind?",
        "Where might that be in the universe?",
        "Well, it's in your mind, that's for sure, and because it's a visual picture, it almost certainly is - at least one rendering of it, and there are probably many different parts of your brain involved, but it'll certainly be in the parts of the brain that are responsible for image processing, that take visual information and process it progressively farther along.",
        "It has been clear that it's very hard to find a local stroke, for example, that damages a small part of the brain where a person ends up with a perfectly normal brain, except the image of their dog is missing.",
        "And that implies, of course, that your dog is distributed over a rather large area, or there are multiple copies of your dog.",
        "There are places in your brain, and maybe this will come up later in the hour or in the next hour, of - where recognition of faces occur, and if that part of the brain is stroked out, for example, a person can't recognize anyone's face.",
        "It's very hard to get very specific memories lost, suggesting this distribution, that it's not localized spatially the way you would if you were an engineer - you might put your little dog in one place and a spoon right next to it and your cat on the other side.",
        "It's not so clear how it's organized."

        "It can be remolded, reshaped.",
        "Yeah, so I think the - you know, the emphasis, especially as we get older, is on how plastic our brains are.",
        "But of course there's the other side of the coin, and I think this is often left unsaid, but I'd like to emphasize this, that the purpose of memory is to give you the opportunity based on often one trial learning, at some point in development, a lasting, indelible impression about the way the world is.",
        "And that is a bit at odds with a constantly changing brain.",

        "And I see this as wisdom, not really a bad thing, you know, that I'm left with a brain that's consistent with the world, but of course the world is changing very rapidly now.",
        "So this is a somewhat painful thing for people my age, as new tools get invented.",
        "But I think memory's main purpose is not to constantly change but to allow a person to hold on to, for example, how to ride a bicycle.",
        "If you learn as a child how to ride a bicycle, you can stop riding a bicycle for 20, 30 years.",
        "You get on a bicycle as an adult, and after a moment or two of unsteadiness, you're riding pretty well.",
        "But look at an adult who's never ridden a bicycle as a child, and it's clear there's something about their brain, there's some indelible trace about bicycle riding that's missing.",

        "But we also have the case where it's been shown that recall is very unreliable, that - isn't it true that we see that you can make up something in your mind, and your mind, at least the scans will show that it's as if you had actually seen it?",

        "Yes, I mean one of the amazing things about memory is every time you recall something, it's up for grabs again.",
        "And often that is because when you recall it, you want to dress it up with more recent data.",
        "So if the recent data tends to overturn something that you remembered earlier, gradually that memory can morph into something that's quite opposite of what the original memory is."

        "Much of the research around brains is focused on the neural network and the depolarization, the signals sent to each nerve.",

        "So could you please speak about that?",
        "Where might the - where might the information we gain as we grow old be stored physically, molecularly?",
        "All right, good question.",
        "I think this is a very good question and one that's somewhat contentious.",
        "I think we now understand that synaptic connections between nerve cells molecularly can change in ways that persist for long periods of time.",
        "And that has sometimes been mistaken, I think, as thinking that the memory per se is built into those molecules.",
        "Ultimately the brain is just a behavior machine.",
        "Input comes in, it churns around inside, and then there comes an output.",
        "And that is through the connections between nerve cells.",
        "So for example, if I tip your - tap your patellar tendon, and your knee jerks, that's because of a reflex of nerves that activate cells in your spinal cord that then send information back out to the muscle and cause that kick.",
        "You could think of all learning, all information, being the same way.",
        "If I say what is two plus two, that goes in your ears, it rattles around by activating nerve cells, and out comes first in your head the idea of four, and if you're a child, then a signal would be sent down to your deltoideus muscle in your shoulder, pulling your arm up.",
        "So you wave it back and forth so the teacher can see you, so you can then say it's four."
