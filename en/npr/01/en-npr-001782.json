        "So essentially how they do that is they advertise some incredibly low prices, and then once you're in they're hoping that you'll buy other things."

        "So do you have any recourse?",
        "If you have the ad in your hand and you see a different price on the register, you can demand to be given the price, and of course if they don't give it you, you can ask to speak to the manager.",
        "You can threaten them with legal action or speaking to the attorney general or some sort of thing like that.",
        "But if none of that works, you need to be prepared to walk away, and they're hoping you're so excited about buying that product, you'll just accept the price and take the product out of the store.",
        "So, you know, let's talk about technology and how technology has aided or not aided customer service.",
        "You'd think that technology would make it more efficient for customers and companies to communicate and to be satisfied on either end, but has it?",
        "Well, I don't think so.",

        "Ah-hah.",
