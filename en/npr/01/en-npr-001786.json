        "He writes about etiquette for The Washington Post and USA Today and a column called Civilities.",
        "He's host of the Civilist podcast, and he joins us from WUNC in Chapel Hill, N.C., one of our regulars back with us.",
        "Steven, thank you so much for joining us.",
        "Thank you, Michel.",
        "So I know you've all had a week's worth of thoughts on all of this.",
        "But before we get to that, I just wanted to ask you - and I apologize - and I know it's painful, but I did want to ask you all when you first heard the news what kinds of thoughts and feelings this brought up for each of you.",
        "And, Steven, I'll start with you.",
        "When my husband first said there's been a shooting, I was like, OK, you know, that doesn't have anything to do with me.",
        "And then I turned the television on.",
        "It quickly went from 20 to 49, and then I understood that it was an LGBT club.",
        "And then I just really had this moment of shock because I remember how many times I had been in bars dancing, singing, having fun, living my life and then the idea that these young people could be cut down in that moment - I mean, literally, Michelle, it broke my heart.",
        "And it really felt as though any of us could have been them, so it's been a tough week.",
        "I've vacillated between sadness, shock and then anger.",
        "Alexis, what about you?",
        "I was thinking, you know, one of the things that has to be really poignant about this was the timing of this.",
        "First of all, it's during pride week.",
        "You know, June is pride month, but this was pride week.",
        "In a lot of places there are parades and big celebrations, and this is also early on a Sunday morning when a lot of people are just getting up and maybe getting this news the first thing in the morning.",
        "What about you?",
        "What did this raise for you?",
        "Well, actually the night before Saturday night I was out celebrating LA pride with my fiance and her best friend.",
        "And, you know, we had a good time and to wake up to this news was - it was just, you know, horrifying for us.",
        "And it was overwhelming.",
        "It was overwhelming, and we had planned to go to pride that morning as well and, you know, there's just so many emotions going on - fear and just not knowing if, you know, you're safe in a place where you're supposed to feel safe.",
        "And, Jacob, what about you?",
        "And, you know, I hope it's OK if I mention that you're also Arab-American and then the shooter's ethnicity started being reported.",
        "I'm wondering if that was kind of an extra punch in the gut."

        "And so I've had a late night out with some board members and then went home and was - went to the bodega across from the street from my apartment run by a Muslim immigrant couple.",
        "You know, I go up to the counter, and I'm still in my outfit from the board meeting, and so I had some lipstick on and, you know, like a nice dress or whatever.",
        "And the husband's sort of like, oh, my wife wants to know what lipstick you're wearing.",
        "She says that you look beautiful.",
        "She thinks you look really nice, which was not what I was expecting at all given the scripts that we grow up with around how queer people and, you know, Muslim folks are supposed to interact, right?",
        "And then I went to sleep, and then I woke up about 10:30 the next morning.",
        "And I was scrolling through my newsfeed and I saw these ominous posts about something bad happening.",
        "And I was like, oh, Lord, why are all my queer friends posting?",
        "What happened?",
        "What happened?",
        "And I get to the article from The New York Times talking about the shooting.",
        "And by the third paragraph, it says, you know, this is being investigated as an act of Islamic terrorism, and I was just sort of like I'll be damned if this tragedy from the queer community is used to somehow fuel further violence against, you know, Muslim and Arab people all over the world.",
        "And I'll be damned if my sort of two identities of being a Syrian-American and being you know a gender-queer advocate get, like, ripped in half at this moment, you know?",

        "That's right.",
        "I think you can think of this e-DNA, as we call it, as the equivalent for environmental protection of, say, using DNA in crime fighting to detect whether a suspect was at the crime scene.",
        "So, we don't actually have a body, but we have DNA.",
        "Well, what would happen if there, indeed, were many bodies of these carp species in the lake?"

        "But there's lots of reasons to think that they would be highly damaging.",
        "We can look, for example, to what happened in the Mississippi River and the Illinois rivers where these fish now often constitute up to 90 percent or more of what fishermen catch, where commercial fisheries have been almost destroyed with this very abundant fish that has very low commercial value.",
        "In addition, the silver carp, especially, have this unusual habit of jumping high out of the water and they've harmed many people.",
        "They're like living missiles.",
        "And because they reach weights of up to 80 to 100 pounds, a fast-moving boat and a person sitting in it collides with such a fish is likely to come out much worse for the wear.",
        "Wow.",
        "They actually are a hazard, you're saying, in the water.",
        "They are a very serious hazard for boaters.",
        "Now, the carp - these Asian carp - as they get closer to the Great Lakes are coming up river.",
        "How did they get there in the first place?",
        "Well, they were first brought to control nuisance algae and other nuisance organisms in aqua culture ponds, where the primary goal was to produce other fish.",
        "But like all sorts of other organisms introduced for fisheries and for pets and for horticulture, these fishes escaped and they have found the environment of the Midwest - the Mississippi River Basin - very much to their liking.",
        "Professor Lodge, I've heard of the idea of possibly poisoning the Asian carp somehow in the water.",
        "Is that an option?",
        "There is a plan to poison a five- or six-mile reach of the canal in order to reduce the populations immediately below the electric barrier.",
        "That plan was developed before our latest results, which suggests that the carp are above the barrier.",
        "It nevertheless remains important to conduct that poisoning, and to realize that just because there may be some carp above the barrier that the game is not over.",
        "It's not time to give up.",
        "There are lots of examples of invasions that while may initially look successful, may fail or certainly could be made to fail with effective management.",
        "We shouldn't give up at this point.",

        "You could make everybody eligible for a public plan and you could pay at rates that are similar to the rates the government pays for the Medicare program for the elderly.",
        "That would probably save a lot of money.",
        "But then it would be very attractive and a lot of people would probably join that government-sponsored plan.",

        "And before you know it, there are no competitors.",
