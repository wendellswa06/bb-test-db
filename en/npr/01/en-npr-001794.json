        "All right, so Ken, obviously the Monday - the events on Monday in Boston were a terrible tragedy.",
        "That doesn't usually, tragedy or not, usually it's immediately turned to political advantage.",
        "Isn't that generally the case?",
        "Well, it certainly wasn't the case after 9/11.",
        "There was a brief moment, and a horrifying moment but it was a brief moment, where Democrats and Republicans actually talked to each other, looked at each other and worked with each other in the aftermath of 9/11.",
        "And that didn't - it lasted somewhat, a short time, but it didn't last that long.",
        "And then we saw in campaign, subsequent campaigns, people would use tragedies to their political advantage.",
        "We saw that in Georgia in 2002, for example, the race between Saxby Chambliss and Max Cleland.",
        "The Republicans called Max Cleland, he was soft on Osama bin Laden, he was not really truly patriotic, even though of course Max Cleland had lost three limbs and was a decorated war soldier.",
        "But because he voted against some kind of a Homeland Security - part of the Homeland Security bill, he was deemed unpatriotic.",
        "The terrible tragedy in Tucson, when Gabby Giffords was shot, there was a time, I mean, in all fairness, Sarah Palin did release a target list of those in - those Democrats in crosshairs, you know, who voted against Obamacare.",
        "Now people in politics have been talking about targets for years, but a lot of people went after Sarah Palin, said she was responsible for this terrible tragedy.",
        "For this shooting that injured Gabby Giffords and killed others.",
        "Gabby Giffords and killed others, exactly.",
        "So we've seen this before.",
        "But we'd like to think that Boston, the tragedy in Boston would not be political.",
        "The fact is that Yankee Stadium yesterday actually played a Boston Red Sox theme song during their third inning.",
        "And if anybody can get along...",
        "Two groups of fans that do not normally...",
        "No, exactly, so if the Yankees and Red Sox can get together, the politicians should be able to, as well.",
        "But then there was some case, for example Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, the president said - the president called it a tragedy.",
        "Well, it's not a tragedy.",
        "It's a vile act of violence.",
        "And then everybody was questioning why didn't the president call it terrorism in time and then sort of like the debate we had over Benghazi.",
        "And then there were two Democratic members of the House, Steny Hoyer, who is the Democratic whip, and Xavier Becerra, who is the chairman of the House Democratic caucus, implied in a sense that if we didn't have sequestration, it's hurting..."
