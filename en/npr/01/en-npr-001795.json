        "So we don't know if we're going to have these kind of votes or not, whereas the Republicans have their own amendments.",

        "So both sides have amendments.",
        "And of course the Democrats say if our side, if our, the Democratic side, is losing on these things, and the Republicans and the pro-gun folks start winning, they may even pull down the bill itself or at least vote to defeat it.",
        "Although, I mean, I think it's fair to say that people are getting a little pessimistic about the chances of real gun reform, any reform on either side of existing gun legislation.",
        "Is that relatively...",
        "Well, in the fact that no - there has not been any kind of gun law passed since 1994, the assault weapons bill that went out of business after 10 years.",
        "But the fact that two pro-gun, moderate, conservative senators, Pat Toomey, the Republican of Pennsylvania, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the fact that they got together, tried to go forward to compromise is as close as we're going to probably get.",
        "And of course in the wake of Sandy Hook, if we don't get anything out of today's votes, and the votes start at 4 p.m. Eastern Time, then we may be really at square zero again.",
        "All right, well, there's another thing that may have a chance, and that's immigration deal, and that's because of a bipartisan proposal, as well.",
        "We finally have the full Gang of Eight bill, which Marco Rubio has been touting.",
        "What are the chances for immigration?",
        "Well, Marco Rubio is the key person.",

        "You get a green card after 10 years and then possible citizenship after another three years.",
