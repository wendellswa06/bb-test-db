        "My pleasure.",
        "So you served in pre-9/11, fair to say a very different world in terms of threat assessment.",
        "The Kaczynski bombings, the Unabomber, started to circulate about during this time, and so the sergeants of arms would give periodic, like, be careful about suspicious-looking packages.",
        "Well, that was down at the mail room.",
        "That wasn't in our office, except people regularly dropped envelopes off.",
        "I mean, lobbyists - and when I talk about that, I mean grassroots lobbyists - would come up and leave packages for you.",
        "And, you know, I cannot remember a day when anybody seriously worried about the contents of a package other than words that somebody would threaten you.",
        "Nobody in your office or that you ever know of said we got a suspicious package today, or we're concerned about something we got?",
        "You know, again, I may have been oblivious to that, but I can tell you that I do not recall of any member of Congress at that time saying that they received a suspicious package.",
        "Does not mean that somebody didn't get one.",
        "I do not remember in four years getting one either at my district office or in my Washington office.",
        "You know, Jack, Congressman, in addition to of course suspicious packages, you could be, as a member of Congress, as Gabby Giffords was, just appear at a shopping center and some person just lunges out with a gun.",
        "What security concerns did you have back in those days before there was electricity and TV and things like that?",
        "You know, I had the arrogance of being a pretty big guy and, you know, spending a lot of time on athletic fields.",
        "And I guess I had the belief that, well, I'm really not worried about it.",
        "I seriously was never worried about anybody pulling a gun or taking out a knife and stabbing me.",
        "I can remember a couple of things when it was the airport expansion in my district was going on, and it was pretty hot discussion.",
        "I can remember the machinists' local that wanted TWA to be treated in a specific piece of legislation.",
        "And those were pretty hot meetings.",
        "And there was some chest-bumping.",
        "But, you know, it was never - I cannot recall of a moment when I actually felt that my - I was physically in jeopardy."

        "Did members of Congress ever talk to you about personal fears?",
        "I mean, of course we - you know, even though it was pre-9/11, there were still assassinations.",
        "They were - there was Jonestown, there was Bobby Kennedy, there were people again out there with some crazy motives.",
        "Absolutely, but I think - you know, everybody talks about arrogance of elected officials - I think part of that was that we were bulletproof, that we were in a - who would - first of all, who would assassinate a member of Congress?",
        "I mean that was sort of the idea.",
        "But that's all changed.",
        "You know, I wonder when it changed for you, Congressman.",
        "We're speaking with Congressman Jack Buechner, who - a Republican represented Missouri's Second District.",
        "When did it change?",
        "Was it maybe the anthrax threats?",
        "Was it 9/11?",
        "Was it Gabby Giffords?",
        "I think 9/11, of course, raised the sensitivity of security to this level that perhaps during World War II there was a sensitivity to that because of saboteurs, and for that matter the Japanese population in California.",
        "But 9/11 I know changed things.",
        "At that time I was a lawyer working on Capitol Hill a lot, and you could see it.",
        "Everybody was jolted, and then the people charged with protecting the members of Congress, everything changed there.",
        "You know, getting screenings for the people going into the galleries, and don't forget the history, there had been people actually pulled machine guns out and pistols in the galleries of the House and the - well, not in the Senate.",
        "They blew up part of the Senate.",
        "So there certainly was an awareness there, but again I don't think it was that acute.",
        "We want to put a call out to those of you listening, as well.",
        "If you're involved in politics, how have you dealt with threats as a member of politics?",
        "Go ahead, Ken.",
        "I was just going to ask Jack also one thing.",
        "Tamara Keith alluded to this earlier.",
        "We do have this amazing security on Capitol Hill in the post-9/11, anthrax, and the mail is sorted far away from the Capitol.",
        "But a suspicious letter or a package to your congressional office in a - you know, you have several congressional offices.",
        "You obviously don't have that same kind of screening, security that you would have here at the Capitol.",
        "Nope, not in the least.",
        "Let me give everyone the number really quick.",
        "It's 800-989-8255.",
        "But what Ken's talking about is Senator Carl Levin just has said that he received something suspicious at his office.",
        "In Saginaw."

        "Yeah.",
        "In Saginaw, Michigan.",
        "Well, who knows what crank would decide to do that, to sort of pile on.",
        "But the issues of today are - I don't want to say that issues were not as blood-and-guts as they are today.",
        "But I think that the level of rancor that comes out of the constituencies are people that don't live in your district, but hate you for a position you're taking or that you're not taking, is exacerbated much more than it was back then.",
        "And I'm not talking about halcyon days, but there was - again, I use the term bulletproof as an idea that even though presidents have been assassinated, candidates for president have been assassinated, the Jim Jones episode, you know, those things all happened, but it was almost as if they had happened on a different planet.",
        "What about threats, when someone threatens your life?",
        "If you get a postcard that includes a threat, maybe you don't make it public.",
        "But at what point do you decide that it's serious enough to report it to a security detail?",
        "Well, of course, the admonition that you're given is that anything that threatens your - you or your family or your staff, for that matter, even the - I hate to use the term the institution, but, like, all of you, or something like that - you're supposed to turn it in immediately to the security...",
        "No matter what.",
        "No matter what.",
        "It's not your job to decide whether it's a loony toon on the other end.",
        "It's your job to give it to authorities who can find out.",
        "So did you then have to make a decision on whether or not to release something to the public or mention it publicly?",
        "Well, you know, what I would say to that is, is that if it said I'm going to kill you, I'm going to kill your youngest son, I'm going to take out the next meeting, somebody, that's, of course, a real red flag.",

        "If somebody says you'll regret this, you don't want to do this, that could just mean they're going to run against you in the next primary.",
        "So you have to be a little judicious about it.",
        "And, you know, I used to practice law, and I represented some people that were kind of on the margins, and I had more threats from them than I did from constituents, I guess.",
        "Well, we're going to take a call here really quick from Sue in Boise, Idaho.",
        "Our question today, Sue, is for people who've been involved in politics: How do you deal with threats?",
        "What about you?",
        "You know, I haven't been involved in politics in some time, but I worked on Capitol Hill from '79 to '89, a much simpler time.",
        "And at that time, Capitol Hill police were patronage folks.",
        "And the worst we - the most threatening situation would be maybe someone with - I don't know, for lack of a better phrase - mental health issues coming in and wanting something sort of crazy.",
        "And so if you were seated at the receptionist desk, for whatever reason, in a member of Congress' office, every receptionist desk had a little button that you would press, and it was a direct line to the Capitol Hill police, and you were instructed just to say your books are ready in, whatever, room 424 Cannon.",
        "And then a policeman would come.",
        "But it was the simpler time.",
        "You worked - how - what position did you work in?",
        "I was a legislative assistant for a member of Congress.",
        "So you - when you were sitting at that desk - let me get the picture in my mind here, Sue.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "You were sitting a desk, and you had, like, a red panic button?",
        "Well, I wouldn't call it a panic button.",
        "It was a little button under the desk.",
        "And, you know, again, you never felt like you were in a situation where you would panic.",
        "But if you were uncomfortable for any reason - because, remember, all those offices were completely open.",
        "Yeah."
