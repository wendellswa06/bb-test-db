        "Yeah.",
        "I think, you know, great leaders have great instincts, and Mayor Giuliani understood from those early moments how crucial it was to communicate to New Yorkers and to the country that, you know, government was intact.",
        "Obviously, the focus at that time was to - was on rescue and recovery, but his philosophy was always in times of crisis, the most important thing is to get out in front of the public and let them know that government is in charge, and that we're going to work through this.",
        "And so there were actually a couple of different press conferences on the fly.",
        "The mayor was walking up, I believe, Church Street, and he did a phone interview with New York One shortly after the first tower collapsed.",
        "And then we were at the - we all kind of convened at a fire station, which is just burned in my head, this empty firehouse and everyone was assembling, including the fire commissioner, the police commissioner.",

        "So, obviously, at the moment when something like this occurs, a political leader is responsible for not only getting out what information they can, but they also have to make sure the information they give out is correct, and they have to make people feel better.",
        "How do you balance all of those things?",
        "That's a great question, because in those early moments, there's also a tremendous amount of pressure being applied from reporters, from different constituencies, from all level of government.",
        "So you're taking inbound requests for more information, and the impulse could be to give away facts that eventually turned out not to be the case.",

        "Right.",
        "And that's exactly what President Bush and Mayor Giuliani did in the days after - the moments after 9/11.",
        "But there are sometimes - with the case of Boston, we don't know what's happening, and you hear very strange complaints.",
        "They don't know - why don't we know and why hasn't the president called it terrorism and why don't we know by now?",

        "Well, I just want to echo the point you just made, which is there is this tremendous amount of pressure in those early moments to put out information.",
        "And I think if you succumb to that pressure, especially in the immediate aftermath of an incident or an attack, inevitably you're going to put out more information that's wrong than right.",
        "And what that does is undermine confidence in government.",
        "So it's important to exercise restraint and err on the side of caution while also projecting calm and confidence that you have a plan, you know, to get to the bottom of it and you're focused on the recovery.",
        "So in terms of what I would do differently, it's so easy to second guess.",
