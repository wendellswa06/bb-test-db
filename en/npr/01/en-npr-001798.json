        "Matt, I was just thinking about - of course, about what Mayor Giuliani did after 9/11.",
        "Now, of course, that was a mayoral election year.",
        "I hate to bring politics in part of this, but that was a mayoral election year.",
        "But Giuliani was not up for election.",
        "There were term limits.",
        "What happens when somebody who's running for office in the middle of a tragedy and how - what do you do to make the public realize or understand that you're not trying to exploit this politically?",
        "I think you make sure that you express your condolences and your concern appropriately and then you get out of the way.",
        "I mean, that's the reality if you're not - and you're not in government.",
        "And at the time, it was - 9/11 was a primary.",
        "Right.",
        "Primary day that day, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I was actually en route to meet the mayor, you know, at a polling site.",
        "So obviously, the entire world changed, you know, that morning.",
        "But I think the candidates at the time, they handled it appropriately.",
        "I mean, you know, you don't want to go anywhere near that.",
        "You want to just stay out of the way.",
        "No.",
        "But I'm saying but if you're mayor and you have to - and you're running for office or you're up for office and you're responsible for calming the public, how do you - you just have to avoid, obviously, trying to - make it sound like you're playing politics.",
        "Right.",
        "You have to avoid the appearance of trying to, you know, maximize anything for yourself.",
        "In our case, obviously, mayor was not up for re-election, so we didn't contend with that issue.",
        "But I think you're absolutely right.",
        "You know, it's easy to be criticized.",
        "I think in a time of crisis, though, people understand the role of government and separate that out from the political role at the office.",
        "We're speaking with Matt Higgins who was press secretary to Rudy Giuliani during the 9/11 attacks.",
        "So, you know, Matt, there's always - the transition between the immediate aftermath when you're just trying to get what little information that you have out to that moment when you become sort of the consolation of your city, your county, whatever you were leading, right?",
        "So how do you choose those words of reassurance that are not necessarily information for people to absorb but words of comfort?",
        "Yeah, that's a great question.",
        "I remember the U.S., you know, moments that stick out in your mind, I mean, for me, and I was fairly young at the time, 26 years old, and I was experiencing the attack like everyone else.",
        "And I remember watching the mayor talk and he was - there was a lot of pressure to put out a casualty figure.",
        "And he kept saying it was way too early, but I think his response was whatever it is, it'll be more than any of us can bear, something to that effect.",
        "And it just struck the right tone.",
        "And I have to say there was - no one was giving the mayor advice about how to handle this.",
        "No one - I mean, of course, there are advice in other respects.",
        "But in terms of communicating, that was really all him and going on instinct.",
        "And so, striking the emotional tone is very important from the very beginning.",
        "I think the police commissioner in Boston made a similar point that this attack does not show our weakness.",
        "It shows our strength by virtue of the immediate public response, and I think that's 100 percent true.",
        "I want to take a listen to short examples of other presidents speaking to the nation in times of crisis.",
        "First, this is 1986, President Reagan consoling the country after the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded, killing all seven of its crew members."

        "We will have resolution.",
        "Is that the kind of thing that you - a leader has to mention?",
        "I think the - no question you have to mention.",
        "You also want to ensure that you're being responsible and you're not obviously provoking at the wrong time when the focus should really be on rescue and recovery.",
        "So - but there is always a need and a sense that you want to be reassured government is going to pursue justice.",
        "I think they struck the right tone in Boston, as well.",
        "You know, I remember also going back to 9/11.",
        "President Bush took some criticism in those early days for not being as visible as some may have wanted.",
        "But sometimes the unscripted moments can be even more powerful.",
        "And when President Bush came to ground zero - I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday morning - and he was going to the crowd and talking to first responders and he climbed the top of a pile with a firefighter and put his arm around him.",
        "And the crowd started chanting - shouting, you know, U.S.A.",
        "and someone said I can't hear you.",
        "And the president says, you know, well, I can hear you and soon all the terrorists will hear you too.",
        "I forget his exact words.",
        "But that was completely spontaneous, very powerful and very emotional.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And we have a call here from Will(ph) in Louisville, Kentucky.",
        "Will, was there a moment when a leader said something that really struck you?",
        "Well, what the gentleman just said was probably the most that struck me of anytime in my life, but almost as close to that is the most recent events that happened in Newtown, the terror that happened there.",
        "I was just really struck by President Obama as just genuine.",
        "I mean, every - such genuine tenderness and when they kept saying things like comforter-in-chief and, you know, you hear that as like a cliche."

        "And I must say that really touched me, and I was not and never have been a fan of President Reagan.",
        "And I think also, although I don't remember the exact words or timing, my impression was of a very calm, steady influence from President Johnson after the Kennedy assassination.",
