        "It's a large influx of Hispanics, as opposed to a smaller amount of African-Americans.",
        "Now, one of the things that he said, before I go to Robert, to talk to him, is that - these are his words, 99.9 percent get along well, it's just that little fraction that bring the gang life from the streets into the jails and prisons and continues it there and, in fact, escalates it there.",
        "I must have misunderstood, because I believe that he was talking about 99.9 percent on the streets that get along well, but in the prison system, in the jail system, it's not that way.",

        "Well, it's quite similar.",
        "I think without a doubt that the racial tension, because the Latino population is swelling and has a great deal of influence in the prison system in Arizona, that yes, they - I mean, it is there all the time.",
        "I think the definite groups hang together largely based on protection or because the tension is always - could always explode in any given time.",
        "Is it more because of race, Robert, or is it because of overcrowding and that it's a space issue as much as anything else?",
        "Well, prison is territorial.",
        "Space, by its nature, certainly could have something to do with it, but I think that the conditions and time has to do - I mean, if you put 6,000 men, 5,000 men with an average time of 15 to 20 years doing, that's not going to be a nice prison.",
        "The way also of what I have to do to keep myself together, have any (unintelligible) to making any sense to stay in order is very limited."
