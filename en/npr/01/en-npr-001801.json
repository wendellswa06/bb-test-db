        "It's a lot more structured, it's lot more disciplined.",
        "An individual who is disrespectful to another race in prison will be dealt with immediately for disrespecting another race.",
        "Where in jail it would be laughed at, and if you guys want problems then, you know, then on a riot would ensue.",
        "But prison is setup as, sort of as little cities.",
        "These are little small communities inside the gate, so they don't want any negative look from the staff or the COs(ph) because they want to continue to do whatever is going on in there that, you know, they don't want to be disrupted.",
        "So, of course there's a lot more discipline in prison than in jail.",

        "He has several different programs in there that offer life management skills and you'll see African-American and Latinos together come and they have the lowest (unintelligible) rate as well for offering programs like that.",
        "One of the things, Robert, that I asked the sheriff was about Latino and black conflicts tend to happen where Latinos and black are located, and right now that's largely in the southwestern part of the country.",
        "In terms of racial violence though in other parts of the country, if you know, are the issues the same even between other ethnic groups?",
        "Well, I don't want to speak as an expert in that regard but I do believe that, as if to say it, there is a lot of things that are centered around the way in which a man is ushered into the prison system.",
        "In somewhat saying that you have a chip on your shoulder because we realize that there has been not an equal playing field of the justice system in the way in which sentences are given.",
        "And so therefore, certainly I believe that there could be a tension that corners itself into other parts of country.",
        "Based on what we just got through with the federal laws that changed rock cocaine sentencing versus powdered cocaine sentences based on classes more than racism.",
        "So, yeah, I do believe that there is certainly going to be pockets of frustration, it is always going to be gauged, and if I got 15 years for something, that my counterpart of another active group got five, well that already has implication of I'm less than.",
        "How do, now that both of you are out and both of you are actively involved in trying to do positive work, you try work with at-risk populations, Skipp?",
        "Tell us what you think the biggest issues are?",
        "Some of the biggest issues are these people coming from dysfunctional families.",
        "I myself didn't realize that I came from a dysfunctional family.",
        "And if I have these conditions that I am surrounded in, I create them as being normal.",
        "See once I normalized the fact that, I have dehumanized myself, I have dehumanized the people around me, then I have no value for life.",
        "I have no value for education.",
        "I have no value for society.",
        "And what society would like for us to do is to change the mindset of these individuals, but at the same time society isn't changing their perception of these individuals.",
        "So there are no jobs when they got out of jail.",
        "There is no rehabilitation in the rehabilitation center.",
        "So what do they have to offer them?",
        "We are putting them, placing them back the cesspool, back right in the same conditions and dysfunction that they come from.",
        "What do you tell, Robert, the people on the outside about, A, staying out and B, if you do go in, what you have to do to survive while you are in, particularly given the racial tensions that we have been discussing so far?",
        "Well you know, sending them - preparation for prison is one of the things that not at the top of the list, but after a person has got incarcerated and finds himself in a difficult situation, there is such a wide brush across the country.",
        "Certainly in Portland, Oregon there has been a real partnership in the - most crimes they are going federal.",
        "And I tell these guys mostly in the sense of saying that, why are you doing this?",
        "I mean, you might have fail in Portland and you might find yourself in Kentucky, or you might find yourself in South Dakota.",
        "And sometime as by design, if you take a black gang member and you put him in a different culture where he wasn't getting visits in the local jail in his own city."

        "And that is one of the things I would say but, those that - I have a transition program and it's about going home versus getting out.",
        "And the mythology of that to is understand that going home is ownership.",
        "Getting out is a rental.",
        "So we realized, as we scan this country, that most of homeowner properties a lot have a greater value.",
        "And so I'm saying to these guys that you cannot use an excuse that I can't get a job or can't do this as an alternative to try to turn yourself around into crime.",

        "I don't believe there is right now.",

        "And the only way I see to straighten up the problem is to balance the modules, balance the number the of inmates you find when you have larger number of African-American in the same cells with the same amount of Latinos, then these riots don't takes place.",

        "So there are two indictments - one was for coercion, one was for misuse of state property - the state property being money that was appropriated by the legislature.",
        "Both of them focus on his veto threat and then eventual veto of money for the state's Public Integrity unit, which is a prosecutorial unit that has jurisdiction over state lawmakers and state agencies.",
        "He wanted the head of that unit to resign because she had pleaded guilty to drunk driving and served time in jail - said if you don't resign, I'm going to zero out your budget.",
