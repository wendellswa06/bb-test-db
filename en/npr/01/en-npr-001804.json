        "Good morning, Ron.",
        "Good to be with you, Sacha.",
        "Ron, we heard this week that President Trump now says he would support what he calls meaningful background checks.",
        "And Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said that when the Senate returns from recess in September, gun laws will be front and center.",
        "That's how he put it.",
        "Do you believe there's actually going to be a real breakthrough this time?",
        "And are we actually going to have legislation, or even a debate about legislation, on guns?",
        "The president says he wants to do something on what he calls intelligent background checks.",
        "That's what he said Friday before heading off for vacation at one of his golf resorts.",
        "That statement would hold out hope, except we've heard this before.",
        "On face value, that sounds promising.",
        "Democrats will say we've heard it several times from the president.",
        "He's even talked about restricting assault weapons.",
        "That was 18 months ago after the high school shooting in Florida.",
        "But every time the president has talked this way, he's reversed himself.",
        "That would come after he's talked to the NRA and some of his Republican Party in Congress, as he's been doing this week.",
        "In the past, nothing gets done.",
        "The key person to watch is the man you mentioned, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate.",
        "He says he'll bring it all to the floor in September for a debate or what he calls a discussion.",
        "But he did not say he would bring the Senate back from its five-week vacation early, nor did he commit to bringing the bill to the floor that the House passed months ago on these issues.",
        "And he did not say he himself had experienced any change of heart regarding gun reforms of any kind.",
        "So there may be a sea change coming on guns, Sacha, but we haven't seen it yet.",
        "And I'm sure this was a topic happening this weekend at the Iowa State Fair, where most of the Democratic presidential candidates are.",
        "They're hoping to make an impression at the first-in-the-nation caucus.",
        "How, Ron, would you assess the Democratic contest right now?",
        "Yes, they all go to the state fair.",
        "There seems to be a certain legitimacy that's conferred by posing for pictures with a cow made entirely of butter.",
        "The state fair is the unofficial starting gun, as you say, for the Iowa caucuses six months away.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: He has my complete and total endorsement.",

        "I'm fighting with him to drain the swamp."

        "I was driving around and was able to see the trailer park, and it appeared to me that about a third of the trailers had been leveled.",

        "This happened overnight, Andrew.",
        "Did the weather service issue tornado warnings before people went to bed?",
        "There were watches in effect, as I recall, and I woke up--I actually live only about a mile or a mile and a half to the area that the tornado went through--and heard sirens and heard the warnings going on.",
        "But as I understand it from people who lived in the trailer park, it was just so sudden there was hardly any time to react.",
        "How do people describe this--the sound of it coming, what they first saw after the impact?",
        "It was the sound of a freight train that you so often hear associated with tornadoes, and one woman I talked to said, `I came on so suddenly; it was over in about 30 seconds.",
        "And what was most painful to her was after the tornado was passed, it was quiet, and she began to hear names of people living in the area being yelled out into the night, people trying to find those that presumably had been covered by debris and the damage.",
