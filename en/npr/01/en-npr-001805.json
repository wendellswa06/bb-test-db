        "The pledge has four basic parts.",
        "First: a promise to nominate judges who will not, quote, \"\"legislate from the bench,\"\" second: avow to appoint only anti-abortion personnel to key administration posts, third: to end taxpayer funding of abortion and defund Planned Parenthood and any other organization that performs or funds abortions.",
