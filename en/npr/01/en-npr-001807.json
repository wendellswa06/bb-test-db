        "And I think it's important to point out there's some history there.",
        "Well, yes, of course, there's been all kinds of history as far as, you know, police and citizens, going back years and years.",
        "But one of the things I want to talk about is how the mayors in all of these cities, including Oakland, are extremely conflicted.",
        "And they're conflicted because, on the face of it, most big city mayors might support many of the ideas behind the Occupy movement.",
        "But, of course, they're also under incredible pressures by police, the overtime cost, business pressures, et cetera.",
        "So here we have a situation in Oakland, for example, where you have this huge show of force.",
        "You have five volleys of teargas.",
        "You have all kinds of stuff happening, some police injured, lots of arrests, et cetera.",

        "We have high levels of unemployment.",
        "We have high levels of foreclosure that makes Oakland part of the 99 percent.",
        "He goes on for paragraphs.",
        "You know, most of us are part of the 99.",
        "We are committed to honoring free speech.",
        "So, you know, you have this situation where, clearly, there is, on the one hand, local pressures on these mayors, and, on the other hand, what they might, as sort of liberals in these big cities, come forth with.",
        "You have, you know, Rahm Emanuel, same thing.",
        "You know, he came out early, supporting Occupy Chicago.",
        "And then, of course, we have all these arrests, and he said we also have to deal with the rule of law.",

        "That's Mayor Bloomberg in New York.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",

        "And he's been very, very - Kasim Reed in Atlanta, you know, came out.",

        "But, you know, this guy came in to Atlanta with an - into the park with an AK-47.",
        "I got really - a little freaked, you know?",

        "Most reliable, no.",
        "...but - not the most reliable, but, apparently, there's been this rebellion in the kitchen at Occupy Wall Street because a lot of homeless hangers-on have been coming in and raiding the food.",

        "The community board in New York, the local community board down near there, supports - passed a resolution saying we support the Occupy Wall Street movement, but the one thing we want is we'd like the drumming to stop, you know.",
        "So there's all this drumming, and drumming can be wonderful but it can also really be nerve-wracking.",
        "So the general assembly, which meets every night and has all these meetings and it's all by consensus, they finally came up with a proposal to basically limit the drumming to four hours a day.",
        "Now, the community board wants two.",
        "But the real problem was that the drummers, they're drumming.",

        "Right, right.",
