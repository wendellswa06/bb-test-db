        "And you know, granted, these protests aren't nearly as mass quantity in numbers as the people in like, you know, Pennsylvania or New York or California, but my whole thing is, is that these people are so aggravated that the police are stepping in and arresting them and breaking this up.",
        "Well, all these people are doing is creating civil disobedience and disorder.",

        "But my point is, is that by having hundreds of people ranting and raving, you know, a phrase over and over and over, how does that create order in this world?",
        "I mean, and it's very unfortunate that veteran got injured the way that he did.",
        "But the point is, is that nobody put a gun to his head and said you have to come to this protest.",

        "But one thing that I've noticed is that the local news media, while it does sort of, every couple of days, just kind of comment and maybe bring the cameras down for a quick snapshot, it seems like the movement itself has been largely ignored by the larger media outlets.",
