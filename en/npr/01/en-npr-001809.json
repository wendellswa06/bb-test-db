        "Just a slip of the tongue, Bob.",
        "What do you think?",
        "You know, when I read it, I was thinking to myself this sounds like a slip of the tongue because he was so very apologetic, but after hearing it just now, it doesn't quite sound so much like a slip of the tongue anymore.",
        "I have to say, I guess, my attitude is kind of turned around about this.",
        "It sounded deliberate, I have to say.",
        "Reading it, it didn't sound that way, but hearing it, it sounds almost like - it sound deliberate.",
        "Yvonne, there have been so many radio shock jocks, their nickname on the airwaves, like Imus, who have gone out and used racial slurs against prominent African-Americans.",
        "And as Bob mentioned, this gentleman, who was the radio host, he didn't break tone.",
        "He was like, oh, oh, I'm sorry, but he didn't really say, oh, I'm sorry.",
        "Does it make a difference, his delivery, make a difference?",
        "And what's the real issue here?",
        "Is the issue that we, once again, are shocked that there are racial slurs on the radio?",
        "Or is that kind of now par for the course?",
        "Well, I think it's unfortunately par for the course, but I think the difference between someone like Imus or Howard Stern, you know what you're getting when you turn onto those stations.",
        "You know that they are there to shock, and whether that's sexual content or whether it's racial content, or racial slurs, you know what you're going to get.",
        "I think what is problematic when you turn on a regular station and you're looking to hear news or sports, and you hear this type of language.",
        "Now, frankly, when I read it, I just found it a bit incredulous.",
        "You know, coon, I mean that's the term that the guys used.",
        "Slip of the tongue, well, it had to be somewhere in your consciousness for it to slip out.",
        "So to me, it's always a slippery slope to start thinking about what people's intent was, but he had a responsibility, just like the rest of us.",
        "We're on the air.",
        "He said it, and he has to pay the price for it.",
        "So again, I think it has to be a strong message that's sent.",
        "And piggybacking on that, I think black Americans have another responsibility.",
        "We will refuse to really deal with people who use the N word, black entertainers, rap artists and such, so we're sending a mixed message out there in the universe, and we're going to have to get clear about our own message before we can really get stark about language and how it pertains to us.",
        "Walter, Yvonne raises the point that really the N word has now been taken over, in some ways, by African-American entertainers.",
        "Some hip-hop critics say that this is an attempt to diffuse the word.",
        "Are we going to have to diffuse every racist word?",
        "What is the appropriate response to all the many different slurs that are against African-Americans?",
        "And of course, every ethnic group has slurs against them.",
        "Well, I mean, I think we should have a zero tolerance policy across the board, and I do think it's a matter of context, particularly when you're talking about news programming.",
        "Look, I was one of the people that led the charge against Bob Grant in the New York metropolitan area because Bob Grant had had a history when he was on WABC radio, of just slurring African-Americans.",
        "But I think that we also have to look back--I mean, I've just listened to that clip.",
        "That was no slip of the tongue.",
        "You know, if that was a slip of the tongue, I have a few choice words I'd like to say right now on the air, but I know that I can't say them.",
        "So you know, I think that we have to put things in context, but I think Yvonne is right about we have to get our own act together and determine what the standard is going to be because we are sending mixed messages when we also use derogatory terms within our own community that we then deem offensive when others use them.",
        "So I think, you know, there is a need for clarity here.",
        "Walter, let's move on to another topic.",
        "The U.S.",
        "Supreme Court rejected a request to give residents in the territory of Puerto Rico the right to vote in U.S.",
        "presidential elections.",
        "This is the latest development in a longstanding debate over the islanders' constitutional rights, and it may actually precipitate a new referendum on whether they should be independent, a U.S.",
        "state, or remain a territory."
