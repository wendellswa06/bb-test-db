        "So the way she described it is that she's autistic, and that allows her to sympathize or to see the world in a more sensory-based way.",
        "That's what she says.",
        "And that's how animals see the world, is her argument.",
        "And so she can design slaughter plants that are sort of more humane, because she can see things more easily, perhaps, than other people cannot.",

        "So much more.",
        "As I said, I mean, you know, we really could have easily montaged(ph) together 10 minutes of amazing and interesting quotes.",
        "One thing that I asked Dr. Grandin about - and I was there with our senior producer Annette Heist, and we were doing this interview.",
        "We were wondering, you know, what role does autism play in her life?",
        "And this is how she describes it.",

        "You see, autism's an important part of who I am, but it's secondary to being a professor of animal science, being a designer, being a scientist.",
        "That comes first."
