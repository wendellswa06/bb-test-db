        "But in terms of how you provide access to the opportunity, it's like in a painting.",

        "So we've heard the broad strokes, and he even acknowledge the broad strokes himself.",
        "He's like, we know we need smaller classroom size.",
        "We know we need programs and opportunities, et cetera.",
        "But we never hear about the details.",
        "And considering the fact that he's been in the Senate for 30 years, it seems as if you would have had 30 years of being able to be a part of fixing this process.",
        "And I think that goes to regardless of the level of street credibility you may have in the civil rights movement, or in putting people together and witnessing things in the '60s - regardless to that, it speaks to the nature of being in the Senate for 30 years.",
        "And I really think that when it comes down to it, when you're a career senator or a career legislator, people don't tend to look to you to be president because you're not in the position where you make executive decisions.",
        "You're full of talk that says, well, I proposed this.",
        "I called for this.",
        "But you're never in a position where you say, I took a stand and made this happen.",
        "So I think that that eventually, that's going to come up and - although he might be bolstered by the two cardinal rules that you gave him that might save him from a political misstep in the future.",
        "Well, very briefly, before we move on - because there's a lot of other stuff to talk about.",
        "I want to just sort of get each of you - how about, E.R., John, and then back to Jeff - do you think that experience can be a disadvantage now in the presidential campaign where you've got Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, neither of whom has been in for even a decade - you know, Barack not even having been in for five years or for a full term, a full six-year term - is experience actually disadvantage to a certain degree in this campaign?",
        "It depends on what kind of experience you're talking about.",
        "The experience of a Joe Biden for 30 years in the Senate may mean that his time has passed.",
        "We've been through too many cycles where nothing was quite accomplished that had been promised to us as a nation.",
        "And so I think it depends on the type of experience.",
        "Obama has experience.",
        "Clinton has experience.",
        "They're in different ways, though, than someone who's just been in the Senate for 30 years.",
        "John?",
        "Well, I think experience can be nice, but there are also times when fresh perspectives and fresh thinking are necessary.",
        "And it could be argued that somebody like Obama, having been in for such a short time means that his thoughts haven't hardened into certain patterns, that he isn't as beholden to certain groups.",
        "And so actually, I think that experience sometimes can be overrated.",
        "I kind of like the direction that things are going in."

        "I think that it's just like with teaching their people who are career teachers for 30-plus years.",
        "There are people who are career administrators in education, and they got out of the classroom after a few years to get into administration.",
        "There's a reason why somebody would spend 30 years in the classroom, because they are not administrative material.",
