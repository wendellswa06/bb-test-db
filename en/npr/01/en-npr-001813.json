        "Puerto Rico's voted several times and they've consistently rejected statehood.",
        "And so I think that speaks because one of the arguments or the argument, I believe, that the government uses in denying them this right is that only states, only people who live in states can vote in the United States, in the 50 states, can actually vote for the president.",
        "And apparently, if you're a U.S.",
        "citizen, as Puerto Ricans are, but you move to Puerto Rico from the U.S., you then cannot vote.",

        "And it remains to be seen if there is enough backing for something like that to happen here.",

        "Why do you think that there has been so much resistance to becoming a U.S.",
        "state even though it would confer extra voting rights?",
        "Well, I think it's an issue about whether or not they want to retain their own individuality, and as was just mentioned, in 1998 they had a referendum and 46 percent of Puerto Ricans decided, voted in favor of statehood, 2.5 percent voted for independence, total independence from the United States, and 50 percent or thereabouts wanted none of the above.",
        "They voted for none of the above.",
        "So I think that does speak to the ambivalence.",
        "Certainly they have some limited benefits to being under the aegis of the United States, but for them, I think a lot of Puerto Ricans think it might be more of a loss to their identity as Puerto Ricans to become a state.",
        "And frankly, a lot of the people who voted for statehood were, from my understanding, the more affluent Puerto Ricans.",
        "The working class and poorer Puerto Ricans were not particularly in favor of this.",
        "So again, I think the argument continues to be made until Puerto Ricans make a more vigorous attempt or aggressive attempt to want to determine what their status is, that United States is not going to really have much of an incentive to do any constitutional changes or any amendments to benefit them.",
        "Walter, let's tackle the topic of drug free school zones.",
        "They are almost a joke in some communities because if you want to buy drugs, some folks say you just go to a drug free school zone.",
        "But these laws have been a staple of the war on drugs.",
        "Now some legislators and activists, are asking whether these laws are fair and effective.",
        "The Justice Policy Institute released a report yesterday claiming that the laws have not shielded young people.",
        "In fact, only 1 percent of the cases that come out of these laws involved drug sales to youth, but they have been disproportionately affecting blacks and Hispanics.",
        "Should these laws be reformed and revised?",
        "Well, I certainly think they should be revisited.",
        "I mean, I think, you know, if you look at drug use in the United States, certainly we still have a serious problem, and I think there was a psychological effect when these laws first went into place that we wanted to think that, at least around schools, that there was sort of a zone of safety.",
        "That hasn't necessarily happened.",
        "So I think it is time to revisit this situation, and I think there might be some other policy remedies that are more effective than this notion of creating these drug free school zones."

        "If there's more activities in these particular areas, in comparison to suburban areas, then I think it stands to reason that, you know, that people who are selling in these areas possibly will be black and Latino.",

        "I'm not so sympathetic to drug dealers.",
        "I think that, certainly, if this is first time offense, perhaps you should not get the same penalty as someone who is a repeat offender.",

        "I think it has to be some type of piece into, into these penalties.",

        "In some areas, there are black and Latinos who are committing the crime against other black and Latinos, and we have to deal with that, and stop worrying about what's happening in suburbia.",

        "If there were white people who could make money coming into urban areas and selling drugs, they certainly would do it, and they certainly are already there.",

        "Bob was essentially saying, look, I want to rehabilitate the drug users, I don't care so much about the dealers.",
        "But some of the dealers see prison as basically a school for crime.",
        "You go in, you come out with more skills, you can commit better crime.",
        "Well I think we have to treat the addiction side of the public health problem, and I don't think we do.",

        "drug policy right now.",
        "It doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and until we begin treating people that have, you know, addictions, we're always going to see, you know, a recurrence of behavior of the nature.",
        "You know, in terms of the racial overlay, you know I will tell you, you know, drugs are rampant in suburban communities.",
        "And I think it's a matter of how, you know, environments are perceived because you could probably go into any suburban community, particularly around a school, and find major drug activity.",
        "And perhaps, you know, in cities that are exempting golf courses, perhaps they need to include the golf course because I'm quite sure there's some activity going on, on that golf course.",
        "I think U.S.",
        "drug policy just has not made sense, period, across the board.",
        "And until we begin to really treat this as a public health issue, really determine that we're going to make sure that we put the dealers behind bars and not let them get out for a substantial period of time, and make this notion of dealing drugs, no matter where you deal them, you know, a very serious issue, we're always going to come back to this.",
        "And unfortunately, for small children who are being caught up in it, and if you go into urban communities, they are being caught up in it at a very early age, I think we do have to refocus our attention on how we protect children and young adults in this matter.",
        "But I think the point, what I was trying to get at, at least in terms of clarifying is that in certain communities, it's right there in your face.",
        "If you're standing on the corner, you're accosted by the dealers, and that's a reality.",
        "Where, certainly, I agree with you, there are drugs everywhere, but at least in some other communities, it is more cloak and dagger and clandestine.",
        "So I agree that it needs to be across the board penalty, but I think it's, in some places you cannot even walk down the street without being intimidated or fearful because the drug dealers have taken over, and I think to pretend that that does not exist is to obscure the real problem."
