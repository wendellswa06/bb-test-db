        "Nothing, and of course if you look at the history of sixth year in a presidential term, this would be the sixth year in 2014, will be the sixth year of the Obama presidency, and the out party often, almost always, does much better, does really well.",
        "Of course in 2008 - in 1998 with Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the Republican Party was thought to overreach, and the Democrats actually won.",
        "But for the most part, a sixth year in a presidency is bad news for the president's party.",

        "Well, the news in Virginia, of course there's two gubernatorial contests, and of course as we always say, we like to know who the next gubernors(ph) will be in Virginia and New Jersey.",
        "And in New Jersey, Chris Christie is running for a second term, and perhaps a lot of what he did with Hurricane Sandy may have been more about 2013 and less about 2016...",
        "Chilly reception for Chris Christie at the Republican Governors Association.",
        "Yes but a very good reception back home.",
        "They all feel that he did his job, and the polls show him doing a very good job in the wake of Hurricane Sandy.",
        "But the news this week is in Virginia where Senator Mark Warner, former governor of Virginia, announced once and for all that he would not leave the Senate to return to the governorship.",
        "And that's good news for Terry McAuliffe, the former DNC chair who is the only announced Democrat in that race for the governorship.",
        "And the attorney general, a conservative figure there, Mr. Cuccinelli, seen as the favorite for the Republican nomination, but he will not go unopposed."
