        "But the Republicans feel that this was a little playing of politics by Susan Rice and the administration, and they're determined to defeat her should she be nominated for secretary of state.",
        "And the determination by Lindsey Graham and John McCain and Kelly Ayotte, among others, they say they would do anything in their power to block this nomination.",
        "Of course, they could any individual one of them block that nomination.",
        "Sure, I mean, they could have a filibuster, and of course there's certainly no 60 seats, so...",
