        "We saw that with Eisenhower too.",

        "And, of course, Bill Clinton did get impeached.",
        "He was not convicted in the United States Senate and ended - left office with great popularity numbers.",
        "Yeah, that's what I said.",
        "I mean, you know, we don't know whether we blamed Clinton or the Republican Congress for overreaching.",
        "We always talk about a second-term president overreaching, and there will be accusation about Obama's first term.",
        "But if the Republican Congress overreached in the impeachment of 1998, I think the American people felt that as well.",
        "And that's why he left number - left office with such high numbers.",
        "And before we leave you, Ken, it's being reported Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned today in a letter to the speaker of the House.",
        "The congressman just won re-election after being largely out of sight for several months, undergoing treatment for mental illness.",
        "Well, we're going to be watching it.",
        "It looks like the problems are quite receding into the background here, are concerns about them.",
        "The last words that I had was they had a very good rollover there in Japan...",
        "Wow.",
        "I mean, that's breaking news here on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And, you know, they kept saying that he had certainly problems.",
        "There were investigations going on.",
        "And everybody was wondering whether he would show up, return to Congress in the next session.",
        "And, obviously, that's - there's your answer right there.",
        "So a special election will have to come very soon.",
        "And this is a solid Democratic district in Chicago.",

        "So this was definitely a blow to his supporters who - they've really looked the other way in recent years as Ortega's gone on to consolidate power and put limits on democratic freedoms.",
        "And so it's obvious that this clearly was just the spark that blew up the underlying resentments that have been in the country toward him and to his wife, who's a very controversial figure there, too.",

        "So the spark - who are these protesters?",

        "The most vocal and - have been the students at a main university.",

        "Well, Ortega went on national TV.",
        "He went on yesterday.",
        "That was the first time he's addressed these protests.",
        "And he said he was ready to negotiate over the pensions.",
        "But, you know, that appearance, in all ways, just seemed to have really made the situation worse.",
        "He said he would only negotiate with the business community, not the students, not the pensioners.",
        "And then he went on to accuse the protesters of being politically manipulated by some unspecified groups.",
        "And, you know, that just really seemed to make matters worse.",
        "And more people came out on the streets.",
        "His response is widely considered to be heavy-handed, with calls for restraint coming from, you know, the business community - which is very powerful in Nicaragua - to the Catholic Church to the U.N.",
        "to the Organization of American States.",
        "So he's really going to have to deal with this situation because of the calls for restraint coming at him from all ends."
