        "Clinton was just in Lisutu(ph), and as you know I was there recently too.",
        "A country of two million people with 300,000 AIDS victims, and I happen to think that the number is probably greater.",
        "And when I was there, it's mountainous, and people don't have money.",
        "They're poor; they don't have transportation.",
        "So one of the things that Clinton people are doing is trying to figure out how to set up clinics and provide assistance to people in what young women said when I was there, mountains beyond mountains.",
        "So that's one of the things that they're doing.",
        "And then they're doing things to fight stigma.",
        "In South Africa, for example, there are people who sneak into the hospitals in the wee hours of the morning because they suspect they're HIV-positive.",
        "And then I've heard stories - I mean not stories, these are true situations - where pregnant women who are about to deliver, when they're asked by the nurse if they're HIV-positive, they say no because of the stigma, which condemns a child who could be saved from contracting the virus to contracting it.",
        "Because, you know, Neviropene is a (unintelligible) dose that you give the baby, the infant, when he or she is born in a liquid form - you just pour it down their throats - and that prevents them from contracting the virus from the mother even if she's HIV-positive.",
        "And so you can see how severe the cultural, social stigma of AIDS is when a mother would not tell the truth to a nurse in a hospital to save her baby.",
        "It is enormous.",
        "And you know you have people like Nelson Mandela who is the icon to just about everybody in the world, and his son passed away from HIV/AIDS complications.",
        "And he came out and said, look, this is like any other disease.",
        "This is like tuberculosis, it's like cancer.",
        "You shouldn't be ashamed.",
        "And the icon who, you know, could not convince people to come out and know their status.",
        "Lisutu has a campaign and the government there has been given high praise for its AIDS efforts.",
        "And their campaign is a know-your-status campaign.",
        "But even so, with a committed leadership that everybody says is necessary in this fight, with people out there every day talking about know your status, people are not coming forward.",
        "It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.",
        "Good morning.",
        "I'm Steve Inskeep.",
        "In Winston, Salem, Steve Feldman, Dr. Steve Feldman, came down on the other side.",
        "Having patients sign a document saying they are not to do online ratings is an extreme solution to the problem of misrepresentative online doctor ratings.",
        "Doctors should be encouraging their patients to get online and do ratings so the public can see what a great job doctors are actually doing.",
        "We also asked you to tell us the one thing you would never sell even in tough times - engagement rings, guitars, and as Dan Dotti(ph) emailed from Georgia, his great-grandfather's desk.",
        "He was a reporter for the Richmond Times Dispatch and covered the state legislature.",
        "He bought a legislator's desk when the state capitol was remodeled at the beginning of the last century.",
        "It ties me to him, history and the newspaper industry, which, he added, laid me off last year.",
        "But necessity can force some painful decisions.",
        "Mary Alice Mistacy(ph) emailed from Arizona: In 1989, when my husband lost his job, we sold everything - our SUV, my husband's electric guitar, my skinny clothes, and our wedding gifts.",
        "I would joke that the only thing that wasn't for sale was our seven-year-old son.",
        "Everything else was negotiable."

        "I spoke about that with our personal finance contributor Michelle Singletary.",
        "She first explained how much homeowner's insurance costs.",
        "The average cost varies really according to how much house you have, where you live - but say around about 4 or $500 a year for some homeowners.",
        "You know, 1,000 or more if you have a very expensive property.",
        "And in the case of a home, you are required to have homeowner's insurance by your lender.",
        "Can you shop around for different policies?",
        "Or do you have to buy from a specific insurance company?",
        "Absolutely you should shop around.",

        "So they're, you know, fighting for your business.",
        "You absolutely should call several companies, get a quote for your property because that could save you a couple hundred dollars on your policy.",
        "And the other thing is you want to look at the deductible.",
        "The higher the deductible, the less you're going to pay for the homeowners insurance.",
        "So, if you can do it, you know $1,000 deductible will bring your policy down quite a bit.",
        "But that also means that if you have a claim, you've got to put out that first thousand dollars.",
        "If that's too high for you, try for $500.",
        "And Michelle, do condo owners need homeowner's insurance?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "As a condo owner you are a homeowner, so you need insurance.",
        "I think lots of condo owners or people who rent think that their landlord or the condo association covers them.",
        "But that covers the outside building, the common areas.",
        "Anything inside your condo is not covered by the association or the landlord, and so you do need homeowner's insurance just like someone who has a single family home.",
        "Now as we found out after Hurricane Katrina, it may not cover such things as natural disasters."

        "If you say have furs or you have very expensive rings or things like that in your home, you want to be sure that that gets included in your policy and the insurance company knows about it.",
        "Take pictures of them, you want to try to put the receipts or evidence of these in a - perhaps a fireproof box or something to that extent so that if you do have to file a claim, you've got proof that you had these expensive items in your home.",
