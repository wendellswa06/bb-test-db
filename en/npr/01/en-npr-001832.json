        "I appreciate the opportunity.",
        "I'm joined now by William Rodgers, professor of public policy at Rutgers University.",
        "All right, Professor Rodgers, you heard the piece that we just aired and heard from Paul Kelly.",
        "Is there some middle ground, in your opinion, that can be found?",
        "I hope so, and this is a, it's an issue that I agree with your previous guest that, you know, the government, really, at the end, shouldn't be involved, that this is a, should be a relationship between the Wal-Mart workers and the communities in which the stores are located and management.",
        "However, it was grown to the, the problem has escalated to the situation where these people in these communities don't have a collective voice to be able to push back and to express their concerns.",
        "In your opinion, how do you find that happy medium?",
        "The idea that no one, I think, wants government intervention, necessarily, but some will suggest that corporate America, big business has really, as I suggested earlier, put profit before the human being, and there is a concern that who will watchdog that?",
        "Yeah, I think instead of also focusing on what you call the bad actors(ph).",
        "I mean there are some good actors out there.",
        "One example that gets trumpeted a great deal is Costco.",
        "They run an excellent model where they have input from collective bargaining process, but they also have a unique corporate philosophy where they have a long-run model.",
        "It's based upon treating workers as assets to be invested in, and one of their statements is that they feel there's a, if you loyal and well-compensated workforce, that means that you'll, people will be efficient, but they'll also be productive, and their strategy does seem to be working, where they're offering wages and benefits that are above the, sort of, industry average, and you're seeing less shrinkage, which is the industry phrase for less stealing, much lower than what Cos...--much lower than what the industry, and it's also much lower than what Wal-Mart reports.",
        "Well, prognosticate for me, if you will.",
        "If you had to juxtapose the Costco model to the Wal-Mart model and project that across America, which do you think we're headed?",
        "Which way do you think we're headed?",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "I think we're headed towards the Costco model for the very reason in that this is an issue, healthcare is an issue that is near and dear to the hearts of most Americans.",
        "And then also, you've also brought in the issue around children, that children of these parents and family members who don't have healthcare.",
        "And again, there's been ample studies to show how, you know, investing in people's healthcare not only improves their productivity, but their well-being.",
        "And if we just take a longer-term view, which I think--these views are galvanizing around that, we'll move in the direction of the more Costco model, which is the one that's more sustainable in the long run.",
        "All right.",
        "William Rodgers is a professor of public policy at Rudgers University.",

        "And we begin today with the story of an elderly woman, who lived alone in South Florida, a woman who depended on her car to get around, a woman whose memory was failing.",
        "Her niece, Marilyn Geewax, made the difficult decision that she could not, in good conscience, allow her aunt to continue to drive.",

        "Thanks very much for coming in.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "So what convinced you that you had to do something?",
        "Well, you know, the moment you think about highway safety, you look at statistics and think about the numbers, but when you get down to the reality of it, these are human beings, they're people that you love, teenagers who drive, elderly people who drive.",
        "And you have a responsibility, I think, to try to make the roads as safe as possible.",
        "And I could see that my aunt was deteriorating, her memory was getting worse, and I didn't want her to be one of those statistics.",
        "So, I actually had to go to court and get a legal guardianship and now there is a court-appointed guardian, who was able to help her with her transportation needs, but it was tough.",
        "I bet.",
        "I'm sure it involved a lot of time and a lot of money, but I'm also sure - did your aunt understand why?",
        "No.",
        "It was very frustrating for her and that's part of the problem with elderly drivers is people's - their judgment becomes impaired and they don't realize what a danger they have become to others.",
        "And it's very difficult because these are - you know, whether you're talking about your teenage kids or your parents or whatever, all of these are human relationships and they take a lot in negotiating to try to figure out how to make the roads safer and how to take responsibility for that.",
        "It is not easy.",
        "Was there one moment in the car when you looked at your aunt and said, oh, my gosh?",
        "Well, she was driving home from church one time and she ended up hours from her house.",
        "She just couldn't figure out how to get home from church anymore and that was the - you know, the danger point that you finally cross.",
        "But there's a - this problem is very common and getting more so because baby boomers are starting to age.",
        "And we see from the statistics that people, as soon as they hit 70, driving skills drop dramatically.",
        "And right now, the leading edge of the baby boomers are in their 60s, but we know that it's coming, that we're going to have more and more millions and millions of people on the road in their 70s and 80s.",
        "And we need to start to have more conversations about, how do we make the roads safer when we've got this giant demographic shift coming?",
        "We actually arranged to have Marilyn Geewax on this program before she told us that story.",
        "She is a senior business editor here at NPR and she is supervising a series that's running on all of the NPR News programs this week called �On The Road To Safety.� It's based on a single, sobering statistic.",
        "On average, a hundred people a day die in traffic accidents.",
        "That's actually a substantial improvement.",
        "And the fact is, we know how to save even more lives but there are sacrifices involved, some bigger than others.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, hopefully, people are taking advantage of that.",

        "So I'm guessing you end up with a lot of leftovers.",
        "You end up with a lot of leftovers, and that is where you get monteria.",
        "Basically, the next day on the 25, everyone gathers for lunch and you use these leftovers in this specific dish.",
        "And everyone sort of sits and gathers again together.",
        "And for Cuban Americans, you know, this is a dish that comes from the island, obviously.",
        "And many people fled after Castro's regime came to power.",
        "And so, you know, the recipes that Cubans use have sort of been frozen in time in many ways.",
        "And so they've become very important - a way of binding Cuban identity at a time when, obviously, they no longer have that direct connection to Cuba under the Castros."

        "So you take your Cuban pork from the night before and you make a sofrito.",
        "A sofrito is basically peppers and onions and garlic that you saute in olive oil with a little oregano and cumin.",
        "And then you fold in your leftover pork and some tomato sauce or tomatoes and some white wine or some cooking sherry, or whatever you have on hand, and a little bit of naranja agria, which is the best part of any Cuban meal.",
        "It's usually Seville oranges, but when you can't find them, you can sort of take half of orange juice and half of lime juice and mix it together and you get something very similar.",
        "And then you just let that cook for about 45 minutes until everything melts together.",
        "Now, every single place has its own variant.",
        "And some people put olives in, some people put raisins in it.",
        "But the core of the recipe is basically just that.",
        "And it is delicious.",
        "And how do you serve it?",
        "Are we to spoon this sort of stewy (ph) pork thing?",
        "Exactly, it's a stewy (ph) pork thing.",
        "And you basically put it in a bowl with a little chopped parsley.",
        "As I told my sister, foodies will use Italian parsley, but Cubans use good, old curly.",
        "And then you serve it with yuca, black beans and rice, of course, and the fried sweet plantains - can't have a Cuban meal without that.",
        "Have you made any changes in this dish from, say, your mama's recipe?",
        "You know, not really.",
