        "Well - so the basic framework remains the same.",

        "But there are big changes to Medicaid, and that's one of the sticking points.",
        "It really reduces spending on Medicaid over the long term that will essentially amount to less money for health care and fewer people getting coverage.",
        "And then finally, last night, the change that will be coming today in an actual legislative language is that they eliminated the list of benefits that under Obamacare are required to be covered if a policy is going to get federal help to buy it.",
        "So let's talk more about what those essential benefits are.",
        "So this is something that became federally mandated under the Affordable Care Act.",

        "People - it's hard for people to come out for a bill where people are going to lose insurance coverage.",
