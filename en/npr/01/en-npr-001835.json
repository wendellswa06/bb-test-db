        "But there are a very small amount of drivers, senior drivers, that simply are unsafe, and when I testified a couple years ago, I suggested to the House chairman of transportation, who indicated opposition, I said look, I hope it doesn't take a tragic event in one of our districts, and sure enough, there was a beautiful little four-year-old girl in my district, Diya Patel, crossing in the crosswalk with her grandfather holding her hand, and she was struck and killed by a senior drive that ought not to have been on the road.",
        "You know, one of the problems that we've explored, Neal, in this series is the need for government spending on transportation issues.",
