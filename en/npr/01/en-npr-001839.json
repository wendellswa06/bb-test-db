        "And one of the ways to immediately connect with them was to friend them on Facebook.",
        "But, of course, having Facebook also allowed her to see what everyone back home was up to while she was backpacking in Central America or moving from one city to the next.",

        "If you looked only from the porch, you could see mountains straight, but if you looked to the left, you could see this huge factory.",
        "But, of course, I didn't take pictures of the factory because why would you do that?",
        "And the factory wasn't the only thing Rachel says she was leaving out of the frame.",

        "Being engaged in excessive social comparison decreased one's happiness.",

        "Kahn thinks that seeing our friends having fun on social media taps into our social anxiety about belonging to the group.",
        "What we found out from a lot of the experiments that we ran, the thing that was generating the FOMO - it's like a social anxiety.",
        "And it's really more about what are your friends doing in building up their social group history that you're missing out on?",
        "Of course, Facebook didn't invent social anxiety.",
        "But when you see it on your phone, and you're just observing that your friends are doing something and you're not there, that's something you didn't get to see before."
