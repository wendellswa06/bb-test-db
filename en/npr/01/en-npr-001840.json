        "Lauren Frayer in Barcelona, thanks a lot.",

        "This week, Israel will be marking the 50th anniversary of the Six-Day War.",
        "The conflict is known by other names, but six days stands out because so much happened in such a short time to change so much.",
        "By the time the ceasefire was called, the relatively new nation of Israel had captured territory from Egypt, Jordan and Syria, defended its right to exist, proven itself as a military power and changed the balance of power in the Middle East.",
        "But that victory came at a cost.",
        "It started what has become a 50-year military occupation of the West Bank with no end in sight.",
        "It includes the flashpoint of East Jerusalem.",
        "Israel still controls entry and exit from Gaza.",
        "And it created what writer and editor Jane Eisner calls quote, \"\"a painful ambiguity,\"\" unquote.",
        "Now, a very great deal has been written and will be written about this anniversary, but we thought Jane Eisner's column stood out, so we asked her to tell us more of her thoughts.",
        "She's editor in chief of The Forward.",
        "It's a national Jewish news organization in the U.S., and we called her in New York.",
        "Jane Eisner, thanks so much for speaking with us.",
        "It's a pleasure.",
        "Now, in your column for The Forward about the anniversary, you started with your memories of listening to the radio as a little girl hearing about Israel's preemptive strike on Egypt's Air Force.",
        "You recall that sense of dread and of fear and after victory, the enormous pride.",
        "But then you write about the anniversary this way - you say (reading) I approach this half century mark with a confusing mixture of wonderment and dread, joy and despair, pride and embarrassment.",
        "Why the conflicted feelings?",
        "Even as a little girl, I still remember the sheer terror of thinking that little Israel surrounded by enemies was going to not exist anymore.",
        "And so to witness this very quick and stunning victory - it's hard to recognize this now, but Israel captured three times as much land as it had before this war - was just astonishing.",
        "And then, of course, the crowning jewel was Jerusalem and the reunification of the city, the ability of Jews to be able to go to the Western Wall, the most sacred spot in Judaism, from which they had been barred since 1948 was - really did feel like a miracle.",
        "Wow, that's fantastic.",

        "Well, ironically that depends on where you go, what school district you're in, what state your in.",
        "one of the long standing problems or issues in how math is taught is that what gets taught varies from school to school, district to district, and state to state.",
        "Part of what the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics has been trying to do or said they were trying to do this past fall was to streamline that curriculum and bring more focus to what gets taught at the pre-K through grade 8 levels, where basically there have been so many different approaches with not a whole lot of uniformity.",
        "Now, is the idea - is the feeling - first of all, let's talk about exactly what the problem is with the way math is taught now.",
        "The need for teaching fewer - why is it important to teach few - why are they saying now that it's important to teach fewer concepts rather than too many concepts?",
        "I think part of the idea is that we've had this long standing debate in math about what needs to get taught at what grade level.",
        "And that creates a lot of problems in the classroom for teachers, because a lot of teachers at the elementary and middle school level want more direction.",
        "They want to know well, what should I be teaching first, second, third graders at various times during the school year.",
        "How can I avoid duplication of topics?",
        "When is it necessary to review?",
        "When is it necessary to forge ahead?",
        "There hasn't been a whole lot of consistency so far.",
        "So I think that one of the main points the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics is making through this document you've been talking about is let's get at a few core key concepts in math and narrow it down and give teachers more direction, more structure, a more focused set of principles.",
        "Also let's talk about how kids are being affected by the way it's being taught right now.",
        "Because I think a lot of parents probably have noticed this, which is it seems like sometimes they move very quickly from one subject to the other and if you don't have a math whiz at home, you know, they may not really have grasped one skill while they're being asked to move on to the next one.",
        "That's true.",
        "And when you think about it that's not a very efficient way of teaching the subject.",
        "Because what that means is if you've got a first grader who goes on to the next grade and they've sort of raced through a series of topics they may end up having to spend a good portion of their second grade year going back and reviewing.",
        "That's long been identified as a major problem in math.",
        "I think that one of the challenges that the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics talked about and really math experts all around the country is how to teach it well the first time and make sure students learn at the first time so that you don't end up with this sort of cyclical process of having to go back and review things that you should have gotten down pat the first time.",
        "And as I understand it also, there's a lot of concern about how American kids do in comparison to students in other countries that our students are falling behind such countries as Japan and Singapore - many other countries around the world that we don't do as well."

        "Oh, definitely.",
        "I mean, if you look at the results of the (unintelligible) of test, the two basically big international tests, American students are generally falling in the middle of the pack in math.",
        "And they're, didn't you know they're not doing well and whole series of skills from, depending on how you look at it from things like what should be basic skills in math to their ability to do more problem-solving and think about solving math problems in different context.",
        "So, the countries that are consistently doing well, you know seem to have a more streamlined approach to teaching math.",
        "In some cases these countries have a national curriculum in which - but not always - but in some cases those countries have a uniform set of principles that all students learn essentially at the same time.",
        "But in the United States we don't do them.",
        "We're a nation of state and local control.",
        "So, what you learn when, can largely depend on what district you're in.",

        "Well, of course our goal is that a couple of things happen.",
        "One is - and I was listening to Sean Cavanaugh's words and he certainly got it right in terms of the intent and some of the issues we face.",
        "There are 49 of our 50 states out there that have curriculum documents, curriculum frameworks of one type or another and they range from the number of objectives that the teacher would have to deal with from somewhere in the high 20s to probably over a hundred, depending upon how you count.",
        "So they have the one, two, threes that they're taught by their parents and grandparents like ABCs.",
        "But if you get to the plus which means addition and subtraction, and all these, and suddenly, they don't know what to do with it because it's a foreign language and they thought that they understood the one, two, threes and the counting.",

        "I have kind of a generalist background and I've studied some mathematics but it sure wasn't my major.",
        "I'm responsible for pretty much all the subjects.",
        "I'm now stereotyping now, but this is pretty much occasion this country.",
        "And I'm faced with a hundred objectives by implication.",
        "They are equally weighted, equally important and frankly we have, we know that has never been the case.",
        "And so what we're trying to do is if you will provide some focus, i.e. Focal Points, provide some coherence across these 49 documents so that when children walk into a fourth grade classroom while there may be still scores of objectives.",
        "We can certainly have some essentials taught deeply and well at particular grade levels.",
        "Well, then, define from what you mean by Focal Points.",
        "You're saying then a fourth grader needs to know what?",
        "Well, okay, for example, at the fourth grade level we call for children being able to recall their basic multiplication facts and have developed some fluency with multiplication and how it works.",
        "What is multiplication?",
        "How we do multiplication?",

        "And the teachers are not being permitted, I think, to really go in to the subjects that are most important in that depth so that they can fully understand.",
        "I think that there are instead being taught in California to teach for the STAR test which is you know, the state assessment test by which the schools get paid.",
        "And they are being forced to go through an enormous amount of curriculum as you said in such a degree of shallowness that nobody is really getting it."
