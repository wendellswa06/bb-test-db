        "So Juliet, you'd like to see some changes for your child - would be good?",
        "I think there needs to be change on every level.",
        "I think math is the one that I'm most intimate with because it's something that I felt like I had trouble with in school, and now I'm having to learn again with my daughter.",
        "Right.",
        "But, I think that on every level, they're being bombarded with busy work in terms of homework and class work, and not really getting the concepts of how to think and how to learn.",
        "All right.",
        "Francis Fennel, before you respond to that I just want to remind our audience that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I'd like to respond in a couple of different ways.",
        "First of all, let me congratulate Juliet for being a great parent.",
        "Admittedly, she says, it wasn't necessarily her best subject but she's gotten over that and she realizes the importance of the subject and she's finding the time to work with her daughter.",
        "We need more and more parents who are concerned enough about this subject to realize how important it is - that's part A.",
        "Part B isn't as positive from my perspective.",
        "I think we push a lot of kids, typically the middle grade levels into Algebra 1 and we have more and more students doing that right now, somewhere around 32 percent in this country than at any other time.",
        "And one of the things we have to be very careful about is that they have the essential prerequisites.",
        "They understand the mathematics we talked about a few minutes ago deeply enough, well enough so that there's a level of success that can be met with that first formal course, if you will in higher-level mathematics.",
        "And so, clearly the first step is in the direction of the teacher.",
        "It sounds like that step has been taken and seems to me there needs to be steps beyond that one.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, thanks so much for your call, Juliet."

        "Hi.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "It is my under - contention and true - having gifted children and having them go through an excellent program, and the honors program in Paradise Valley schools.",
        "But math is a language and one of the problems is that they don't have the verbs of the language until they get to a formal setting.",
        "Back now with DAY TO DAY.",
        "I'm Madeleine Brand.",
        "And I would really like to see a totally different understanding of math as language and we start teaching these things to them much younger so they know when they get to school, that this is going, you know - more is going to happen with this.",
        "And it is a language.",
        "It's a universal language and it's what creates the whole civilization, as we know it.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, thanks for your - for that comment.",
        "Francis Fennel, what's your thoughts on that?",
        "I love it.",
        "I think it's great she's absolutely right this subject is in fact a language by itself.",
        "I would also like to say that one of the things we were very careful about in writing our Focal Points, and of these are not just single statements.",
        "These are deep structures about the mathematics that's important for children at these levels, is the kinds of elements of language that Dawn discussed.",
        "In other words, properties like the commutative property, the distributive property.",
        "How equations work and why they work as early as the primary grade.",
        "And the symbols that go along with this subject, as is the unique vocabulary - a couple of words I just mentioned.",
        "I couldn't agree more that it has to integrated and interval to the mathematics - teachers teach and children learn."

        "One thing I wanted to ask you, the woman who called earlier, I think it was Juliet was saying that she sits down and helps her children.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, I have to be honest.",
        "I'm one of those people that has a lot of math fear and you know -",
        "You know, you know -",

        "You're on your own here.",
        "And by that I meant that it'd been a while since I'd done calculus.",
        "Certainly, I could sit down with him and do it, but I didn't have the time with that particular time and is also I felt it was his responsibility.",
        "But for any parent, I think the goal is to value the subjects, recognize the importance as Juliet mentioned earlier of this subject and support your child.",
        "Maybe that's just providing encouragement.",
        "Maybe it's making sure through the teacher that the right homework is coming home at the right level of assistances and so forth.",
        "And it's not so much that geez, mom can't do this, or mom said she had trouble in math or whatever.",
        "That's frankly history, but the point is, we now have a next generation and we sure do need more mathematicians, more scientists, more engineers, -"
