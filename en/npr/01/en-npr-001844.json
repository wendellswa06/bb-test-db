        "And I understand it.",
        "Sometimes they've been killed in those situations.",
        "But still, you're asking an 18 year old to have an inordinate amount of power over someone else's life, and that harms you as a person.",

        "But I also know that there's this other thing that it is forced to do, and to some degree, chooses to do.",

        "So as this week unfolds, and as people hear more about this story, who, perhaps, do not engage with it as regularly as you do, what would you like them to be thinking about?",
        "Well, I think we have to learn how to acknowledge the fact that there are two different people that have an historical, religious and emotional attachment to the same place.",
        "So I think it's really up to us, as individuals, to learn more about the other people and feel compassion to them and try to figure out ways in which we can alleviate suffering, even if those are hard to accept.",

        "If you're going to get rid of him, get rid of him after he takes all the heat for this.",
