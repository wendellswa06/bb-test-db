        "Well, actually, tantalizing, I think, is a better word, because we, in sleep medicine, for years - and this has been getting a lot more press in the last several years - we've recognized that people with chronic sleep deprivation have significant changes in their metabolism and the way their bodies behave and have a far greater problem with managing appropriate weight or losing weight, and in most cases, tend to be overweight if they are chronically sleep-deprived.",
        "So what was interesting about this is it shows - even in people who are slightly overweight - that in a very short timeframe, you already start to see changes in the way the body operates and metabolizes calories and things.",
        "So, very interesting.",
        "And the fact that you're losing the weight from your muscles is alarming, I would think.",
        "That's as you so aptly put, that's really not what you're going for.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And why should sleep change the way you lose weight - instead of from the fat, to put it - take it from the muscle?",
        "Well, the thing that we've noticed - I mean, of course, there's a kind of a very basic assumption, which is that people who don't get enough sleep and are therefore sleep-deprived tend to have decreased energy, which leads to decreased activity, which leads to an overall decrease in the calories that they burn.",
        "But on a deeper level, we also know that it decreases general body metabolism, and it causes insulin resistance to occur, which then leads to greater depositions of adipose, higher blood sugars, weight gain and so forth.",
        "But they - probably the most critical finding in this study showed that even with two weeks' sleep deprivation, that you start to already see changes in two of the most fundamental hormones regulating appetite and satiation, or feeling full and therefore decreasing appetite.",
        "And those hormones are called ghrelin and leptin.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And one makes you gain - makes you want to eat, and one makes you feel full.",
        "And right now, the statistics suggest that up to 75 percent of the people - in the U.S., anyway - with sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea - where their airway closes down during the night and they have interrupted sleep from fighting for air or stopping breathing - that nearly 75 percent of people who have that condition remain undiagnosed."
