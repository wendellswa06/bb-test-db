        "It was definitely something new.",
        "My initial impressions of drones was basically a mix of skepticism and sarcasm.",
        "In my mind, it was the geek squad, a bunch of gamers sitting around a console, chatting it up and not really being the consummate aviation professionals that, you know, I am or was used to working with.",

        "And that startup was a commercial drone company.",
        "All right, motor start.",

        "The transition from flying helicopters to drones was definitely different.",
        "You don't have any seat-of-the-pants feeling.",

        "And this practice has come into question in part because in the wake of the Me Too movement, both female and male models have raised complaints about sexual harassment, especially by certain top photographers.",
        "So this year, an advocacy group for models and the Council of Fashion Designers have agreed that models will finally have private changing areas.",

        "The backstage environment at Fashion Week is pretty frenetic.",
        "I started working when I was 14 years old every season.",
        "Sometimes the backstage photographers are a little pushy and are trying to get their shot and are not mindful of the fact that, you know, we're standing there basically naked in nothing more than a G-string trying to change.",
        "And then, you know, there are all kinds of people back there, especially when the show ends.",
        "The attendees tend to pour backstage to congratulate the designer, and we're left, you know, trying to put on our clothes.",
        "Has anybody ever asked for privacy before?",
        "Has this issue surfaced?"
