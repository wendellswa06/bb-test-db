        "All these examples you've given, Michael Isikoff, may make him look bad in cases.",

        "And he's clearly trying to translate that into the world of politics and government.",
        "Have you heard back from him when you have reported on his business career?",
        "Actually, the interview I did with him back in 2011, which was quite contentious - and he didn't appreciate it at the time.",
        "In fact, he said - after the interview, he went on CNBC and called me the worst reporter in America.",
        "I actually ran into him during the New Hampshire primary.",
        "I ran into him this year up in New Hampshire at a restaurant, and we talked about it.",
        "And he said, well, you really were right about that, which I thought was quite unexpected to hear from him.",
        "Right about which part of the interview?",
        "Well, he didn't parse it for me, and I left it at that."
