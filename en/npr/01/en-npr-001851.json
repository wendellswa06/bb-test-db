        "Okay.",

        "Do you find that effect on that type of professional?",
        "Well, there's no question.",
        "That's one of the reasons why, in the last year or so, there have been very specific criteria laid down in terms of how many consecutive hours an intern or resident is allowed to work because, as you said, in the old days, it was kind of a rite of passage to be able to say that you were up for 48 or 72 hours, and you would wear that badge proudly.",
        "But the problem is that that would almost uniformly lead to someone - by virtue of being that sleep deprived - that could be judgment impaired, and not so good.",

        "I know more people are up later at night, tweeting and podcasting and things like that.",
        "Could we be seeing something having to do with sleep deprivation affecting the diabetes epidemic?",
        "I think that that is a piece of the puzzle, because what we are seeing all tend to walk hand in hand is that we are, as a population, heavier, which then makes a person also tend to be more prone toward type 2 diabetes, as well as being more prone toward certain sleep disorders like sleep apnea."

        "And that encompasses when you eat, the types of food you eat, what shift you work, when you exercise, how much time you allot to wind down, and also very important, what type of sleep environment you have, because, you know, it needs to be sufficiently dark, sufficiently quiet, the bed comfortable.",
