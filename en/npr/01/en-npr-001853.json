        "First of all, this is not a narrative of who's against the cops.",
        "The cry - the legitimate discontent around both racialized police brutality or just police brutality in general because, as you see, black Americans do not care if it's a black person that shoots another black person if they believe that shooting was unjustified in the shooting of someone unarmed.",
