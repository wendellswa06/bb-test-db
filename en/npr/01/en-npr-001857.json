        "And thank you.",
        "Earlier this month, a front-page bombshell in The New York Times reported that Richard Blumenthal claimed that he served in the war in Vietnam when, in fact, he obtained five military deferments and then joined the Marine Corps Reserve, which allowed him to spend all his time in uniform stateside.",
        "Blumenthal is currently attorney general in Connecticut, and before that news, considered the odds-on favorite to win a seat in the United States Senate.",
        "In an op-ed in The Times, former South Dakota Senator Larry Pressler wrote that he was among many who opposed the war, but when drafted, reported for duty.",
        "I don't fault anyone for taking advantage of the law, he wrote.",
        "Where I do find fault is among those who say they were avoiding the draft because they were idealistically opposed to the war when, in fact, they mostly didn't want to make the sacrifice.",
        "If you were of military age during the war in Vietnam, how do you explain your decisions?",
        "Tell us your story: 800-989-8255.",

        "Former Senator Pressler joins us here in Studio 3A.",
        "And, sir, nice to have you with us today.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "And, Senator, younger listeners need to be reminded that there was a draft for most of that time that was supposed to make all of this fair, but you could get a deferment if you were a college student, if you were medically or psychologically unfit.",
        "Or if you joined the Reserves, there was an understanding you would not go overseas.",
        "You were safe.",
        "But if your draft board classified you 1-A, you were very likely headed for Vietnam.",
        "And, of course, that system was supposed to be fair, but ultimately, it was decided it wasn't.",
        "Well, that is correct.",
        "And my point is not to criticize anybody, but rather to point out that some of the divisions in our society today - be it the lack of ethics on Wall Street or in Washington - might have had their origins in some of the cracks that we had at that time.",
        "For example, most of those who did not serve went on to very high careers, because they had three or four years of - extra years in their career.",
        "And they are now the editors of papers or members of Congress or members of the Cabinet, and so forth.",
        "And this has had two policy results, I think.",
        "The first one is that in the meetings that I've attended in the Pentagon when I was in the Senate on the Foreign Relations Committee, frequently, the most - the people who wanted to go to war the most were those who did not serve when they had a chance.",
        "And that's sort of a phenomena.",
        "Overcompensation, you think?"

        "I think maybe so.",
        "Then the second result - policy result is maybe an over-praising of the military today, if that's possible.",
        "At the time I was in the military, it was very difficult to wear one's uniform on the streets of, let's say, San Francisco.",
        "Because at that time, the standard was that anybody who served was part of - was -lacked the conviction to serve.",
        "So the people who resisted - or who didn't serve wrapped themselves in idealism, but they knew that that really was a lie, in a sense, because I knew that during my time at Oxford and Harvard, many students expressed to me that they just didn't want to go because they didn't want to fight in the war.",
        "And - but more importantly, they didn't want to give up three or four years of their life.",
        "And but they - to the outside world, they proclaimed that they were idealistic, that they didn't - that they disagreed with the war.",
        "Now, I don't want to get into a big fight about that, but that has led us down...",
        "Oh, I think you're already in a big fight about it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Okay.",
        "That has led us down to - I call it the technicality generation.",
        "If it's technically correct, it is legal - I mean, it is moral.",
        "And that is why we have so many problems on Wall Street with -about derivatives and things like that.",
        "My generation, we have - we're divided in many camps as a result, in part, of the Vietnam - of the complicated Vietnam and unfair Vietnam draft.",
        "And I might say that 25 percent of all those killed in Vietnam in the year 1965 were poor African-Americans.",
        "And that's another group that's angry about this, and that's still going on today.",
        "Because they were overrepresented because - the - most of the college students that got deferments were not poor and African-American.",
        "I assume, sir, you're not questioning, in any sense, those who claim to be conscientious objectors or those who were willing to go to prison for their beliefs.",
        "No, no, no. I admire them.",
        "I admire Cassius Clay, Muhammad Ali.",
        "And I'm really not attacking the others.",
        "I'm just trying to say: Where do we go from here?",
        "I do think, in the future, we should have a universal service requirement that would be carried out with a lottery.",
        "We don't need everybody, but - not just for the military, but for other - so people would have a duty to serve their country.",
        "Eventually, the draft was resolved, that all of this system and these classifications were inherently unfair.",
        "And there was a draft lottery, and everybody was involved.",
        "And there were no deferments except for medical deferments.",
        "That's right.",
        "From 1969 on, it became much more fair.",
        "But from about 1963 to '69 is probably the most unfair draft since - maybe since Lincoln's Civil War draft, which was strongly protested in New York City."
