        "And I took my responsibility and I went to Vietnam, and I'm glad I did.",

        "But let's remember that the military and people who served in it were considered lesser idealistic than this group that did not.",
        "And this causes part of the division.",

        "They're only about $30,000 a year for 100 percent disability.",
        "That's very, very low.",
        "So we're not really meeting our commitment to veterans, but we're praising them.",

        "this is tricky because the U.S.",

        "They still routinely jail dissidents - bloggers - who challenge the state's authority, so that's an issue.",

        "and Vietnam are developing a close relationship, not just economically but in terms of foreign policy, too.",
