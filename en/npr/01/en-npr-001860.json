        "And also we are seeing a bit of a change in that there are more robberies in some very prominent places, especially where tourists go - along the National Mall, where there've been some very disturbing robberies and particularly a murder in Georgetown, a wealthy white neighborhood where a young white man was killed -and that has raised a whole bunch of race and class issues here in Washington, a majority black city where most of the homicides victim - most of the homicide victims and major crime victims are black.",

        "Well, the measures that the city has now agreed to take to fight this crime emergency are kind of the usual grab-bag of stuff, but also some new intrusions on civil liberties, such as using surveillance cameras, which are already quite prominent in Washington in the touristy and office parts of town, pushing those out into the residential neighborhoods where, I have to admit that people in those neighborhoods are clamoring for that.",
        "They think that the surveillance cameras will help them.",
        "But the record so far is that neither the cameras nor a midnight curfew for young people has done anything to stop the stem - to stem the tide of violence.",
        "So now that the proposal is to move the curfew up a couple of hours to 10:00 p.m., it's really not clear that that will do anything."
