        "We know what really does help is paying attention to why these kids are out there committing crime in the first place and also doing something about the size and the way in which you use your police force, and those are obviously much more expensive and time-consuming measures.",
        "You cited in your column a very interesting statistic about crime and juvenile unemployment.",
        "Yes.",
        "In fact, there's been a fascinating study that shows that youth unemployment and crime track each other in an almost remarkable way; if you graph it out, the two lines follow each other in lockstep.",
        "And so as we've seen a bump up in youth unemployment, we are seeing more in the way of some offenses around town.",
        "But, in general, the numbers are down, and yet this hysteria that comes about when you declare a crime emergency - I mean, my goodness, we had Fox TV sending Geraldo Rivera here to do a piece on D.C.",
        "under siege.",
        "It does tend to snowball when you start using terms like crime emergency.",
        "And another factor that you pointed to in your piece was the - an example of what you describe as political correctness when the police chief in charge of the district in Georgetown, where it was a British tourist who had his throat slashed - his - the woman he was with was also assaulted - and the chief of police in that area, the local commander, made some remarks that got him into a world of trouble.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "The local commander said in a meeting with neighborhood residents that residents should really be the eyes and ears of the police and should watch out for people who look suspicious, and then he went on to say that it's unusual to see blacks in Georgetown.",
        "Well, that raised quite a storm.",
        "First of all, it's not true.",
        "Most of the stores in Georgetown really wouldn't even be able to survive without their black clientele.",
        "But beyond that, it raised all sorts of hackles about racial profiling.",
        "And that commander, as it turned out, was a guy who's deeply committed to racial harmony in the city, lives in a black part of town, sends his kids to an almost all-black school, and so on, and so he has now been reinstated.",
        "But at every step of the way, we seem to be exacerbating these race and class divisions rather than trying to work to bring crime down in all neighborhoods and thereby perhaps move beyond some of those issues.",
        "And you suggest, in citing some resentment in neighborhoods where crime has never declined or at least where it continues to be a major problem, a couple of incidents in the white part of town and suddenly it's a major crisis."

        "And that sends just entirely the wrong message when in fact there are many neighborhoods in Washington, in poorer parts of town, where people go to bed every night listening to gunfire, wondering if their kids will make it through the night, where there are regularly horrific incidents in which bullets pierce windows of people who are sitting innocently inside their apartments.",
        "So there are parts of town where murder is something you'd live with on a daily basis.",
        "For this kind of hysteria to happen around one incident in a wealthy part of town is really quite disturbing.",
        "Marc Fisher, thanks very much.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is this significant?",
        "Well, part of the reason we're seeing an increase is because we saw seven years of decrease.",
        "And were it not for the great 1990s crime drop when homicide, for example, declined by 50 percent in this country, we would not be wringing our hands about a four to five percent increase nationally and an up-tick in many cities.",
        "So part of it is sort of the ups and downs of crime.",
        "It's - I call it crime gravity.",
        "What goes up tends to come down, and what goes down tends to come up.",
        "In fact, if you look at the cities that have the biggest jump-ups in a single year, most of the time they have a falling down in the crime rate the following year.",
        "In fact, I did an analysis where I looked over the past 25 years, and when a city experiences a 20 percent jump in murder, which tends to get people very excited...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...there's two to one odds that the murder rate will go down the following year.",
        "So we tend to get very excited in the short-term by very short-term trends, and one year change does not a trend make.",
        "We tend to be very myopic, look just at this year versus last year and get carried away like Chicken Little did about a sudden rise in homicide, or in violent crime, when indeed, as Marc Fisher pointed out, we're a lot better off than we were 10 years ago.",
        "As you look at these statistics, in some cases, we're talking about very small numbers, so an increase from eight to 12 looks dramatic if you put it in percentage terms.",
        "Yeah, but we're not really focusing on the cities that have such small population that eight to 12 will be noteworthy.",
        "We're also talking about cities like Philadelphia and Boston where the numbers are appreciably larger.",
        "I mean, my city, Boston, it's frequently pointed out that in 2005, we had our largest number of homicides in 10 years.",
        "Well, part of that is because we had a very good 10 years, and we're a victim of our own success.",
        "The 75 homicides that the city of Boston had last year pales in comparison to the 152 we had in 1990.",
        "And I don't want to say this is not worthy of concern.",
        "It is.",
        "There are certainly many issues going on right now, with budget cuts in programs for youth and lack of police resources, but it's not time - it's time to get concerned and get back to work at crime fighting, but it's not time to be alarmed."

        "But then, of course, in that old fable, Foxy Loxy -and I'm here being Professor Foxy Loxy today - recognized that it was just an aberration.",
        "And so, I guess, the short answer is here, yes, crime is up, and we need to do something about it because there's reasons why it could continue to rise.",

        "And both parents of the victims mentioned that there needs to be more jobs for these inner city - some of these inner city kids.",
        "And they thought that - the parents themselves thought that was one of the reasons, and I wanted to know what your statistics show about that.",
        "Well, in general, unemployment and crime rates do not track very well, because if you're really geared towards a life of crime and making a lot of money through criminal activity, you're hardly going to be dissuaded by a job flipping burgers.",
        "But what is true about kids and jobs is that it just keeps them busy.",
        "And it doesn't have to be a summer job, for example, or an after-to-school job, it can also be an after-school program or a sports program, just something to keep kids off the streets and engaged in quality activity.",

        "Well, I voted for the parts that were substantive: putting more police officers on the street and approving overtime.",
        "But, like a lot of legislatures, there was, you know, kind of a knee-jerk reaction because there was such an outcry to just do something, do anything, and we ended on an emergency basis kind of like adjusting our curfew policy in the city, approving surveillance cameras, things that are really unproven instead of doing what I think works in the city; short-term, putting more officers on the street, making sure they solve crimes and are more aggressive answering 911 and 311.",
        "And then, of course, we really abandoned long-term solutions like you've been talking about on the show: getting these young kids involved in, you know, programs in their community to dissuade them from getting into crime in the first place.",
        "We should mention Councilman Fenty is running for mayor in this political year.",

        "We can't just vote on things just to make people feel good.",
        "We have to do things that make people safe, and that - that's what I support, you know, putting more officers on the street, having a much more visible, aggressive police department, and then, again, long-term.",
        "There's just such a need, especially in the city, in the District of Columbia, to get these young people - I'm talking about kids under 30 who just have been involved in a life of crime - involved in either jobs or some type of rehabilitation."
