        "And as they got a little complacent, they think well, we don't need to try so hard anymore and they moved resources elsewhere.",
        "Well, crime came back with a, you know, with a vengeance.",
        "And we have a larger number of kids in our population now who are attracted to gangs.",
        "They see gangs as exciting, cool, status conferring.",
        "And so, when we let down our guard, the gangs made a comeback.",
        "Bob, I'm sorry?",
        "But that's gang violence as opposed to citizenry violence, isn't it?",
        "But there are others - those weren't the only cities to see an increase.",
        "I think yes, there are lots of people who believe that a concealed weapon law sends a message to offenders: watch out, you attack me, I'm going to get you first.",
        "But there's just not a lot of evidence that that's a significant deterrent.",
        "You know, we're talking about, in many of these cases, are offenders who really don't think about the future.",
        "They're - I mean, we're talking about kids who live for today and die for today, and things as seemingly trivial as a leather jacket or a pair of sneakers is a matter of life or death.",
        "If you don't really have much hope for the future, and if you don't really think about what things are going to be like for you at the age of 25 or 30 and you're just living for today - then you have kids who are carrying guns and really don't care about concealed weapons laws, even if they knew about them.",
        "A lot of them don't know the laws, anyway.",

        "I've advocated for filling the 250 police vacancies that we currently have.",
        "And I think, over the years, we have maintained a high level of vacancies primarily due to budget constraints.",
        "And I think we've dug ourselves into the hole.",
        "And, you know, I further advocate for a more broken windows-type of policing, of foot patrol, bicycle officers, problems solving, out in the neighborhoods, that I think can make an impact in order maintenance.",
        "And that's certainly what I'm looking to try and restore in the city of Milwaukee.",
        "And I know others as well, certainly.",

        "Yeah, very quickly.",
        "The difficulty with the fact that so many cities have seen these declining numbers of police officers is, once we wake up and decide that we're going to restore those resources, you can't do it overnight.",
        "Because you've got to recruit them, you've got to train them, and you've got to give them some experience.",
        "So, it's actually a several year lag time between the point when we wake up and say we need to expand police resources once again and the point that we really get to where we were 10 years ago.",
        "And as you suggested, Alderman Donovan, this isn't cheap.",
        "Oh, absolutely not.",
        "But, you know, many of my colleagues, other people in the community, will argue we can't afford it.",
        "Well, I would argue we can't afford not to do it.",
        "And the comment is absolutely right.",
        "An officer, to be an effective officer, takes at least five to eight years on the job.",
        "To really know what he or she is doing and be an effective police officer, that doesn't happen overnight, without a doubt.",

        "Either pay for the programs now or pray for the victims later.",

        "That, you know, that has changed.",

        "I see a change in people's patience, if you will, for no other reason.",
        "It's not uncommon to run into individuals and have situations where people - we had an incident not long ago where two ladies were arguing over a dress and one pulled out a gun and killed the other.",
        "You know, I mean, it's ridiculous things like that that maybe years back you didn't see.",
        "I wonder about that, James Alan Fox.",
        "We do hear anecdotal evidence of just what the alderman is talking about, where incidents that might have involved an argument turn into fistfights or what used to be a fistfight turns into a knife fight, and on up the scale."
