        "I think things in St. Louis are way up if I recall.",
        "But what's happened in many of the smaller cities, particularly in Middle America, is they have become fertile ground for a lot of the gangs who have been, sort of pushed out of the coasts - away from the coasts - by heavy anti-gang initiatives, looking for new places to land, new turf to rule and new businesses to run.",
        "And they've found in many of these small cities that have police departments that aren't really geared up to dealing with gangs or don't have the resources to deal with gangs, that they can move right in, take over businesses, make lots of money, and take over some turf.",
        "So, the caller's quite right that part of the problem in Middle America is the gangs have seen - gangs are as mobile as people are.",
        "You know, if things aren't going well for you in your neighborhood lots of people pick up and move to another community hoping for another start.",

        "Well, I was in a diverse area, and it seems like crime in a black community - you have the mother, father or an aunt saying he was a good boy, he was a good boy.",

        "Well let me tell you.",

        "So I think this deal about political correctness, I'm willing to sacrifice some political correctness for safety in the streets.",
        "Well, I really can't speak about the situation there, because I don't know too much about it, but let me just say something about the difference in white communities and black communities and rich and poor.",
        "One of the problems I see right now is there's been so much shift in resources away from hometown security to homeland security, because those people who are most effected by terrorism are wealthy and powerful.",
        "Those people most effected by ordinary street crime are poor and powerless."

        "Combined with that is we've had these tremendous cuts in federal and local spending for cops and for programs.",

        "So the question those cases has become, what caused most of the damage?",
        "Was it water or was it wind?",
        "And the reason that's become critical is because insurance companies cover wind damage but historically they do not cover flood damage.",

        "Well, there are situations where they come in conflict, but I do want to make it clear that even though we have this, this surging of the influence, of the religious right, that is not the only thing that is driving the trend in terms of dealing with religious diversity.",
        "We have very powerful demographics driving this, notably changing immigration patterns, and also the aging of the population.",
