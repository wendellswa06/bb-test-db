        "Exactly.",

        "I was incredibly lucky.",
        "I don't think I could have done this thing.",
        "And \"\"Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader?\"\" is essentially a two-part Batman story.",
        "I was asked if I'd like to write something that would be a two-part story that could be the last episode of Batman comics and then the last episode of Detective Comics, where Batman started all those years ago.",
        "And Detective - DC comics is called Detective Comics because it's DC, Detective Comics.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And in Detective Comics number 27 back in 1939, Batman made his first appearance.",
        "So it was very fitting that the last Batman story in Detective got to be, what, they've got to be in Detective.",
        "But it was the point when they told me that I could have Andy Kubert as my artist that I got really excited and go, okay, I could probably do this completely mad thing where I get to talk about every single aspect of Batman or all the ones I've ever cared about and even some of the ones that I didn't.",
        "And I can put them all in there and I can get - because Andy is somebody who could draw like Frank Miller, like Brian Bolland.",

        "(Soundbyte of laughter)",

        "It wasn't really.",
        "I was actually quite surprised when I learned that - I was going to call it \"\"Batman the End.\"\" And then I learned that DC had actually titled it \"\"Whatever Happened to the Caped Crusader\"\" to basically clarify for people that it was the same kind of thing as Alan Moore's wonderful last Superman story back in, I think it was about 1985, '86."

        "The - I think what Alan did, which was so brilliant and so beautiful, was essentially bid farewell to the Mort Weisinger era, the silver age Superman.",
        "He got everything that made that era what it was in history and you had something that was basically a love letter from Alan to the things he loved about Superman, most of which were going to finish at that point.",
        "What I got to do, rather than try and pick a specific era of Batman to say goodbye to, was to essentially try and celebrate the entire thing, to say that the glory of Batman is that, you know, yes, he's dead in the comics right now and everybody in comics gets to stay dead until they get up and get better again.",

        "He spelled it like Neal Conan.",
        "(Soundbit of laughter)",
        "Neal Adams who re-imaged, who gave us the longer, pointer ears, the more swirlingy cloak, he put Batman back at night back in the '70s and essentially made him cool again after the Adam West version of Batman had had un-cooled him ultimately.",
        "So I got to try and say - talk about how much I loved all of those things and of course have essentially the same format that Alan had, which is you get the last issue with that numbering of your comic.",
        "But I don't think that you could look at them as being the same kind of thing at all.",

        "I think what you get in that mainstream comics thing is you get out of it what the creator is willing to put into it.",
        "The joy of Batman, I think, is that he is A) incredibly old now.",
        "He's been around since our grandparents and our great grandparents' days.",
        "And that allows you to have an awful lot of history to play with.",
        "On the other hand, I think that the - and he became the archetype of all of the vengeful avengers of the night.",
        "But I do think the problem that you can get in with Batman in that kind of situation is you can look at it and go, well, every story has been told.",
        "They have all been done before, which was why I started.",
        "I think one of the things that attracted me to it was just the idea of, okay, tell the last Batman story.",
