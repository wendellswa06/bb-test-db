        "And the second week it came out, the publisher went into bankruptcy and I never got the royalties.",

        "And the reason why is just because that I feel that with Dick Grayson learning to become Batman after being Robin for the longest time, it was a good jumping on point for me to read Batman comics and so I could learn about Batman as Dick Grayson's learning about being Batman.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Because the only Batman I've known is this technologically, superiorly advanced Batman.",
