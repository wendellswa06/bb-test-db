        "and European consumers and businesses cutting back on their spending, even China gets hurt.",
        "Although it's still growing, China's not collapsing at all, it's notably slowing, and it's being affected by the rest of the world.",
        "And all of these things connect, so we're seeing all the major regions of the world slow down, and it's not clear where growth is going to come from in the coming quarters.",
        "Rogoff, the co-author of a book on the history of financial crises, points out that a slowdown like this is typical after a big financial crisis.",
        "In working so hard to get banks to lend again and consumers and businesses to spend again, governments drive themselves deep into debt.",
        "Cornell University economist Eswar Prasad points out that government debt has become a burden for all the big Western economies.",
        "And the high levels of government debt that exist in virtually every advanced economy are going to be a real drag on their growth.",
        "Instead of promoting economic activity, those governments have to focus on financing their debt.",
        "Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland, they're all having trouble getting banks to loan them what they need.",

        "It adds up to economic trouble for much of the developed world, and also to some realignments.",
        "The new economies, the emerging market countries, are in relatively better shape.",
        "Those that export to the advanced countries are affected by some of their export markets drying up, but Prasad points out that consumers in those countries - China, for example - are making up some of the difference.",
        "Plus, Prasad says, many of these new economies got their own budget deficits under control years ago, leaving them freer now to do more stimulus spending."

        "What do you mean being safe to be used?",
        "To make these cells, what the researchers did was used viruses to take specific genes and they inserted those genes into the skin cells which converted the cells into cells that are very much like an embryonic stem cell.",
        "However, number one, any time you use a virus, you run the risk ultimately of that virus creating problems in the cells, some of the problems that we saw with viral gene therapy.",
        "Number two, even if we use techniques that don't involve viruses, if you insert new genes into cells and they disrupt the normal pattern of DNA in the cell, you run the risk of converting that cell into something that would be a cancer cell.",

        "It hasn't yet given us a lot of therapies because from the moment you discover something to the point where you can have it practical therapy for human beings, takes quite a few years.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But in fact, the human genome project was really a revolution for us because the sequences that were used, for example, to convert the skin cells came from the human genome project.",

        "Well, now, the real Charlie Chan, who was he?",
        "I want to come in for a minute about the sort of hype question, and you talked about the human genome and maybe stuff not really materializing out of all of that hype and promise.",

        "We have over 1,500 - 1,400 genetic tests that are now available, most of those were developed because of the understanding of the human genome that we gained from the human genome project.",

        "So you think similarly in this case that you first - real information will come out of studying the cells themselves instead of the therapeutic results?",
        "You know, I'm a developmental biologist by training, and I think it's just completely remarkable that you can take four genes or actually maybe only two genes and put them in a fully differentiated skin cell and get them to behave like they're starting all anew.",
        "And so that's going to give us incredible insights into, you know, how cells know what they are and what they should become.",
