        "So, John, you want to take that.",
        "Yeah, those are the genes that exist that enable us to develop an organism in the first place.",
        "I remember the embryonic stem cell is derived from very early embryos and then those genes that are expressed at that point in time that gives them the properties to allow the cells to go create a whole animal.",
        "So those genes exist for the developing embryo, not for the adult cells.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So they're there just, you know - once they've done their job, they are dormant.",
        "So once they've done their job, they are largely turned off.",
        "And…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…the point of this was by turning those genes back on, you can make the cell look like it's a very early embryonic stem cell.",

        "There - one of those advantages being talked about with this new technique is that you can use cells from the same person so that whatever cells are produced is not rejected by that person.",
        "Would that also be true of embryonic stem cells?",
        "Well, the only way that that would have happened with the embryonic stem cell was to use what was the other major controversy in the field, something that was called therapeutic cloning or somatic cell nuclear transfer…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…where you took a nucleus, for example, from a person's skin cell and put it into an egg cell and then use that to derive new embryonic stem cell.",
        "This, of course, is very much more exciting because now we can think about taking, just taking the DNA directly, the skin cell, leave it with its nucleus in it and convert it to be embryonic stem cell.",
        "So you think that the money that would be going into that is now going - we'll be going into this new technique?",
        "Yes, I do.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And supposedly from what I read, the University of Wisconsin is not going to claim patent rights to this or demand royalties from people who use it.",
        "Well, first, I would like to point out that the really exciting paper in this field came out a year ago and it came out from Dr. Yamanaka's laboratory, where he proved in principle that you could convert these cells."

        "The excitement about the two papers that just came out now was that it was in human cells and his first paper was with the mouse cells., so it's not certainly clear to me that Wisconsin would be able to claim any kind of priority anyway.",
        "So that would just like ignite.",
        "Well, they also recently lost a patent dispute in court, which I'm sure they will appeal about the basic patent on embryonic stem cells.",
        "And they've created that this controversy because there are those people who have felt that those patents have helped to delay the field a bit.",
        "So I think there's been a lot of pressure for everyone to feel that this is a wide-open, exciting scientific discovery.",
        "Kathy Hudson, you would agree?",
        "Yes.",
        "You know, the important thing here - and John mentioned this -is both from somatic cell nuclear transfer, we have these very thorny ethical issues with both destroying embryos in order to get the stem cells, but also the issue of where did the oocytes come from and whether or not women would potentially be coerced in providing those oocytes.",
        "And that has consumed the attention of endless ethics committees around endless mahogany tables in Washington for the last several years and we can now basically do away with those discussions.",

        "We're talking this hour about stem cell research and policy with Kathy Hudson, director of the genetics and public policy center at the Johns Hopkins University - this office is located in Washington; Dr. John Kessler, the Davee professor of neurology and director of Northwestern University Stem Cell Institute at Northwestern University.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "I'm a little confused, and maybe my listeners are bit confused about it.",
        "Dr. Kessler, you're saying on one hand, we still have to do more research in the old-fashioned embryonic stem cell line, on the other hand, more - the money is not going there.",
        "Can you tweeze that out a little bit for me?",
        "Well, first, you asked me the question, specifically, about so-called therapeutic cloning, and I think there's less money likely to go that route because this, I think, is a substitute for that.",
        "But with respect to the embryonic stem cell itself, it will be the gold standard by which we judge these new cells.",
        "We are going to have to compare them.",
        "And it - and, of course, we still have to find out whether these new cells do have all the capabilities of the embryonic stem cell and whether we will ultimately be able to use them.",
        "I happen to believe they will.",
        "I happen to think that this will supplant deriving new embryonic stem cells from embryos, but of course that remains to be proven.",
        "And how…",
        "But there will be new - new ethical issues will arise.",
        "Well, that's what I want to talk about.",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Well, for example, there's reason to believe now that it may be possible to reprogram a skin cell so that it's identical to a fertilized egg.",
        "Well, then what do we have?",
        "And all those people who felt that a cell that had the capacity to generate a whole, you know, a whole animal by its splits equivalent to being a human being, have we, in fact, then created a human being simply by reprogramming a cell to be what a scientist would call totipotent, in other words, able to generate the whole animal.",
        "I don't know that that can be done, but these recent studies suggest, probably it can.",
        "Kathy Hudson, do you agree?",
        "I do.",
        "I think that these cells have enormous promise.",
        "I think we don't have to do a whole lot of more additional research in somatic cell nuclear transfer.",
        "But I think that there are very important issues, and this was mentioned early on with the viruses that are used in order to reprogram these cells, in at least the paper out of University of Wisconsin -specifically documented, I think, that there were over 20 different integration sites within the genome where these viruses sat down.",
        "Ultimately, the genes inside those viruses appeared to be silenced, so there, you know, the cell sort of knows its work is done and they can turn these genes off."
