        "There are new understandings of adult-onset diabetes and a number of genes have been identified that contribute weekly to the development of adult diabetes.",
        "And we need to understand sort of who are all the actors, the molecular actors, and then, you know, what are their roles in this play and what's going wrong in order to be able to target therapeutics and new preventative strategies.",

        "Yes, it's exactly - that's exactly what happens.",
        "Our genes are precisely what program our cells.",
        "And we have one program that run cells at the very early stages, as an embryo, and then different sets of genes, or the same genes used in different ways that then run the program in an adult cell.",
        "And what we've really - or what our colleagues have done - is turn on the set -back on the set of genes that normally would control the cell in an embryo, and made that cell more now like a cell in a developing organism.",
        "Is the idea to develop cell lines of - like ageless cell lines of tissue that, you know - or is it for every individual, we want to pull out a skin cell and design something for each different person?",
        "Well, the dream of this field, of course, would be for us to be able to have a designer stem cell line for every individual.",
        "If we use a stem cell line that's not derived from that individual, we will run into the same problems we've run into with organ transplantation.",
        "That is the body will reject it unless we give very powerful drugs which can be toxic to the individual.",
        "If the stem cell line is derived directly from cells that came from the very individual who's getting the transplant back, then there'll be no rejection.",
        "So that is the - if you'll pardon the choice of words - holy grail for the field.",
        "But of course, I think it's likely that that will not be the very first way we do things.",

        "But my question was I haven't heard about any primate research or other mammal research into stem cell.",
        "And it almost seems like they want to round up a bunch of people that are desperately ill and do Frankensteinian research on them, you know, and that kind of thing.",
        "And I just wonder what's going on here?",
        "I mean, nobody's proved the stuff will even work in, say, a chimpanzee, which share, what, 99 percent of our DNA?",
        "Let me get a quick…",
        "What's going on with that?",
        "Okay?",
