        "No, not at all - 100 percent, no.",
        "O'DOWD: That's because Cartel Coffee doesn't carry the clout of airport perennials like Starbucks.",
        "And renting 740 square feet of space here costs more than 10 times what Silberschlag pays for a much larger cafe in town.",
        "What is a harder pill to swallow is the fact that we have quite a bit of debt for this location.",
        "And previously, until this, we had been a debt-free company.",
