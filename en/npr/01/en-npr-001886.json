        "What's changed, of course, is six months have gone by.",
        "The context has changed rather radically and at this point, with confidence being such a key issue, the administration feels that it has to shift over to a little more happy talk, and try to talk people into spending their money and investing their money again.",
        "So it sounds a lot like the campaign, when president Obama was candidate Obama and running for office.",
        "There is a certain echo of that, as a matter of fact, and the organizational phase of things, there is a group that is actually going to be putting people on the street in the weekend to come, getting people out on the Internet, making telephone calls and talking up the Obama program, talking up the budget, and acting very much the way they did back last fall during the campaign.",

        "Did President Obama say anything about that today?",
        "He has not spoken directly to that yet today, although we have heard so much over the weekend and from some of his surrogates about how distressed they were, how outraged they were, how they tried to negotiate these bonuses and retention payments back down.",
        "Some of this appears to be contractual.",
        "There were certainly a lot of payments of large amounts made to European banks that had bought a lot of toxic assets and insured them with AIG.",
        "It's a huge insurance operation, global.",
        "And then a lot of this also was for the retention of more ordinary level people who were not getting huge bonuses, but just getting paid off for the products they had sold.",
        "So, this is a big image problem and it's fallen to the administration, even though they're just as angry at AIG as anyone else.",
