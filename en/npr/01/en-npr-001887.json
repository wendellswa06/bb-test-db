        "Now whether or not that should be driven from Washington, I have some concerns about that.",
        "I think having Secretary Napolitano on screens throughout the country provides a bit of a creepy feeling.",
        "That shouldn't be from Washington; it should be driven by local authorities, local figures that the community already knows, works with and is part of every day.",
        "So is it the message itself that's creepy, or just the fact that it's coming from Washington you have a problem with?",
        "You know, I think that people will turn to people that they actually know, and people that they see every day, to be part of the solution.",
        "Now the message itself, I think, is short on - long on noun, short on verbs.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I think we need some specificity around what it is we're trying to convey.",

        "What actions should they take?",

        "To be afraid is not the same as being provided the ammunition, the knowledge to fight fear.",
        "And also, isn't there the risk that if you hear these messages everywhere, and see them everywhere, that you just start to become desensitized to them?"

        "Precipitation is highly variable from place to place, so there were lots of dry areas, lots of wet areas.",
        "But when we average those out, it was also the wettest year on record.",
        "We're now towards the bottom of the hour.",
        "That is something that I think we need to constantly re-examine -not only the message itself, but what it is we're asking people to do, and how they respond to these sorts of messages.",
        "I mean, there is a threat; it is real.",
        "And we can't be lulled into a false sense of security and a false sense of complacency.",
        "But at the same time, we need to make sure that what we're conveying is the best information that - are in people's hands.",
        "And I would err on the side of sharing more information when you have it.",
        "Countries that have, arguably, some of the most robust communications efforts vis-a-vis terrorism and risks and the like, are the U.K.",

        "Now, in the U.S., I think communicating terrorism, communicating risks is at best, an art.",

        "And lastly, Frank, you had a hand, actually, in creating the Department of Homeland Security.",

        "Is it doing what you hoped it would do?",
        "I mean, is there anything you would have done differently?",
        "Well, I certainly don't want to take any personal credit for creating a department.",
        "That was the premise behind a Department of Homeland Security - was while we had a number of national security and security efforts, the whole was less than the sum of its parts.",
        "Today, are we greater than the sum of its parts?",
        "Not yet.",

        "He didnt abandon other parts of his agenda, though, and that pleased Jack Rossin, a Democratic marketing consultant from Massachusetts.",
        "I thought he took the argument to the Congress a little more forcefully than he has done in past.",

        "It's always difficult to run as an outsider when you're president of the United States.",
        "And Obama's goal last night was less to pretend that he wasnt president, and rather to remind voters what he'd set out to do and what they obstacles were to making that change happen.",
        "Schnur, who directs the Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, says he doesnt think Mr. Obama has shifted to the center of the political spectrum, the way Bill Clinton did after losing Democratic majorities in Congress.",

        "This is the first generation of business leaders in America that's largely never served in the military.",
        "As a result, Tarantino says, vets and prospective employers often don't see eye-to-eye.",
        "I was explaining to a gentleman during an interview that for a time I was a company commander, and I said, you know, I ran an organization of 400 employees with three multimillion-dollar budgets.",

        "And he says history shows that over the longer term vets actually have an employment advantage.",
        "I think that the evidence shows us that while veterans have a period of unemployment following separation, they rejoin the civilian labor market within a relatively short period of time and that in the long run, if you look at veterans compared to comparably educated people in the civilian labor market, that in fact they have lower unemployment.",
        "The jobless rate for vets of the first Gulf War is 5.9 percent.",
        "For earlier conflicts, it's 7.2 percent.",
        "In both cases, lower than the nine percent rate for the population overall.",
