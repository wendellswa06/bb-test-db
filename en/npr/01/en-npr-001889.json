        "What appears to be not legal was a modification that was made to the magazine that allowed it to fire rapidly and cause the carnage that it did.",
        "Another issue we, have, as well is that individuals can hold a gun license, but the individual weapons that they hold do not need to be registered.",
        "So, essentially, we have no knowledge of how many guns or the type of weapons that are in New Zealand at the moment.",
