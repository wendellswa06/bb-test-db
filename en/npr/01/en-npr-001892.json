        "You mentioned the five-minute exegesis in \"\"Star Trek.\"\" The - there were two kinds of science fiction novels when I was growing up, one in which the author went into page after page about how the faster the light drive was developed and how it worked.",
        "And the other in which the guy said, push the button and let's go faster than light.",

        "Oh, yeah.",

        "I think you - one of the notes that I gave for the \"\"Stargate Universe\"\" writers way back when was don't overcomplicate your explanation.",
        "And the reason for this is, is you want just enough to sound plausible, but you want to leave it open enough that you don't actually make some sort of basic mistake that then somebody at a science fiction convention like Comic-Con or Worldcon later on this summer is going to stand up and go, you know, in episode five, you did this and that was clearly wrong.",
        "So what I tend to do is give you enough information that you know the basics of it, but then leave it alone because then the people who are much smarter than I am about physics and science will, in their brains, fill up the gaps of me not explaining it to something that sounds rational to them, and then I'm off the hook.",
        "So that, I think, is a secret to a lot of science fiction, which is to explain right up to a point and then let your reader's imagination take care of the rest.",
        "The other purpose - plot device used for new ensigns who are assigned to ships is - so that can be explained things that older characters or the captain can say, well, we do it that way because blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, explication.",

        "Right.",
        "But that's, you know, and to be fair, you know, you have to do that because when you are creating a whole new universe, you do have to set the ground rules.",
        "And there has to be to someone who is there for that sort of explication.",
        "You can get away with it in different ways.",
        "For example, in \"\"Old Man's War,\"\" there was a scene where I needed to actually explain the new bodies that people got, these genetically engineered bodies.",
        "But I didn't want to have people sit there and talk about it because it would've been a horribly artificial thing.",
        "So what I ended up doing is having someone transfer to a new body like ask - he asks his doctor, well, what does this new body do?",
        "And the doctor says, well, I'll send you a pamphlet.",
        "And he actually gets the pamphlet and he opens it up, and it's in marketing speak.",
        "And, you know, it works perfectly well because it's in and of itself sort of a parody of marketing speak: Welcome to your new body.",
        "But at the same time, it does the job of explaining to the reader what they need to know about these new bodies, so they aren't lost.",
        "And that's one of the things that you learn to do as a writer, is to take these elements that you need to provide the reader so that they are not lost.",
        "But do it a way that it doesn't hang up the story, it doesn't hang up their enjoyment of the novel that you're getting across to them.",
        "And I wonder, now, after serving as a creative consultant for one television science fiction series and having written this takeoff of \"\"Star Trek\"\" - it begins there - believe me, it's goes to a lot of other places.",

        "Ironically, my next project as a writer is called \"\"The Human Division.\"\" We're going to be doing that in an episodic way just as writing.",
        "So one episode-length story's continuing on, and I think that would be a good practice.",
        "But the great thing about the television form or the episodic form is that you have the opportunity to tell a great story now but leave tendrils so that you can tell larger stories over a creative arc of three or four or five episodes or an entire season.",
        "And as a storyteller, that certainly is intriguing to me.",
        "The one thing that I can guarantee is that it would be mostly rationally based.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "I have to ask also, you write this book, the novel ends, and there are loose ends, three of them.",
        "Yes, yes.",

        "But the implications of the universe I created were still - there were a few loose ends.",
        "And so the way that I solved it was just as in the novel, the main characters of that are supposed to be minor characters in another story entirely.",
        "So do minor characters in my novel, each get a spotlight story, where it talks about them dealing with the ramifications of the universe that I built.",
        "And it also gave me an opportunity to do something else.",
        "The \"\"Redshirts\"\" novel proper is a comic novel.",
        "It's meant to make you laugh.",
        "It's - you can think about it if you like, but ultimately I want you to laugh.",
        "But the \"\"Three Codas\"\" allow me a little bit of space and a little bit of distance from the novel itself to explore some of the emotional reverberations of the story.",
        "And I was really happy to have that opportunity.",
        "Well, good luck with \"\"Redshirts.\"\" It's already made the best-seller list."
