        "Kelley's time in the Peddie School was followed by a stint as an executive with a glove company, a period in another boarding school, a few marriages and, finally, a return to Peddie.",

        "He talks about history, about when the Ivy League was the pinnacle of football, when the sport's best player could turn down a pro career for the classroom.",

        "A lot of kids, when they hear it and begin to process it, just sort of get kind of quiet and look at it.",
        "It's not like they're genuflecting or anything, but they definitely know that they're looking at something that is significant in the sport that they are new to.",
        "And every once in a while, some kid will reach over and kind of touch the case.",
        "That gets a snicker, but I think all the other kids who are snickering would have liked to have done it themselves, too.",
        "Clements, of course, will tell the students that they're not looking at Kelley's actual Heisman.",
        "The real Heisman is almost exactly 100 miles away.",
        "This is The Stadium sports bar - Garrison, New York - home to a vast and eclectic array of sports memorabilia, a gold glove, actual Hall of Fame plaques, Stanley Cups.",
        "But the first Heisman, according to The Stadium's owner, James Walsh, is the creme de la creme.",
        "It's Larry Kelley's Heisman trophy, then it's everything else.",
        "And to be honest with you, after meeting Larry Kelley himself just makes the trophy even more valuable to me.",
        "What was he like?",
        "So it's not critical, but I think what's happening now, which is interesting, is that there's not just Netanyahu but a part of the Israeli political constituency that doesn't really know whether it should trust this administration.",
        "That's more significant than whether the two leaders get along.",
        "If President Obama is going to get to the point where he wants to ask of Israeli to make certain compromises, take certain steps, it's going to be harder to do so at a time when part of the Israeli body politic thinks: Is he really looking out for our interest?"

        "Now, that sounds very ironic when you say this to an Arab audience, and they think: How could Israelis not believe that the United States is going to try to defend its interests after their interests after all these years.",
        "But, you know, Israeli is a country that feels often very isolated, very vulnerable; and when it feels, as it does now, as some Israelis do now, that this administration cares more about its image in the Muslim and Arab world than it does about its reputation in Israel, again it just very quickly turns people into thinking, well, maybe this president is not the one we want to do business with.",
        "I'm curious to know whether this sort of long-standing belief among some policymakers in Washington that you shouldn't criticize Israel too strongly, at least publicly, is that idea fading, or has that idea faded?",
        "I mean, I think things are different again because of the makeup of the governments in the United States and in Israel and also because we now have troops in the Middle East, and that is whether rightly or wrongly it has strengthened the impression among many in the United States that resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical to our interest, and therefore we need to take bolder action to get there.",
        "What leverage does President Obama have in pushing the Israelis and the Palestinians towards a final deal?",
        "You're hearing two very interesting things coming from the administration.",
        "On the one hand, President Obama, Secretary Clinton, others have said it's a vital national interest.",
        "On the other hand, they've said we can't force or impose a solution.",
        "It's hard to reconcile those two.",
        "If it's truly a vital national interest, maybe we should do everything within our power to resolve it.",
        "On the other hand, I think there's the political reality that there's constraints on what the U.S.",
        "could do.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is not about to impose punitive sanctions on Israel.",
        "That's not going to happen.",
        "So that's one limitation.",
        "But the other limitation is it's not even clear that you could convince entities like Israel and the Palestinians to do things that they believe are fundamentally hostile to their interests or fundamentally hostile to their perception of what their national cause is about.",
        "Based on your analysis as a former you were involved in negotiations that were brokered by President Clinton at Camp David in 2000, a talk that broke down.",
        "I mean, how what do you envision happening if the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians was resolved?",
        "I mean, would it have a ripple effect and happen quickly?",
        "Let me put it this way.",
        "First of all, I think it's a critical effort to make to try to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for a whole host of reasons.",
        "Now, is it vital to U.S.",
        "national interests?",
        "I think the two arguments against that proposition, one is almost a red herring.",
