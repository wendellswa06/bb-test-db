        "Well, the language is horribly stigmatizing.",
        "And, in fact, so offensive that it is hard to even discuss the substantive aspects of the law, and it's never been changed.",
        "Honberg also says it's not particularly helpful to officials who have to decide who should and shouldn't be allowed to buy a gun.",
        "It's very unhelpful.",
        "And the reason its unhelpful is because no one really understands what it means.",
        "In 2007, the shooter at Virginia Tech passed two separate background checks without a problem, even though two years earlier he had been found to be a danger to himself and others.",

        "Even now, six years after Virginia Tech.",
        "Criminal reporting is better but it's still not perfect.",
        "And Cook says even when all these records are accurate and up to date, the current system doesn't do a very good job predicting and preventing future gun crime.",
        "He recently completed a study of alleged murderers in the in Chicago.",
        "What we found was that only 40 percent of them had a felony conviction in the preceding 10 years.",
        "Most of these people could legally buy guns.",
        "Cook argues if background checks are going to be effective, they'll have to become more robust.",
        "He believes background checks should examine juvenile records, any violent crimes, even histories of alcohol abuse.",

        "Then he eventually branched into Afghanistan and other parts of the world.",

        "Yes, because he was dealing with a known terrorist organization with the stated intent to kill Americans.",

        "So I think there's clearly some complicity of the Russian government in his activities.",
