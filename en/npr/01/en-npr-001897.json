        "That's correct.",

        "We're also looking for plants which are more disease and pest resistant and plants which are really easy care.",
        "So some of the really exciting things that we're working on for 2009, one is a brand new Agapanthus from Australia, and we've been working on this plant for, oh, three to four years.",
