        "This is the actual sound of one Hermes scarf - a single one - being hand cut and hand sewed around the edges.",
        "It takes a few hours just to get this right, and it's perfect - tight and flawless and classic in every way.",
        "It's a scarf that could allow Jackie Kennedy or Grace Kelly to go out and maybe snatch a few extra seconds of anonymity and still look fabulous.",
        "Anyway, when Jason Sheeler was at the Hermes factory, he discovered something else unusual about Hermes scarves.",
        "So I got there.",
        "And the first day I was in the scarf making factory, this imperious French woman threw out this really great big scarf with a turkey on it, and it had Texas on it.",
        "And she said, you are from Texas, no?",
        "She said, do you know Kermit?",
        "And I was like, who?",
        "Or what?",
        "What's Kermit?",
        "Then she told me that there was a man in Texas who designs scarves for Hermes and he's the only American ever to do it.",
        "So I immediately was fascinated.",
        "I was - it was like of all people, there's a guy in Texas.",
        "And then she said, and as a matter of fact, he's a postman.",
        "A postman in Waco, Texas.",
        "And his name is Kermit Oliver.",
        "Now, that part of the story didn't end up in Jason Sheeler's article, but he couldn't get it out of his head.",
        "And so around that time, he called the Texas Monthly, and he said there's a postman in Waco who designs scarves for Hermes.",
        "And they told him call him up.",
        "So Jason Sheeler did.",
        "Just to get him on the phone took about five or six voice mails, you know, really just saying, hi, it's Jason once again from Texas Monthly.",

        "He reluctantly agreed to meet with Jason.",
        "He didn't want the attention, but Jason was persistent.",
        "And eventually, he headed to Waco to Kermit Oliver's modest home in a rough part of the city.",
        "And every single bit of wall space is covered with his incredibly beautiful, colorful paintings, most involving portraits of his children, of farm animals.",
        "There's this great, big, huge painting, there's like, you know, a cat sitting on the back of a cow.",
        "The cow has a floral necklace around its neck.",

        "And I tell him what an honor it is to meet him.",
        "I said: You've just got the most amazing story.",
        "And he says: Well, why don't you tell me what my story is?",
        "Kermit Oliver is almost 70.",
        "He wears his mustache trim and neat.",
        "And the thing you need to know about him is he doesn't understand what the fuss is about, even though he's one of the most important living African-American painters in America and the only American artist ever to design Hermes scarves.",
        "He's actually designed 16 of them.",
        "Kermit would tell you he's a garret artist.",
        "He doesn't believe that he can make a living as a painter.",
        "He doesn't even believe he's that good.",
        "Those are his words.",
        "He just likes to paint.",
        "He goes - he works overnight in the post office, then he comes home and he paints a little bit, takes a nap and does it all over again.",
        "He survives on two or three hours of sleep, eats a sandwich at - on his break at the post office.",
        "He gets a 30-minute break, and then he goes back to sorting mail."
