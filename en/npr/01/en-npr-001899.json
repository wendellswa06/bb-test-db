        "It's been eight years since reporters first uncovered a deadly environmental and health disaster in Libby, Montana.",
        "More than 200 people in the town have died from asbestos-related disease.",
        "The asbestos in Libby came from a vermiculite mine owned by W.R.",
        "Grace and Co. Now, Grace has agreed to a record settlement to pay for cleanup costs, $250 million.",
        "It's the largest such payment in the history of the Superfund program.",
        "Andrew Schneider was the reporter who first broke the story in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.",
        "Thanks for being with us.",
        "Thanks for having me back.",
        "And tell us please, where did this asbestos ended up in Libby?",
        "Where did it end up?",
        "Almost every conceivable place - the exhaust from the mine, which was six miles away, put tons and tons of asbestos fibers over the town.",
        "It'd get out in the afternoon and you will be able to write your name in the windshield of the car.",
        "People brought back waste tailings and used it to build driveways, it was in the school yards, on the ball fields, and then of course, it was in their products that they produce, the vermiculite-based insulation called Zonolite and it was in almost all of the homes and that is heavily contaminated with asbestos fibers.",
        "So you couldn't really get away from it there.",
        "Now, the EPA went into Libby very soon after your report ran and started working on cleanup.",
        "How much have they spent in the last eight years on trying to clean up Libby, Montana?",
        "I don't have the most current figures, Melissa, but the last time I looked at it, there was an excess of 100 million.",
        "And you're still seeing reports, there was a report just a month or so ago about an elementary school in Libby, some - a wall was knocked down, asbestos spilled out, the kids were picking it up and were exposed."

        "Yeah, the town is, I mean, it's just all over the town.",
        "I feel that it's a shame because it's just a gorgeous town and the valley's surrounded by beautiful Cabinet Mountains and the Kootenai River and it's just filled with this material.",
        "The Montana senator, Max Baucus, has been calling for a whole lot more money to be spent on the cleanup.",
        "He says, this $250 million settlement is a drop in the bucket and he blames the EPA too, for not being able to tell the people who live in Libby how clean is clean.",
        "Is he right about that, do you think?",
        "I think, he's right about that but with all respect to the good senator, it's not due to a lack of effort on the part of the people in the field.",
        "The people that came out of the Denver office were about the most dedicated government types I've ever seen.",
        "For years, they fought not only their own agency, the U.S.",
        "Senate and the White House, but every corporate effort that graced it for (unintelligible).",
        "And it was really interesting, Melissa, because when you ask them why they put so much of their life into this, they say that traditionally, in cleaning up Superfund sites, they are always doing this on the assumption that people will die.",
        "So for the first time, they were actually cleaning up a site where people were dying all around them - people they've gotten to know really well.",
        "So, well, Max maybe correct that EPA isn't doing enough but the problem surely isn't with the guys in the field, it's with headquarters.",
        "We've been talking about a civil settlement for the cleanup here.",
        "The company, W.R.",
        "Grace also faces criminal charges at a trial that should be up coming.",
        "What are the charges there?",
        "The United Nations has approved an international tribunal; so has Fouad Siniora, the prime minister of Lebanon.",
        "The legislature though, has not, and that's the sticking point.",
        "And so many people said that this bombing yesterday was tied to today's rally, but it also came one day after the speaker of the parliament announced progress on resolving that impasse over the tribunal, and some say that may be what alarmed Syria, if indeed they were behind this bombing.",
        "But the investigation is still a critical issue here that must be resolved.",

        "President Obama ran as a reformer who would change the way Washington does business.",
        "Did Tom Daschle's nomination undermine that claim?",
        "Well, it certainly caused an appearance problem for the administration, which is not a good thing to have right off the bat.",
        "I think more fundamentally it underscores the high standards, but also the difficulty with meeting those high standards for the administration.",
        "I want to ask you about one standard, which is the is-he-a-lobbyist standard.",
        "If Tom Daschle were a registered lobbyist, he would've been presumably barred from a job in the administration.",
        "He wasn't, but he was in the lobbying wing of a Washington law firm.",
        "Right.",
        "And that law firm has significant lobbying contracts.",
        "He is not, technically, a registered lobbyist.",
        "He is a senior policy advisor, but he can spend up to 20 percent of his time doing exactly the same kind of work that a lobbyist would do.",
        "Well, could the Obama administration, or could any administration have a rule that would cover what people do, not just whether they're registered to do it?",
        "You know, that would be a difficult one to impose and to regulate.",
        "I think the strength of the lobbying law is that it is so narrowly defined - covering the most important piece of lobbying, which is contacting Congressmen and covered officials.",
        "But are there a lot of people in Washington who would pass the litmus test of, say, not being a lobbyist, but who are, you know, big influential players, who are being compensated to a great extent because they are former powers on Capitol Hill or in the executive branch?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You often get former members of Congress who are hired specifically because they have those connections.",
        "They can call on former members of Congress easily.",
        "They're playing tennis or golf with them on the weekends as it is.",
        "The distinction here, again, is that it can't be the majority of what they do.",
        "They can be like a general directing the troops from the rear, but they themselves are not placing the call.",
        "And that's a big distinction.",
        "At the Department of Defense, Secretary Robert Gates brought in William Lynn as his number two.",
        "And Mr. Lynn was lobbying for Raytheon, a big defense contractor.",
        "But he was given an exemption.",
        "As you view it, is there a proper place for exemptions when you have a policy that says no lobbyists at such levels?",
        "I don't think you ever want to say absolutely no exceptions.",
        "There might be someone who has such stellar expertise, that you would be doing yourself a disservice, cutting your nose off to spite your face by not allowing that person to serve.",
        "The huge disappointment there was the speed with which the Obama administration broke their pledge to slow the revolving door.",
        "So, you know, it was just very disappointing that right off of the bat they've waived one of their first nominees."
