        "They can hire babysitters.",

        "Kind of like summer camp only strike camp.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And on the other end, you know, we have parents who work two, three jobs, right?",
        "And this is, like, the possibility of, a, not having child care or having your kid in school during this time and then B, food.",
        "It's a serious challenge.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "And, as you allude to, right, so many parents in these neighborhoods rely on the school for child care at least part of the day and for free or reduced meals for students.",
        "You've taken it on yourself to provide some backup options for these kids.",
        "Can you tell me more about that?",
        "At our school, about 70 percent of our students are on free and reduced lunch.",
        "And, believe it or not, that's actually on the lower end of most LAUSD schools.",
        "A lot of LAUSD schools are in the 80s and 90 percent.",
        "And so, considering that we're estimating about half of the students are not going to be showing up to school, that's going to cause some serious issues in terms of food security.",
        "So in our school, we're going to be providing meals to students who are not going to be going to school during this time to make sure that they do not have to worry about proper health and nutrition.",
        "And they can come and pick it up - we'll be striking on the line 7:00 a.m. beginning Monday morning if there's no agreement.",
        "I'll be out there from 7:00 a.m. all the way to 1:00 if anybody, parents or students, want to come by and pick it up.",
        "And then, when we are not striking, we're going to just be making bag lunches.",
        "So it's going to be a full-scale process but I - this is definitely worth it.",
        "And I've heard that there's some concern about students - because these schools will stay open, right, during a strike, so there's concern about students having to cross picket lines of their own teachers.",
        "Not at all.",
        "In fact, the students have asked me last week about it, and all of our teachers are not going to put anything negative or shame any students for crossing the picket line.",
        "If you need to be at school, or your parents have to send you to school, like, that is totally understandable.",

        "And what these hospitals then do is they use this accreditation - it comes with a gold seal of approval - on their websites, on brochures.",
        "And they use it to recruit new patients even at the same time that they are under federal investigation for these violations or even, in some cases, where the violations are so severe the federal government has cut them off from all Medicare funding.",
        "Yeah.",
