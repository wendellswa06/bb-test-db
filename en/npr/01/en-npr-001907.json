        "All right.",
        "The really serious deficit problems - there are really two deficits.",
        "There is the short-term deficit that's been created by a combination of the recession, mostly the Bush administration policies, which are basically big tax cuts, two wars and the Medicare prescription drug benefit.",
        "And then, third on the list in terms of size is the stimulus program, the Obama stimulus.",
        "And so that's the short-term deficit.",
        "That starts to shrink over the course of the decade.",
        "But sort of just on schedule, we then get the real problem, which is we start to get the long-term Medicare - and to a lesser extent, Social Security deficit - growing.",
        "And so that's why, over the long term, we need to look at this kind of fiscal adjustment, as that's in the neighborhood of something like 6 percent of GDP.",
        "And that is every year.",
        "And when you're talking about the Bush tax cuts, they are set to expire.",
        "There are going to be a lot of people arguing to keep them in force.",
        "You don't cut - you don't increase taxes effectively during a recession.",
        "But, anyway, that's another argument, and I guess that's part of the argument.",
        "Let's get Clint on the line.",
        "Clint's calling us from Moultrie in Georgia.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "What I'd be willing to give up is black budget, like defense spending, you know?",
        "What seems to me - it seems like, you know, we're spending undisclosed amounts of money to fight, you know, a Cold War era-style war, you know, when - you know, the truth is is that we're no longer - you know, we're no longer in that kind of like conflict, you know?",
        "When you're talking about black budget, you mean the stuff that we don't know about that's buried in - somewhere...",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, the stuff that, like, that's undisclosed, like defense spending is what I'm talking about.",
        "Well, it's buried somewhere.",

        "We just don't know what we're voting for or what we vote for it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The previous target had been four million people on treatment.",
        "You can't, but it's big.",
        "It's now in the neighborhood of 650 billion.",
        "One of the real problems with defense spending is that it has already been shrinking quite significantly as a share of GDP.",
        "We have - I don't remember the numbers exactly off the top of my head, but it's a few percentage point of GDP down from where it was.",
        "So if it's 650 now, that is in the neighborhood of four to 5 percent of GDP, and that is way down.",
        "And so it's way down from the Cold War and the Vietnam War era.",
        "And I think we would agree that we need some kind of military, right?",
        "And we probably want a pretty strong military, based on the seriousness of the threats that there are around the world.",

        "I don't know, but I'm open to that idea.",
        "It doesn't get us anywhere close to solving the larger...",
