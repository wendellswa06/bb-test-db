        "Well, as you already mentioned, the states enacted higher minimum wages, and that's very important.",
        "States got a little frustrated waiting for Congress to act.",
        "And so those are around $7-ish an hour?",
        "Yes.",

        "And today in Colorado, all employers must verify that their new hires are here legally.",
        "Arizona and Georgia also passed really tough immigration laws in 2006.",
        "All right.",
        "So tell us about some of the wackier new laws around the country.",

        "That's what it sounds like, doesn't it?",
        "Actually, what the law does is it prohibits trunking.",
        "And what that means is that folks can't ride in the trunks of cars.",
        "Now, you may automatically wonder well, why would anybody want to do that?",
        "Well, I guess trunking has becoming quite popular among teenagers in California.",
        "Just for fun or is it -",
        "Well, actually, no. They're trying to get around some California state restrictions on the number of friends that teenagers can have in the car while they are new drivers.",
        "So what they've ended up doing is putting some friends in the trunk, hoping they won't get caught.",
        "But it's come with tragic results.",
        "Some teens have actually been killed in accidents because of that.",
        "And some others?",
        "A few involved pets and animals.",
        "Ohio became the 35th state, where pet owners can establish trust funds for their pet if the owner dies or becomes ill.",

        "But in Europe, there is an anti-Americanism that is at once casual, but can also be insidious.",
        "David Brooks, I think I hear echoes of Old Europe embedded in there.",

        "He met with a lot of resistance.",
        "Overall, how did the president do?",
        "I don't think he did badly, but I want to linger on that moment that you just played because I had underlined it in my transcript also, and it was a classic Obama moment, honoring the other side's argument, embracing it, and then making his own point against anti-Americanism.",
        "How long has it been since an American president was able to hold a town hall meeting?",
        "You know, I think that's seen as why many Americans voted for Obama, to win new friends for the United States and influence people.",
        "He got applause when he talked about closing Abu Ghraib and - closing Guantanamo and saying that - about Abu Ghraib, that humiliating people is never a good strategy to battle terrorism.",
        "So I think there is a kind of base of support for Obama in Europe and that he get out of the summit not with an enormous victory but certainly not with a defeat.",
        "They did get some spending, though not in a stimulus directly but through the IMF.",
        "Obama agrees broadly with the Europeans on the need for new regulation of the financial industry.",
        "He talked about that in Strasbourg.",
        "So what looked like - they spun it down going in, and so what looked like might have been a very difficult meeting came out pretty well for him."

        "David, a wise move by the Republicans to unify in their opposition or are there shoals in here?",
        "Well, there are shoals, but you know, you present a budget with - which implies $6.5 trillion in deficits over 10 years, that's going to be tough to get Republican votes.",
        "You know, I think to me the biggest thing was - Obama got most of what he wanted from the Democrats, but even the Democrats struck down a lot of things.",

        "I'm not getting in there.",
        "He put himself, his administration, the Democratic Party right in the middle of it, ousting CEO really putting himself into position to be responsible for what plants are closing and what plants are not closing.",
        "If I'm a citizen somewhere in northern Indiana or Michigan, I'm lobbying the Democratic party as hard as I can to preserve my plans, and I just think its perilous to get politics that much involved in these sorts of decisions.",
        "E.J., a perilous way to go forward?",
        "I agree it's perilous, but I don't think he had much choice.",
        "The basic decision was - are you going to try to save GM or not?",
        "He decided he was going to try to save GM.",
        "Once you do that, you've got to get very deeply engaged in the process of how.",
        "The administration decided that GM wasn't moving quickly enough to restructure itself, there will be a lot of pain in this restructuring, there will be some plants closed.",
        "But their view is, you got to take aggressive action to keep the company going so it can grow eventually some day, but he is taking a risk and doing it."
