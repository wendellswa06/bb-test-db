        "He speaks about the culture he grew up in when he was a teenager, which was Germany under Hitler, and the culture was, as he put it, quote, \"\"marred by its sinister regime that thought that all the answers - it had all the answers\"\" and infiltrated society before it was recognized as, quote, \"\"the monster that it was.",

        "And so, if you imagine like a typical pirate's peg leg, you know, that wouldn't retain any energy.",

        "What they often refer to as a prosthetic is sometimes being active, where you have the bionic to the prosthetic leg.",
        "So this is a very passive prosthetic, the Cheetah, and I guess the difference between this leg, you know, the Cheetah and the everyday walking leg is the Cheetah doesn't have a heel on the back, and it doesn't have any cosmesis.",
