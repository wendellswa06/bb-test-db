        "The first time I heard about your story.",
        "But I just was wondering why, when they first told you that you could not compete because it might - it may or may not give you an unfair advantage, but then, another decision handed by the - I think you said it was the arbitration board of sports, I think...",
        "Board of Arbitration.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And they said that you could compete.",
        "Why is that?",

        "I mean, would it have had...",
        "No.",
        "Not at all.",
        "It's a completely independent sports governing body.",
        "And basically, what the court of arbitration does is they do a lot of the preliminary hearing and that sort of thing.",
        "And it's usually involved with the sports governing body as the one party and then the athletes as the other party, and both represent, you know, your take or your side of the story with you evidence and your testing and that sort of thing.",
        "They make an independent decision.",
        "And it's basically world-acclaimed judges from different countries all across the globe, and they do it independently.",
        "So it's completely independent of any country or governing body.",
        "They make the decision.",
        "Isn't this the same body, for example, that decided about Floyd Landis?",

        "And...",
        "It's far more in depth and far more - they didn't only look at the prosthetics.",
        "They looked at my legs (unintelligible), the volume of oxygen, and they looked at the video analysis.",
        "They used pressure plates.",
        "They used, you know, different measurements for the prosthetic legs as far as energy turn and contact form on the treadmill and on the track.",
        "And correct me if I'm wrong.",
        "As I understand it, one test suggested that you did get an advantage on a straight away, but then, the other test said, well, that doesn't necessarily apply to the acceleration phase or to taking the turn, which you have to do in the 400 meters.",
        "And so overall, there was no advantage.",
        "The (Unintelligible) test indicated that I use less energy at constant speed.",
        "But they used a formula which is Vo2 mass, which is the volume of oxygen used, and volume of oxygen used you can only use to indicate aerobic exercise, which is endurance exercise.",
        "Sprinting isn't an aerobic exercise.",
        "It's an anaerobic exercise, meaning that you use the cells in your body to create energy, not oxygen.",
        "So they - I mean, they admitted in the end that they'd used the wrong form of, you know, hypothesis and the wrong...",
        "The wrong measurement.",
        "The wrong measurement, basically, to test, and they took that back in the end.",
        "But, you know, it was unfortunate because they actually only looked at the advantages during steady state running.",
        "They didn't consider the acceleration phase or any disadvantages, you know, the net advantage or the net disadvantage.",
        "And later on, I found out proof that the only advantage, the single advantage that they had was - wasn't even an advantage.",
        "It was a disadvantage.",

        "But, you know, I think, just as far as, you know, technology goes, there's never going to be a limit on it, but that's exactly one thing that the court of arbitration has definitely specified in the ruling, that each prosthetic leg is going to have to be reviewed by the IWF before they make a decision on it, which I think is also very important.",
