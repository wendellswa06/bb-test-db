        "Everybody sort of grumbles and grouses.",
        "But by the time you get up to 25%, that's real hurt for - on both sides of the border.",

        "But a lot of people will tell you, including such respected statesmen and economists as George P.",
        "Shultz, that it's really a question of arithmetic, and if you consume more than you produce, you're going to have a deficit.",
        "Basically (laughter), your deficit is going to be the difference between what you actually consume and what you can produce.",
