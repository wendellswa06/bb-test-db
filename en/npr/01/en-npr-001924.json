        "We haven't had to refill this thing - I don't think - once yet, but our busy season is yet to come.",

        "It lists how much you're allowed to have, where it's legal to consume and how long the high takes to set in.",

        "The result of that campaign is the pamphlets; 10,000 of them are located throughout town.",

        "One of the challenges that the bureau sees across the student loan market is despite the availability of federal consumer protections that allow student loan borrowers to pay an amount that is in line with what they can afford, what we see is the most vulnerable borrowers - and that definitely includes older borrowers who are struggling under the weight of student loan debt - reaching out to their student loan company and continuously getting bad information, no information despite the fact that they should be able to get into these affordable repayment plans.",

        "I mean that's where a lot of this comes from, right?",
        "What advice would you give that parent?",
        "So I think the first advice is to ensure that, you know, they could make the payment should their child or grandchild be in a position where they can't pay.",
        "But another issue that's important is understanding how and then they might be able to be released from being a cosigner.",
        "So for quite a number of private student loan companies, they actually allow the borrower to apply to have their cosigner be released from the loan after making a certain number of on-time payments or other requirements.",
        "And I think one of the things that the bureau has highlighted for years now is that far too often, cosigners who are trying to get released are running into roadblocks and unnecessary hurdles in that process.",
        "So you know, we urge primary borrowers and cosigners to really understand the aspects of that key consumer protection.",
        "Seth Frotman, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's student loan ombudsman, thank you very much.",

        "Used to be most Americans were middle-class - 61 percent back in 1971.",

        "Those are the findings of a new Pew Research Center survey we've been talking about this week.",
        "And today, we'll take a look at what to do about the shrinking middle class.",
        "And NPR's Scott Horsley joins me now to talk more about it.",
        "Hey there, Scott.",
        "Good to be with you, Audie.",
        "OK so to start, the Pew survey we've been talking about deals mostly with income.",
        "And we use, like, middle-income and middle-class interchangeably, but there are actually distinctions there, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's a lot of different ways to look at this, Audie.",
        "One is a sort of absolute standard of living.",
        "You know, you might think you're middle-class if you've got a solid roof over your head, plenty of food in the fridge.",
        "You get to take a vacation once in a while, maybe you have some confidence about your retirement.",
        "Another way to look at it, though, is how does your income compare to that of other Americans?",
        "And these are related questions, but they're not the same thing.",
        "The Pew researchers were very clear in defining the middle class in relative terms - that is, if you make between two-thirds of the middle income and twice the middle income, you're middle-class.",
        "For a family of three, that's between around $42,000 a year and $126,000 a year.",
        "So if that middle class is shrinking, it doesn't necessarily mean absolute standards of living have fallen, but it does mean that income's getting more stratified or stretched out.",
        "Most of us used to be bunched up somewhere in the middle.",
        "Now we've got more Americans making a lot more, and in some cases a lot less.",
        "And, of course, politicians are always, like, campaigning on protecting the middle class.",
        "But what tools really does the government have to address this?",
        "How could they fix the slide?",
        "A big tool that has been used is taxes and transfer policies.",
        "The Pew points out that one of the big winners over the last four decades has been the elderly.",
        "More generous Social Security benefits help move a lot of seniors into the middle class from the lower rungs on the economic ladder.",
        "And, of course, a progressive taxation can whittle away at the top end.",
        "That's the most direct way the government can influence this distribution of income around the country, but there are some drawbacks.",
        "It can be inefficient so when you take a dollar from a wealthy person, it's worth less by the time it gets to a poor person.",
        "And politically, there are also limits to have anything that smacks of redistribution.",
        "So what are politicians looking at instead?",
        "On the Democratic side, you're starting to hear about more ways the government could rewrite the rules.",
        "So the market itself divides the economic pie more equitably.",
        "So much of the pie in recent years has gone to the wealthiest Americans.",
        "A lot of those ideas have to do with boosting workers' bargaining power, whether through collective bargaining or things like mandatory overtime or maybe a higher minimum wage.",
        "Now, as we have seen under President Obama, none of those things is easy to do politically.",
        "But they are the kind of policies that could make a difference.",
        "Trade policy, immigration policy also come into play here, although the effects of those can be pretty complicated.",
        "What about Republicans?"
