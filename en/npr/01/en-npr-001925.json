        "NPR's Wade Goodwyn is there today and has this report.",
        "In Lake Charles, there are the casinos, a nice little downtown and a lovely lakefront with beautiful homes and lawns leading down to the water.",
        "All sustained major damage from Hurricane Rita, but most everything in this part of town is covered by insurance.",
        "But wind your way down Enterprise Street to the poor section of Lake Charles, where a row of shotgun houses sit close, here you'll find the damage that's not going to be so easy to fix.",
        "Irma Chaives(ph), in her 60s, is sweeping up glass on her porch, and like many who stayed behind, she's desperate for a cigarette.",
        "I wish I'd have been coming back to Pickney's Package(ph) to buy me some cigarettes, but I guess the Lord might want me to quit.",
        "Compared to the nuclear blast that Biloxi and Gulfport experienced from Hurricane Katrina, what Chaives is suffering is minor, except that it's not.",
        "I'm cleaning up some of the glass that shattered my new storm door.",
        "It bust two windows, took half of the roof off.",
        "All the ceiling tile is coming down in my dining room and in my bedroom.",
        "It's sad, but I'm blessed, yeah.",
        "Irma Chaives has no insurance, but she's got a phone number for the Red Cross.",
        "And as soon as she gets phone service, she says she's going to call and see what they can do for her.",

        "Around the block, standing on the side of the road next to an old Chevrolet Impala with its hood up, is Warren Provost.",
        "His house is under water in Port Arthur, so he's come to help his family here in Lake Charles.",
        "There's a small look of desperation in Provost's eyes.",
        "He decided not to evacuate, and now in the heat and humidity and all alone with a broken car and no one to help him, that mistake is being brought home to him full force.",
        "If I had to do it all over again, I'd do it a different way, you know?",
        "I could have just left all this behind from the get-go, you know, and just do something different.",
        "Across town Lake Charles police Officer Jason Schnocke(ph) stands on Ryan Street with dark sunglasses on his face and a 9mm on his hip.",
        "Schnocke says there were a few attempts at looting after Rita came through, but the police department took care of that.",
        "After the mess in New Orleans, Lake Charles PD was determined there would be nothing like that in Calcasieu Parish, and there hasn't been.",
        "The biggest challenge is that there are parts of this town that are still flooded that authorities haven't been able to get to yet."

        "Well, that's what I'm afraid of.",
        "You know, both President Obama and John McCain promised to close it during the 2008 campaign.",
        "John McCain actually promised he would close it on day one of his presidency.",
        "And it's proven to be much more difficult than imagined, in part because of very determined and partisan opposition that President Obama has faced.",
        "But there is a real danger that if the mechanism that President Obama uses to deal with these very difficult remaining cases he still has in Guantanamo -about 46, 48 prisoners left who he's decided are hard to prosecute, but too dangerous to release - if that mechanism gets put in to place in a way that can be applied in the future to people we capture next year, 10 years from now, 50 years from now, then that Guantanamo principle of detention without charge will be with us forever.",
        "Yet if these detainees can't be transferred to the United States for trial, what alternatives does the president have?"

        "Yet, that has its risks too.",
        "We remember the case of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, the man alleged for - charge with 280 charges in connection with the bombings of U.S.",
        "embassies in Tanzania and Kenya back in 1998.",
        "Convicted of just one of those charges, this after much evidence was not able to be presented by prosecutors.",
        "It was thrown out by the judge as inadmissible.",
        "And well, the concern is if you bring people on civilian charges in civilian courts and the evidence is thrown out of court, what do you with them then?",
        "Well, you know, the Ghailani verdict, I think, has been misunderstood.",
        "This was a man who was convicted and will likely be sentenced to life in prison.",
        "And once he's sentenced, I predict we'll never hear about him again.",
        "He won't be a problem to the United States anymore.",
        "Had he been kept in Guantanamo in the state of indefinite detention without trial, he would have been a permanent problem, a permanent source of controversy for the government.",
        "And I don't think that regime of detention would be sustainable for the rest of his life.",
        "And then what do you do with him when the pressure for his release would mount and mount and mount?",
        "So, you know, I think given those two alternatives, prosecuting him successfully - and it was successful - in a civilian court in New York was by far the best option for the United States.",
        "If he appeals his conviction and gets thrown out on the same kind of technicality as the other - the evidence was thrown out of court, he then walks.",
        "Well, I don't think, in a democracy like ours, we can have a system which guarantees 100 percent that someone in the government wants to imprison will be imprisoned.",
        "That's not what we are as a society and we never will be.",
        "We do have a system in our civilian federal courts that has worked in almost every single case we applied it.",
        "Can you think of a terrorist, a significant terrorist, who has gone through our civilian courts and not been convicted and not been put away in a way that's safe and secure for the American people?",
        "And yet every single person who's in Guantanamo - nine, 10 years after the camp is opened - remains a continuing problem for us, a source of pain and controversy, partisan dispute for the president, for the Congress, for the country.",

        "You can argue that there have been a handful of people who have gone back or started fresh terrorist activity.",
        "But the numbers are - I don't believe they are as high as the 20 percent that some people suggest it is.",
        "And some, as I'm sure you know, say it's much higher than 20 percent.",
        "Well, I don't think there's any evidence for that.",

        "If those people are released, how much more does al-Qaida benefit if 5 or 10 percent of them then go back to becoming cannon fodder for the terrorists?",
        "And compare that to how much al-Qaida benefits if we keep Guantanamo open forever, and it remains a recruiting symbol that they use to encourage hundreds and hundreds of people to join their movement.",
