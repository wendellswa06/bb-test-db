        "Hi, folks.",
        "I just want to make the comment that it's a unique situation, because putting aside the people that are incarcerated that are U.S.",
        "citizens, they're - you can make an argument that they should be treated like POWs.",
        "But because they're not part of a nation-state and we never declared war, it's this no man's land that's resulted in Guantanamo that has resulted, admittedly, in a lot of the problems that your guest is suggesting.",
        "However, until the groups such as al-Qaida and the Taliban make \"\"peace\"\", quote, unquote, with the United States, I believe that they should be treated (technical difficulty) kind of enemy combatant.",
        "Tom Malinowski?",
        "Well, you know, we have a - we clearly have an interest in not allowing significant terrorists like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others to go back out there in the world, where they can threaten us again.",
        "But we have a system, a traditional system of justice here in this country that allows us to do that securely, that works, that puts these people away, if we're allowed to use it.",
        "We have a system in Guantanamo that has resulted in the release of dangerous people, and in the prosecution in the military commissions of only a couple of people.",
        "We have two systems: One that's established and that works.",
        "We should use it.",
        "One that has failed miserably over the last 10 years - we should stop using it.",
        "I think that's fairly straightforward.",
        "Marty, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I'd just like to say I think that Guantanamo Bay should be closed, and we need to normalize relations with Cuba.",

        "So, again, you know, I think rather than searching for new and novel ways of bringing these people to justice, we ought to use the system that we've been proud of in this country for over 200 years and that worked so well.",

        "So, you know, I feel like it's completely contrary to our entire philosophy of government should be doing this.",

        "They were arrested by the police in countries like Pakistan, in Europe, in North Africa, in cities, just the way people might be arrested in the United States.",
        "But actually, it's not true that even enemy combatants captured on a battlefield in the past have been tried in civilian courts when we, as a country, have wanted to deny them the status of a soldier.",
        "For example, General Manuel Noriega, the president of Panama who's the commander-in-chief of the Panamanian armed forces, when the United States invaded Panama in 1990 and took him into custody as a prisoner of war, he demanded the right to be tried before a military courts, to be treated as an enemy combatant, because he thought that was his right as a soldier.",

        "You are a drug trafficker.",

        "It used to be in this country that giving someone a military status and military trial was considered an honor, and putting someone before a civilian court, lining them up in front of the rapists and the murderers who normally get tried there, was not considered an honor.",
        "And somehow, the Bush administration turned that on its head for people, and I want to get it back to where it was.",
        "Let me ask you: A lot of people are giving President Obama a lot of advice two years into his term.",

        "So, you know, I give them advice, but, at the same time, I have to recognize just how difficult the dilemma they face is.",
        "And do you fear that this decision is going to be made soon?",
        "Well, I think, you know, the White House has signaled that it is going to issue an executive order that defines the rules under which those 46 people in Guantanamo can be held without charge, and those rules are going to be better, I think, than the rules that exist right now.",
        "And so I would welcome an order that gives those people greater due process.",
