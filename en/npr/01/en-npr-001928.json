        "And you would point to other neighboring countries where there also was great modernization and urbanization...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...And birth rates came down.",
        "They came down, and they - with none of these negative side effects that China is experiencing now.",
        "You write about, among other things, the pilot projects and the exceptions to the national policy by which some Chinese couples could have had two children.",
        "In fact, most did not.",
        "What does that say to you?",
        "Well, it tells me that these latest changes that just happened are probably not going to result in a baby boom that the Chinese government hopes for and needs to keep the economy going and growing forth.",
        "It's so expensive right now to educate and raise a child.",
        "One concern about the one-child policy was what's sometimes called the Little Emperor phenomenon, that it would lead to the largest cohort of only children - the most cherished, spoiled children the planet had ever seen.",
        "Was that fear borne out?",
        "I think that that's a very squishy one to talk about, right?",
        "You're talking about a whole generation, and to import all of these values into a whole entire generation is hard.",
        "And there's been a lot of studies done that go both ways.",
        "There's no difference; there's plenty of difference.",
        "But I think the most telling on that I saw was this one by a group of Australian economists, where they did a series of psychological tests, and they found that only children were very different from non-only children cohort before them because they tended to be very risk-averse and less optimistic and also less entrepreneurial.",
        "And I think that's very suggestive going forward because you wonder.",
        "Everything we're used to thinking about China - economic, dynamic, you know - that's all going to change very rapidly if not only is the makeup of the population is, you know, little emperors who are risk-adverse but also a hugely aging population as well, you know?",
        "These are not, you know, the kind of movers and shakers of tomorrow"

        "When you assess what this policy has meant for Chinese women - net positive, net negative - what do you say?",
        "Well, it has benefit a certain segment of Chinese women, urban Chinese women who did not have to compete with siblings.",
        "And so you can be a modern Chinese woman and go to college in greater numbers than ever before and graduate school and not have to share with your brother in a way you would have in the past.",
        "But if you balance that against, you know, what happened to women, particularly rural areas who are forced to have abortions or sterilizations, and also if you balance that against the women outside of China on the borders who are now being trafficked to fulfill this, you know, huge gap, I don't think you could say that, on balance, this has been good for women in China at all or women anywhere.",
        "The great gap you mentioned is the imbalance between men and women in China.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, we're talking - what?",
        "- 30 million men - more men than women in China of a certain age group.",

        "That's the population of Saudi Arabia.",
        "There is no way they can fill that gap, not even with immigration.",

        "We're going to hear about some of the lines of inquiry the FBI and other agencies are following.",

        "So help us understand this, why it's thought a government report may have essentially shown hackers a way in.",
        "Well, investigators are now following a number of lines of inquiry, including, as you said, whether an inspector general's report tipped off hackers to some of the agency's vulnerabilities.",
        "The 66-page report was released publicly in November 2014, and the hack is thought to have come about a month later.",
        "Among the things the inspector general found that could have helped hackers was that nearly a quarter of the agency's systems did not have valid authorization procedures.",
        "That means things like having passwords or dormant accounts closed or using smart cards or access codes.",
        "The reason that's important is because one of the departments that didn't have the correct procedures was the Federal Investigative Services.",
        "That's the group responsible for background investigations of federal employees.",
        "So that data's very sensitive, and as we know now, this is one of the databases that was hacked.",

        "We have some heated moments, but we start as friends.",

        "Many people called in and cited houses of worship as places where they find common ground and a feeling of community.",
