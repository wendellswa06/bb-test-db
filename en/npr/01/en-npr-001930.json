        "Well, they're also focused on the hack that took place during the government shutdown in October 2013 and whether that played some role in this latest episode.",
        "That hack was against the Federal Election Commission, and it had furloughed all of its then-339 employees during the 2013 government shutdown.",
        "So that means the FEC's IT, the people who would have been monitoring the networks, weren't on the job.",
        "And it turns out that the Chinese hacked into the FEC system just days into the shutdown.",
        "The focus at that time was how hackers were able to - might - maybe get information on subpoenas and donors in investigations that the Federal Election Commission might be conducting.",
        "But now officials are looking at whether or not that breach may have helped hackers find vulnerabilities in other government networks.",
        "So does that mean that finding a vulnerability at the Federal Election Commission's computer system might have also led to a hacker finding a vulnerability at OPM?",
        "Exactly.",
        "So hypothetically, let's say you're hacking into the FEC network, and you find that it's easy to get into the system through some glitch in the code that runs, for example, the network printers.",
        "Then you take that glitch, and you see if that works in a hack against some other federal agency, like OPM.",
        "So hacking into one agency can potentially give you a window into how to get into another.",
        "Why isn't the Obama administration saying on the record that China is responsible for this?",
        "Is it because they aren't sure?",
        "No.",
        "In background conversations, they seem pretty sure.",
        "In fact, they're zeroing in on who, specifically, they think is responsible.",
        "They're looking at a hacking group that goes after strategic interests for the Chinese government, and it's called - and I'm not making this up - Deep Panda.",
        "Why not say this publicly?",
        "Well, part of the reason is because the U.S.",
        "does this kind of hacking and espionage as well, and it's understood that this sort of thing goes on.",
        "One official told me that so far, the calculation has been that the trouble that they would cause in naming China specifically seems to outweigh the benefits of calling them out for stealing the information.",
        "What's more, as a general matter, officials see a bright line between spying for commercial advantage and spying for national security.",
        "This isn't about stealing credit cards or commercial secrets.",
        "There's an expectation that they're going to be trying to get this information just as the U.S.",
        "is trying to get this kind of information about them.",
        "So this falls into a different category.",

        "Today, we're looking into what's happened with some of the more compelling stories we've covered this year.",
        "We've been reporting on the resurgence of opiate abuse in the U.S.",
        "One of the saddest incidents occurred last February - a cluster of 22 overdose deaths in the Pittsburgh area from heroin spiked with the painkiller fentanyl.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF KDKA NEWS SHOW)",
        "Right at this very moment, there is a batch of heroin out there that will kill you.",

        "That was the Mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, speaking to TV station KDKA in January.",
        "Dr. Neil Capretto is the medical director of the Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh.",
        "He says region's problems with heroin have continued, though not at the same intensity.",
        "The fentanyl was a spike within a crisis.",
        "This has been an ongoing crisis for many years.",
        "I mean, back in 1985 and 1986, Pittsburgh area - Allegheny County - had 22 overdose deaths.",
        "In 2012, we had 290.",
        "Last year, we had 278.",
        "We may be somewhere in that range this year.",
        "So this has just been ongoing.",
        "The fentanyl killed a lot of people, but the regular heroine that's out there is killing, you know, at least five people a week, on average, in the Pittsburgh area.",
        "Also this year, there was the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who died of a combined drug overdose and brought a lot of attention to the rise of heroine abuse in the country.",
        "Do you think that changed the conversation at all?",
        "I believe it did to some degree with some people.",
        "I mean, it helped raise awareness.",
        "I mean, it kind of humanized the problem.",
        "I've actually had a couple people come into treatment a couple months following that who said learning of his death was a factor that helped get their attention and motivate them to get help.",
        "Wow.",
        "And in the media coverage, did you see any misconceptions or misunderstandings that came across from how it was covered?",
        "Well, I think it helped.",
        "I think, unfortunately, a lot of people have this misconception that addiction - particularly, heroin addiction - only happens to a certain segment of society that's in the inner-city, you know, living homeless under bridges.",
        "But this is now very much a problem of all people - in the cities, the suburbs, rural area.",
        "And actually, in Pennsylvania and a lot of the country, the rates of overdose deaths in the suburbs and rural areas are actually now proportionally higher than the city 'cause this has spread like an infectious disease with - it was the prescription medicine problem that started, but then this new heroin came in in the late-'90s, and that is now everywhere.",
        "We have more heroin being used in our community than at any time in our existence, and I still see that problem's getting worse before it gets better.",
        "And actually, nationally, the prescription drug overdose problem has improved a little bit, but the heroin problem has increased as a lot of people convert from prescription drugs, unfortunately, over to heroin because it's much cheaper, but often it's much more deadly."

        "And so sadly, it seems that you've really got your hands full as much as ever.",
        "Is there anything that the federal government or local government can do to help ease the crisis?",
        "The short answer is yes.",
        "I'm happy to say three things got accomplished this fall in Pennsylvania legislature.",
        "We now - the Good Samaritan law got available.",
        "That allows people who call for help for somebody who has died from an overdose, basically, immunity if they're caught with just drug paraphernalia.",
        "Second thing is the law to make Narcan or noloxone more available.",
        "That's a drug that reverses an overdose.",
        "Both of those were unanimous in both the House and Senate in Pennsylvania, which is basically unheard of.",
        "And also, the third thing that came through was a prescription monitoring program that will allow doctors to check to see if patients are obtaining prescriptions from multiple physicians.",
        "Well, best of luck at it, and I bet you'll be getting an earful.",
        "As is the case with so much of what we cover, there's a real divide between the parties.",
        "Democrats are saying Deborah Ramirez's claim that Kavanaugh exposed himself to her in college is very serious, that Thursday's hearing should be delayed so it can be investigated.",
        "But interestingly, a lot of Republicans are outright dismissing it, being much more skeptical of it than Christine Blasey Ford's allegation.",
        "Orrin Hatch even called it phony.",
        "So has it changed the dynamic at all from what you can see?",
        "Is it making his confirmation any more likely, less likely?",
        "You know, if anything, a lot of Republicans sound even more determined than ever to support and confirm Kavanaugh.",
        "This time last week, Republicans were saying that Ford deserved to be heard, that her allegations are serious.",
        "Today, Mitch McConnell and other Republicans are dismissing both claims as unsubstantiated and designed to slow down or stop Kavanaugh's confirmation.",
        "Mirroring Kavanaugh, McConnell on the Senate floor today called the allegations a smear campaign.",
        "Now we're hearing there could be a committee vote on his confirmation as soon as the end of the week, and that's hard to square with Republican promises that they want to hear what Ford has to say, that they want a fair hearing.",
        "But we've said all along that a couple of key senators will determine what happens given that Republicans hold such a narrow majority.",
        "One of them, Susan Collins, did say today that she does think the Judiciary Committee should reach out to Ramirez and talk to her under oath.",
        "So that's worth pointing out.",
        "All right.",
        "And meanwhile, the hearing that has been set is scheduled to go ahead for Thursday.",
        "Both Ford and Kavanaugh are set to testify.",
        "And I - before I let you go, I want to mention another letter.",
        "This is one that Ford sent to Senator Grassley.",
        "It was made public today.",
        "What did it say?",
        "Yeah, this weekend she wrote Grassley that the assault that she described, quote, \"\"while many years ago, it was serious and has had a lasting impact on my life.\"\" And she also wrote, the decision to report it was a very difficult one, but I felt that this was something that a citizen couldn't not do.",
        "And Grassley wrote her back, saying that he wants to hear from her.",
        "He wants to have a credible and fair process.",
        "But as we've been saying, that's kind of tough to square with Republicans promising a committee vote soon and a full floor vote very soon as well and basically all but saying, we're going to get Brett Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court.",
        "All right, thanks, Scott."

        "We now have a different president.",
        "Another option is for scientists to forget about embryonic stem cells and focus on newer methods, like transforming regular adult cells into stem cells.",
