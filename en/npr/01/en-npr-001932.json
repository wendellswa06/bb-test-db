        "Sixty percent of white people are opposed to paying student athletes.",

        "Have there been any studies looking at why certain groups are responding in certain ways?",
        "So there was a study done last year by some researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst that looked at whether racial resentment was informing how people answer this question.",
        "And they found that the strongest indicator for opposition to compensating student athletes among white people - the strongest indicator was racial resentment towards African Americans.",
        "And there's a way that these sports are racialized because the most high-profile college athletes in these sports are black players.",

        "Adult stem cells is a very important type of cells, but their potential to differentiate is only for the tissue they come from.",

        "Now, the third type of stem cells, which has been very recently developed, are these so-called induced pluripotent stem cells, or IPS cells.",
        "They are derived not from embryos but from adult cells, like skin cells.",
        "Now, those are very, very interesting cells, and they have a lot of similarities.",
        "Maybe they're almost identical to embryonic stem cells.",
        "The problem is we do not know at this point what is a good embryonic stem cell or what is a good IPS cell.",
        "We now know it depends on how you isolate these cells, and they have different properties.",
        "So one of the very important issues of present research is to define what is the gold standard for pluripotent, a stem cell like an IPS cell, or an embryonic stem cell.",
        "And that's why I think it's essential to work with embryonic stem cells and, I would argue, even to isolate new embryonic stem cell lines under different conditions.",

        "I think it gave us a lot of hope that now things would relax, and we could work with these embryonic stem cells with federal funding, and there was the process of NIH to approve newly derived lines.",

        "Now, this is very weird to me, very puzzling because in this country, the support for science is determined by panels of scientists, review boards who prioritize who should get funding, who should not.",
