        "And of course, the city's largest library, the Ahmed Baba Institute, just how many documents were stored there and how did the librarians try to protect them?",
        "There's about 40,000 manuscripts at the Ahmed Baba Institute and quite early on, the interim director of the Institute sensed that these documents were likely to be in danger.",
        "And so, they decided that rather than leaving them in the library building that they would try to smuggle them out, bit by bit.",
        "They took the manuscripts and wrapped them in sackcloth and then loaded them onto motorcycles or into cars in small packages so that they wouldn't attract the attention of the Islamist rebels who are occupying the town.",

        "Is there an irony here, given that there's been this big international effort to build a space for these manuscripts at the Ahmed Baba Institute and collect them all there, and yet it seems like they're safer in a way with the community where everybody is in this tradition of hiding them when trouble comes?",
        "Well, I think the two are not mutually exclusive because the Ahmed Baba Institute exists within the community and is staffed by people from the community, those same impulses and instincts remain in place.",
        "And the very few documents that were burned were ones that had been slated to be examined and digitized.",
