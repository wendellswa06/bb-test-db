        "That was the real American dream, your own farm.",
        "So, we had the Homestead Act in the 1860s that made it possible for anyone with modest means to buy a farm.",
        "It was something that was noted by Alexis de Tocqueville who wrote a book on democracy in America in the 1830s.",
        "He was French, but he was touring America.",
        "He noticed the independent streak of Americans and their desire to own their own farm and their own home.",
        "And he thought that that represented kind of an anti-feudal feeling that with each person in this country is an independent agent.",
        "There is no landlord or lord with his thumb on you.",
        "Now, during the housing bubble, the American dream arguably got pretty warped.",
        "Buying a house suddenly meant making a lot of money really fast.",
        "There was a frantic rush to buy houses as prices went up and up and up.",
        "McMansions sprang up as people used the equity in their homes to move into bigger houses than they really needed.",

        "The homes here on their street are well-kept, but pretty modest.",
        "Many are ranch houses, they're spread out with nice, big backyards.",
        "There's definitely no new McMansions here.",
        "Most of these ranches were all built in the '50s, so it's at a time, like a turnover right now.",
        "Either the people are moving to Florida or dying or selling their house.",
        "And a lot of couples our age with kids, first-time homebuyers, are buying up all the houses around here.",

        "The lowest homeownership rate in the developed world is Switzerland and only 35 percent of the population of Switzerland owns their home.",
        "And Switzerland is a very affluent little enclave.",
        "And it's not that the Swiss somehow love renting.",
        "Wheaton says it's just that the economic incentives in that country push people towards renting.",
        "And that's worth American policymakers taking note of.",
        "Over the next few years, Congress will be restructuring the government's role in the housing market.",
        "And those changes could have a real impact on what for so long has been considered a key part of the American dream, owning your own house.",
        "Chris Arnold, NPR News, Boston.",
        "And the Federal Communications Commission has a proposal it says will boost the economy.",
        "The FCC wants the government to spend billions of dollars on a nationwide network for emergency responders, and it wants to bring a faster, cheaper Internet connection to the 100 million Americans who don't have one.",
        "FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski says the government could pay for all this by auctioning off public airwaves long-used by broadcasters for new wireless broadband services.",
        "This plan is revenue-positive for the American people.",
        "When you look at the spectrum that will recover and the auctions that that will generate, even before you start counting revenue from increased investment and job creation, the plan is revenue-positive."
