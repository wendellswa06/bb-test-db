        "And I think you can find a connection between how they're running their campaigns and how they are crafting their methods and specifically addressing these issues because quite frankly, the people who talk about net neutrality, broadband access, open media, that sort of thing - media consolidation - are grassroots in nature.",

        "Yet, Islam was also an organizing principle of an empire that exploded out of Arabia in the 7th century, and to, well, dominate much of the world - to conquer Spain and, well, right to the gates of Vienna.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "On the other hand, it was fascinating how relatively easy the Muslim conquest was.",
        "And one fascinating reason here, Neal, is that the Islamic vision of Jesus was that he was a great prophet with an all-time message for Muslims, as well, but he was not literally the son of God.",
        "This is what Christians were arguing about for hundreds of years in that part of the world, as to what was the exact nature of Jesus, and was he man or was he God, or 50/50, or all of those things.",
        "So by the time Islam came along and said, OK, this is our take on it, it was hardly a surprise.",
        "It was more sort of an administrative change of power at the top than theological.",
        "Yet, again, it can't be argued that the Muslim empire that took over much part of the world could ever have been possible without some organizing principle, and indeed, that principle was Islam.",
        "Absolutely, and I agree with you.",
        "And that's not the point that I'm arguing.",
        "I'm not arguing that Islam has not had great impact on the Middle East region and its cultures and civilization.",
        "I mean, it's had a glorious civilization in its day.",
        "But I'm arguing that the relation - the nature of conflict between the West and the East does not depend on that, and precedes Islam and would still exist if you took away - you know, I mean, for example, struggles over oil and energy in the area.",
        "If the area were Christian, would the region be any more accepting of big, Western oil companies trying to come in a trying to dominate those things?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "You also point out the example of the Middle East conflict, sometimes portrayed as a three-sided conflict between Christians and Jews and Muslims.",
        "Nevertheless, if you said all of those Muslims were Christian, they would have been no more accepting of the state of Israel.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "And, I mean, the whole Arab-Israeli thing has nothing to do with Islam, really, because the Jews who had suffered incredible persecution in Europe, and slaughter and discrimination, and it culminating in the Holocaust, ended up migrating to Palestine to get away from all of that, and displaced Palestinians who were living there.",
        "But I don't - you know, if those Palestinians were Muslim or Christian or Buddhist, or whatever, it was still their land, there would have still been the same resentments in the struggle to regain their state.",
        "But there are, as you know, those who will argue that Islam is a fundamentally violent religion that calls on forced conversion, among other things.",
        "Well, that, I think you know, is really very inaccurate.",
        "Forced conversions - there's a law - there's a line in the Quran explicitly saying that no force in religion.",
        "So - but this is not to say that various religions at many - at various times in history have not broken their own commandments.",
        "Certainly Christian armies, Muslim armies, other armies have done the same.",
        "But, essentially, that is not considered to be a correct form of Islam.",
        "One of the great tensions between the East and West to this day are those series of military expedition known as the Crusades.",
        "Do you think Europeans would have been eager to be traveling to that part of the world had not the Holy Land been held by what they regarded as infidels?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "That's really a fascinating question, because I think the Crusades, in our eyes in the West, are the sort of preeminent example of cultural conflict.",
        "But, you know, it's interesting that Jerusalem fell to Muslims sometime in the 7th century, and it was only about 500 years later that suddenly, they decided in Europe to have Crusades over the whole thing.",
        "And this was when Europe found itself with mercenary armies that had used to be fighting against German barbarians and others, for years were marauding all over the place, and the pope needed to get all of this energy and - out of the way.",
        "So there were economic and there were political and there were cultural and social reasons for that Crusade to start."

        "But hey, we talked about Islam as a banner.",
        "Christianity was a glorious banner for what ended up being an invasion of the East, establishment of city-states run by Christians, and even the sacking of Christian Constantinople itself at that time.",
        "So, you know, you can easily take Islam out of that and find pretty similar events.",
        "And indeed, in the course of human events, you argue that had Islam not been there, the Western, in their interests - or what they regarded as their interests - would have found something else to crusade about.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you know, when you start moving outside of Europe for areas to conquer, you can only go east to Russia, and Europeans did.",
        "Or they could go south and east to the Middle, and that's why this area has been a classic grounds of clash between East and West.",
        "But I think Western, you know, expansionism, the whole colonial and imperial movements in the 18th, 19th century, all of that would have gone on.",
        "Europeans didn't care whether they were invading and taking over Christian countries, Buddhist countries, Muslim countries, whatever.",
        "They went there and colonized and ran them and created huge legacies of resentment and sparking wars of national liberation.",
        "So nothing special - specially religious there, except again, Islam was a great banner for many Muslims who were struggling against French or English or Dutch or other forms of foreign European imperialism.",
        "And you focus on the Western depredations into Islamic lands.",
        "Nevertheless, this does cut both ways.",
        "And today, we're setting a new target of helping six million people get treatment by the end 2013.",
        "But apart from that, it was mostly the other way around.",
        "The West by then was getting much stronger and able to send its armies there.",
        "And, you know, Neal, in terms of violence, it's interesting to consider, the really most hideous killings of human beings in the history of humanity took place in the 20th century and largely driven by Europeans, who started World War I, World War II, picked these conflicts all around the world, Marxism and Leninism, Hitler, Stalin, you know, not even any religion in all of this, was - much of it, it was atheist imperial drive in which millions, you know, maybe up to 100 million people killed in all of those events.",
        "So...",
        "Including some in the Middle East, though both conflicts, the Middle East was something of a sideshow.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "I mean, the Europeans carried their war to the Middle East and wanted various states to line up with them against the Germans or against later in the Cold War against the Russians.",
        "But, you know, you're hard put to find anything remotely in the annals of Islam that show the numbers of people butchered, as were butchered by the 20th in the 20th century by Western Europeans."
