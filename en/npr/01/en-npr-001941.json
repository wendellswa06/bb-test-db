        "One of the many legacies of Western imperialism was not only to conquer and occupy and control most of the rest of the world for long periods of time but to redraw the boundaries, and that is - those are that has created problems and legacies we're still living with.",
        "I mean, the Arab world in particular was divided up very, very artificially, along lines that were more reflective of agreements between British and French interests than they were with the populations who lived there or the ethnic or tribal makeup of it.",
        "So that is what the region is still studying(ph) - somewhat artificial states, and then run by dictators who were established by the West who are perceived as pro-Western and pliable to Western interests.",
        "So that's still a burning issue and has not changed in a number of Middle Eastern countries today.",
        "And I'm not going to argue with that, but to go back just a little bit further, it's important not to overlook the effect of the previous empire in the region, that's the Ottomans.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "The but - and it's interesting that the major region in which opposition came to the Ottoman Empire was in the Balkans, and that was an area that was largely Christian, either Orthodox or Catholic, and they didn't get along, by the way, particularly well.",
        "But in terms of the broader Muslim world, there was not a great deal of revolt.",
        "There were periodic dissatisfactions, but most Muslims felt that they were part of a greater empire, Muslim empire, one of the biggest in history.",
        "So they were fairly content to be part of it.",
        "Later on nationalism developed.",
        "You had Arab nationalism, Turkish nationalism.",
        "These are Western ideas that I'm not sure have really helped the region to unify when you have ethnic groups at each others' throats.",

        "Now, this is a God-given event for Osama bin Laden, who saw these wars as the quickest way to get, to win support of the local population in this so-called struggle against American imperialism.",
