        "Mr. Fuller, my question is what is your theory on if Islam didn't exist, would 9/11 still have happened?",
        "Well, that's - you know, when we get into these what if questions, it's hard to get specific answers.",
        "But I do struggle with that issue a little bit in the book and argue that if you still keep all of these other grievances - the colonialism, the imperialism, the support of foreign - the support of dictators that are not - that are hated by the region, efforts to control oil, seize oil, control the price of oil, to invade, to overthrow regimes we don't like, the whole Arab/Israeli problem and ignoring that issue, one after another after another.",

        "It was really only a matter of time before something snapped and they started taking the war to us.",
        "But that was the first time it happened, and that was an incredible shock.",

        "Mr. Fuller, when you were talking about humanity and the amount of atrocities committed by the crusaders, you should also reveal(ph) the fact that the Muslims came to India and they massacred and killed millions over there.",
        "The very one(ph), Hindu Kush Mountains, where they are fighting right now, comes from the term used by the Muslims to describe the millions of Hindus who died there.",

        "I'm not a Hindu fanatic, by any means.",
        "But if we're talking about history, we have to say that - you know, we have to tell the whole truth, because I quote to you, in India, there are great cities that were pillaged for six months by Muslim hoards and (unintelligible) and looted and raped and whatever you can think of the crusaders - these guys did in India.",
        "I think your listeners should know that there is a lot of history behind the animosity towards Muslims even today in India and Pakistan, as you guys know.",

        "But you're right.",
        "I mean, I think every ethnic group or religious group in much of the world can point to some very ugly incidents in their history when foreign armies came in and killed and pillaged.",
        "But it's interesting to note that in most of the areas where Muslim - Islam, by the way, is spread mostly through trade and missionaries through a long, softening-up process rather than it was by the sword.",
        "In the early days of Islam, Arabs didn't want other people to convert to Islam because they wanted these privileges for themselves.",
