        "Well, I find it interesting we're talking about increasing troop levels when the biggest problem that we've had in the past six years has been a lack of adequate diplomacy.",
        "I mean, sending in troops is really your last option.",
        "Unfortunately, we have become a country, an administration that chooses to go the military route first rather than diplomacy.",
        "And so it needs to be a double conversation because that's really one of our greatest problems.",
        "I know folks are out there trying to float this whole notion of a draft, and I'm telling you right now, that is not going to happen.",
        "If they try to institute a draft in this country again, I think you're going to see the kind of revolt that both parties does not want to see.",
        "There's an absolute limitation on how many people can be persuaded to volunteer for the military service.",
        "If you read some of the poignant stories of people who did volunteer, 18- and 19-year-olds and the like, they're doing it because they believe that in fact if we have to go over there to fight the Iraqis because they came here on 9/11, which is not true of course, or they will come here, there are only so many people who believe that, which is why it's so hard to recruit people, no matter how much they pay them, what incentives they give them.",
        "So the United States is going to be forced to find some military force somewhere else from some other country that they can use to in fact help to go off on these adventures, or we are going to be reduced to trying to use multilateralism and diplomacy more than we have right now.",
        "One last speed round question.",
        "This is about undocumented immigrants who are trying to go to college.",
        "They can't, under federal law, get financial aid, but now some lawmakers in Congress have developed something called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act or the DREAM Act.",
        "It would allow undocumented students who arrive before they turn 16 and have lived here at least five years to become temporary legal residents and eligible for college aid.",
        "With immigration such a divisive topic, does this DREAM Act have a fighting chance and should it, Professor Berry?",
        "It is not going to pass.",
        "It doesn't have the chance of a snowball in hell.",
        "And also the point should be made there's a lawsuit in California right now from out-of-state American students suing because the University of California admits undocumented students with in-state tuition.",
        "And they're complaining, `Why should people who are undocumented pay in-state when we're paying out-of-state?",
        "And there are lawsuits that are being developed in other states that have this.",
        "So the bill isn't going to pass and the problem in the current environment that we have will not, but it ought to.",
        "There--something ought to be done because these people are here, they're going to be here, they have potential, we're not going to stop them from coming, and it's in the national interest to educate them.",
        "Marcelo?",
        "I agree.",
        "And furthermore, really these children are not going anywhere.",
        "These children, these youths who come to the United States often not really knowing that they don't have the papers to be in our country, these children are going to grow up to be citizens of the United States one way or another, let's face it.",
        "They're not going anywhere.",
        "They're not going back to Mexico, they're not going back to El Salvador, they're not going back to Jamaica, they're not going back to Nigeria.",
        "This is really the human face of a failed migration policy.",
        "We have hundreds of thousands of undocumented alien children and youth in our schools today and many of these children are facing very dim prospects as they make the move to college or to the labor market.",
        "Roland, very briefly, what about Mary Frances' point that, you know, black students will say, `What about me?'",
        "Well, I'm not even looking at it from a perspective of what black students will say.",
        "This is indeed what happens.",
        "This--I mean, the children are having to deal with the sins of the parents.",
        "And that is that illegal immigration.",
        "I don't think it's going to pass.",
        "I mean, you're not going to find huge supporters of illegal immigration in the United States Congress.",
        "But again, this is what happens when you have illegal immigration.",
        "And so this is the back end.",
        "If you don't address the front end, this is the story that we're going to be telling 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now.",
        "All right.",
        "In Chicago we have had Roland Martin, executive editor of the Chicago Defender; in New Orleans, Louisiana, Mary Frances Berry, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania; and Marcelo Suarez-Orozco, co-director, immigration studies at New York University in East Hampton, New York.",
        "Thank you all so much."

        "Yeah.",

        "This lawsuit in documents filed recently as part of civil suits in Oklahoma and Massachusetts have revealed a lot of new details about how the Sacklers ran Purdue.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Now, as Purdue sold more and more opioids, the Sackler family transferred more and more and more wealth to their personal accounts.",
        "And as the lawsuits have piled up against the Sackler family and Purdue for their roles in this crisis, they continue to move funds into trusts and, yes, offshore accounts to be out of the reach of any potential recovery.",
        "So in this lawsuit, New York is now saying they're going after the Sacklers' vast private wealth, seeking damages and penalties that could run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.",
        "And how has the Sackler family responded to this latest lawsuit?",
        "Well, the Sacklers sent NPR a statement saying they strongly deny these allegations and will defend against them.",
        "They say drugs like OxyContin provide life-changing relief for millions of pain patients who need it.",
        "And they added this quote.",

        "It names other companies that made and sold and distributed opioids around the country and around New York.",

        "This is really typical, you know, the sort of cliche for this is, it's called affinity fraud.",
        "But, you know, people - with all of the shenanigans on Wall Street, with all of the volatility in the market, the unpredictability, I think people are beginning to feel more comfortable with someone who is tangible, who lives where they live, even if they know very little about their actual track record or experience.",

        "Right.",
