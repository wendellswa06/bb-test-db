        "There's a sociologist you talk to in the book, Shin Wang, who's going on a project to talk with Mexican mothers in St. Louis.",
        "And you write that, in fact, she came to the realization that she was thinking about - she's trained to go into the field and getting access, the start, the incredibly important part - because, obviously, you can't have a project if you can't get access to people to tell them your stories, a little like journalism.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, from the very start, she was thinking about: And how do I leave?",
        "Yes, she's an anthropologist, right?",
        "And most of us, including me - I mean, when I was trained as a sociologist, moving out into the field, we were so focused on the entry, on gaining access, on figuring out a way to get people's permission to hear their stories and to tell their stories, we didn't think at all about saying goodbye and the responsibilities of saying goodbye and the sort of moral and ethical code, or even what the sort of scientific and empirical responsibilities were around authenticity or validity in saying goodbye.",
        "And so she - but she realized once we began to talk that as soon as she went there and met the first Mexican-American mother and began to hear this woman's stories, and this woman was immediately sort of trusting of her, that she was feeling the heaviness of leaving, that even in the very beginning, she was worried about how she was going to say goodbye.",
        "And came up with, I thought, a pretty elegant solution.",
        "Right.",
        "She really realized that - she was there for four years.",
        "And she decided to show a copy of her work, her documents of their interviews, to the women - and remember that documentation for them must have been incredibly important for this particular group of mothers - and let them read their stories.",
        "She also began to have conversations that were much less formal where she revealed parts of herself, so that it became a more symmetric relationship.",
        "And so when she said goodbye, they knew more about her than they'd known before, and she knew something about them.",
        "We're talking with Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot, the author most recently of \"\"Exit: The Endings That Set Us Free.\"\" We'd like to hear from you about exits and how they may have surprised you in your life, some of those vivid moments we've been describing.",

        "Yeah, I just wanted to say I've always been - I've never been a rude person, but I've always, like, kind of downplayed the formality of hello and goodbye, good morning, what have you.",
        "And my brother passed, it's been over 10 years, but I just recall the last time seeing him.",
        "We had gone out for pizza, and he said goodbye to me, and I was watching TV or playing a video game at the time.",
        "I didn't kind of - I didn't look up to really see him or acknowledge him.",
        "I said goodbye verbally, but I never made that eye contact that last time.",
        "And that's always stayed with me, and it's always kind of altered, like, subsequently altered the way I kind of view the hello and goodbye and the formality of it.",
        "I just wanted to share.",
        "Yeah, that's actually - thank you very much.",
        "That's a lovely story, and it makes the connection, too, between the sort of small, ordinary, everyday goodbyes and how important it is to connect with those and to almost ritualize those because I do think that paying attention to them, naming them, reframing them as important has a lot to do with the larger goodbyes.",
        "And in that case, of course, the small goodbye became a very, very large goodbye, momentous goodbye.",
        "And the feelings that you still have about it, Tunde, that suggests that this has preyed on your mind, in a way.",
        "Yeah, it has.",
        "I think about it at least once a month.",
        "Subsequently, he actually committed suicide after.",
        "And then when they wheeled him away in the hospital that last time, I reflected on to the last time I didn't say - didn't make that eye contact.",
        "And so it's - I don't know.",
        "It's always just - it was always a defining moment in my life, you know, the whole lack of saying goodbye appropriately and acknowledging him, looking him in the eyes.",

        "So, obviously, this was not your decision to leave the job.",
        "No, it was not.",
        "But still, it was - it came as a shock, and like I said, there was controversy behind it.",
        "But still, there's - no one really stepped - well, I can't say no one.",
        "But for the number of people, it was just kind of like everybody else just kind of woke up and moved on except for these choice few people who really went to bat for me.",
