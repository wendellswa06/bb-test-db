        "Yes.",
        "Oh, that's such a wonderful story.",
        "And I think it's wonderful partly because it's talking about how this is embodied, something about the body knowing and feeling and experiencing, again, an opportunity to make an exit that is noticeable, that's clear, where people can surround you and support you through what is, you realize after it, an extraordinary sense of loss and bereavement.",

        "Thirty days before I was about to get married to somebody who I definitely compromised myself for, I left and I said goodbye because I knew that if I stayed and didn't say goodbye to that, that I was going to live this life as a person who always accepted compromise and was less than the woman I knew I could be.",
        "So it was almost like goodbye to this life that I had as a girl, and I became a woman.",
        "It was so distinctive that day.",
        "And every relationship from that day on that I brought into my life completely changed, even the relationships I have with my family.",
        "So it's a pretty incredible transformation and experience to have.",
        "So obviously a very difficult decision.",
        "But once you'd made it, do you remember the exact moment?",
        "I remember the exact moment.",
        "And I just - it was almost as if this person came - this inner self came out and looked at me straight in the eye and said, do you want to continue to be this person, or do you want to be the person that everybody knows that you are, but you've been just too afraid to be?",
        "And I just am done, and I said goodbye.",
        "It was right then and there I said goodbye, and I left.",
        "And ever since then, like every single relationship I've brought into my life has been one full of respect and happiness that I've chosen to have in my life.",
        "And like I said, even my family relationships became better from that day and all the people around me.",
        "It was almost like I took on this whole new respect for myself, and I approached life with a lot more confidence and assurance of who I was."

        "You know, they kind of go into these marriages where they are compromising themselves and - because I was told.",
        "When I left, so many people came up to me and said that they wish that they had done that and that they didn't have the guts to do it.",
        "And I was really surprised how many people told me that.",
        "You know, that's a wonderful story, and it reminds me of something I talk about a lot in the book.",
        "That is, that our own individual development, the trajectory of our life stories have within them these entrances and exits, you know, that at each time when we are moving into a next stage in our lives, there is this tug of war between moving forward and staying put, between progression and regression.",
        "Eric Erikson, a very famous psychologist, talked about this 50 years ago.",
        "And to move forward to the next level, we need to exit.",
        "So exit is a moment of great propulsion, and I think that's what you experience when you finally said, I need to be the person I know I can be and other people know I can be.",
        "I will not live this life of compromise.",
        "And the other thing that this points out is that your story of exit had reverberations in all of your relationships with your family, with your coworkers with everyone who knew you.",
        "So the ways in which a recognition of the importance of exit has ramifications for your entire community, I think, is also a very powerful notion.",

        "It's nice to be here.",
        "So first, let's talk about Title X.",
        "What is its role in providing reproductive health services, and how is the Trump administration trying to change the program?",
        "Well, the Title X program is now in its 49th year, and it was established to equalize access to modern forms of contraception and to help people both achieve pregnancy and prevent pregnancy.",
        "Last year, the Trump administration introduced a new set of rules, which represent the most consequential changes to the Title X program since it was enacted in 1970.",
        "It changes the rules around how we can speak to patients about their contraceptive care.",
        "It allows providers to select the range of contraceptive methods that are offered and would allow providers to exclude methods that they object to, even if patients are interested in those methods.",
        "And it also limits the conversation that clinicians can have with patients once they have a positive pregnancy test.",
        "Now, President Trump and other Republicans have run on promises to, quote, unquote, \"\"defund Planned Parenthood.\"\" This policy change is an effort to move in that direction, not just for Planned Parenthood but for other groups, of course.",
        "Now, the objection - I covered this issue quite a bit, and the objection from anti-abortion rights groups is that they say that funding for abortion should in no way be commingled or overlapping with other services.",
        "And so I would ask, why couldn't these groups just stop providing abortions or referring patients for abortion?",
        "Well, the Title X program has prohibited use of Title X dollars for abortion care since its inception, and current grantees and some recipients follow very detailed rules that help you demonstrate when you have Title X funds that support family planning services, STI treatment and screening, cancer screening and then any abortion care that is provided in the same organization.",
        "Those rules go down to the very detail of financial reporting, and our grantees report quarterly.",
        "The administration has not been able to document either in the rule, in testimony before Congress or in any public documentation that there is any abuse whatsoever of the prohibition on Title X funds.",
        "And what does this mean for the patients?",
        "It can be very confusing.",
        "And, candidly, it may be invisible.",
        "But I think for many low-income people, they know exactly how much cash they have in the bank, but they're not necessarily tracking the rules.",
        "And one of our great fears is that folks are going to begin to encounter this when a service that used to be available to them is suddenly not available, or they're presented suddenly with a bill.",
        "So I'm concerned, and I think lots of us are concerned that all the decisions and considerations and guidance and coming back and forth between the feds and additionally the litigation that continues that patients won't really begin to feel the impact until they ask for something that is no longer available to them where they live."
