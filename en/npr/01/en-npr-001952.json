        "Because those are always a sensitive area.",
        "So for most biographies, are you saying that they will still be - you will still be able to edit most of them not being a registered user, anyone can do it?",
        "Yes.",

        "Exactly.",

        "You know, I remember this - one of the big splashes that this problem made a few years ago was when members of Congress - their staffers were changing the biography entries of the member of Congress that they worked for, to erase things like divorces and things that they didn't want in their biographies.",
        "And at that time you were just blocking computers from Capitol Hill from being able to make changes at all.",

        "Yeah.",

        "We went from - originally we only had full protection, which meant no one can edit, to semi-protection.",
        "And now we've found a way of doing something even gentler.",
        "We've always been on this trend towards trying to maximize the openness of Wikipedia as a solution to problems and to really carve out protection to really match the problems exactly.",
        "So even though it's not a fundamental philosophical change, I still think it is an important tool.",
        "I think it's going to be very valuable for preventing a lot of the kinds of problems that we're most concerned about, problems, you know, relating to somebody vandalizing an entry and then, you know, the general public sees it before someone gets a chance to solve it.",
