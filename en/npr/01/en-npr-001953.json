        "What's it like for you to be in it?",
        "It's a lot of fun for me to be in it because I tell everybody it's like reliving my life the whole time I'm on stage because back in the '60s I was with a group called the Blossoms and we did a television show called \"\"Shindig!\"\" and they did not want us on the show because we were black.",

        "You know, you have been such a trailblazer, but I didn't know that you were the voice behind \"\"Da Doo Ron Ron,\"\" and those of us old enough remember that, and \"\"He's A Rebel.",

        "You have over the years worked with some remarkable people.",

        "You sang with Elvis and Tom Jones and you sang background on two of what are clearly classic pop hits, and that's \"\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling\"\" and \"\"Unchained Melody.",

        "And so people, you know, we're still down 15 percent from where the market was in October 2007 or where the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in the late 2007.",
        "And so the natural inclination is, if you want to retire and you don't quite have enough to do it, is to try something that will goose your returns just a little bit more.",

        "We should all probably know better than to think we can easily get a 24 percent return a year right now.",

        "You can't lose your principal.",
        "That's a very, very big - a big thing right now, is to tell people that they can't lose their principal even when they really can.",
        "And this problem has roughly doubled over the past year, according to some of your sources.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was remarkable.",

        "And those are the folks who basically are called in to figure out what happens when people lose their money.",
        "You know, they also, if you call them before you invest, will tell you whether someone is actually registered to sell an investment in your state, and whether they've had any troubles in the past.",
        "That's no guarantee either, by the way."

        "Absolutely.",
        "What - how does that work?",
        "Well, what happens is you get this invitation to learn more about how your savings for retirement or a better way to draw a retirement income, something rather vague and seemingly benign.",
        "And, you know, when you get a free meal often at a restaurant that you know and you like, and so you go.",
        "And typically, what happens is that a lot of concepts are presented, which are logical and attractive and appealing and makes sense to people who know a little bit about investing on their own.",
        "And you provide - if you want to learn more, you provide your information, and then you are pitched a very specific investment later.",
        "One case that I looked at was in Missouri, where after a series of these seminars, this one insurance agent sold the exact, same kind of equity-indexed annuity to something like - I think it was 36 out of 37 of the people who had come to, like, three or four of these seminars.",
