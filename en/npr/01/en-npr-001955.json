        "And when you look at how music can touch people and touches people, how much do you appreciate that you've been able to set the soundtrack to many people's lives?",
        "That's a really great feeling for all of us that sing and that we--the gift--'cause I say that our gift is a gift from God, and surely Luther's gift was a gift from God, and he was a very good friend of mine.",
        "And to be able to leave a legacy of `the music touched you, the music did something to your heart, it made you feel good about yourself or good about life'--I think that's the big difference.",

        "If the chlorofluorocarbons are hanging around and acting so quickly like you just showed us, why don't they eat up all the ozone?",
        "Why does the hole break up and re-form every year?",
        "The hole forms because in the winter in Antarctica, without the sunlight, the air gets very cold and the winds go running around this two-mile high mountain of Antarctica, around and around, and they form, if you can envision it, a huge cooking pot where all the chlorine molecules and HFCs, other things collect in the center.",
        "And it's totally dark.",
        "And then it gets coldest just at the end of August and the ice crystals form and the chlorine sits on there.",
        "And then when the sunlight comes, the reaction goes.",
        "And the reaction will go for about only 30 days, and then it'll completely remove, at present, almost all of the ozone in the 10- to 15-mile layer, which is the ozone layer above Antarctica.",
        "And then as the atmosphere warms up, this - the edge of the cooking bowl gets a little bit wavy and soft.",
        "And then all of a sudden, you get this big waterfall of ozone rushing into this open area, the ozone hole, and fills it right up.",
        "And it's just - within - by the end of November, it's actually full and might even be overfull, higher than it was at the start.",
        "Didn't the ozone hole form over the North Pole a couple of years ago?",
        "Yes.",
        "It wasn't really centered on the pole, but in the northern areas.",
        "Yes, it did.",
        "And the same occurrence - and the same principles happened there.",
        "You have ozone at a high layer.",
        "It gets cold.",
        "And sometimes, it gets a little extra cold.",
        "You get these snow crystals forming, PFCs, and then you get exactly the same reaction.",
        "But in the Arctic, the vortex is not quite as strong or not even nearly as strong as in Antarctica.",
        "And because there's no continent, the Arctic is a floating ice mass.",
        "It's an ocean with an ice mass on it.",
        "Antarctica is a huge ice island two miles thick with an ocean around it.",
        "So they're completely opposites.",
        "So the vortex breaks down in the Arctic much easier, and the temperatures are much warmer.",
        "The Arctic is much warmer both on the ground and in the stratosphere than Antarctic."
