        "But all of the ingredients are there.",
        "So if we get more climate change in the Arctic, the heating at - lower, the surface - the stratosphere will get a little cooler.",
        "And if you start depleting ozone, the stratosphere doesn't warm up as much, so it's kind of a self-feeding process.",
        "And you start getting more of these polar stratospheric clouds.",

        "It's an amazing story that the governments of the world listened to the scientists, put together an agreement called the Montreal Protocol, stabilized the production of these chemicals and then reduced them, and the atmosphere started to respond.",

        "And is there an alternative?",
        "I don't think that chlorine gets up into the stratosphere.",
        "And as it's going up, it gets reacted.",
        "The only - one of the main reasons that we have chlorine in the stratosphere is that it's carried up there like - let's use an illustration.",
        "It's carried up in, say, a train.",
        "And then once it gets up there, it can be released.",
        "But if you release actual chlorine as a molecule at the surface, it has no way of getting up there because it's oxidized.",
        "So the only reason that you can get the chlorine into the stratosphere is it's carried up with the chemicals that it's bound up in.",
        "And then once it gets into the stratosphere, the sunlight, which is very bright, breaks off the chlorine...",
        "Thanks, Adele.",
        "...and releases it up there."

        "Is - are there other ways an ozone hole can form totally unrelated to human activity?",
        "Not totally unrelated because the chlorine that is up there is manmade.",
        "But there are other forms of catalysts that can cause the problem, and those are volcanic explosions that put particles up into the stratosphere.",
        "So there's enough excess chlorine in the atmosphere now that, say, for the next 20 to 30 years, if we have a huge volcanic explosion that puts particles into the stratosphere, we could have very large ozone depletions at mid-latitudes and latitudes where people are living.",
        "As you know, in the Antarctic, the ozone hole occurs essentially over this huge ice island or ice mountain, and there's not people and stuff but, yes.",
        "So for the next 20 years, we are very vulnerable.",
        "The volcano that occurred in Iceland a couple of years ago was very, very small and all in the lower atmosphere.",

        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "First time calling in, but wanted to say - ask a general question.",
        "As the ozone gets depleted over the Antarctic and the season changes, everything flows back in, are you depleting the global supply of ozone in this process?",
        "No, because ozone is made and destroyed on a constant basis.",
        "And there's always ozone being produced by sunlight hitting oxygen.",
        "So the total amount, for the most part, is not depleted.",
        "But since the destruction around the world is a little bit higher than the production, there is a slight lessening of ozone, but it's not a huge amount at this point.",
        "Well, I want to thank you very much for taking time to be with us today.",
        "Very interesting, and it's actually our anniversary of 22nd - entering our 22nd year, talking about ozone again and ozone depletion.",
        "Thank you very much, Doctor Schnell."
