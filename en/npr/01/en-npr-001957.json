        "I'm sure everybody wants to know that first.",
        "Yes, well, it was a combination - I personally always loved animals, and so I always read about animals, especially animal behavior and occasionally took courses on biology and zoology.",

        "I'm a bird-watcher, an oyster-raiser.",

        "Now, we did it three years ago, still this question of what is the life of the internet.",
        "It's just a recycling bin of what's in television or things specifically to the Internet will be produced by companies such as the Sundance Channel?",
        "So he wanted to re-do the sundancechannel.com just as something different.",
        "But he thought that short films - and also he reminded me that if you work for the Internet, short - small screens are also something to take into consideration.",
        "And so that gave me the idea of doing these very colorful costumes.",
        "Beautiful.",
        "Yes, with - because I had a friend, two friends, Rick Gilbert and Andy Byers, who are marvelous artists with paper.",
        "And so they created the sort of origami, very complex paper sculptures for my film.",

        "Oh, the spiders.",
        "They are so - when you say spiders, we all have in mind one, but we also know that there are many spiders, and each one of us knows because they've seen small spider, big spider, colorful spider, hairy spiders.",
        "There are so many spiders, and their rituals, their mating rituals, their courtship ritual, can be very, very different.",
        "But a friend of mine, who is actually a specialist of spider, said you can make a difference between two wide categories: the spiders that don't see very well, in spite of the fact that they have many eyes, would rely very much on smell and vibration; but the ones that see very well, those are the spiders that would be very colorful, and they see beyond the range we see.",
        "And so I tried to portray this in the film that now you're going to hear.",
        "Well, here - and it comes across very well, also, but it's such a gorgeous film.",
        "Unfortunately, we only have the sound for it.",

        "My web is vibrating.",
        "Is it a love message, or did I catch a fly?",

        "Yes.",
        "Most of the time, the female spiders are very big and very aggressive.",
        "So the male spider has to have all different sort of strategies not to be taken for a fly or, you know, and eaten.",

        "And how did you decide which one in the animal kingdom you were going to choose?"

        "So I made these categories of animals, and then according to the science I understood, and according to how beautiful we can portray these animals with our paper sculptures, that was the ultimate decision.",

        "Well, when - the Sundance Channel really commissions me groups of seven to 10 films.",
        "They are about a minute and a half each.",
        "And the first group we did were under the name of \"\"Green Porno\"\" because the Sundance Channel had so many programs about green - green house, green food, green transportation.",
        "So it was obviously that mine would be called \"\"Green Porno.",
