        "(Through interpreter) I'm calling out from here to those in America.",
        "It is a pity that you chose a pastor over your strategic partner in NATO.",
        "This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News.",
        "I'm Rachel Martin.",
        "On the surface, Norman Rush's new novel is about a middle-aged man, Ned, who has been reunited with a group of college friends after one member of the group has passed away unexpectedly.",
        "But what transpires over the next few days ahead of the memorial service is less about Ned's relationship with these men and the heady self-absorbed days of yore, and more about how Ned sees himself.",
        "In his third, much anticipated novel, Norman Rush takes the reader inside the most intimate parts of relationship - between Ned and his wife, between Ned and his deceased friend and between Ned and his own expectations.",
        "Norman Rush joins me now from our studios in New York City.",
        "Thank so much for being with us, Mr. Rush.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So, this is probably an annoying question to you.",
        "But I understand this took you a while to write - almost a decade.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yes.",
        "And the explanation is actually pretty simple.",
        "The book kept escaping from my control.",
        "I am afflicted with the - I guess you'll call it - compulsion to say everything.",
        "But I decided that I had made a promise to my wife to do something unheard of for me, which was to write a concentrated piece of writing, a distillation and not consume these years in herculean struggle.",
        "But it didn't work out that way.",
        "The book got over 400 pages twice.",
        "It brought me to my knees one evening and I sought her forgiveness first and then her help and we together reduced it to its essentials and ultimately at 236 pages, I believe it is.",
        "This was a big process - as you said - distilling everything, all the ideas percolating in your head, distilling all of that down into a concise narrative with a few characters.",
        "Why Ned, why his wife Nina, why the circumstance of a friend's funeral?",
        "I wanted to write about friendship.",
        "And I discovered when I started reading around in this subject that there is not actually a lot of first-rate literary fiction that concerns male friendship.",
        "And I wanted to contrast the kinds of friendship that exist within a marriage and what masculine friendship is.",
        "I wanted to look at it in a deep way.",
        "The central relationship, the central male relationship is really between Ned and his friend who has passed away, Douglas.",
        "Can you describe who is this man Douglas and what was Ned's relationship with him like?",
        "Well, Douglas is one of these characters who turns up who has what you might call limited charisma, or charisma limited to a particular circle of people, but with ambitions for it to be broader.",
        "And it's effective in the case of those people.",
        "Ned - and the others too in each of their own ways - were susceptible to the opposition persona presented.",
        "Douglas was the charismatic in this group of friends.",
        "And they'd all kind of - is it fair to say - they'd kind of fallen under a spell."

        "She is desperately trying to conceive a child.",

        "Well, the problem for Nina with Ned is that he's been brought along to the point of being willing to do it.",
        "But she wants him to want to do it and that means embracing the possibility of the child living in a decent world, a happier world, a better world, a world that would be nurture and decent.",

        "You have been married a really long time - more than 50 years, right?",
