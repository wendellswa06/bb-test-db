        "The Republican Party has not been doing well, and of course with the momentum seemingly going in Murphy's direction, Republicans kind of were happy.",
        "Well anyway, we'll go more in-depth on the New York 20th later in the broadcast.",
        "In the meantime, we have some people who think they know the answer to our trivia question: Who was the first NBA, former NBA professional basketball player to be elected to the House of Representatives, and let's start with - this is Jim(ph), Jim calling us from Elkins Park in Pennsylvania.",
        "Yes.",
        "Would that be Bill Bradley?",

        "Oh, now you're confused.",
        "We got another one, this from Ken(ph) in Pittsburg who also says Mo Udall.",

        "Well, we'll take these under advisement.",

        "If they're only counting 400, it gets very tough for Norm Coleman.",
        "You need like 57 percent.",
        "Coleman needs to win 57 percent of the votes that are about to be counted for him to surpass that 225.",
        "So except it may not be over then.",
        "Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, says that when the three-judge panel rules, which will probably be on April 7th, it's very possible that the Democrats will declare yes, Al Franken is the next senator, but Ben Ginsberg, who's the attorney for Norm Coleman, has said we are going to the state supreme court.",
        "You are disenfranchising, you know, thousands of legitimate voters.",

        "This is regarding the sale of a home, I believe, and while, you know - except that everybody will look at the headline, saying one more Obama Cabinet official has tax problems.",
        "And again, it's just, you know, more embarrassment, more damaging stuff for the Obama administration.",
        "The size of the mistake or the, you know - may not be a big thing, but again it's the headlines that matter."
