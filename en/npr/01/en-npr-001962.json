        "He was found guilty just before election day, a race that was tight as a tick up there in Alaska - he barely lost - and now the Justice Department has admitted prosecutorial misconduct and it's dropped the charges.",
        "It's remarkable.",
        "A lot of people, you know, NPR broke that story, Nina Totenberg broke that story, and when she did, a lot of people thought it was an April Fool's joke because they couldn't believe it was true.",
        "And of course, this is very interesting because it was the Republican, well with quotes around it, \"\"Republican Bush Justice Department\"\" that brought the case against Ted Stevens.",
        "And of course, had they not brought this case and had he not been indicted and later convicted, it's very possible that Ted Stevens would still be in the Senate today.",
        "I just wanted to let you know, I put a little, a note on my political junkie blog today that the Justice Department has also thrown out the results of the 2008 Alaska Senate race and that Mark Begich, the Democrat victor, is very upset.",
        "That was an April Fool's joke.",
        "That was the April Fool's joke.",
        "Okay, just to make that clear because you got some hostile reaction.",
        "Mostly from this building, yes.",
        "Mostly from this building.",
        "I can understand that.",
        "In the meantime, polls show that while President Obama's policies are having some difficulty - not only with Congress but some with the American people - he himself remains very popular.",
        "It reminds me - those exact words - that's exactly what they said about Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, that personally he's very popular, but a lot of people are having problems with his policies.",
        "Now, there's a lot of questions about whether President Obama has done the right thing regarding Rick Wagoner at GM and how to deal with the auto industry, compared to what they've done to the banking industry and the insurance industry."

        "And - all right, we'll take this argument from two sides.",

        "Well at this point, they don't want to settle for a moral victory, but I do think they've got a moral victory, at least, on their hands.",
        "This is a district that was literally designed for Republicans to win.",
        "It was sort of gerrymandered, created for a GOP House seat, and the fact that the Democrats have been able to come in and compete with a complete unknown.",

        "So for us to even tie, we're doing well.",
        "Yeah, well, the question that they are trying to answer is why is it that Chuck Schumer and those folks are starting to win districts like this?",
        "But yes, they are looking for a floor.",
        "They're saying we want to prove that we can now start moving back into these districts where the Democrats were doing better and better and compete again and start winning again.",

        "Brian, first of all, great reporting on the election - excellent job.",
        "I have a question.",
        "There's a discussion that if Tedisco actually wins this race, the Democratic legislature - and they control both the assembly and the state senate - when they redraw the districts in 2010, and New York has to lose a seat, this is the seat that they're going to get rid of if Tedisco wins.",

        "This is - you know, you look at the shape of this district.",
        "It was clearly gerrymandered pretty extravagantly to create a Republican district, and we are going to lose a House seat here after the census.",
        "And so, there was some theory that that was why the Democrats initially didn't throw much weight behind this race and only sort of charged in after Scott Murphy began to really build momentum.",
