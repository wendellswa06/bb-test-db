        "And I've got to tell you, I just don't know the answer yet to that.",
        "I haven't seen hard numbers on how many of those ballots will be military ballots.",
        "And you know, the Democrats here are also claiming that they're just doing better with those military voters, so that they're not as certain that they would lose that part of the contest.",
        "So that's going to be an interesting set of numbers to see as this next couple of weeks unfolds.",

        "Thank you.",

        "Thanks very much, appreciate the phone call.",
        "And as we look ahead, were there any local issues in this election?",
        "You know, there really weren't, and the reason is that this guy, Scott Murphy, this Democrat, is a complete unknown, and so what he did is he just grafted himself onto Barack Obama's political brand.",
        "He started talking about the stimulus package, just immediately, as if it was sort of the Holy Grail for this district, that this would bring the jobs back and kick-start things, and Jim Tedisco obliged.",
        "He said okay, let's talk about that national stuff.",
        "And you know, really look.",
        "The unemployment in many parts of this district is over 10 percent already.",
        "So the recession has hit hard here.",
        "The national economy is the issue that voters seem to be concerned about.",
        "So I guess you can sort of say that the national is the local.",
        "And how was turnout?",
        "Huge, 150,000.",
        "I think that people were simply shocked.",
        "I think there had been a lot of predictions that this would be, you know, pretty sleepy and that the person who sort of turned out their grandmother and their cousins would win this election, and instead, all across the district, turnout was very heavy."

        "Brain Mann?",
        "The Republicans moved very aggressively to make sure that state police were literally picking up the boxes of ballots as the polls were closing.",
        "They just called it a preventative measure, and you know, they are carefully going back through some of those ballots already today.",
        "But I think it does sort of presage the litigation that's very likely to follow here, if this remains as close as it appears now.",
        "Everybody's lawyering up here, and so you know, the kinds of post-election court fights that you're seeing now in Minnesota - very likely that that kind of thing is brewing here.",
        "Is there any kind of colorable claim that there was some mishandling going on, or is this just a preventive measure?",
        "I've seen no allegations specifically about any kind of misdeeds here yet, but it's early.",
        "And let me just read something that Jim Tedisco said after the election was over - the voting stopped.",
        "In an email he sent out: We need to raise as much money as possible in the coming days to stop Nancy Pelosi and the national Democrats from stealing this election with a lot of lawyers and dirty tricks."
