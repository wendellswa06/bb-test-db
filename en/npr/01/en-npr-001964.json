        "But before he left, a lot of politics surrounding his announcement about the auto industry in Detroit.",
        "Well, exactly right.",
        "There are some people who say that the way he treated the auto industry is almost like punitively, especially given the fact that it affects so many workers in Ohio and Michigan and states who were very crucial to his election, compared to the folks at AIG or the banks and things like that, which almost got, you know, got as much money and much help as it could.",
