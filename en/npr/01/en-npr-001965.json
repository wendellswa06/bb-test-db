        "So this planet has an extremely eccentric orbit.",
        "The orbit looks more like that of a comet than what we would normally think of for a planet.",
        "It spends most of its time - it takes 111 days to go around its star.",
        "It spends most its time about 80 million miles from the star.",
        "That's about not quite the distance from the sun to the earth in that system, but then every 111 days, it comes screaming through for a very, very close encounter with its parent star.",
        "It comes to about 3 million miles from the surface of the star and during that time, if you're sitting on this planet, if you're floating above the hot surface, the hot gaseous surface of this planet, then you see the star filling something like a thousand times the area their own sun occupies in our sky, and so there's this brief period which lasts for a few hours of just tremendous heating on one hemisphere of the planet.",
        "So, it's like zipping around the star like a comet.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And in that brief time, the temperature is skyrocketing.",
        "Yeah, so this temperature on the hemisphere of that is getting the brunt of the stellar radiation.",
        "It turns out, and we observed this, it spikes from roughly 980 degrees Fahrenheit all the way up to more than 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "So, it kind of goes from a really hyper oven cleaning temperature up to sort of a natural gas flame temperature in a matter of hours.",
        "So it goes, you know, sort of it's an out of the frying pan into the fire kind of situation on this planet.",
        "That's a new definition of global warming.",

        "How did you discover all of this happening on that planet?",
        "Well, the planet has been known since 2001.",
        "The planet was discovered using this technique that astronomers have used to discover many planets around the stars, the Doppler Wobble method, and the Doppler Wobble method shows you what the orbital period is and what the orbital shape is.",
        "And we realized that the shape was so extreme and that this close encounter with the planet was so intense that the brewing storm on the surface should be visible using the Spitzer Space telescope, and so we're able to schedule the telescope to have a look.",
        "What would the storm look like if, you know, we could see it?"

        "Well, if you were looking at this planet from a safe distance, you would see a blindingly bright crescent, and the crescent would have sort of a bluish cast.",
        "The starlight that hits the planet- the red and the yellow light tend to be absorbed, and the blue light is reflected.",
        "And then on the night side of the planet, the temperature is so hot that it would be glowing like red hot coals.",
        "So, if you've ever seen pictures of Jupiter, it has those sort of turbulent storms, and this would look something like that except that the storms themselves would be glowing with their own heat.",
        "And this is a gas giant.",
        "It's a gas giant.",
        "Yeah, the planet is roughly the same size as Jupiter and it has about four times the mass of Jupiter.",
        "Is it rotating quickly?",
        "It is rotating, not that quickly.",
        "Jupiter rotates in about 10 hours and this planet takes about 34 hours probably to rotate on its axis.",
