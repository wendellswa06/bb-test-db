        "Did I get that right?",
        "Hi, yes, Bartlesville.",

        "Well, we're definitely not winning.",
        "There are some critical things that we need to do to get this right in the next months.",
        "So it's very clear that the entire region is in crisis and interconnected in that crisis.",
        "It seems to me that the war, as the president has described it, has been continually in military terms.",
        "And there's nobody out here who believes that there's any resolution militarily.",
        "This has to be done diplomatically and politically.",
        "And hopefully, in the next days, we can get the diplomacy in place that brings together the kind of coalition that can resolve the differences between Shia and Sunni.",
        "What about this idea of a surge in American troops - another 15,000 or maybe 30,000 American troops to be sent to Iraq and, specifically, Baghdad for a period of six or eight months at least?",
        "If a surge is unaccompanied by the kind of political resolution that I've just described, it would be a catastrophic mistake.",
        "You can put another 100,000 troops into Iraq and it's not going to make a difference without resolving the fundamental differences between the stakeholders.",
        "This is a power struggle.",
        "It's a power struggle between Sunni - who run the country for years and now aren't - and Shia - who were oppressed for years and now have won at the ballot box where they could never win before.",
        "So it's a question of how you get one side to get what it can't win at the ballot box, and the other side to give up when it won in a sufficient level that you can find some accommodation.",
        "If you can't do that, you're going to see, I think, a lot of killing for some period of time, and possibly even a full-scale civil war.",
        "You've just met with Syria's president Bashar al-Assad.",
        "Of course, there have been suggestions that the United States might try to get Syria to help out in some way with Iraq.",
        "Did you raise that with President Assad?",
        "And if so, what was his response?",
        "I was here with Senator Dodd, and we had a long discussion about that, a long discussion about all of the interconnected issues - Lebanon, al-Qaida, and Iran.",
        "And the fact is I think there are very real possibilities that Senator Dodd and I will certainly relate to the administration that we think that could follow up on and they could conceivably elicit some greater cooperation.",
        "I believe that possibility is real.",
        "And I think that they certainly spoke clearly, definitively and specifically about the ways in which they're prepared to do (unintelligible) with respect to Iraq and how important they think it is that there be a regional-wide effort.",
        "Senator, you know that another Democratic senator, Bill Nelson, was in Syria just a couple of weeks ago.",
        "After that visit, there was kind of pronouncement from the White House that it was not helpful to have U.S.",
        "Senators speaking to the Syrian government, that this might confuse things in some way.",
        "And I just wondered what your reaction is to that.",
        "I emphasize to you, as we did to the administration, that I met with Secretary Rice before I left.",
        "But, you know, we are separate and co-equal branch of government.",
        "We have important responsibilities to our constituents -the American people - for foreign policy.",

        "He learned to climb in the Cascades and guided there for many years as he gained the skills that would make him the first American to climb all 14 of the world's tallest mountains - climbed them without oxygen.",

        "Mount Hood is not quite as high, but the conditions there are extremely challenging.",
        "We've got glaciers.",

        "Is it fair to call him a fixer?",
        "You know, I think that he handled a lot of matters for Donald Trump before he was - before he became the president that were difficult and sensitive issues.",
        "Michael's role at the Trump Organization was not really that of a lawyer.",
        "One Trump Organization - senior Trump Organization official pointed out that when the legal department at the company had a meeting, Michael was not included.",
        "He was not part of the legal department.",
        "He didn't really practice law there.",
        "In fact, when the government was arguing with Mr. Cohen's lawyers over issues of whether or not material seized by the government in a search warrant were privileged, the government indicated that an examination of his emails - they previously had a search warrant for his emails that had been secret until it was revealed in the course of that litigation.",
        "But that an examination of his emails indicated both that he conducted little to no legal work for President Trump or for The Trump Organization.",
        "And it also pointed out that he never emailed with Mr. Trump.",
        "But I think Mr. Trump is not a big - not a big emailer.",
        "And Mr. Cohen has had his brushes with the criminal justice system before, hasn't he?",
        "Well, I don't think it's fair to say that he has.",
        "I think that there are many people around him who have, ranging from members of his family to myriad business associates - associates of his in the taxi business.",
        "When he first got out of law school and started working as a personal injury lawyer in, I think, 1992 or 1993, the first job he took was with a personal injury law firm where the named partner was arrested on bribery charges within a year or two of Michael having arrived there.",
        "Now, Michael was a junior associate.",
        "You know, I wouldn't want to imply that somehow that related to him, but that was the first known instance of many that followed of Mr. Cohen being around or being involved with people that got into a lot of legal trouble - other lawyers, business associates and so forth.",
        "In the 30 seconds we have left, is he - is Michael Cohen in a position to know a lot about Donald Trump and The Trump Organization that they might rather not have the public know?",
        "I think that's right.",
        "But I think we have to make a distinction between knowing a lot that they might not want the public to know to having information that represents evidence that can be used in a criminal prosecution, whether it's of people at The Trump Organization, Mr. Trump's family or Mr. Trump himself, who likely wouldn't be indicted under any circumstances because he's the sitting president.",
