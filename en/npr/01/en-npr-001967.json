        "No, it's a different side each time because the orbital period isn't commensurate with the spin period, but nevertheless, each time it goes by, there is one hemisphere that takes the heat, and then that heat is distributed across the planet over, you know, the next days and weeks.",

        "Well, I wouldn't say it's boiling and bubbling.",

        "Well - so, an interesting thing is that the orbit is quite crazily elongated, and about six days after this close approach, then the planet actually passes between the star and the earth.",
        "And if the orbital geometry is just right, then the planet will actually block out some of the stars light as seen from the earth.",
        "This is called a planetary transit, and this has been observed for about 50 other planets outside of our own solar system.",
        "And so, if this occurs, it blocks out about one percent of the star's light, and it's something actually that amateur astronomers who have their technique down to a fine art can detect.",

        "And then for kids, I think that the NASA sites often have great stuff for kids as well.",
        "So, if you go to nasa.gov, for instance, and just follow the links there, you'll uncover quite a bit of fascinating stuff.",
