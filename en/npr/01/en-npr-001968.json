        "Scott is a smart, but low-key former hospital CEO, a person comfortable with big decisions, but not necessarily big crowds.",
        "It's great to be here.",
        "The - I just want to tell you before I start, I've really enjoyed all of you, just meeting everybody.",
        "After a year in office, Floridians are still getting to know Rick Scott.",
        "He was a virtual unknown when he jumped into the governor's race.",
        "The former head of the nation's largest hospital chain, he spent more than $70 million of his own money to get elected.",
        "Now, the former outsider is Tallahassee's most powerful insider.",
        "Republican lobbyist and fundraiser Brian Ballard worked to oppose Scott in the primary but now has become one of his biggest fans.",
        "He doesn't care about politics, he cares about governing.",
        "It's not just that Rick Scott doesn't care about politics; it's almost a foreign language.",
        "A conservative who was elected with strong Tea Party support, he convened a Tea Party rally to announce his first state budget.",
        "It was a budget that cut billions of dollars from education, the environment and benefits for public employees in a state that was already reeling from the recession and housing collapse.",
        "State Senator Paula Dockery, a Republican, says while the budget pleased the Tea Party, it alienated many others.",
        "He went after police, firefighters, corrections officers, teachers.",
        "And those are large numbers of people.",
        "And they felt that he was more interested in an ideology than in caring about the people who have been protecting us on the streets and teaching our kids.",
        "Scott has some of the lowest approval ratings of any governor, although in recent months, those numbers have edged up slightly.",
        "If Rick Scott is winning over some Floridians, one reason may be his new style.",
        "Gone is the suit and tie - instead Scott now wears open-collar shirts.",
        "And he's begun engaging with the media, even sitting down with editorial boards around the state, something he rejected as a candidate.",
        "Daniel Smith is a political science professor at the University of Florida."

        "He has a distinguished military record.",

        "The VA has some 360,000 employees.",
        "It's responsible for the care of 9 million veterans.",
        "Also, Dr. Jackson is something of a mystery on the big policy question facing the VA, which is how big a role the private sector should play in caring for veterans.",
        "The big veterans service organizations are very concerned about what they see as a push towards privatization.",
        "So they were already going to be some tough questions facing Jackson at his confirmation hearing.",
        "And now we are hearing from senior aides on Capitol Hill of some serious but unspecified allegations that have surfaced.",
        "We may learn more about that in the coming days.",

        "So let me ask you, Gregg Lee in Boston, I'm assuming that you probably think, and the fans in the New England area probably think, that while these trades - Gasol, Shaq, Kidd - they're big, they pale in comparison to the acquisition of Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen to the Boston Celtics.",
        "Well, you know, that's - you know, the Celtics, you know, those acquisitions were at the beginning of the season, so they developed chemistry early in the year, whereas, you know, in the West, it's all reactionary with, you know, the Gasol trade, you know, starting off the chain reaction of the trades.",
        "You know, the one trade we looked at is Jason Kidd going to the Dallas Mavericks.",
        "And you know, it's going to take some time for chemistry to develop - same thing with the Lakers when they get Bynum back and Gasol and Kobe playing all together in that triangle."
