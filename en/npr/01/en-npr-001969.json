        "So, you know, the Celtics, you know, they have a little bit more chemistry, although they've only played for, you know, 40-some-odd games, 40-50 games, they have a little bit more chemistry than the teams who were just acquiring these players in (unintelligible) trade.",
        "And you know, I saw Jason Kidd last night, and you know, it's going to take some time.",
        "You know, he's a point guard.",
        "You are the quarterback of that offense, and if you don't have the flow or, you know, know where your players are best-suited to make shots, then it's going to take some time to get together.",
        "Well, it certainly has been interesting to watch all the trades, but talking about Boston, let me say this.",
        "My producer, Roy Hearst(ph) and I had not an argument but a spirited discussion about whether we should even bring this next topic to the table, because we weren't sure that it was appropriate.",
        "And we bandied it back and forth and back and forth, and in the end we decided we do want to discuss it, and I'm glad that you're on this week, Gregg Lee, because we're talking about the Celtics and black folks and whether black people are traditionally, or have become fans of the Celtics.",
        "Now by way of a little history, we know that the Celtics were - they're the winningest team in the history of basketball, and we knew that they had the baddest white players ever - Cousy, Larry Bird, John Havlicek.",
        "They had Bill Walton.",
        "They had McHale.",
        "They had Danny Ainge going from the '60s through the '80s.",
        "And we know that Boston has had a history of racial intolerance, going back to the '70s and bussing, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "We also know that Magic and Bird hated each other for a while before they finally settled into a respectful friendship.",
        "But with the trade of Garnett and - not the trade, but the acquisition of, well, there was a trade.",
        "Garnett and now with Allen and with Pierce, and they got a whole black team rolling in Boston now.",
        "Are black people embracing the Celtics?",
        "Well, I could probably speak a little bit about that because growing up as a kid in the South in New Orleans, I didn't the Celtics at all.",
        "I mean, just, it just, I didn't like them.",
        "But it's a different time, it's a different NBA than it was 20 years ago.",
        "It was a different Boston than it was, say, you know, 10, 20 years ago.",
        "And I see, you know, see black people supporting the Celtics now.",
        "I see black kids wearing Celtic jerseys and seeing Garnett jerseys around, Paul Pierce.",
        "So it's a different time now than when - between the hated Celtics/Lakers rivalry when people always assume it was black against white, Lakers with all their stars and Celtics with their stars.",
        "So I think it's a different era now.",
        "Well, you know what, Justin, ironically the Celtics were the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.",
        "His name was Chuck Cooper.",
        "That was in 1950.",
        "They were the first to put an all black starting lineup on the floor.",
        "Also, Bill Russell was the first black coach with the Celtics.",
        "So do you think that maybe they got a bad wrap from black people earlier on?",
        "Well, I'm not sure if they got a bad wrap.",
        "I know that as a kid growing up in the 1980s I was taught by my uncle, my dad, to hate the Boston Celtics.",
        "And it's so far ingrained for me here in New York that that's not gonna change.",
        "But really we, it really goes to show how we've evolved, I think, as a nation within the last 20 years or so.",
        "Look, a black man might become President of the United States.",
        "Twenty years ago, Jesse Jackson was running and he had no chance.",
        "So I really feel like perhaps this speaks to a bigger story here, just the way we've evolved as a nation.",
        "But also the Celtics have a black coach in Doc Rivers.",

        "So privately a lot of black people in the '60s were very happy to see an all black team.",
        "What they couldn't stand is that the white players were often elevated above everyone except for Bill Russell.",

        "I think that would really spice up the All-Star game.",

        "Well, I was in my hometown in New Orleans for the All-Star game and I would probably, the NBA All-Star game and the MLB All-Star game, you know, it depends who you talk to.",
        "I like the NBA All-Star game best, but a lot of people like the MLB All-Star game.",
