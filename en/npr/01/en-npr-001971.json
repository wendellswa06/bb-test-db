        "not on Broadway.",
        "Well, I consider it",
        "But its all right near 48th and 8th area.",
        "Legally.",
        "Right, right.",

        "And it was a really extraordinary experience that I didnt actually do until 2000.",
        "But as long ago as 2000, I started thinking about these issues, just because talking to patients, in particular, was a very rich experience, since what Ive been doing since the early 80s is collecting talk",
        "Right.",
        "just really interesting talk.",
        "And when something has happened to someone to compromise their health, they often have a lot to say, and its very interesting to hear.",

        "Is that always the biggest problem?",
        "Its always the hugest problem with all of my work.",

        "Well, yeah.",
        "I think that the overriding theme really is stated in the beginning of the play that its about every single person in that - in the play has something that they love about their life.",
        "Right.",
        "And has a relationship to possibly losing that very thing.",
        "So, I think that this play is about love and death, its about love and loss, its about the resilience of the human spirit, the vulnerability of the body, and the price of care.",

        "Okay, great, okay.",
        "So, this is called - and I give everything a title because I think people deserve to have their sections titled, and this is called Developing Nation.",
        "What I fear is happening is that we are slipping into a health care system that looks very much will look very much, unless it's changed dramatically - like that of a developing nation.",
        "Well, think about it.",
        "This simple fact: The survival projections on a worldwide basis are much higher than they've been in the past.",
        "But those can be radically changed by a couple of significant factors.",
        "One of them, which is preventable, is the epidemic of obesity.",

        "So this is called Toughness.",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "It's not even made.",
        "I didn't even assemble that yet.",
        "You know, obesity in its own right will engender the evolution and development of so many other morbid diseases that it can erode much of the progress thats been made in survival and longevity up until now.",
        "And secondly, we have the emergence of new infectious diseases that challenge us year in and year out.",
        "And those two will make a tremendous a tremendous difference.",
        "The whole focus right now on health care reform is largely an economic one.",
        "But underlying that is a huge set of views and expectations.",
        "The whole difficult challenge, if you will, of rationing or regulating health care is going to have to be a part of the public debate.",
        "We spend a significant portion of our heath care dollars on the last six or eight months of life, right?",
        "That would be all right if it led to success.",
        "But the fact that it simply results ultimately in death, and sometimes with as many complications as benefits, is a really important part of this dialogue.",
        "You know, when I hear the debate go on from members of our Congress, theyll say, well, I dont want you to tell me what my grandmother should get or what my mother should get.",
        "But the reality ultimately is that each of us have to make some decisions about that.",
        "We do it in a way on an individual level, and then we slip into a kind of a slippery slope with one parent or a child or a loved one saying do this, when, in fact, doing it isnt going to result in any true long-term benefit.",
        "What are our expectations of what constitutes reasonable care, at really both ends of the aid spectrum, is going to have to be a part of this public debate because it tracks right back to the economics and what were going to spend.",
        "I think that the discussion has to begin by a significant cultural frameshift which is really quite encompassing.",
        "You know, in addition to being a pediatrician, Im also an oncologist.",
        "There was a study that was done just a couple of years ago that asked if oncologists, how often did they introduce to their patient that they were at the end of known therapy, rare - rarely done.",
        "Rarely does the dialogue take place that, you know, we - we have expended a reasonable, or a reasoned amount of treatment.",
        "And we need to move towards comfort and care.",
        "And I think thats a cultural phenomenon that doesnt exist throughout the world.",
        "I mean, youve traveled the world, Anna, and you know how people talk about death and dying in other societies.",
        "Its different than we do it here.",
        "The kind of discussion that I describe that a doctor may need to have with her or his patient about death and dying may be one that a medical student or even a resident never has organized supervision around.",
        "Shocking, isnt it?",
        "Shocking.",
        "And I think that there are probably at least two or more reasons why this doesnt happen as much as it should.",
        "One is the lack of skill and sophistication.",
        "The other is in some ways a concern that if you begin to move towards that discussion, youre taking away hope from a patient.",
        "And then a third one which is a hard one for me to say, but I think, nonetheless, represents an honest reflection is that it takes a lot of time."
