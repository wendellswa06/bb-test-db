        "And I think the one of the effects of this program will be changing medical education in medicine.",
        "And your work is a big part of our studies.",
        "And I have a question many of us had for you when we saw your show about how you prompt the people with whom you speak.",
        "What how do you invite them to speak with you and what questions do you ask them that elicits these stories?",
        "Well, I try not to ask very many questions, because I think that narrative is an organic sort of a thing that we all have, like breathing.",
        "And part of getting to know who someone is to see how their narrative works.",
        "So in the case of one of the things one of the reasons, in fact, that this project became so interesting to me after I was at Yale, was because I really only had to ask a patient one question to get some of the most beautiful language.",
        "People spoke, they sang, they prayed.",
        "I got hung up by a bull.",
        "Weighed over a ton.",
        "Wasnt a mean bull, but when I hit the ground, I was on my side and he stepped on my left side with two back feet, broke four ribs, L2, L3.",
        "And there was a guy, urologist for the hospital was sitting in the front row when I got stepped on and he came back and he told me, kid, you better go to the hospital.",
        "He said, I bet you ruptured your kidney or your spleen or something.",
        "I said, no, I just broke some ribs.",
        "He said, no, Im serious.",
        "You need to get that checked out.",
        "Im serious.",
        "Im a urologist in a military hospital.",
        "He got on the phone, he called the hospital.",
        "And a civilian can only go to a military hospital if its a life or death situation.",
        "And he called and he told them it was a life or death situation.",
        "I was kind of laughing.",
        "I didnt believe him.",
        "Then they took me to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas and made me piss in a cup.",
        "And I pissed straight red blood.",
        "Then they said they was going to take out my left kidney.",
        "I begged them.",
        "I said, look, you know, Im going to sit here, Im going to ride bulls.",
        "If I only got one kidney, I'd just as soon have two.",
        "So they tried a new deal.",
        "They put a stint in there and they saved half my kidney.",
        "So I got one and half kidneys instead of one.",
        "And them doctors, they get paid a flat rate.",
        "Its not like theyre trying to rape me to make more money to pay their Mercedes Benz bills, whatever they got.",
        "And Ill bet, missie, that most of them guys dont even drive them fancy sports cars like the other doctors do.",
        "Cost me a flat rate, 1,200 bucks.",
        "Yeah, 1,200 bucks.",
        "Flat rate.",
        "Didnt matter if I got a CAT scan or whatever they did to me.",
        "It didnt change when I was in the ICU for six days.",
        "And then they took me to the next level, it didnt change.",
        "I didnt get no doctors bill or nothing.",
        "And I was in there for 11 days.",
        "Everyone pays a flat rate no matter what it is.",
        "And personally, I think, I think we need to go to a deal like that.",
        "And I think and I think I had better doctors there, doctors who really want to be doctors, not these [deleted] these days, just go to college, spend all their parents money going to college, come out and make a killing, dont really give a [deleted].",
        "You tell me a poor doctor and Ill kiss his [deleted].",
        "But well see, well did you take my kidney out?",
        "Yeah, I have insurance I have a family policy for through Blue Cross of Idaho.",
        "Two hundred and sixty bucks a month to cover all of us, like $7,500 deductible, which is stupid.",
        "We dont ever meet that.",
        "I mean, paying all this money and then, you know, because we got to pay $7,500 for them to meet it?",
        "I mean, all they do is rape us.",
        "They its just like all the people got the money.",
        "They rape the poor until they rape the middle class till the middle class becomes poor.",
        "And then theyll start raping the rich.",
        "And I mean, theyre going to break the country, I think.",
        "But basically Im an optimist.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "See, Im an optimist?",
        "Yeah, I mean, you know, when you ride a bull and you do good and you ridin' 'em, I mean, you feel like, you know, there ain't nothing in the world that can probably, you know, beat you up or anything like that, you know, it just be like life couldn't be better, you know?",
        "Like, this is what life is supposed to be.",
        "And it feels - because, you know, theres so much power in it, you know?",
        "If you think about it, we shouldn't be able to stay on top of a bull whos trying to buck ya off, because you know, we weigh like, you know, 150 pounds, you know?",
        "And they weigh like 2,000 pounds, you know?"

        "I mean, it would just be like a big old empty space in me, I think, I mean - be all right, I have my ranch, my cows, but it probably be like maybe even better - maybe even bigger empty space in me than when, well, like my brother died.",
        "I don't know what it'd be like, you know?",
        "It's a pretty big space, but I guess I feel like when I'm done rodeo-ing, it probably be like the day my brother died, you know?",
        "Toughness?",
        "When we was in western Utah, this bull shoved my face right through the metal chutes, tore my face all up, and took five hours to sew me up.",
        "And next day they was going to straighten out my nose.",
        "And I had a rodeo that night so I didn't want them putting me under anesthesia, or however you say that word - I told them to do without it.",
        "And so when they straighten out your nose, they take these two metal rods and shove them up your nose, work their way up and feel like it was going out through my brains and out the top of my head.",
        "And everybody said it should have killed me.",
        "They didn't even knock me out.",
        "I have a high tolerance for pain.",
        "So I guess that'd be toughness.",
