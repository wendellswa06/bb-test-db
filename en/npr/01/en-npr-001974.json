        "It also extends unemployment benefits another two months and prevents a big cut in the fees that doctors get paid for Medicare patients.",
        "And it's all paid for but not with the surtax on millionaires that Democrats had insisted on.",
        "They dropped that demand after Republicans refused to go along with it.",
        "But Republicans would not give up their main condition for extending these provisions, namely an acceleration of the permitting process for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "But didn't President Obama once say that he'd reject any measure to extend the tax cut by including the Keystone pipeline?",
        "What we found out from some of the top experts in the country is that half the time indeed it is the husband who stops being interested in making love.",

        "Now, you did this survey where you got 4,000 responses, but you say, and you're a journalist, and I'm quoting you: Our approach was journalistic rather than scientific.",
        "Why do such a big survey then?",
        "Well, you know, we had to find a self-identified population.",
        "These were folks who said yes, we are in sexless marriages where the husband is the one who shut down physically.",
        "and we couldn't just go to the whole world and find out, pinpoint people who are in this relationship.",
        "We wanted to do in-depth research on these people who said this is our issue.",
        "But I think we also might add to that, we didn't necessarily expect to get more than 4,000 responses to our survey.",
        "We put the survey out there, and the responses started pouring in.",
        "It was like a waterfall of responses.",
        "People were dying to get this off their chest.",
        "Women were embarrassed, ashamed, and they felt that their self-esteem was in the gutter, and men never talk about this, not to their wives, not to their best friends, to no one.",
        "Susan, what were some of the things that you found both on the men's side and the women's side?",
        "Well, the men - the first thing I want to say is that on the women's side, the main reason they gave when we said why do you think your partner or your husband has shut down - the main thing they said, almost 70 percent, was I don't know why."

        "But we suspect that most of these men are saying she is no longer showing any passion, any interest, any positive reinforcement for our love-making - not to say that they're bringing much to the bed, either - and it spills over into anger and recriminations, and what these men do is that they shut down physically, emotionally and verbally.",
        "Susan, what's the process - if you're a woman, and you talk to specifically heterosexual couples in long-term relationships, either married or not married - but if you're a woman and your life partner, the man in your life, just shuts down, how do you even start asking the right questions or going about asking things in a way that actually produces some change as opposed to just, you know, what the heck is going on, you idiot?",

        "The fear of losing her is so tremendous that they're afraid to go that extra step.",
        "One of the things that surprised us a lot was how many women said the sex stopped on the honeymoon or within the first year of marriage, and intimacy often is the reason for that.",
