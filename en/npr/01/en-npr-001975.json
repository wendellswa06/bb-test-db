        "What the switch we have to make in the military is the realization that we're dependent on cyberspace for military operations on air, land and sea and in space, and we cannot effectively conduct out operations in those areas without the cyberspace domain and our military networks.",
        "So they're not just a convenience, they're a necessity, and that means when you have a problem there, the commander in charge of forces ought to be, whether he's in charge of air, land or sea forces, ought to be very worried about his networks and paying attention to their health, are they defended properly, etcetera.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for your call.",
        "And let's go to Chuck(ph) who's calling from San Francisco.",
        "Hi, Chuck.",
        "And so would this be a vote out of conviction or a vote in a way to punish the Republican Party?",
        "In the conduct area, we need to do a better job of training people to point out that anybody in the military who's using a computer plugged into a military network is the same as a gate guard standing in front of a base, protecting the gate.",
        "And if they don't do their job correctly, they can allow someone to intrude on those networks and steal information or interrupt operations.",
        "So training is part of the conduct change, and then we have to hold people accountable.",
        "We haven't done a very good job of that, in my view, for people who don't follow the rules, because we haven't seen it as being that big a deal.",
        "It is a big deal, and we know it will be in the future.",
        "And then in a capability area, that's investment in the technologies to make sure our military men and women have the same kind of technologies available that you can invest in to defend and protect your home computer, to include automatic connections to your Internet service provider that can push antivirus software to you as soon as it's made available electronically, so you don't have to go, as we often do in the military, machine to machine with a disk and upgrade the defenses on the computer.",
        "So we need those capability and technology investments, as well.",
        "Do you know how many times a day there are attempted - attempts to hack into the Pentagon?",
        "Well, into the military networks writ large, there's thousands.",
        "And it's hard to say are they attempts to hack, or are they just a curiosity, someone going to that site just to see what they can find, or is it malicious attacks?",
        "It's hard to parse those until they succeed, but there's thousands attempts a day for unauthorized entry into the military networks."

        "How many times are they successful in a day?",
        "Well, our job is to make them unsuccessful, and often times it's difficult to prove the negative, but we have had cases where we know we have been intruded on, and that's getting back to Tom's point.",
        "We have lost information, and that's important information - not classified, but important to operations.",

        "800-989-8255, or send us an email.",

        "Hi, actually, as I'm listening, I have another question now.",
        "The first question I was interested in is that okay, so if cyberspace goes down, me as a citizen, can I bypass it so I could carry on my day-to-day life?",
        "What are some of your advice?",
        "And then the other question that I thought of, is that, can you guys create a mil-space, where it is only for military use?"

        "General?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, when we talk - and cyberspace was a broad term to basically define the domain that includes the wires and the computers and the servers and the routers, etcetera.",
        "To the caller's first question, he's probably, as I am at home, using the Internet and using the www.com or .edu or .net to business, maybe with your bank, etcetera, or whatever.",
        "And so it would be difficult, I think, to take down the broader Internet, but it may be possible to take down a particular site or service that you're interested in using.",
        "And so here's where, in the Department of Homeland Security, where they need to think about and worry about defending critical infrastructure in the United States of America, our financial systems, our power grids, our transportations, telecommunications systems that are essential to all of our citizens day in and day out.",
        "To the military point, we do have these portions of the cyberspace that we operate in, and the dot-mil, that are both unclassified, that is plugged into the Internet, and we have also classified networks that are more isolated from the Internet.",
        "And so we do do our military operations there.",
        "And the logic to having a military organization operate and defend those is we know, in time of conflict, that we must have those networks available for everybody else to do their operations in the military.",
        "Okay, thanks so much for your call.",
        "We're going to go to Mark(ph).",
        "Mark is calling from Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
        "Hi, Mark, go ahead.",
        "Hi.",
        "General Chilton touched on this a bit, but it seems that the federal government's cyber-security efforts are very fragmented, in that you've got General Chilton at Strategic Command, you've got Homeland Security, Department of Energy, and even within the Department of Energy, when you start looking at electricity-grid security, you've got DOE and FERC and NERC and all these different people talking about it.",
        "Now, something like the energy grid is clearly a military, as well as a civilian, interest.",
        "And I'm wondering first of all, until there's a security czar appointed, and I guess the administration has talked about appointing someone like that, how do you integrate all these efforts, and once a security czar, cyber-security czar is appointed, will General Chilton be reporting to that person, or will there be some kind of a coordinated effort, or will it always between Homeland Security, military, DOE and other groups.",
        "Hi, thanks a lot, Ms. Neary, and good afternoon, General.",
        "I'd very much like to see an effective verifiable regime to prevent a space arms race and the revitalization of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.",
        "Are either both of those on the agenda for the current administration?",
        "Mark asked a very good question.",
        "The first effort to try to do, I think, from a national perspective and get our arms around this and put some serious funding and organizational construct to this was the National Cyber Security Initiative, which was pushed forward in the last year of President Bush's administration and was carried forward in the current administration.",
        "President Obama just had a - one of his first acts was to have a group get together and take a look at how to go forward, and one of the things they are considering is whether or not to have a cyber czar, and you describe."

        "And so it will be interesting to see how that works out in the future.",
        "Again, Department of Homeland Security has had the rose pinned on them for the broader issues with regard to the nation and to Department of Defense for the military networks.",
        "And who's in charge of the electricity grid?",
        "Because I know the Department of Energy seems to be within their purview, but that would also seem to be a Homeland Security issue.",
        "It is, but here - you know, here's an interesting point.",
        "Who's in charge of the energy grid?",
        "A lot of the energy in our country is provided by private companies, and so here's where, you know, you start getting into some issues of maybe why you don't want the Department of Defense doing that type of work directly.",
        "But for sure, at the end of the day, regardless of how we organize, and this gets back to your question of who should be doing what.",
        "At a minimum, we need to be - we need to have robust information-sharing constructs put in place.",
        "Presumably, that's what a cyber-security czar would do, I guess.",
        "I'm not sure exactly what their responsibilities would be, particularly, but I know in the military, what we want to be able to do is share information about - particularly about threats that are coming against any part of the society, because we can anticipate them being brought to bear against us, as well, in the military.",
        "All right, thanks so much for your call, Mark.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let me read you an email, General, from Brian(ph), also calling from Massachusetts, in Hopkinton.",
        "General, could you talk about your international counterparts?",
        "Which countries have appointed counterparts to your role in their governments, and which countries are you hopeful will do so in the near future?",
        "And do you have enough cooperation with key nations to adequately deal with international threats?",
        "There are - cyberspace and threats in cyberspace are being taken seriously by all governments around the world.",
        "I mean, Estonia, obviously, was attacked, and I've had the opportunity to meet with their minister of defense, as he came over and educated us on exactly what happened and how they dealt with that attack.",
        "But many of our key allies and friends as well, beyond Estonia, are also paying close attention to this area.",
        "And I think this is an area we can improve our military-to-military dialogue.",
        "We already do have dialogues at certain levels with - and I've had dialogues with Australia, had dialogues with the United Kingdom, with France on the cyber-issues, but it's one that we're going to want to again share information with our friends and allies because we don't have the corner on all the knowledge here.",
        "All right, let's take another call.",

        "Hi, thank you for taking the call.",
        "My question is, could somebody, and our people at this time, try to come up with a super-virus that they might be able to introduce, either from a foreign nation or via some operative - foreign operative in the United States, that may be tapping directly into cable.",
        "Are there such efforts that you know of that are going on, and is the United States also trying to come up with a super-virus that might disable an enemy upon their attack of the United States?",
        "Well, I don't know about any super-viruses, Vernon.",
        "I would say - in the greater context, remember if a nation-state were to take down, attempt to take down the broader international financial systems or international commerce systems that ride on the Internet, odds are they're injuring themselves as dramatically as they would be injuring the nation they were targeting, whether it be the United States or someone else.",
        "It's possible, and certainly terrorist organizations wouldn't be so concerned about that.",
        "And so that's another area of concern you have to think about is those not aligned with a nation-state, you have a lot to lose by the Internet going down, but maybe you have a lot to gain by creating chaos in other countries, is another threat factor we worry about.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, if that kind of chaos were created by our enemies taking down an important part of our social life, really, or our lives, our economic life, for example, which you were talking - we were talking about a little bit earlier, and we touched on this a little bit earlier, but maybe you can expand on this.",
        "What is the response?",
        "I think that you have said that - I mean, could a nuclear response be part of that?",
        "How aggressive would we be in response to something that we knew was intended to create chaos and to disrupt our lives?",
        "Yeah, Lynn, I think I might have been misquoted on that previous interview there.",
        "What I said in that conversation was, don't - how we respond will be decided by the president of the United States of any attack on the United States of America, and I wouldn't preclude any options for the president ever.",
        "I wouldn't take any options off the table for him how to respond.",
        "If I could change the focus of your question a little bit, I think the real trick and the real challenge for us is to make sure we take the appropriate steps today in changing culture, conduct and fielding the right capabilities to make sure that that eventual - that theoretical attack can't be successful against us.",
        "Now, I know, and being a military person, there's no such thing as the Maginot Line or perfect defense.",
        "So we have to be able to anticipate how we're going to continue to operate under attack.",
        "That's some of the things we learned from Estonia and listening to them, I mean, they were not completely shut down.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "But what about offensive capabilities?",
        "There was a story not too long ago, I think in the Washington Post, about early in the Iraq War, or maybe prior to the Iraq War, there was talk about cyber-attacks on Iraq itself.",
        "And that was considered for a little bit, but then it was decided that may be too widespread.",
        "It may take down systems throughout the region.",
        "And they kind of backed away from doing any cyber-attacks."
