        "Is this something that should be considered?",
        "Do you - should build up an offensive capability?",
        "Tom, I think what we've learned in the history of warfare is that oftentimes the best defense includes a good offense - it's whether that's air, land, sea operations.",
        "And I think the same applies here in cyber space.",
        "So I think we do want to develop those capabilities.",
        "You don't want to just have a (unintelligible) defensive line that just fends off attacks.",
        "In time of conflict, you want to be able to go forward and make them stop, as opposed to just protect yourself from the attacks.",
        "So, it's good - I think it's good sense to develop offensive capabilities.",
        "One thing you have to be cautious of, though, is that if you're going to use a particular offensive capabilities, that your defenses are prepared to sustain further attacks, or more sophisticated attacks.",
        "Now, clearly, we have to have that in place any way, day in and day out.",
        "But it's another calculus that you have weigh in, when you weigh whether or not, you're going to respond to a cyber attack, with a cyber attack or in some other domain.",
        "But what's the status of U.S.",
        "offensive capabilities in the cyber realm?",
        "Are they pretty robust now?",
        "Does there have to be a lot of work done on this area?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Tom, it's an area I probably can't - shouldn't talk too much about, but it's an area that we're focused on.",
        "And - because we recognize that a good defense also incorporates elements of an offensive capability.",
        "You need a lot more money in this area?",
        "You know, money - there has been budget requests that went in with the National Cyber Security Initiative - which, if sustained, will be very helpful - but I would tell you, I think our biggest shortfall in this area is in people dedicated to work in these particular missions.",
        "Now, I'm speaking for the STRATCOM perspective and what we do in military - defense in the military networks.",
        "And so the expertise - and frankly, you know, the services, they organize forces for the combatant commanders to use.",
        "So Naval forces and fleets, and Air Forces and wings, and Army forces and divisions and corp - we need to (unintelligible) equivalent, if you will, of forces to support the cyber defense of our military networks.",
        "And the services are stepping up to that.",
        "And there's going to be a training element and an organizational element that they'll have to put in place; and we're starting to see that.",
        "But not - if I could ask for something today, it wouldn't be the next piece of technology, although that doesn't hurt, it'd be people.",

        "But I was wondering if you might address a little bit about the consequences of electromagnetic pulse from, say, a rouge state launch of a nuclear - thermo nuclear weapon.",
        "There's a lot of those out there, and you know, I was just wondering if you might be able to address that somewhat about - how that might affect our military systems.",
        "Sure, Dom.",
        "And when a nuclear detonation occurs, you're absolutely correct, there's a large electromagnetic pulse that goes out.",
        "It's not very long lived, but what we found is that it has a greater effect on some of our high tech microcircuit technology that we've deployed in various things, whether it'd be computers or electronic that supports automobiles, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "Good news and bad news.",
        "The good news is that it's a finite area that has affected, it's not infinite or global in nature.",
        "The bad news is you have to consider this, which is almost the inconsiderable, would be the detonation on nuclear weapon.",
        "And the consequences which not only would result from the blast but also from an EMP and what it would have on our electronics systems.",
        "For that reason, we take steps to protect our critical commanding control elements from an EMP blasts, so that we always provide the president the opportunity to command and control his nuclear forces even in that environment.",
        "And that's really important.",

        "Well, first of all, thank you for being in the ROTC and joining the all-volunteer force to serve our nation.",
        "You have my highest respect for that.",
        "We need skill sets across the board, in the United States military -whether it'd be in cyberspace, air, land, sea operations.",
        "And so, I would encourage you to follow your passion of study because whatever you're passionate about is what you'll be best at it and you'll do well at it.",
        "And then come on board, and we have great training programs in the military to bring up to speed in a particular expertise that we may lack.",
        "But we certainly value, in the space and cyberspace business in U.S.",
        "Strategic Command, engineering backgrounds, computer science backgrounds, astronomical engineering backgrounds.",
        "And we have places for those type of students in our command, in our supporting commands that are quite vital to our operations.",
        "All right, here's some good music for that."

        "Good afternoon, Chuck.",
        "Let me talk about space, first of all.",

        "signed up to and many other nations that prevents putting nuclear weapons in space - which I think is a good thing, or putting weapons on other planetary bodies like the moon.",

        "And there's been talk, not new but for many years, about how do you define a weapon in space?",
        "I mean, a nuclear weapon is pretty easy to find.",
        "I often ask people.",
        "I say, well, if I could build a spaceship or a spacecraft that could go up into space, and then let's say I put a chemical arm on it and I could fly it up next to another country's satellite and reach out and pluck the solar rays off, would that be a weapon?",
        "They often say, yes.",
        "And I remind them that I flew on that.",
        "It's called a space shuttle.",

        "Democrats managed to strip out of the bill a lot of GOP policy riders from the bill, among them restrictions on travel to Cuba and indirect funding for NPR.",

        "Why do these things seemed to be always resolved at the very last minute?",
        "Well, you know, as a rule, Congress usually doesn't get big things done until it absolutely has to them.",
        "And that's been especially true this year.",
        "But there is another reason this went right up to the brink, and that is that the White House had urged Democrats to hold up the omnibus spending bill to add pressure to first reach a deal to extend expiring payroll tax cuts and unemployment insurance.",
        "The last thing President Obama wanted was for House Republican leaders to approve of the big spending bill and then simply leave town for the holidays.",
        "And there appears there has been a Senate deal struck to keep people's payroll taxes from going up on January 1st.",
        "There has indeed, and it was approved by the Senate this morning.",

        "They dropped that demand after Republicans refused to go along with it.",
        "But Republicans would not give up their main condition for extending these provisions, namely an acceleration of the permitting process for the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "But didn't President Obama once say that he'd reject any measure to extend the tax cut by including the Keystone pipeline?",
        "He did.",
        "The president had earlier declared a decision on this controversial pipeline would not be made until after next year's election.",
        "And when Republicans started talking about attaching the Keystone pipeline issue to the payroll tax cut extension, he warned he'd reject such deal.",
        "But this Senate deal does include such a requirement, and that the decision be made within 60 days.",
        "And White House officials are now saying they won't make good on their veto threat because the president can still say no to the pipeline.",
        "That might help placate environmentalists who oppose this massive project.",
        "But if the president does stop it from moving forward, he would likely anger another important constituency for Democrats, the labor unions, that want to see this project move forward because they and Republicans say it creates jobs.",
