        "And what might change your mind?",
        "It depends in what his views are as far as on the taxes, the economy, you know, the Clinton-Obama just keep talking about raising taxes, that they have the deficit.",
        "Well, we're in a different tax bracket now.",
        "And that's the last thing I want to hear.",

        "I have a feeling that had Mitt Romney run from the beginning as somebody who was touting his business experience, his business acumen, showing how he turned around the Olympics in Salt Lake City, how he turned around Massachusetts, he was in a far more (unintelligible) but he started from the beginning as being a very strong pertaining himself as a very strong pro-life anti-gay politician, which is the almost the opposite of was when he ran for the governor of Massachusetts - ran for the Senate against Ted Kennedy.",
        "So a lot of people feel that authenticity is a very important issue.",

        "There's also a financial question.",
        "A lot of the funding for Mitt Romney's campaign was coming out of Mitt Romney's pocket.",
        "I think the last number I saw were $35 million, and that maybe at the end of 2007, so who knows how much more he's spent in January.",
        "I suspect a lot.",
        "He did pumped at least a million dollars - his effort in California.",
        "And I think, like that guy, Ken - I love that name - the guy who called not too long ago who said that immigration was a key issue.",
        "When we look at the Republican exit polls in California, immigration was indeed a key issue for many Republican voters and for many of those same voters, John McCain failed that test.",

        "Well, I don't think he gives them back.",
        "I mean, I don't think John Edwards was giving back the money that he has raised.",
        "I think that's - I mean, where Mitt Romney could decide to give back, of course, much of his campaign was out of his own pocket, but I believe that's what happens when you have a loosing campaign, whether you drop out (unintelligible) defeated, that's money has already been spent.",

        "Are you willing, as conservative, are you willing to see Hilary Clinton, should she be the Democratic nominee be that - be in the White House for at least the next four years?",
        "Taking the wrong view, yes, because if we were to see another four years of a none conservative Republican president - White House, then we would end up seeing in the long term that moving away from conservatives has been rewarded by having three consecutive Republican presidents.",

        "Well, that's possible; I still suspect that most of them will go to Mike Huckabee.",
        "Ron Paul remains only getting about 5-7 percent of the vote in the primary.",
        "He does much better in the caucuses, is getting double digits in caucuses.",
        "But I think also the fact that Ron Paul is anti-war and for the most part, the Republican electorate supports President Bush and the conduct of the war.",
        "I don't know if Ron Paul will get that - pick up much from Romney's withdrawal.",
        "And back to that question of the potential vice presidential nominee.",
        "Again, this is going to be important for balancing the ticket whether it's influences any votes, but at this point, it's an important decision for John McCain for any number of reasons."
