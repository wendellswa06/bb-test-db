        "In the meantime, there's, say, an executive action to bypass Congress and divert money into wall construction.",
        "There's a possibility of declaring a national emergency.",
        "There is executive authority to tap funds elsewhere.",
        "The White House has a lot of options, and they've alluded to the idea that they might be willing to use them.",
        "Do you think that is the right move?",
        "I think they're likely to not necessarily declare a national emergency.",
        "I think that's something that would set a really problematic precedent for future presidents.",
        "I mean, if Kamala Harris were president, then what does she do with that authority?",
        "You see what I mean?",
        "But there are other authorities, short of declaring a national emergency, where the president can reallocate certain money to build some more fencing, for instance.",
        "I expect he probably will do some of that.",
        "It may be challenged in court.",
        "Who knows?",
        "But I think the most - the national emergency idea, I think, is probably a bridge too far because of the precedent it would set.",
        "So basically, your objection to that is, when you're not the party in power, that becomes a lot less appealing.",
        "That's why you have a lot of the protections, whether it's in legislative or executive branch - because you don't want to be on the receiving end of things like that because you're not always going to be in power.",
        "You've said you're not a wall or bust guy.",
        "But why do you think the wall's such important shorthand?",
        "It's shorthand - it's not symbolic because we actually do need more fencing, more barriers on the border.",
        "But it was, I think, a way for the president to communicate to people during the campaign that he was serious about border enforcement, unlike other candidates before him.",
        "Is it a problem now?",
        "Yeah, I think he's - the problem is he kind of talked himself into a box by emphasizing the wall so much.",
        "And you know, the - I mean, while it's important, there are other measures that are more important - change if - plugging loopholes in asylum law; the E-Verify system, which makes it harder for illegal immigrants to get jobs.",
        "Those kinds of things, in my opinion, are clearly higher priority than more fencing, as valuable as increased fencing in certain areas would be.",
        "At the same time, this administration has faced several legal setbacks when it has tried to draw restrictions around immigration or asylum.",
        "From where you sit, are they making progress for the agenda for people who want restrictive immigration policy?"
