        "You don't wait till you're there and then try to deal with it, because then it's really sucks, because it's a lot to come back from.",
        "But if you've got things that you're doing now that are disordered eating acts - like when I was 11, I had disordered eating acts, but I did not have BED.",

        "And Dr. Bravender, we just heard Ron Saxen talking earlier, and some of the callers with him - men are very reluctant to get help.",
        "Well, you know, if you look at all medical visits for any reason at all in adolescents and young adults, about 65 to 70 percent of all those visits are by women.",
        "So very, very few men go to the doctor for anything at all.",
        "And I think when it comes to a mental health issue, men are even more reluctant to come in and get help.",
        "I mean, if the old stereotype is right about men never wanting to stop and ask for directions, how simple is that compared to actually saying that you're struggling with something like an eating disorder?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the reluctance also is because it's a condition associated with women.",
        "And I know that probably about 10 years ago there were a number of high profile deaths on division one college wresting teams that made the NCAA take a better look at this and put in some stricter controls.",

        "They just reported very good first-quarter profits.",

        "Well, exactly.",
        "And I think that women who come in for treatment for an eating disorder illicit a whole team approach.",
        "And the first thing that people will think of, I think, if a woman comes in with symptoms of anorexia is anorexia.",
        "Back when I was a resident in training about 15 years ago, I was taught that any adolescent boy or a young man coming in with symptoms of anorexia should have a much, much more extensive evaluation, including a head MRI and complete scans to rule out any other illness because anorexia was, I was taught, was so incredibly rare in men that it almost never happened.",
        "I think we know that's not the case anymore.",

        "He's truly suffering with gender identity, among many other issues.",

        "Does this make it more difficult for his recovery?",
        "Any insight you might provide would be helpful.",
        "That's, you know, that's a tough issue, and that's one that we struggle with down here.",
        "And I've had a number of my male patients say that they feel very unusual coming into our eating disorders program because the waiting room is always filled with girls and young women.",
        "I think that number one issue for this boy is to get the treatment he needs, and I think that bringing those issues out into the open about how uncomfortable he feels being around the girls is the best you can do right now.",
        "I think that if he needs in-patient care that - it's called milieu therapy -meaning how he interacts with other - the other patients is important, but again, I think that needs to be brought up with the group.",
        "Unfortunately, I think the family is going to be hard-pressed to find any in-patient treatment center that isn't primarily focused on girls and young women, because that's who come in for treatment the most.",
        "Let's get some listeners in on the conversation.",
        "This is Carolyn, Carolyn with us from East Lansing in Michigan.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi, you're on the air.",
        "OK, I was wondering if you could talk about what some of the symptoms might be or how to talk about - if you suspect someone has an eating disorder, how would you know about it and how could you talk to them about it?",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Sure, this is a question that we get very frequently.",
        "And like the author previously to this said, certainly binge eating disorder can remain hidden for years and years, and similarly with bulimia.",
        "And I think that for people concerned - either about a friend or certainly parents who are concerned - I think it's important to bring this up with the young person in a very caring manner, so in a non-accusatory way."

        "And one of the suggestions that I often use is to use what are called I statements.",
        "So rather than saying I think you're doing this, you say I'm worried and here's why.",
        "So I'm worried because it seems like you're much more isolated than you used to be, or I'm worried about your weight loss, or I'm worried because I can't find the food that's disappearing.",
        "And say - and couch it in terms that indicate you want to help that person or find a professional who can offer help rather than accusing them of doing something wrong, because anything that's accusing is just going to exacerbate the kind of feelings of shame that go along with many of these eating disorders.",
        "Thank you very much.",

        "Thank you.",
        "One should not underestimate the ability of people to hide these disorders, too.",
        "Oh, absolutely, and I think that when you mentioned the disorders can appear almost like an addiction, I think that's a model that we use quite frequently.",
        "And binge eating disorder certainly is hidden, and bulimia is, too.",
        "And I think one of the misconceptions about bulimia I would like to bring up is that patients don't have to vomit after they eat in order to have bulimia, and they can use any kind of maladaptive, compensatory behavior to make up for that binge.",
        "So I had one patient who would have huge binges and then fast for two or three days after the binge and compulsively exercise, and she fit the diagnostic criteria for bulimia.",
        "Now she never binged.",
        "She didn't look abnormal.",
        "She was a normal weight.",
        "But that type of behavior fit criteria for bulimia, and she had been going about it for about two or three years before finally her roommate noticed her behavior when she was in college and called her parents, who finally brought her in for treatment.",
