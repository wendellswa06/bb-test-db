        "Hi, 35-year-old guy, six-three, range between 220, 250 pounds, and the last guy that you would look at on the street and say, well, there walks a bulimic, but have struggled, you know, with the bingeing and purging - and not always purging, just like was mentioned - you know, bingeing and then compensating, you know, some other way for years and years, and didn't address it until I addressed my alcoholism and then realized that, you know, that binge eating and that part of it became extreme and that kind of took over, and it was all about control.",

        "I mean, I didn't want to look like a model.",
        "I didn't have any delusion that I ever could.",
        "But that part of my life that I could control was the issue.",
        "And when I - and I still haven't - other than just in my, you know, 12-step meetings - dealt with the specific issue, but I think that I need to at some point address it separately from my alcoholism.",
        "And what do you, you know, what is the advise for that?",
        "Dr. Bravender?",
        "(Through translator) Maliki will smash the others.",
        "He will win and reach the top.",
        "Sure.",
        "You know, from the study that we've been citing by Dr. Hudson and colleagues that was published recently regarding men and eating disorders, one of the findings in that study showed that of all the people they identified with bulimia, almost 95 percent had some co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis.",
        "So that ranged from anxiety disorder and depression, all the way up to alcoholism and other drug abuse disorders.",
        "So it's not surprising that bulimia goes hand in hand with other problems, particularly substance abuse.",
        "And I think that just brings up to the forefront how much of an addictive nature these disorders have.",
        "And with our patients whom we see who have multiple different diagnoses going on at the same time, it's almost like which are you going to treat first?",
        "And we know that they all feed off one another.",
        "And what we usually end up doing is taking a hierarchy of harm and addressing those issues which are causing the greatest physical harm initially, working on that, and then working through the others.",
        "But sometimes, it takes treatment for one issue - such as alcoholism -before you can even begin to address the others.",
        "Now just like with treatment of an addiction, I think Ron said earlier that you can't expect the eating disorder to get better if you don't replace it with something else to fill the need that the eating disorder is filling.",
        "And it's the same way with alcoholism.",
        "You can't just simply stop without finding some other healthier coping mechanism.",

        "In the past five years I've met five different men who had bulimia.",
        "All of them, including myself, are homosexual.",
        "My question for the doctor is this: did any results from the study indicate homosexuals are more likely to fall victim to this illness?",
        "Yeah, that's been - that actually been a common assumption in teaching, is that gay men - we do know that gay men are at greater risk for a number of psychological issues.",
        "We know that gay men are more likely to suffer from depression and are significantly more likely to have attempted suicide than straight men.",
        "It's been long held that gay men are at greater risk for eating disorders.",
        "And there are lots of theories as to why that might be, whether it's an increased emphasis on body or looks or appearance, or a feeling of other kind of social alienation from the greater culture at large.",
        "The study in question here didn't really address that, and there have been small case series and smaller reports that, but no population based studies yet.",
        "But I think from my clinical experience, and from other's clinical experience, that probably is the case.",
        "One thing the study did say was that as opposed to women who were in pursuit of thinness, men seemed to be in pursuit of that perfect ripped body.",
        "And is that your experience as well?",
        "I think many men are, and there's a wonderful book that came out probably about five years ago now, called \"\"The Adonis Complex,\"\" which examined this and looked at kind of young men's perception of the ideal body type."
