        "Hi, Dr. Bravender.",
        "I was calling because I had a question.",
        "I was wondering if you felt or have noticed if it's more socially acceptable for women to come out about their eating disorders than it is for men?",
        "You know, that's a great question, and I think it is.",
        "Particularly in teenagers.",
        "And I've seen a number of my patients who, as young women, who are almost proud of their eating disorder.",
        "And it's part of their identity and who they are.",
        "And all their friends know they have eating disorders, their teachers know, their parents know.",
        "And when they come into the clinic it's something they're very proud of.",
        "I have never seen that in a teenage boy or a young man.",
        "It seems to be much ore hidden.",
        "Again, I think because most of the press that eating disorders get are about women.",
        "I think that most of the treatment centers are focused on women's health, and it remains a fact, still, that eating disorders do affect mostly women.",
        "Although many, many more men, I think, than we previously thought are also suffering with eating disorders.",
        "Does that perverse pride in an eating disorder, does that make it more difficult to treat?",
        "Well, in a way it does, because just like, you know, part of the treatment of the eating disorder is trying to figure out what role the eating disorder is playing in that individual's life, and then trying to find something more productive to fill that role.",
        "And if an individual's identity is tied up in having an eating disorder, then replacing that - it can be done, but it's going to be a long road to go down.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Matt, thanks for the call.",
        "It's interesting, too, in treatment of eating disorders, in extreme cases they require hospitalization.",
        "It's simply the fact that a lot of - before people go into the hospital, family, friends, they can't be nearly tough enough with somebody who suffers from, for example, bulimia or anorexia.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, one of the - you know, one of the key components of our program at Duke involves bringing the family in and actually training, particularly the parents, in how to deal with their children with eating disorders.",
        "You know, virtually every treatment program in the nation uses a multi-disciplinary approach that involves people from medicine, psychology, psychiatry, nutrition.",
        "We may have social workers involved.",
        "Kind of body work professionals, like massage therapists or physical therapists or yoga work and things like that.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think after last week no one could doubt that."

        "And we found that a key piece really involves bringing the family in, whether that means a spouse, grandparents, or parents, somebody else, because certainly in the outpatient realm we're only with these patients for an hour or, you know, two, maybe three a week.",
        "Whereas, the family members are with these patients all the time.",
        "And they're really looking for help to figure out how to help their loved ones.",
        "And we're doing our best to teach them how to do that in a productive way.",
        "And you've made the comparison with addiction.",
        "Is it typical for people with eating disorders to have relapses?",
        "Well, it is.",
        "And, you know, we're always cautious when we have a patient come in and things get better.",
        "Or, you know, an individual has anorexia and when that child gains weight parents think, yay, great.",
        "We're done.",
        "Thank you very much for your help.",
        "And we won't ever come in to see you again.",
        "And that's not the case.",
        "And we tell most people that even the most successful cases whom we treat will have to be with us for about a year in the outpatient setting.",
        "And we're going to anticipate roadblocks along the way.",
        "And just like with other addictions, that should be anticipated.",
        "And we should help the parents -and the patient, too - predict what those are going to be and figure out ways of addressing that before they happen.",
        "One final call.",
        "Let's get Jennifer on the line.",
        "Jennifer, another call from Rochester, New York.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was wondering - there's an older family member - male family member - in our family who seems to have - seems to be somewhat of an unhealthy kind of preoccupation with maintaining a certain weight.",
        "I was wondering what would generally kind of classify eating disorders in men?",
        "And is it any - really any different than that in women?",
        "Well, the diagnostic classifications that we use are pretty much the same for men and women.",
        "And the - Ron earlier mentioned the DSM, which is the diagnostic and statistical manual.",
        "It's kind of the diagnostic Bible for psychiatry, and it lists different behaviors and other parameters that you must have for certain eating disorders.",
        "So for example, anorexia nervosa, you have to be below 85 percent of ideal body weight as well as having a morbid fear of fat and some other psychological parameters.",
        "Bulimia, you have to have a certain number of binges with compensatory behaviors afterwards."

        "All right.",
        "Well…",
        "And those are - yeah, those are all - those are all listed there.",
        "…great.",
        "But here's the interesting thing, is that those are really artificial constructs.",
        "And other data has shown that there's this kind of catch-all phrase for eating disorders that don't fit those like artificial categories called eating disorder not otherwise specified.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "People who come in for treatment who are worried about their eating or their families are worried about their eating, if we look at measures of psychological health and well-being in those folks with eating disorder not otherwise specified, they're just as impaired as those with the diagnosable eating disorders.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So those definitions we've got really are kind of blunt instruments for figuring out who has the disorder.",
        "And I think I would look at how much it's impairing his life, and as well as his physical health is the most important pieces to look at.",
        "All right.",
