        "Pompeo has been controversial for reasons beyond those raised by Rand Paul.",
        "Remind us why this has been such a contentious nomination.",
        "Like most things in Congress, it's a little bit of politics and a little bit of policy.",
        "Republicans have accused Democrats of basically throwing Pompeo under the bus.",
        "They voted 66 to 32 to approve him as CIA director, which is the job he has now.",
        "Democrats say that secretary of state is just a different job, and they worry about his policies on things like his opposition to gay marriage - how that might affect many of gay diplomats that are serving all across the world.",
        "And they worry about that idea of wanting to have strikes in North Korea and Iran.",
        "He used to support those strikes.",
        "And during his confirmation process, Pompeo said that he had changed his mind, and he favors diplomacy now.",
        "And Democrats say they don't know what to trust.",
        "After Pompeo, there are other controversial nominees headed to the Senate in the next few weeks.",
        "Senators have raised concerns about White House doctor Ronny Jackson, who's nominated to head the Department of Veterans Affairs; the deputy director of the CIA, Gina Haspel, who's nominated to lead that agency.",
        "Are they facing the same sort of risks that Pompeo has been dealing with?",
        "They both definitely face risks, but they have different risks.",
        "And it's kind of too soon to tell what will happen.",
        "Jackson gets a hearing on Wednesday, and those concerns are about his record basically that he doesn't have enough experience to run a big bureaucratic agency like the VA.",
        "And those are fairly bipartisan concerns.",
        "Here's what Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said earlier today at a campaign stop in Virginia.",

        "That's a pretty common complaint.",
        "People say that he seems like a nice guy, seems like a good doctor.",
        "But the VA is troubled and needs somebody who can run a really big organization.",
        "Concerns about Haspel are also bipartisan but very different.",
        "Senators say they want to ask her about her involvement in brutal CIA interrogations of terror suspects.",
