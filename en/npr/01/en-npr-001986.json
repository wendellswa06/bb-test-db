        "Now, I said insider trading, but to be blunt about it, is this just insider cashing in?",
        "The practice at its worst is a situation where they wait for the date to pass when the stock hits bottom, so it's already on the way up, and they back-date the granting of the stock option to that bottom, so that the executive is automatically guaranteed a huge gain, you know, tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of free money.",

        "Many of the companies that have been named, either formally or informally, as being under SEC scrutiny are tech companies.",
        "Is that just coincidence, or is that where the money is or is there something about tech companies that make it more likely?",
        "Well, the main thing about tech companies is that their compensation system has been heavily skewed to options for many years.",
        "So it's not a giant surprise that companies like Rambus, which makes - a semiconductor company, or Comverse Technologies or Vitesse Semiconductor, have been ensnared."

        "Did CEO's just talk to each other and figure this out themselves?",
        "Nobody really knows, and therefore it's hard to know how many more companies - how much more widespread this is than it's already been.",
        "Part of the logic of stock options is that it gives a CEO or any executive a stake in the performance of the company.",
        "That gets created if what they're just going to do is shop around for the lowest price and then maximize the investment.",
        "The point of options, originally, was to align the executives, and even the rank-and-file when they get stock options, with the shareholder, so that he is incented to try and make the share price go up, and you and I, who are shareholders, are rewarded, and he's rewarded.",
        "So if you have a situation where, you know, he's rewarded from the very moment he gets the option - he has his reward, it's there - there's been no effort on his part, he's just handed free money.",
        "And then, by the way, it's not disclosed in the proxy that that's what they've done.",
