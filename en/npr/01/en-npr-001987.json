        "And I wonder, the version of the bill that we saw come out of the Senate today, or at least mentioned by Senator Christopher Dodd, who's the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, includes as part of it that the U.S.",
        "would get stakes in the companies they're helping out.",
        "Yes.",
        "But from what I've read about that, it's a slightly confused suggestion in that the Senate seems to be proposing that on the one hand the government buys debt, so it gives the banks some money and in return it gets these bad loans.",
        "OK, so it's got the loans in exchange.",
        "And now on top of that, it wants to get some kind of equity participation, as well.",
        "You can do it that way but it doesn't get around the fundamental problem with any debt purchase, which is that valuing the debt is something that the private sector has being unable to do for the past 12 months, and there's no reason to suppose that the government will be smarter at valuing this very complicated mess of mortgages instruments which are in the grid(ph), they're not traded, you can't see what price they should be at.",
        "They'll be haggling over whether this should be 22 cents on the dollar or 50 cents on the dollar, what should be the discount.",
        "I just think going down that route is way more complicated than simply looking at the stock price of a bank and saying, OK, your stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange.",
        "We know what it's worth, and at that value we're going to inject several billion dollars into your balance sheet to give you more stability and more time.",
        "And if you do well on the deal, we'll make some of the profits.",
        "Right.",
        "That's right.",
        "So what Senator Dodd is doing is he's trying to get that upside for taxpayers just like my suggestion would do.",
        "But I think he is sort of tacking it onto a deal, onto a proposal from the Treasury, which begins by simply being too complicated.",
        "And I'm suggesting, you know, get out of that complication.",
        "Don't even try to buy bad loans because they're way difficult to value.",
        "But didn't we go through this process or something quite similar to it when the savings banks had a crisis of their own seven years ago and they set up the Resolution Trust Company?",
        "They had a bunch of bad loans and eventually disposed of them.",
        "Well, unfortunately, that's what a lot of people think, and that's why it's been possible politically to market this plan as something we've done before.",
        "We know how to do it, it's no longer that radical.",
        "But the truth is that what happened with the Resolution Trust Corporation set up in 1989 was fundamentally different.",
        "Back then, what you had was savings and loans, thrifts, which had already gone bankrupt.",
        "And because they were federally insured, that meant that their loans fell into the lap of the U.S.",
        "government, and the U.S.",
        "government had to figure out what to do with these loans.",
        "Now you have a situation where the treasuries...",
        "So in other words, they had no choice.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, there was insurance already - federal insurance of these thrifts.",
        "So when the thrifts went bust, by definition the government picked up the loans and had to figure out how to sell them.",
        "Today we're talking about buying bad loans from banks which are not bust, so then you get into this difficulty of negotiating which loans you buy, what price you pay for them and so forth.",
        "That's what worries me."

        "So that since the private market - since the - not the private market - since the markets can't figure out how much these loans are worth, and as you say, they've been - these bad mortgages have been bundled into very complicated instruments of varying types that I'm told I sure don't understand and I'm told very few people do, that in fact the government's not going to be any better at figuring out how much to pay for these and is likely then to get paid too much.",
        "I mean - exactly.",
        "And just to give you a sense of the complication, I mean, since my column appeared yesterday in The Washington Post, I've been inundated with emails from a lot of very thoughtful and smart people on Wall Street saying, you know, here's how the Paulson plan could work.",
        "And one of them emails me and says, you know, the thing is that if the government came in and offered a low price for bad debts, let's say 40 percent of what their face value is worth, then it would make a market.",
        "You know, people would know that they could offload these debts of 40 cents on the dollar, and so people would be willing to bid 45 or 50 because they knew that if it went wrong for them they could turn around and sell it to the government.",
        "So then you'd get liquidity in these debt markets.",
        "But then I get another email from somebody making exactly the same argument but saying that government should come in and buy not at 40 cents on the dollar but at 20 cents on the dollar.",
        "So in other words, no one can agree what the price is, and that's going to be the beginning of a huge fight if this plan gets enacted.",
        "A huge fight about how you value this debt, what price you put on it, and there's no one, good, simple answer because the truth is that some debt is probably worth 40 cents, other is worth 20 cents, other is worth 30 and 50 and so on.",
        "And so there's no one price that the government can come in on and say, right, we will buy all bad debts at the following price because bad debts are very, very varied, so there's no way of structuring this in a simple fashion.",
        "We're talking with Sebastian Mallaby of the Council on Foreign Relations about what do the taxpayers ought to get for their $700 billion, which is what Congress is talking about spending this week at the urging of the White House and the Secretary of the Treasury.",

        "Hi.",
        "Hi, Mark.",
        "One of the things that we should get, I think, is some legislation that these mortgage entities can't make political contributions because the people, like in this case, Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, we were looking at them at least to give warnings that something like this would happen.",
        "And I don't think I can have any trust right now in these government officials that they've really been looking out for us, been looking and doing good oversight if they in fact have been receiving.",
        "And in the case of Chris Dodd, even receiving favorable mortgages from Countrywide.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Chris Dodd and Barney Frank, respectively the chairman of the Senate and House Banking Committees.",
        "What do you think, Sebastian Mallaby, is that - have they been derelict in their oversight and should mortgage companies be barred from political lobbying or contributions?",
        "You know, it's very tough to single out one industry like mortgage companies for this kind of thing when it happens in just about every industry.",
        "You could make a similar point about the regulation of any industry you like.",
        "Of course, the people who are regulated are giving big amounts of money to people in Congress all the time.",
        "So it gets to, I think, a bigger question about the way the political system works, about campaign contributions and so on.",
        "I would say, though, that I think the clearest example of political connections sort of messing up what should have been better regulation are the two monster government-affiliated mortgage lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which went - were taken into government receivership just a few weeks ago.",
        "That really was a case where the lobbying power of those two companies, I think, prevented decent regulation and clear rules being set up.",
        "And I fear that, you know, the danger is going to be down the line.",
        "We haven't seen the last of this.",
        "Further lobbying on behalf of those two entities could cause them to be resurrected in a way that makes us live through this experience all over again."
