        "Well, you know, in some ways, the job of the secretary of state in this sort of circumstances is not simply - to a kind of a docile way - accept a 30 percent cut that's been ordained by a director of the Office of Management and Budget who knows nothing about diplomacy.",

        "So on some very basic managerial tasks, he has really failed.",
