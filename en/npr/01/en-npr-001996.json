        "That is the refugee ban and the travel restrictions on folks from those six countries.",
        "And because those have essentially not changed - yes, they've been narrowed but they essentially remain in place - we believe the injunction established by the federal court judge here in Seattle four or five weeks ago remains in effect."

        "So that's - that continues to be the basis for your lawsuit is this idea of intention when it comes to this executive order.",

        "The natural gas-fired boilers here will heat Biogen's buildings and make steam for its manufacturing process, but what's unusual is that same steam will also be sent through this turbine.",
        "Its spinning blades will generate enough electricity to power the nearly one million square feet of offices and labs here.",
        "Since the steam is doing two jobs at once, the system is twice as efficient as stand-alone boilers or electric power plants.",
