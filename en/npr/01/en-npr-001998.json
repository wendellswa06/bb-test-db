        "They're at the bottom.",
        "They're right there at the wellhead, so it's basically the cap on the well, and it's supposed to, like I said, kick in the instant that, you know, that kind of the riser disconnects or blows out.",
        "Doyle?",
        "Great.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Appreciate the phone call.",
        "And the - another part of this, so depending on where that riser, that long pipe from the wellhead at the bottom - the floor of the Gulf of Mexico going all the way up to the surface - depending on where that oil is gushing out of, does that depend on where it flows to?",
        "Does it rise to the surface?",
        "Does it flow underneath the surface?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That, I mean, that does have an impact.",
        "Again, you could, you know, theoretically, if the entire riser was intact and there was, say, a leak right at the blowout preventer and a leak 5,000 feet away and the bottom of the surface, you'd end up with different oil patches on the surface.",
        "But, ultimately, what we see is an 1,800-square-mile big oil patch, so all of the leaks are kind of flowing together, and they will hit the coast in short order unless something is done.",
        "And, obviously, a lot of efforts are being taken to prevent that from happening, ranging from, you know, booms and skimmers.",
        "These are ships that are, kind of, herding the oil together and then scooping it out of the water; to the Coast Guard, yesterday, actually set it on fire to see if that might help cut down on the amount of oil that ultimately ends up hitting the shore and hitting some of the - and this has been less discussed - the deep water reefs and other significant ecosystems in the area.",
        "And, by the way, our colleagues at ALL THINGS CONSIDERED tonight are going to be focusing on the potential environmental damage, so stay tuned to an NPR station to get more details on that.",
        "Here's an email - it's untitled - the Wall Street Journal reported this morning, this well did not have a, quote, remote-control shut off switch that may be used in other countries to prevent these kinds of major spills.",
        "It's called an acoustic switch.",
        "Are you familiar with that technology and how does it work?",
        "Basically, it responds to acoustic signals and attempts to engage the blowout preventer when something like this happened, assuming that the blowout preventer wasn't kind of triggered by the action of the well explosion itself.",
        "Those are available in other countries, but again it's actually kind of a bell and whistle, if you will.",
        "It's nice to have, obviously, in a situation like this.",
        "But, theoretically, the fact that you have four valves in this blowout preventer that respond to hydraulic pressure, they should kick in.",
        "They should have kicked in.",
        "And it will be interesting to see what prevented them from kicking in.",
        "We're talking with David Biello again of Scientific American.",

        "I'm wondering if there's any chance that beginning to drill a release well maybe should have happened earlier than it seems to be happening, and whether a neutral adviser who had no interest in saving money for the company might have been able to make that decision at an earlier time than BP executives would make it, because of the high costs.",
        "Yeah, that's a tough one for me to answer without kind of internal BP meeting-minutes kind of thing.",
        "But it seems to me, from the outside, that BP has pretty much instantly decided that drilling another well is the way to go.",
        "The problem is you have to get a drilling rig into place and start the drilling.",
        "These are not, again, it's 5,000 feet down.",
        "It's not kind of simple.",
        "And they're also trying to do something pretty difficult, which is intersect an existing well with a new well.",
        "Typically, when you're drilling, you're just drilling down into the resource, which is a much bigger kind of target to hit than an existing well.",
        "Whether it could've been done faster or if rigs could've been mobilized faster, is tough to say at this point.",
        "I think, certainly, all due speed has been taken by everybody involved with this, especially as the kind of scale of this has become more visible, from space and everywhere else.",
        "The anti-war movement has had its ebbs and flows, as do all vital social movements.",

        "BP was in charge, but now that it's a spill of national significance, the U.S.",
        "government will kind of take control.",
        "And that's a term of art.",

        "government, because the U.S.",

        "When you have an accident in skydiving, dead is dead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "David, I think there was a statement by a senior official at the Interior Department today, that said they may put a halt on all offshore drilling until it can be proven that these valves will work.",
        "But to his larger question, David Biello, what do you think?",
        "Well, I - it certainly seems clear that, you know, even the White House press secretary has said this will have an impact.",
        "But at the same time, he said that we would go forward with offshore drilling.",
        "It remains to be seen.",
        "You might recall that back in 1969, there was a similar oil spill off the coast of California.",
        "That's the reason...",
        "Santa Barbara, yeah.",
        "...why we have a moratorium on oil drilling off the East Coast and the West Coast that existed until last month.",
        "It was a similar situation.",
        "You ended up with oil on the coast.",
        "It was a big disaster.",
        "We may see something similar.",
        "We may see a return of the moratoriums.",
        "Already, Democrats and Republicans from affected states have said that this is a major disaster and one that has either confirmed them in their opposition to offshore drilling, or caused them to question it.",
        "Finally, this email question from Robert in Visalia, California.",
        "Have there been situations where the blowout preventers worked correctly?",
        "What's the success rate?",
        "Unfortunately, a lot of that is kind of confidential information.",
        "Most oil companies aren't going to tell you when they have a disaster if they don't have to report it.",
        "But there have been circumstances in the past where blowout preventers have worked.",
        "Certainly, they've been shown to work in the lab and they have worked in accidents in the past.",
        "Like I said, there are about 4,000 rigs out there.",
        "Everything doesn't always go smoothly.",
        "And this technology is needed to make sure that, you know, we don't end up with situations like this.",
        "That said, there have been two in the last 30 years, and both of them pretty big, nasty oil spills.",

        "NAGL: That's correct, and in some ways, it's even harder fighting a rural counterinsurgency campaign because the people aren't compact in ways that you can control a large number of people or at least control access to areas for a large number of people with fairly small numbers of troops.",
        "So, the number of troops required in Afghanistan is going to have to be far larger than the number of troops we've deployed there to date."
