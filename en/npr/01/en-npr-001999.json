        "Today, a development in an issue that's been in the headlines of the British press all summer - Jewish leaders there have accused the opposition Labour Party of harboring anti-Semitism within its ranks.",
        "Now, the party's leadership has agreed to adopt an international definition of anti-Semitism after months of internal struggle.",
        "To explain the significance of today's action, we're joined by NPR's Frank Langfitt in London.",
        "Hey there, Frank.",
        "Hey, Audie.",
        "So how did a definition of anti-Semitism blow up in British politics?",
        "Well, the Labour Party was hesitating to endorse the definition.",
        "But the real sticking point was examples of what you can't say.",
        "So, for instance, the definition sort of said you couldn't say that Israel was a racist endeavor, and this could have been used - can be used to punish Labour Party members who say things that violate the definition.",
        "Now, Labour leaders, they were especially worried that this could curtail legitimate criticism of Israeli policy.",
        "And in some ways, the bigger picture here is this was pitting a fear of racist rhetoric against concerns about, you know, curtailing free speech.",
        "And first some background here, we know that hate speech laws in the U.K.",
        "differ from the U.S., right?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "One of the things is according to The Times newspaper, police here are actually looking at some alleged cases in the Labour Party to see if they violate hate speech laws.",
        "So why have Jewish leaders focused their attacks on the leader of the party, Jeremy Corbyn?",
        "Well, they say under Corbyn that Labour hasn't cracked down on online anti-Semitism.",
        "In the party, he's also, they say, shared public platforms with anti-Semites.",
        "There's a lot of examples of that - or some examples of that.",
        "And Corbyn, though, I should say, has repeatedly said there's no place for anti-Semitism in the party.",
        "He admits it's a problem.",
        "But many Jewish groups are also uncomfortable with him because he's long supported the Palestinian cause.",
        "Now, there were three leading Jewish newspapers.",
        "This was back in July.",
        "They said a Corbyn-led government posed an existential threat to Jews here in the United Kingdom.",
        "And in some, you basically had Jewish leaders going to war this summer against a man that they're afraid is going to end up in 10 Downing Street.",
        "So what's their reaction now after Labour's taken action?",
        "Well, there's some people who are glad to see Labour accepting the definition, but others are disappointed.",
        "And the reason is there's this caveat.",
        "Labour has said that the definition would not in any way undermine the freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians.",
        "Now, one Jewish leader called this free speech clause a right to be racist protection.",
        "And earlier this afternoon, I was talking to Daniel Sugarman.",
        "He's a reporter with The Jewish Chronicle here, and here's how he put it."

        "The Jewish community will not be satisfied.",
        "The Jewish community will believe that once again the Labour Party has gone about this in bad faith.",
        "Frank, while the Labour Party has been tangled up in this debate, you have Prime Minister Theresa May dealing with Brexit, dealing with basically an open revolt of senior members in her ruling Conservative Party.",
        "Has this hurt Labour's ability to be effective as opposition?",
        "Well, I don't think you've seen much of a fall in the poll for Labour, so I don't think that it's yet resonating among the populace, but it's definitely seen as a lost opportunity.",
        "This would have been a great time this summer to offer an alternative to the Conservative Party as they flail about on Brexit.",
        "And, you know, Labour had been surging earlier.",
        "It had done much better last summer in an election.",
        "And so, yeah, this was a really good chance to score some points and also grab the attention of voters.",
        "They can certainly argue it.",
        "They've tried to argue that already.",
        "And four federal judges - two appointed by Republican presidents, two appointed by Democratic presidents - have completely and utterly rejected all of those arguments by the federal government.",
        "Moreover, we're entitled as this case goes forward to discovery.",
        "What that means is we can take depositions of administration officials.",
        "We can ask for documents and emails to get at the intent behind this executive order.",
        "And we believe that will only strengthen our case as this moves forward.",
        "You have argued specifically that the executive order would have an economic impact on the state of Washington.",
        "How so?",
        "Oh, in numerous ways.",
        "So for example, we have now dozens of declarations.",
        "And they go to issues like our universities and colleges who no longer get the benefit of students and faculty who come to their - to our universities and colleges.",
        "But wasn't there an exemption for foreign students?",
        "There was an exemption in the original executive order and in the current one.",
        "But there are strong hurdles to achieve any of those exemptions.",
        "And that actually remains in place.",
        "So the exemption did not save the original executive order from judicial scrutiny and actually being rejected by the federal courts.",
        "And we don't think that the revised order changes anything in that regard.",
        "And so you're arguing that because students can't come from abroad, that has an economic impact on your universities."

        "That is one piece of our argument.",
        "So for example, the tuition that our colleges and universities receive.",
        "We had declarations from more than a hundred businesses talking about the negative impacts on their businesses, their ability to recruit and retain top-level talent, the adverse impact on their employees.",
        "So yes, we have dozens of declarations going to the economic harm to the people of the state of Washington and moreover the harm of individuals who can no longer travel there, they cannot have their relatives come to visit them.",
        "We have declarations from individuals as well.",
        "But forgive me, I thought another exemption was to allow for familial connections, so if someone wants their mother to visit from Iran that an exemption would be made for that.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And I believe under the current executive order, you have to show that you are not a threat to national security.",
        "And again, there was an exemption process under the original executive order.",
        "That still did not save this executive order, the original, from judicial review and from the federal courts unanimously rejecting the original executive order.",
        "The fact that it's essentially unchanged for the revised executive order, I'm confident it will not change the analysis from the federal courts.",
        "So this thing is supposed to take hold on March 16.",
        "So you have a tight timeframe here.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We've been operating under a tight time frame for a long time.",

        "Some works of art are suspected of being forgeries, good copies, yet nonetheless they are not the originals.",
        "Here's a case in point: a van Gogh painting, still life, \"\"Vase With 15 Sunflowers,\"\" bought at auction for nearly $40 million and later thought by some experts to be a forgery.",
        "How do you tell?",
        "Well, a newly formed collaboration might be able to help, and my next guest who is an engineer brought together computer scientists, engineers and mathematicians with art historians and museum curators to show how a scientist's bag of tools can help quantify characteristics of a typical van Gogh painting.",
        "The scientists analyzed 101 digital images of van Gogh's paintings - many authentic, some known forgeries and some of questionable origin - looking for some sort of quantifiable characteristics that might be able to separate a real van Gogh from the fakes.",
        "For instance, features in the brush strokes described by art experts as either course or short or choppy or yarn-like - did it work?",
        "Can image processing tools help authenticate works of art?",

        "So tell us what happened.",
        "How do art historians - let's go from the beginning - typically decide whether a painting is authentic?",
        "Well, I can only tell you that from my observations, but for the last year and a half that I've been organizing this workshop, I've also been talking with art historians and conservators.",
        "And one of the first things they do in looking at a painting is tell which parts have been repaired or damaged since.",
        "And then among those that are left, they use their knowledge in a way that's not apparent to an outsider.",
        "They extract a certain set of features, and then with their knowledge of the artist - those features might be a particular brush stroke or the way a particular ear is done or how hands or fingernails are done - and from their knowledge of how the artists normally would deal with that issue, they'll make a judgment, a decision about whether this is by this artist or a different artist.",
        "So it means basically making a visual assessment based on the features they're looking at?",
        "We make it to downtown and drop Elia off at the factory.",
