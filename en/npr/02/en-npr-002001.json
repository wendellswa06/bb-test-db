        "We worked with the police over there for the rural districts of Ghazni Province, and you know, trying to get the guys equipped and trained was a major challenge.",
        "And once we gave them equipment, oftentimes their chiefs would take it away from them and try and sell them on the market out there.",
        "So, we had to keep our eyes on them very closely.",
        "And that was, you know, three years ago.",
        "I haven't heard much back from a Ghazni back since that time, but I imagine it's still similar.",
        "Let me read you a quote from the article in Foreign Policy Magazine that John Nagl helped write, \"\"As tribal elders in Ghazni Province recently said, they feel 'slapped on one cheek by the government, and on the other cheek by the Taliban.'\"\" Does that describe the situation as far as you knew it?",
        "Well, in some ways.",
        "I don't want to go into names, but when I was there, you know, it was very much a warlord-run province.",
        "The warlord happened to be our buddy; you know, as long as he took care of our interests, we took care of him.",
        "And as it progressed, he moved on to bigger and better things, and you know, in that country, that's the norm.",
        "I mean, we can't criticize it too much, because it did lead to some stability.",
        "But he went in and he made sure people were doing what he wanted them to do.",
        "And when he wasn't in that area - actually, we took away his militia from him as part of the, you know, DDR process, and as a result the Taliban came in and burned down the, you know, district center and destroyed a lot of stuff there.",
        "So, it was, you know, it worked both ways.",
        "I mean, you couldn't have it the way we wanted it in an ideal situation, and we were trying to effect change, and we did gradually, everything from getting, as you talked about, the symptoms that cause counterinsurgency, like, you know, poverty; we had a department of agriculture adviser; we were - bought, like, 50,000 fruit-tree saplings to go plant in one of the districts, actually in several districts out there, along with giving out wheat seed that we bought with serf(ph) money to try and get the Taliban guys back in the fields so they would have something to do other than try and shoot at us.",

        "And police are very important.",

        "We had something like this called CORDS during Vietnam, civil operations and revolutionary development.",
        "And it started going very well before we pulled the plug, pop, smoke, and headed out of Vietnam.",
        "Well, when we went to Afghanistan, we basically - we're trying to reinvent the wheel because nobody could say the V word and that there was this good thing called CORDS, and let's look at it and see how much we can use out of it, which my Department of State adviser and myself looked at that, and we said, hey, here's a model for, for the most part, what we're doing here in Afghanistan.",
        "But when we talked to anybody with stars, they kind of look at - hard stare at their wristwatch...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And they maybe had heard somewhere about CORDS, but really didn't know what it was.",
        "And a former secretary of the Army come visit us in Ghazni, and he'd been talking to the CFC-Alpha commander and mentioning CORDS, and he could tell the guy had no idea what he is talking about.",

        "Col.",
        "NAGL: I've got to tell you, Jerry, history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes.",
        "And the story of counterinsurgency both in Iraq and Afghanistan has been relearning lessons that we knew but intentionally forgot.",

        "The first thing the Romans did when they faced insurgency in a province was build a road there so that they could move troops there quickly.",

        "So, the dedication of the Afghan people to building a better life is extraordinary; the suffering they'd gone through is almost unbelievable, over 30 years of the war.",
