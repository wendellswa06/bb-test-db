        "Does this legislation really accomplish nothing?",
        "In the states that have recently passed the orders, it's too early to say if they've had a measurable effect on murders and suicides.",
        "In 2016 in California, the protective orders were used 86 times.",
        "That's a relatively small number for a state that big.",
        "But Nancy Skinner, the state legislator who pushed the bill through, says 86 is not nothing.",
        "I was very impressed that it had been used and that - I felt confident then that in each of those incidents we likely saved a life or multiple lives.",

        "We're going to take some time in this part of the program to tell you the story of Ruben Cantu, a young Texas man convicted of murder and executed by lethal injection.",
        "In recent years, we've learned that more than a hundred people on death row were actually innocent.",
        "A few of those prisoners had been within hours of execution, but there have been no cases where we know conclusively that an innocent prisoner was actually executed until now.",
        "It appears that Texas executed an innocent man, Ruben Cantu, in 1993.",
        "Now 12 years after his death, two people involved in the case say Cantu was innocent.",
        "Reporter Lise Olsen investigated this story for the Houston Chronicle.",
        "She told us about Ruben Cantu's life as a teen-ager in San Antonio.",
        "Ruben Cantu was a teen-ager who had a mother and father who loved him, but who split up when he was 14.",
        "And his mother moved 20 miles away and he grew up with his dad on literally a mean street in south San Antonio.",
        "He ran with other kids who were known as the Grey Eagles in a sort of loosely organized group that I don't think would qualify as a regular gang but certainly was called that by police.",
        "He struggled in school and he had lots of run-ins with police.",
        "And so when a man was murdered across the street from his house, he was a natural suspect for them.",
        "Well, tell us about the night of that murder.",
        "On the night of that murder, there were two men, Pedro Gomez and Juan Moreno, sleeping in a house under construction that was almost directly across the street from where Ruben Cantu grew up.",
        "And in that house, there was virtually nothing.",
        "They were sleeping in there kind of guarding it because someone had recently stolen a water heater out of it.",
        "And both worked construction, worked for cash.",
        "They were sleeping in their clothes with their pockets full of the money they had earned.",
        "Sometime before midnight, two teen-agers broke into the house and began to rob them, took their watches and tried to take their money.",
        "And as they were doing the robbery--there's different accounts of this, but apparently, Pedro reached under the mattress for a gun that was hidden there.",
        "And at that point, one of the two teen-agers who carried a rifle began to fire at him, almost instantly killing him from all accounts.",
        "And he was shot at least nine times and then the same rifle was turned on his companion, Juan Moreno, who was only 19 years old, recently in the United States from Mexico.",
        "Juan went down and the two people who were there, the boys, teen-agers who attacked them, thought he was dead, too, and they ran away, but Juan survived.",
        "Juan was able to get out of the house, call for help and eventually recovered from his wounds, although he lost a lung, a kidney, a spleen and still has a belly that's pockmarked with bullet holes.",
        "And he eventually turned out to be one of the key witnesses in the trial of Ruben Cantu.",
        "He identified Ruben Cantu as the killer.",
        "And why did he do that?",
        "Why did he identify Ruben Cantu?"

        "Well, Juan's story is--and this is born out by police records, as well--that when he initially survived the shooting, the police came to see him in the hospital and started to show him photos and he thought that they were from the neighborhood.",
        "He thought they were from the barrio there.",
        "And so they began to bring in photos sort of randomly of kids from the neighborhood, showed him a number of photos, including the photo of Ruben Cantu, who lived across the street.",
        "He did not identify Ruben on that first go-around and he didn't identify anyone else, either.",
        "Then three months passed and Juan got better, but really didn't hear anything much more from police.",
        "And then something happened to change all that.",
        "Ruben Cantu one evening was in a place called the Scabaroo Lounge near his house shooting pool with another friend and he ran into an off-duty police officer who was wearing plain clothes and had a couple of guns on under his clothes.",
        "The police officer said that there was no words exchanged between them, that Cantu just up and shot him.",
        "Cantu's version was the officer threatened him and that he had no idea he was a police officer, showed him his gun, and so Ruben Cantu who also carried guns fired at him.",
        "The officer survived that shooting, but almost immediately, even that same day, the sergeant of homicide who was a friend of his decided to reopen the murder investigation against Ruben Cantu and the other unsolved case.",
        "And the next morning, he sent out an officer to Juan Moreno once more to see if he could get an identification of Ruben Cantu again.",
        "Juan Moreno said, `No, this isn't the guy.",
        "And then on a third occasion, the very next day, the same sergeant sent you yet another homicide detective and this time on the third go-around, they brought Juan, who was an illegal immigrant, at that time into the homicide division, sat him down with the homicide detective and the sergeant.",
        "The sergeant said, `I know you know who did it,' showed him again the pictures.",

        "That's right.",
        "The Senate did not pass a spending bill before midnight, and so government funding lapsed.",
        "And this was largely symbolic because most federal offices were already closed for the night.",
        "The reason for all this, though - Republican Senator Rand Paul.",
        "Even though the Senate had enough votes to pass a budget bill, Paul delayed the vote.",
        "He wanted to make a point about increased spending.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Well, you know what?",
        "I think the country is worth a debate till 3 in the morning, frankly.",
        "And he just about got his wish.",
        "The Senate reconvened at 1 a.m., and by 2 o'clock in the morning, they had passed their version of the spending bill.",
        "And so that tossed it over to the House, which is now holding a vote on this bill - a bill, we should say, that does not include changes to immigration policy that Democrats badly wanted."
