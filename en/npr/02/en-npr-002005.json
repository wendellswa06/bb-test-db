        "Yeah.",
        "We've been clear in recent days that not everybody is invested in the stock market.",
        "Only a little more than half of Americans either own stocks directly or through some kind of fund, but that's still more than half of Americans who have probably lost some money here.",

        "They were - at least they were.",
        "There was a lot of exuberance in the market, a lot of enthusiasm about the tax cuts.",
        "That drove stocks up 7 percent in January - an incredibly fast rate of growth.",
        "Then, interest rates are moving higher.",
        "You know, they were near zero for years.",
        "That helped make stocks the only place to get a decent return on your investment.",
        "And investors are concerned rates are going to be moving higher faster.",
        "A week ago, we got a strong job growth number and a strong wage number from the jobs report.",
        "That suggested the Fed might raise rates faster, and that helped trigger - really triggered this sell-off.",
        "And then the market is actually worried about the Fed.",
        "We have a new Fed chair, Jerome Powell, and he says he will follow Yellen's gradual approach to raising rates.",
        "But, you know, there are several open seats on the Fed's policymaking board, and the market doesn't know who's going to fill them and whether they might want to raise rates faster.",
        "And then, Steve, we still have these people who are involved in this investment scheme betting on low volatility in the market.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're still selling stocks to cover their losses.",
        "At least we think they are.",

        "And we should say fortunately no Americans were killed, and they fought back with some massive air power.",
        "But here's the thing - this attack was not launched by ISIS, and this is a sign of just how complex this war is becoming.",
        "Yeah.",

        "There are many, many sides.",

        "Hey, Steve.",
        "So if it wasn't ISIS attacking American troops, who did attack?",
        "Well, Steve, they were Syrian regime militias backed by Russia, and 500 of these fighters using tanks and artillery, they attacked a U.S.-supported Syrian rebel base.",
        "And there were some American military advisers there.",
        "Now, these artillery attacks came, Steve, within just a few hundred yards of that rebel base.",
        "We talked to the commander of the Syrian rebels in the area.",
        "He said he called the Russians because there's a formal process in place to avoid any military mishaps.",
        "Sure.",
        "And that's kind of routine.",

        "Oh, OK.",
        "So just to review here - you've got two countries, the United States and Russia - which could each destroy the world - and they have allies of one country attacking the troops of the other.",

        "You also have ISIS fighters, as we mentioned.",
        "We've got regime forces.",

        "Well, we actually went up to the front with the Turks - the Turkish rebels - and we did talk with Kurdish commanders and troops that are worried even more now.",
        "Hundreds of their fighters are heading up north to fight the Turks who consider all these Kurdish fighters terrorists.",
        "And at this outpost in the north, the Kurds said they often come under fire.",
        "And now, with this Syrian militia attack farther south we were just talking about, the Kurdish commanders are sending their reserve forces down to that base to shore up the defenses.",
        "And all of this is pulling resources away from the fight against ISIS.",
        "So if you have this chaotic situation, is the United States determined to remain in Syria, Tom?",
        "Well, what the American military say is it's going to take about two to six months to defeat ISIS, they say another year or more to stabilize the area with humanitarian aid.",
        "But this is where it gets complicated, Steve - Syrian government and the Russians say you're here illegally.",
        "Even some on Capitol Hill are saying you could be stumbling into a broader conflict without clear objectives.",
