        "Here is NPR's senior news analyst Daniel Schorr.",
        "First, you have to know - if don't already - that lobbying pays a lot better than legislating.",
        "So that may help you to understand a rush to the revolving door in Congress.",
        "So far, six senators and 22 representatives have announced that they are bowing out.",
        "The latest is Mississippi's Republican Senator Trent Lott.",
        "He's abrupt resignation seemed a more surprising since he has fought his way back to Republican whip in the Senate after being bounced as a majority leader because of remarks perceived as racist at a birthday party for Strom Thurmond.",
        "Why would Trent not resign with more than five years left in his term?",
        "Actually he told a news conference he'd been planning to retire in 2006, but he felt he had to stay because of the suffering of his constituents on the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina.",
        "Did new lobbying restrictions play any part?",
        "It didn't have a big role, he said.",
        "What's that about?",
        "Well, in one of the suggestions towards ethics enforcement, Congress voted to lengthen the cooling off period before a former member can engage in lobbying from one to two years.",
        "That regulation goes into effect on January 1st.",
        "Senator Lott said he had learned from colleagues the lot of work could be designated as consulting rather than direct lobbying.",
        "Maybe, but Senator Lott was apparently not convinced that this creative interpretation of lobbying would hold up.",
        "And so to stand in the safe side, it seems wise to resign before the end of the year and take advantage of the shorter cooling off period.",
        "Senator Lott's son, Chester, is a lobbyist and he says his father will probably make a final decision on his future plans over the Christmas holiday.",
        "Oh yes, Governor Haley Barbour now has the task of appointing a senator to serve out Lott's unexpired term.",
        "That would probably have been Representative Chip Pickering, but Pickering is retiring from Congress himself.",
        "Will the last legislator to go through this revolving door of Congress please turn out the lights?",
        "This is Daniel Schorr.",
        "Brazil may be better known for beach and bossa nova, but travel to the interior and it's rodeo time with fans stomping at the beat of \"\"lady-done-me-wrong\"\" songs and other regional rhythms."

        "Because it's a treachery to come in to northern Iraq en masse.",
        "That is to say, they were to bring large numbers of troops, equipment, tanks, et cetera.",
        "They will have to go across the Kurdish - Iraqi-Kurdish controlled territory, and most likely, this will create a clash between Iraqi Kurds and the Turks.",
        "And since it is their territory, you can imagine that the Iraqi Kurds will inflict casualties and vice versa and this will probably draw Turkey into an incredible quagmire much like ours in Iraq at the moment.",

        "These are fairly remote isolated places.",
        "Can't the Iraqi Kurds say, lay down your arms time to give it up, guys?",
        "I think that's what ultimately will happen, but before the Iraqi Kurds can do that to - and send out to the PKK, they want some assurances from Turkey.",
        "And what the problem has been is if you want a lack of communication between Ankara and the Iraqi Kurds.",
        "The Ankara government and its military refuses to talk to the KRG, the Kurdish Regional Government because it doesn't recognize it.",
        "Even though the United States, the Iraqi government and everybody else recognize the KRG, the Turks refuse to because they said that Iraqi constitution has not taken its final form.",
        "I mean, that's the lame excuse.",
        "But the new problem is that they worry that the Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq will ultimately achieve a very robust federal status within Iraq or maybe even become independent.",

        "This is a very remote territory.",
        "They are not near any major settlement areas.",
