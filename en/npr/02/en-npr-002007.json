        "David's story--and David was a good friend of Ruben's--is that he told Ruben about the robbery and what happened, about how someone died, and so Ruben knew who was there.",
        "Ruben knew who else was involved because of David, is what David's account is, but that David says Ruben never wanted someone else to go to death row in his place even to save his own life, that he always felt that there was some other way for him to be cleared.",
        "He really believed that the courts would question the way Juan Moreno came to identify him on the third pass.",
        "He also believed that the fact that he was only 17 when this happened would carry weight with the courts and that he would never need to use this information.",
        "And this is nothing that we can ask Ruben about, but I do have a lot of letters that Ruben had written that do urge his attorney to talk to David to try to get exculpatory information, to talk to other people, and she did not.",
        "Well, now what does that lawyer say?",
        "What do the prosecutors say?",
        "What does the judge say?",
        "What do they all say now that they have this information?",
        "Well, the lawyer has always felt that this was a travesty of justice.",
        "She was very unprepared to represent Ruben Cantu at the time she did it.",
        "She was a really young lawyer, had no death penalty experience.",
        "She didn't know the procedures for the 5th Circuit or the federal courts or even how to write a state writ, which were all things she was having to do for him.",
        "But she feels a lot of--I think always and has always even before this came out, a lot of remorse, a lot of sadness about what happened to Ruben Cantu.",
        "She says it's the worse experience in her life.",
        "So now are officials working to posthumously exonerate Cantu?",
        "Well, the DA who was DA at the time is very troubled by this case and he has urged for that.",
        "The current DA in San Antonio who had a small role in the case because at the time she was a judge and she set Ruben Cantu's execution date--she so far says she's more concerned about the possibility that there might be another murderer out there who's never been punished and that she's concerned that someone's perjury might have actually killed someone else.",
        "She's actually considering--she's told our columnist Rick Casey--the possibility of pursing murder charges against Juan Moreno, murder by perjury basically.",
        "Wow.",
        "That's shocking to the victim who was almost killed that night and who...",
        "That's right.",
        "...was forced to identify the wrong man, or who says he was forced to identify the wrong man.",
        "She feels that he has not so far presented a case that he was forced illegally in anything that would have been illegal by the homicide detectives.",
        "And so he bears responsibility for perjury.",
        "She hasn't determined that he, indeed, committed perjury but she says she's looking at the possibility that she could charge him with murder of Ruben Cantu, because his statement is what--it was the only evidence against Ruben Cantu.",
        "There was no other evidence.",
        "There was no physical evidence, there was no murder weapon ever found, there was no fingerprints found that put Ruben in that house.",
        "It was Juan Moreno's word."
