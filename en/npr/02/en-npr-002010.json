        "Is that true?",
        "What assurances did we give them?",
        "Well, the U.S.",
        "official position has always been that the United States wants Iraq to remain as a whole.",
        "How Iraq governs itself internally, whether it's a federation or a unit or a state, is up to the Iraqis.",
        "The United States, however, since 1998, since Secretary Albright arranged this ceasefire between the two Kurdish factions in Northern Iraq, has been committed to an Iraqi federation precisely because the United States thinks that a federal arrangement is the best solution for Iraq in terms of keeping the Kurds within Iraq.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So, if you're looking for specific assurances, the United States was never in favor of a separate Kurdish state.",
        "So that's not - that should not have come up as in the discussions in the first place.",
        "And when he refers to the airbase, he's referring to Incirlik like a big airbase in southeastern Turkey that is used by the United States to fly in and off a lot of supplies to Iraq and, of course, then on to Afghanistan, some of them as well.",
        "That's correct."

        "Thank you.",
        "And the question about this - there are Turks not just in northern Iraq and south Turkey, there are Kurds in northern Syria and northern Iran as well.",
        "In fact, the Kurds are generally identified as the largest single group in the world that does not have their own state.",
        "That's right.",
        "Actually, I would say western - northwestern Iran that this - if you look at the map, there is a large chunk of territory that is usually recognized as being Kurdish inhabited.",
        "Of course, people move over time and some places become denser and other places become less dense.",
        "But it is a general (unintelligible) it encloses northwest - northeastern Syria, northern Iraq, obviously, southeastern Turkey and part of eastern Turkey, as well as northwest Iran.",
        "And you've had, over the years, different groups fighting for independence, cultural rights, political rights, sometimes politically, sometimes - in other words, in nonviolent fashion and sometimes violently.",
        "So it has not always been violent, and I think we should stress the fact that political activity in Turkey among the Kurds has not always been violent.",
        "Unidentified Man #1: (Singing) Why can't you see?",
        "There's been a lot of political activity which has meant trying to get into parliament, trying to get to through better representation and pushing the system.",
        "And as Turkey democratizes, these demands will be better responded to.",
        "And the closer the Turkey gets to Europe, the better off Turkish Kurds will be.",
        "And it should be pointed that in Turkey, until not so very long ago, the Turks did not admit that such things as Kurds existed.",
        "They called them Mountain Turks, and thereof prohibited the use its Kurdish language.",
        "That's correct.",
        "It couldn't - actually in the 1930s, you could be fined by for every Kurdish word you use by the police, if a policeman - if he heard you on the streets.",
        "I mean it was kind of absurd.",
        "But it is really the events in northern Iraq following the Iran-Iraq War, later on the 1991 Persian Gulf War that pushed the Kurds in to the world stage.",
        "And it became very difficult for Turkey to continue to argue that there are no Kurds in Turkey."

        "I mean, are they not allowed to practice their religion?",
        "Are they being forced to live in certain Kurdish ghettos, or deny economic or academic opportunities relative to other Turks?",
        "It - I gather the answers to this would vary depending on which country your in, Henri Barkey, but certainly the Kurds are allowed to practice their religion.",
        "Almost all of them are Sunni Muslims.",
        "But - go ahead, please.",
        "That's correct.",

        "Hence, it is so very limited.",
        "You can not have a party that advocates for greater Kurdish rights, for instance.",
        "That's against the constitution.",
        "So any political activity that is - associates you with an ethnicity, specifically Kurdish ethnicity, is by default illegal, and therefore subject to persecution.",
        "And in fact, many Kurdish parties had been closed over and over and over.",
        "And when leaders, for instance, even make a speech in Kurdish, they get hold up in front of the court systems and tried.",
        "So it is a little bit of an absurd situation because in - the Turks insist, for instance, that Turcomans in Iraq shall have right as Turcomans as its separate ethnic group, but they won't want it acknowledge it in Turkey.",
        "Turks were anxious that in Kosovo the Turkish language was just spoken by very minute number of people become part of the official languages of Kosovoian, it was actually made so recently.",
