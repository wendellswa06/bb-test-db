        "They are stating that we don't know what chocolate is; therefore we won't notice if they change it, and I don't think that that's true, and I think that that's what this lovely open comment period is going to prove to them, is that we do pay attention to what is in our chocolate, and I don't want to have to flip over the chocolate bar to read the ingredients to know what I'm getting.",
        "I want to know on the front that it is chocolate with cocoa butter.",

        "I was telling your screener that if manufacturers started using sub-par ingredients such as, you know, not using cocoa butter, that that's okay with me because, you know - if a Snickers started using it, and it tasted different, I would no longer buy Snickers, and the gourmet chocolate places, you know, could actually benefit from this by billing themselves as, you know, quality makers of chocolate and stuff.",
        "I've tasted some gourmet chocolate bars that were $8 a bar that, you know, I had to look at the ingredients and see what was in it, but it tasted like crap.",

        "However, I just think that if we label it different - I just think it's so confusing to the consumer, and I think that they're asking to know what's in their food, and they're searching out pure foods in all matters of foods that they're getting in the market, so I think that just - I think the label chocolate should be chocolate.",
        "What label would you give the chocolate with vegetable oil?",
        "Well, I mean I think there's other things out there.",

        "How did you find out about it?",

        "Well, the petition actually says that it's a safe and suitable substitution, and if there are people who are concerned about different tropical oils being substituted for cocoa butter - cocoa butter has already been shown to be neutral for blood cholesterol levels, so if you don't want to end up with some palm kernel oil or hydrogenated oil or coconut oil, it's very important that the FDA know that it's not a suitable substitution because of these issues.",

        "No matter what happens with this, even if this were to go through, high-end chocolate will still exist.",
        "It always does.",
        "I mean, you will always find people who are willing to pay a premium for the premium product, and some of the members of the Chocolate Manufacturers Association have already said that they - even though they may be permitted to do these things, they will not because they have integrity and a history of creating really good quality chocolate products.",
