        "And how did you get started as the doyenne of list-keeping?",
        "Well, so I call myself a to-do list-ologist(ph), and that's kind of just giving myself a title and almost like a post-doc degree for something that I've spent eight years doing.",
        "It began eight years ago.",
        "In 2000, I started publishing a magazine called To-Do List, and originally the idea was to use to-do list as a metaphor for all the things that we have to do to feel like we're grownups.",
        "So, whether that's get a job, find a boyfriend, you know, feel like you have some purpose in life.",

        "But in fact, I was wrong, and they did, and they sent them in droves - people of all ages.",
        "And I just quickly found that it was so incredibly fascinating to open an envelope and read someone else's to-do list that it wasn't just a list, it was almost like reading someone's autobiography, but the very spare bullet-point version because you start to construct a story in your mind about that person and what's going on in their lives.",
        "And so it got to the point where I had about 5,000 lists, list of all kinds, to-do lists - things to do before I die, things to do before I get pregnant.",
        "And they were collecting in my apartment in boxes.",
        "And I was like, oh, my God.",

        "And happy holidays to you.",

        "And so most of my weekends, a lot of my time was sacrificed spending time in the library.",
        "And I just had to put down on paper what I have done in order to sort of see my life in paper and, you know, think that, you know, I have done things outside of studying and trying to pursue the dream of becoming a physician.",
        "Well, Cru Powlie, thanks very much for calling in to share that with us.",
