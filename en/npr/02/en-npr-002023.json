        "And so he went out there, and this was in the final days of the glory days of network radio.",
        "And along came television in the early 1950s and all the programming went away.",
        "All the network programming jumped over to the TV side.",
        "Little station owners around the country were left wondering what they would put on the air.",
        "Todd Storz's great revelation came - he used to hang out at a diner watching the waitresses clean up because he had a particular eye on one waitress.",
        "And he would watch as they would plunk their nickels into the jukebox and play the same songs over and over.",
        "This inspired Todd Storz to break two taboos in radio.",
        "One taboo was against playing records on the radio.",
        "It simply wasn't done.",
        "The musicians union wouldn't allow it.",
        "And the other was against playing the same song more than once in a given month.",
        "Todd Storz said people want to hear their favorite songs over and over.",
        "Seems obvious to us today, but it was a revelation in the early 1950s and it changed radio, because radio suddenly became something that appealed to one generation.",
        "The new music was coming along - the early R&B and rock and roll - and that brought one generation together on the radio.",
        "And he didn't necessarily introduce that kind of music.",
        "That happened later.",
        "But he invented the format, the jingles, the action-packed sound of AM radio, and in fact put a big stack of limiters on his equipment so that the sound would - the signal would sound louder and broadcast, you know, the - the volume never changed.",
        "Everything was go, go, the sort of new frantic pace of American life.",
        "The interstates were being built.",
        "America was being suburbanized.",
        "People were spending more time in their cars.",
        "There were now radios in the cars.",
        "And that quicker pace of life was reflected by the speed and the action of AM Top 40 radio.",
        "Yet within a period of 10 years, AM Top 40 radio was a medium as dead as dead could be.",
        "Not that it wasn't on the air everywhere.",
        "It was.",
        "But it was stultifying.",
        "It really was.",
        "The music was derided as bubblegum.",
        "But along came a whole new frontier in the form of FM radio.",

        "And that opened up a whole new frontier.",
        "Along with the technological advance, which was in the late '60s, early '70s, suddenly cars were equipped with FM radios.",
        "And that made this a fertile field for all kinds of experimentation on FM: the underground FM sound, the freeform movement, lots of new ideas in radio that also served to chop up the audience.",
        "In the Top 40 days, just like in TV when there were just three networks, there really weren't many programming choices.",
