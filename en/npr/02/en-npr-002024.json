        "So you can start up a little radio station on the Web maybe just for the folks who share your passion for Latvian folk songs.",
        "But on the other hand, the radio industry has spent the last 10, 20 years moving in entirely the opposite direction, toward a much blander, more predictable kind of programming.",
        "So there is this great frustration that I hear everywhere I go about corporate radio, about the sameness of stations, about the loss of local programming, and instead we get nationally syndicated programming.",
        "And so I think there's a craving for radio that sounds like the place that it serves, for the local connections and the kinds of small stations like she's talking about.",

        "Both commercial and public radio are based on drawing as large an audience as they possibly can, and so they're looking at ways to eliminate what some people in public radio call seams, those lines that divide different kinds of programming so that maybe a jazz show comes on after TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And some people in the radio business say, oh no, you want to provide the same thing all around the clock so that people come in large numbers to your radio station.",
