        "Thank you.",
        "Listening to the images, you know, that were described, I guess, on the radio itself.",
        "That week was an extraordinary moment for radio.",
        "There were high points, such as NPR's coverage, a few other places around the dial.",
        "But there was also a revelation to many in the industry on that day, because on September 11th most of the radio stations in the United States were caught with no one to tell that story.",
        "The cost cutting at commercial stations had been such and so many news departments, news staffs had been eviscerated in the preceding few years, that there was no one on hand to tell the story.",
        "And so station after station on the radio had to simply pipe in the sound from the local TV coverage.",
        "So you had simulcasting of TV coverage where…",
        "CNN, yeah."

        "And what the cost cutting - you know, why radio listening is down across the country.",
        "Well, that was a very good illustration of it.",

        "There's a lot to be said for that.",
        "Rush Limbaugh, like most of the other very successful talk show hosts in radio, is a former Top 40 DJ.",
        "He was known as Jeff Christie when he was a Top 40 jock.",
        "And going back and listening to some of his antics back then it's almost identical to the act that he does now.",
        "But what he realized was that music didn't work on AM anymore because of the superior fidelity of FM radio.",
        "And he transformed himself into a talk host.",
        "He does a show that's very much a Top 40 radio show, except that the callers are the songs.",
        "Everything else is just about the same.",
        "The pace, the music bumpers, the jingles, all of the what they call the formatics are the same.",
        "But Rush Limbaugh very much took that old AM Top 40 audience - now a little bit older -and brought them back to AM with a much more volatile kind of talk radio than anyone had heard before.",
        "Also, thanks to the federal government, which had deregulated content to such an extent that talk radio really had the limits removed and talk hosts were allowed to rant and rave on one particular side of an issue without worrying about the Fairness Doctrine.",
        "Fairness Doctrine, yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's interesting you say that.",
        "Rush was using the same format.",

        "While your guest maybe nostalgic for Mr. Storz new take on radio - this is back to our conversation about Todd Storz and his invention of Top 40 - it should be pointed out that it is this very aesthetic that has brought commercial radio to the very low point it is out today.",
        "Shouting ads, interrupting the same eight to 10 songs played a hundred times a day is not a good thing.",
        "It is because of this format that people like myself listen to NPR.",
        "Well, it's certainly true that radio was then and remains even -has grown even more commercial.",
        "Some of the big radio companies are now pulling back because the ad load, the number of minutes per hour of advertising, had bumped up to about 30 and listeners were starting to change their position on the dial.",
        "But I would argue that Top 40 radio really had a socially transformative impact, because it brought everybody together under the same tent.",
        "Now, obviously some of the music was bubble gum.",
        "It was superficial in content.",
        "However, when everyone is together there's a common cultural conversation going on.",
        "And I think we're in danger in this very atomized, Internet driven world of dividing up into lots of little sub-communities.",
        "And we lose both politically and socially the glue that we had when we had, paradoxically enough, fewer choices and everyone had to sit around and listen to that Top 40 station.",
        "And if you didn't like the song you waited for the next one.",
        "It was a different - and then you could go to work and share a conversation about what did that crazy DJ do yesterday or what show was on TV.",
        "Fewer choices means, I think, in some ways more community.",
        "And it's interesting to see the same thing that happened to radio all those years ago, happening to television.",
        "You still have the three big networks, but their audience share continues to dip and dip and dip.",
        "And you've got formats - ESPN; you've got all news stations on cable.",
        "The same kind of market fragmentation is happening on television.",
        "Right.",
        "And obviously they're being left behind, both, you know, radio, television, newspapers, print in general are all losing market share to the Internet.",
        "But what's happening there is that people are organizing themselves into very strong and powerful communities, but very small ones.",
        "And so there isn't the same kind of common foundation to American pop culture that there one was."
