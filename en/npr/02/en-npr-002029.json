        "He tuned it, and I looked around.",
        "I said, `Ooh, that sounds nice.",
        "And then he played a few notes, and then I really turned around and looked at it and said, `My God, that's my Guarnerius!",
        "He said, `How could you have known?",
        "`Well,' I said, `this is the cello that I had from the age of 12.",
        "And it was stolen from me.",
        "And I said in the intermission, `Please, don't get away.",
        "I want to--must play on the cello to make a hundred percent sure that it is mine.",
        "So in the intermission I went to the artists' room, and he brought the cello, and I played on it all the cadenzas that I could think of--most difficult stuff.",

        "The original was even whiter.",
        "This animal is predominantly white on the upper torso, white with black splotches, but still has some tawny color in its legs, so almost certainly a different individual.",
        "Charles, tell me how you spotted this animal.",
        "What were you doing?",
        "I was with a team from Wildlife Conservation Society, and what we were doing was we were actually counting elephants in an area of thick bushland outside the national park.",
        "And we had been doing this for about two days, and we were flying backwards and forwards over this area.",

        "Yes, it is.",

        "It is indeed.",
        "I think it's a full-grown male giraffe.",
        "It was in a group of--I think it was a total of five giraffes, some other females and a younger animal.",
        "And it's obviously survived at least a few years out there in what is really, for a giraffe, quite a dangerous environment.",
        "So despite the fact that it's so visible, it seems to be actually doing well for itself.",
        "Tell me about the area where this giraffe is.",
        "What kind of terrain is it, and are there a lot of people around there or hunters or lions or what?",
        "It's a fairly arid area.",
        "It is village land.",

        "There's not much poaching out in that area, and so it will probably be fairly safe from humans.",
        "Will anything happen in this area because there's a white giraffe there?",
        "I mean, is there anything to be done about this white giraffe, other than take its picture and say, `Huh, that's kind of an oddity'?",
        "Well, I think what this does is that it draws attention to the fact that many of the national parks in east Africa at least often depend upon spill-over areas outside the national parks, which are often owned by villages.",
        "And if you want to try and protect the entire ecosystem, then you do need to concentrate conservation efforts on village areas as well outside the national park.",
