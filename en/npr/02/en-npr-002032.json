        "The US State Department is trying to do something about the proliferation of conspiracy theories.",
        "It runs a Web site that presents the most popular theories and then points out in great detail why they are wrong, listing, for instance, the names of all 76 Jews who died in the World Trade Center attacks in an attempt to counter the belief, widely held in the Arab world, that no Jews were killed since they were all warned ahead of time.",

        "They've usually been in the margins, and they're not complete reproductions of the first version.",
