        "Justice O'Connor voted to strike down the statute in 2000 in a close vote, 5-4.",
        "But now she and former Chief Justice Rehnquist have been replaced by the new chief justice and Justice Samuel Alito.",
        "So what's at stake here are two things at least: the continued constitutional significance of the court's past requirement that late term abortion restrictions have to have an exception to preserve a woman's health...",
        "That's sort of the central key point of this case, isn't it?",
        "That is the central key point.",
        "And in its hearings, Congress found that it's never necessary to preserve a woman patient's health to perform a partial birth abortion.",
        "This, however, is contrary to some other scientific opinions.",
        "So one question is how deferential the court will be to this finding that Congress made before it passed the prohibition.",

        "This is a gray area.",
        "I mean, I think that it's, you could make a more plausible argument about the legality of this kind of operation than you could if it was actually listening in on phone calls.",
