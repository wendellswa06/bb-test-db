        "I mean, this is such a difficult issue for Americans and one that raises such conflicting emotions.",
        "Some people have suggested that the whole reason that the president dismissed Porter Goss at this juncture and promoted or sought to promote Michael Hayden was because he wanted this debate to happen again.",
        "Because he felt that in advance of the congressional elections, this was an issue that looked good for Republicans, law and order, protecting the country, doing what you need to in order to survive in the war on terror.",
        "What's interesting is that now, with this USA Today story, you have a significant backlash.",
        "And I think that a lot of Americans are going to be asking themselves how far, exactly, are we going to let these people go?",
        "And one final question and that is, when the president said, first of all, leaks of this sort of information damage national security.",
        "And when we're asking about other ways we're tracking down al-Qaida, should we read that as essentially confirmation of the story?",
        "I wouldn't necessarily.",

        "I'm not sure that any terrorist really cares whether or not you go to get a FISA warrant or don't in order to look at the traffic of his communications.",
        "But, well, we've never heard an explanation, at least not in public.",
        "And perhaps when General Hayden's nomination comes before the Intelligence Committee next week, as far as we understand it, he can provide an explanation of how revealing the methods here would damage national security.",
