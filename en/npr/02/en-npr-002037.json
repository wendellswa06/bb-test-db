        "But, nevertheless, the remarks were addressed to the Iranian people as much as they were to as they were to the government of Iran.",
        "Well, I think both the president's remarks and the secretary of state's remarks reflect the horns of the dilemma on which the U.S.",

        "It has to adopt both a hard-lined position and also a more conciliatory one.",
        "And I think striking the right balance between these two has proved very difficult for the U.S.",
        "And, as we heard from the correspondent in Tehran, Kasra Naji, the hard-lined tone in Washington is not exactly helpful to making the offer of negotiations credible.",

        "That is not necessarily the case and there are all - there is a case to be made for a dual energy structure for Iran, and the idea that they would like to sell their oil and have nuclear power for their population.",
        "But, just for the sake of argument, let's assume that this is a nascent nuclear weapons program.",
        "I am troubled with the elevation of this program to an existential threat, with respect to the United States.",
        "This administration has done this with Iran, it's done it with North Korea and it's done it in a number of other instances, as far as what constitutes an existential threat to U.S.",
        "security.",
        "The simple fact is this - there is one country that presents an existential threat to the United States, and it has for over 50 years, and that is Russia.",
        "They have thousands of nuclear weapons that could be targeted on this country before this radio program is over.",
        "And the idea that we would not sit down with Iran because we have many of these preconditions that we would like to impose on them is - there's an arrogance here.",
        "And I will tell you this, I'm a hawk, I do not want to see Iran with nuclear weapons.",

        "About two-thirds of the proven oil reserves in the world are in the Persian Gulf, or the Arabian Gulf, depending on which side you're looking from.",
        "The U.S.",
        "doesn't so much import a lot of that oil, but all the oil is tied together in international markets.",
        "The reason Iran matters, is that it is in an incredibly energy-rich part of the world, and its behavior over the last 30 years has been destabilizing to friends of the United States.",
        "Yes, that's one way to look at it.",
        "In other words, some might argue, well, no matter how you feel about this question as an original proposition, it was only six years ago that the court struck down a very similar statute.",
        "A respect for precedent suggests that the outcome should be the same here.",
        "So the issue is not only could those bombs hit the United States - I think they don't have the ability to launch missiles.",
        "If you want to talk about what could they smuggle on a ship, it's a whole separate set of issues.",
        "The immediate issue is that Iran is a destabilizing power in American eyes, in a very, very strategically important part of the world not only for the United States, but for all of America's allies, as well.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, I guess that's fine, except that we have for - again for over 50 years, not only protected ourselves through deterrence, but we have extended a nuclear umbrella over our allies.",
        "And up until fairly recently, that was related to - that was simply limited to Europe.",
        "I do not see...",
        "And Japan.",
        "...right, and I just don't understand why extensions of that umbrella not only the nuclear deterrent, but our conventional deterrent could also be -those kinds of security guarantees could not be made to our allies in the Gulf to ensure the security of petrochemicals or petroleum shipped out of the Gulf.",
        "You know, we've had these running, you know, semi-conflicts with the Russians in the Persian Gulf, in the Mediterranean, over the years and none of them have resulted in a shooting war.",
        "And the simple fact is that I don't see why those security guarantees that we're perfectly capable of rendering cannot also be rendered to our allies in that region.",
        "It is true.",
        "It is a destabilizing influence that Iran is trying to present.",
        "But, that said, it is not something that cannot be remedied.",
        "And I'm not sure that elevating their program to a status that it really does not have yet, and probably will not attain, is the right approach."

        "Shaul Bakhash, I wanted to get your input on this.",
        "Well, I think the caller raises a good point in that Iran is still many years away from acquiring a nuclear weapon, if that is its intention; and that Iran is very unlikely to try to use such a weapon against the United States, or maybe even in an offensive way.",
        "But it is a fact that it would be a destabilizing, new element in the situation in the Persian Gulf.",
        "It might cause other Persian Gulf states to want nuclear weapons of their own.",
        "Israel, obviously feels this would be an existential threat to it.",
        "So I think there's good reason to try to dissuade the Iranians from seeking nuclear weapons, if that is their intention.",

        "Go ahead, Jon Alterman.",
        "Just that there's also a real estate problem, which is a lot of these countries are very small and very close to Iran.",
        "So you don't have the ability you have in the United States to really shoot down missiles on their way over.",
        "In many cases, you have ports; and when the port's obliterated, the whole country's obliterated.",

        "Yeah.",
        "There's nothing left.",
        "Yes, but I think that really is not putting the problem in the right context.",
        "The idea that Iran would fire missiles or nuclear weapons or nuclear bomb at its Persian Gulf neighbors I think is so far fetched as not to be realistic.",
        "The problem is that Iran with nuclear weapons would perhaps exercise diplomacy more aggressively, would throw its weight around much more aggressively and so forth.",
        "So it's a destabilizing element not because Iran would fire nuclear weapons at its neighbors, but because it would make Iran a much stronger and more - less predictable power in the Persian Gulf."

        "At this point, does he have any room to crawl back to accept American conditions or some fudge of American conditions?",
        "Well, he certainly, you know, as the speaker has suggested, his rhetoric has resonated with at least elements in the Persian population.",

        "Iran has always said that it won't give up a right to fuel enrichment.",

        "And when you make that conceptual shift, it has a number of implications.",
        "And one of them I think is that when you have an opportunity for multilateral negotiations, you have to engage in them.",
        "And some people would point out that similar negotiations are underway, stuttering and stopping, that way with North Korea.",
        "But, nevertheless, nobody has asked North Korea to stop nuclear enrichment or even construction of nuclear weapons as a precondition to those talks.",
        "Well, and the other thing is I think that people are missing the fact that this is not the first time we've had face-to-face discussions with the Iranians.",
        "We reportedly had a lot of face-to-face discussions with the Iranians in Geneva in 2002 over Afghanistan.",
        "Now, granted that was a difference because we were largely on the same side - and on the specific issue of proliferation we tend to be on opposite sides - but that's an example in this administration of speaking face-to-face with the Iranians in a purportedly multilateral framework.",
        "But people understand that the real people who have to be in the room are the Americans and the Iranians.",
        "And often times people leave the room and these negotiations go on and are very, very constructive.",

        "On the one hand, we all know that terrorism organizations and states sponsoring terrorism misuse information in a very - it's a very, very, very good pull use to mislead people.",
        "On the other hand, they understand the decision process is limited and we kind of understand the democratic loopholes.",
        "And so while we're debating and talking about, should we talk to them?",
        "Should we negotiate with them?",
        "They're progressing on their nuclear plan and they're really close to getting there.",
        "Now, the bad part of it is that, while time goes by, they're progressing; and if we do, at a certain point, do intervene, then our very big tsunami of terrorism is going to hit the world and is going to hit American interests all over the place.",
        "I have a question for you experts there.",
        "What do you think Mr. Ahmadinejad did in Syria, another state sponsor of terrorism, when he visited a few weeks or months ago and met there with Mr. Imad Mugniyah, which is a fellow we really should be focusing on."
