        "On the other hand, of course, you know, the U.S., having taken a very hard-line on this issue in the beginning and having had to retreat again and again, also expended valuable time which it might have picked up on earlier to address Iran's ...",

        "Still, others think a winsome statue in Salem risks trivializing the tragedy of 1692 when 20 people in town were accused of witchcraft and put to death.",

        "Now Justice O'Connor, who was in that past this sort of exquisitely fact-sensitive and nuanced justice, who provided the swing vote in numerous affirmative action cases in the past, is of course no longer on the court.",
        "So at stake here may be not only the use of this practice in primary and secondary schools, but if the opinion should be written in a categorically way to prohibit the use of race as a consideration in educational decisions in any school, then the court's recent precedents upholding affirmative action and admission to the University of Michigan Law School may also be threatened.",
        "Okay.",
        "Any other big issues we should watch for this term?",
        "Well, yes, there a big environmental law case before the court that raises the question of whether the Environmental Protection Agency has the authority and the obligation under the Clean Air Act to regulate mobile sources of greenhouse gases - vehicles chiefly.",
        "In the Bush administration the EPA has claimed that it doesn't have the authority to regulate such emissions.",
        "But Massachusetts and several other states, cities and organizations have sued the EPA, and they argue that it not only has the power but the obligation to regulate these emissions.",
        "So these are huge issues of environmental law in this case.",
        "But the outcome may in the end turn on the somewhat arcane question of what lawyers call standing; that is, whether those who brought the case really suffered enough injury to give them a right to sue.",
        "There's some conflicting recent past decisions on this question and they make this case both an important one and a hard one to call.",

        "That's right.",
        "The court decided 75 cases after argument last term.",
        "And that was actually a much smaller number than they used to decide back in the '80s, when they would sometimes decide twice that many.",
        "So it's easy to focus on hot-button cases, high-profile cases.",
        "But of course there are many, many others, some quite important, others more routine, that the court will take up before its term ends at the end of the spring."

        "So far court watchers have looked back at the last term to see what the voting affinities of the two new justices might have been, and they've discovered that the new chief justice, Roberts, has voted most often with Justice Scalia.",
        "Justice Alito has voted most often with Chief Justice Roberts.",
        "But Alito only voted in 36 cases last term, so that's probably not a large enough sample to make possible any confident predictions.",
        "And each of the two men voted in a way that was somewhat surprising in at least one or two cases.",
        "There's really a potential here for Justice Kennedy to emerge as the new swing justice, somewhat as Justice O'Connor was during her tenure, and his vote will be especially critical in the abortion and the affirmative action cases that we mentioned.",
        "I understand that Chief Justice Roberts, at his partial term last term, he tried really hard to forge consensus among the justices, something that hadn't been happening much in the last few years.",
        "That's right, and in the somewhat brief period of his presiding over the court last term, he had a great deal of success.",
        "The court decided nearly half of the cases that it decided after argument without dissent, and that's a much higher percentage of cases without dissent than the court had had in the past.",
        "So he has shown an inclination to use his power to assign opinions to a justice for writing.",
        "He can do that when he's in the majority, to try to forge consensus.",
        "He's said that he would like the justices to write decisions on narrower rather than broader grounds, to aid the achievement of consensus.",

        "There's been a lot in the news recently about issues of military tribunals, interrogation of terrorism suspects, access to the courts, habeas corpus for those held in detention.",
        "Are any of these issues likely to come up before the court this term?",
        "Not likely, but they are almost certain to come up before the court again, and it might be sooner than you would think.",
        "It might be next term, for example, the term that begins about a year from now, because Mr. Hamdan, who was the named party in the court's important decision last term, Hamdan v.",
        "Rumsfeld, his case was sent back down to the court of appeals below, and because of some features of his situation, he might be perfectly situated to mount a challenge to the new rules that Congress just enacted concerning the treatment of detainees, the rules governing military commissions, the availability of habeas corpus to test one's detention.",
        "So I do expect these issues to come back to the court before too long, but probably not in this term.",
