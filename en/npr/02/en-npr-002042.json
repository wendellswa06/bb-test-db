        "Really?",
        "These are just little, like, steel-looking boxes and they're just on poles?",
        "They're about--I would say they're probably about chest-height.",
        "They're green boxes made of some kind of metal and if you open them up, there's a little kind of copper spigot that pours water into a small sink.",
        "And the Department of Environmental Protection goes around and tests about 500 locations each month to make sure the water is good quality.",

        "Who sets the timers on the traffic lights?",
        "How is the traffic controlled?",
        "There's something called the Traffic Management Center which is run by the New York City Department of Transportation.",
        "It's actually located out in Long Island City, which is in Queens.",
        "And they basically control all the traffic lights either directly from there or some of the traffic lights actually have to be adjusted at source.",
        "But most of them, the great majority of them, somewhere around 6,000 of them, actually can be adjusted remotely.",
        "They monitor them through sensors at the intersection and if they see that traffic is piling up too much in one direction, they can actually adjust the timing of the light remotely by cable from their location in Queens.",
        "It's fascinating.",
        "I mean, when you describe the streets as a platform--we think of it as the ground or ground level.",
        "By calling it a plat--it's almost arbitrary.",
        "It could be anywhere.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, it's not just the streets.",
        "If you think about it, it's the streets and the sidewalks.",
        "It's everything that's located essentially between the buildings in New York and in other major cities.",
        "It's all tied together in a set of different systems that are going round the clock.",
        "There's also a set of governmental systems.",
        "I mean, New York City--just, again, talking about the roads, there've got to be a dozen different agencies responsible for different roads, tunnels, bridges, that sort of thing.",
        "There's probably about a dozen of them in the region as a whole if you think about it as a tristate region--New York, New Jersey and Connecticut--which is often how we think about it.",
        "Jersey state Department of Transportation, New York state Department of Transportation, Connecticut Department of Transportation, then there's the New York City agencies, then there's the Port Authority, which is bistate, then you have highway authorities for particular roads.",
        "So you have quite a network of them, but the actually are all tied together in trying to manage the traffic collectively, believe it or not.",
        "I have a question, as someone who's spent a lot of time as a pedestrian in New York and, you know, sometimes those lights--they're timed, they're not timed to try and get across the street at a certain time or when the light is not in your favor, you've got this little button that's on the side and you push it to walk.",
        "Do those things work?",
        "You know, there's a lot of them in the city.",
        "Some of them work and most of them don't.",
        "I think at last count there were about 3,200 of them that are still on the poles and only about a quarter of them actually work.",
        "The rest of them are there purely for show.",
        "They once worked and they don't anymore."

        "And what I want to know is why do the radiators bang when the heat comes on?",

        "That was one of the top 10 questions that I had when I set out to write this book.",
        "And it's very interesting.",
        "To get up to the various floors and tall buildings, the steam pipes have to do a series of turns and bends to come up through the various floors.",
        "And while gas can move through curvy pipes without any noise or any aftereffect, as steam moves through it can occasionally collect into water droplets, and the banging that you hear is often those water droplets, which are not able to gracefully make the curve in a pipe.",
        "Those are noisy droplets.",
        "The are indeed, particularly about 5 in the morning, which is when you usually hear them.",

        "A number of apartment buildings do; a number of dry cleaners do.",

        "I wouldn't say that it's fundamentally changed in terms of the technology that underpins it.",
        "Some of it's been rebuilt with slightly greater security, the ability to withstand, you know, terrorist attacks in a more robust way.",
        "But the fundamental technology has remained the same.",

        "So the newspapers were publishing graphic after graphic of what it looked like and what actually happened, and I thought, `Don't people know this?",
        "And then of course I realized that they didn't.",
