        "So is that true for (technical difficulties)...",
        "Hello.",
        "Yes, is that true for traffic also?",
        "And how do they make decisions about how to time the traffic lights at different times of day?",
        "How do they sync up the lights, Kate?",
        "Well, the Traffic Management Center that's located out in Queens basically watches traffic patterns, and they'll go out and test it.",
        "So they know pretty much how many cars are going to come through various intersections at various times during the day.",
        "They have sophisticated models, some of which you may be familiar with, that actually tell them how to program the lights along an avenue or on a street.",
        "And if for some reason things are getting out of sync because traffic's building up more than it should, they'll go out and do another traffic count and adjust them accordingly.",
        "I was fascinated to read your account of changes on Queens Boulevard, which is a major thoroughfare through that borough, and I used to live there at one time.",
        "And it was worth your life to try to cross Queens Boulevard..."

        "And there's all kinds of strange technology that they're developing to make those crossings safer.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, some of the things are simple, like just better signage, but there are special pedestrian refuge areas now where you can go halfway across the street and you can wait until the light's appropriate for you to cross.",
        "There's what they call neck-downs, which are when the sidewalk extends into the street so the cars actually have to slow down at certain intersections so that you have a chance of getting across with your life.",
        "There's a whole array of traffic management and traffic-calming, is what they call it, traffic-calming techniques that they can employ.",
        "Do the same people that work on the traffic lights and the flow of traffic also work on the traffic on the bridges and the tunnels?",
        "Well, in some cases, yes.",
        "The Department of Transportation of the city, who monitors the streetlights in the city, does do some of the city's bridges, many of them.",
        "The bridges across the East River, for instance, or the Harlem River, are all city bridges.",
        "The bridges across the Hudson River, the bridges and tunnels, the Holland, the Lincoln, the George Washington Bridge are actually bistate.",
        "So the Port Authority of New York or New Jersey manages those bridges.",

        "Oh, OK.",
        "That is one of my favorite stories in the book.",
        "And--not because the George Washington Bridge is one of my favorite bridges in the world, but initially the bridge was built to be clad in stone so that the towers that we see, the two towers, were to have an ornate, you know, concrete finish.",
        "The skeleton that we see was of course the underbelly of that.",
        "And right about Depression time, the skeleton was up, the cladding was off, and the Port Authority decided that they would postpone putting the cladding on to save a little bit of money, and then looked at the bridge and decided that the bridge was absolutely beautiful as it was and that they could bring the project in on budget at $60 million.",
        "And so they decided to completely forgo the cladding forever, much to most New Yorkers' great delight."

        "Basically, they're repainting the bridge.",
        "Oh.",
        "And it is a long, laborious process because they have to blast the paint off and repaint it.",

        "So the fumes really do mount up.",
        "They have a toothbrush truck, as some people refer to it, that goes through there generally in the evenings and it does it three or four times a week.",
        "And it literally scrubs the tiles.",
        "It has a rotating arm, it's a bit like a toothbrush, and it scrubs the tiles primarily with water--it doesn't use a lot of chemicals generally, just with water--to get the grease and the grime off it.",
        "And if you're going through the tunnel at midnight sometime, you are generally stuck in traffic because one lane is often closed for the toothbrush truck to be slowly moving through the tunnel.",

        "How did that get--how did they come up with that?",
        "You know, I don't know.",
