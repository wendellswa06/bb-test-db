        "The sludge itself, once it's produced at the various sludge-processing facilities, goes to a pelletization plant.",
        "Most of New York's sludge goes to a pelletization plant in Hunts Point in the Bronx and it actually gets heated up and turned into these pellets that are put into silos, stacked on rail cars, and an awful lot of them go down to fertilize orange groves in Florida.",

        "All right.",
        "I'm kind of looking at the urban myths of a lot of these things.",

        "Another city that I've lived in that I've seen a lot of urban myths about is Idaho Falls, Idaho.",
        "How do you research to find out what really is and really isn't real about what's underneath the city?",
        "Because I find it fascinating.",
        "Well, there's two ways to do it.",
        "The first way in this day and age is just go on the Internet and read everything you can about whatever myth it is that you're investigating.",
        "OK.",
        "But by far the more reliable method is actually talking to some of the often engineers, sometimes just civil servants who've been working in that field, 'cause these folks, some of whom are still working, some of whom are retired, really know what is and isn't true about what lies under the surface.",
        "You can really mine them...",

        "There was.",
