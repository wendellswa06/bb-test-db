        "There are obviously some systems that don't exist anymore, and there was one wonderful one called the pneumatic tube system.",
        "I mean, this was a system of mail delivery that ended in 1953, but how nifty is this.",
        "It was vacuum tubes, yeah?",
        "It was vacuum tubes, and it was a network that stretched all the way from basically the Battery up to the northern tip of Manhattan, and about a third of the mail that went through the general post office at Harold Square actually got sent out by pneumatic tube to different post offices all around the city.",
        "Took maybe four minutes to get across from Harold Square to Times Square, maybe 10 minutes to get up to the post office at the Museum of Natural History on Central Park West.",
        "And it was--the letters were put in a small canister.",
        "The pipe was greased with oil to let the middle canister flow through.",
        "And basically a vacuum sucked the canister through with anywhere up to 500 letters at a time would be moving through the system.",
        "One of the weird things about that system, and I love pneumatic tubes, but the first subway system that was tried and built in New York--I did a story about this years and years ago when I was working at NPR's New York bureau--was a pneumatic subway.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "The first subway, which was actually built in stealth and then unveiled, was actually blown--the subway car was essentially blown or pulled from one station under Broadway from about Warren Street to Cedar Street, and it didn't go very far but there was about 400,000 people that rode that subway in the few years it was in existence.",
        "I think that was about 1870.",
        "Oh, you're good.",
        "We're going to continue our discussion on the \"\"Anatomy of a City\"\" with Kate Ascher and her book \"\"The Works\"\" after we take a short break.",
        "Then we'll talk about the layoffs at General Motors and what they will mean for the workers who will be losing their jobs.",
        "And we'll have your letters about the program we did last week with Howard Dully after we broadcast NPR's \"\"All Things Considered\"\" broadcast his radio documentary \"\"My Lobotomy.\"\" That's after the break.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Hi, Kate.",
        "I've got a couple of sort of interrelated questions for you concerning the Brooklyn Bridge.",
        "I'm reading David McCullough's book right now and his questions that have popped into my mind are sort of along the lines: How is the city doing long-term monitoring of things like the anchor cables that go into the anchorage?",
        "Or actually, the cables themselves, to just check for corrosion and just aging of these things as--I'll leave it at that at the moment.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, there's actually--you'll enjoy--there's at least a two-page section in the book that talks about how you maintain bridges because I was always fascinated by that question too.",
        "I, A, wanted to know that somebody was doing it...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...and then, B, wanted to know how it was done.",
        "And there is a regular program of maintenance of all the bridges, including the Brooklyn Bridge.",
        "There are special tools and machines that actually travel the length of the bridge, and then there are special techniques that essentially rely on sound and hammering and, you know, various other things to basically ensure the integrity of the bridge.",
        "There's a flag system when there is a defect that's found, so that the important defects are remedied straight away, and the defects that are more roadway and not structural can be dealt with subsequently.",
        "So there's a very sophisticated system for ensuring bridge integrity, which I was very happy to find out about.",
        "Is there a sell-by date on the Brooklyn Bridge?",
        "You know, use before?",
        "Well, the interesting thing about bridges--and the Brooklyn Bridge isn't different from any others--is the more you maintain them the longer they can live.",
        "And one of the questions has always been how do you find the money to maintain city bridges.",
        "One of the things the Port Authority's always been to do because of their funding source is spend a lot of money maintaining their bridges, and the city has wanted for years to try to find a dedicated way to support its bridges.",
        "But it does the best it can and uses a pretty sophisticated system.",
        "The more--the longer you maintain it, the longer it will last.",
        "Roy, thanks very much."

        "Some of the systems are very, very old in the city.",
        "Can they sustain?",
        "You know, the interesting thing that I found in researching this book is that some of the most robust systems in this city are the oldest, so when you look at something like the subway, you look at something like the water system and you realize how far-sighted people were who originally engineered these systems.",
        "And even though there's constantly improvements being made to both and new pipes and, you know, holes being plugged and new subway cars and new signals, the basic technology hasn't changed much.",
        "And my guess is that these systems will be around pretty much as they are for some time into the future.",
        "Yet they're always adding new systems.",
        "I mean, in that wild tangle of pipes and conduits beneath the streets of the city, obviously things like, you know, fiber-optic cable had to be added over the past few years.",
        "That's exactly right, and when you open up a street it's really a scary thing.",
        "I don't know how many folks have had a chance to walk through an open cut in a New York City street, and you wonder who really does know where all of these pipes and cables are going.",
        "The interesting thing is that some of them are absolutely defunct.",
        "Some of them are still working.",
        "So it really does layer pipes and cables upon pipes and cables, and there are some new technologies.",
        "But the core systems are pretty much there.",
