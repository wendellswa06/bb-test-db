        "Why India?",
        "When lots of developing countries are struggling with these challenges, what makes India unique, and what can it tell us about the challenges around climate change that the whole world faces?",
        "First and perhaps most importantly, India's now the third-largest emitter of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.",
        "This is Anthony Leiserowitz.",
        "He directs the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication.",
        "He says even though India is only behind the U.S.",

        "And local people have placed very simple offerings in front of his tomb.",

        "Geoff Brumfiel traveled to Switzerland to find out how physicists are hoping to use these collisions to solve the mysteries of the Big Bang.",
        "It's hard to explain how much the Large Hadron Collider means to physicists, but you get a sense of it when you speak to Srini Rajagopalan.",
        "He works on a giant, underground detector that records what's produced in the collisions.",
        "It's called ATLAS.",
        "I've been working on ATLAS since 1996.",
        "I was down in that pit when it was completely empty and it was wonderful.",

        "Collisions were just days away when a faulty connection triggered an explosion in the machine's liquid helium coolant.",
        "It was a devastating accident, though Steven Goldfarb, another researcher on ATLAS, puts the best face on it he can.",

        "We didn't really want this to happen, and it set us back for a good year or so.",
        "This year, the LHC finally got going, and that means researchers can finally start looking for new particles.",
        "At the top of their list is one called The Higgs.",
        "Researchers think The Higgs explains the masses of all the other particles.",
        "Its discovery would be a major find, and everyone is excited.",
        "Goldfarb's even got a song.",

        "David Francis is another researcher working on ATLAS.",
        "It's a bit harsh, this comparison.",
        "But in two cars crashing and each car's got passengers in it, and they crash into each other and bits fly everywhere, right?",
        "And then your job is to identify what the cars were beforehand and how many passengers were in each car.",
        "Except it's more than just the contents of the cars.",
        "Smashing protons together actually makes new particles.",

        "When the Hubble turned on and looked out into space, they had some ideas what they were going to see.",

        "Instead of looking out, we're looking in and we're looking for new things.",
        "The LHC produces hundreds of millions of collisions each second.",

        "Once researchers have those data, they can start to look for The Higgs.",

        "In fact, our galaxy is loaded with this dark matter, but we have no idea what it is.",

        "I find it significant that you and I met in Baghdad in a darkened hotel when there wasn't any power, because you would hear Iraqis say, this is the strongest country in the world that defeated Saddam in 27 days, why can't they turn the lights on?",
        "It fueled many conspiracy theories.",
        "And when the first wave of American engineers showed up, they went to some of these power plants and they found these decrepit monstrosities with 1950s-era control panels, and they'd walk through and find leaky valves, and everything was a mess.",
        "And they expressed surprise.",

        "Had we wanted to know about this, we could have.",
        "And I felt in those early months the lack of electricity spawned a greater degree of anger toward the Americans than seeing American checkpoints or hearing about accidental shootings or any of the other things.",
        "Now, Ambassador Bremer at one point made a calculated decision that when they began to repair the electrical grid of Iraq, that he was going to do it in a totally equitable manner, which is to say that other parts of the country, particularly where Shia lived, in the southern part of the country, had not received as much electricity as they had in the capital, in Baghdad.",
        "And he thought that was wrong.",
        "So he decided to distribute what stores of electricity there were more equitably.",
        "What was the practical effect of that?",
        "The practical effect was that Baghdad, the capital, the center of opinion, wound up with about half as much electricity as it had before the war.",
        "So people who used to get 20 to 22 hours a day were now getting 8 to 10 to 12 hours.",
        "And it really angered people.",
        "And as we see now, with the decision by the Pentagon to concentrate U.S.",
        "forces on Baghdad first, because they feel that securing Baghdad is key to securing the rest of the country, that opinion in the capital shapes it across the country, we should have realized this back then and we shouldn't have disadvantaged the capital.",
        "And the few extra hours of power a day that were given to people across the Shiite south never really won us any friends.",
        "It just wound up angering a lot of people in a place where you didn't want to anger them.",
        "You seem to think that U.S.",
        "policy missed a series of opportunities and one overall great opportunity during the first few months.",
        "The great missed opportunity was to do a better job with governing and reconstructing Iraq.",
        "There was a window there of months where had we brought the resources to bear, had we created an Iraqi interim administration that projected to the Iraqis that Iraqis were really in charge and Americans were there to be advisors to help support this administration, but that you had Iraqis slightly more front and center, I think it would have had an enormous difference.",
        "Would this have solved everything?",
        "Would it have prevented an insurgency?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "But I think it would have created a situation on the ground today that's very different from what we are now encountering."
