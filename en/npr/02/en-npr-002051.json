        "There's one question pollsters at Gallup have asked since 1963.",
        "Do you think that relations between blacks and whites will always be a problem for the United States or that a solution will eventually be worked out?",
        "Editor-in-chief of Gallup, Frank Newport, says the answer has stayed relatively the same since 2008 for about 60 percent of white Americans.",
        "They're optimistic, just like half of African-Americans who responded in 2008 and 2013.",
        "But Newport says even though sentiments don't seem to have shifted during the Obama administration, there remains a significant gap between how whites and blacks perceive race and equality.",
        "Blacks see a world that has barriers - structural barriers - and discrimination, whites much less so.",
        "Whites are more optimistic about race relations than blacks are.",
        "And if you look at other pollsters as well, you see similar trends.",
        "Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at another pollster, the Pew Research Center.",
        "We ask, how well do blacks and whites get along with each other these days?",
        "Very well, pretty well, not too well or not at all well.",
        "Almost 70 percent said very or pretty well more than a week after protests began in Ferguson, Missouri.",
        "But that share was seven points lower compared to a 2009 survey.",
        "Still, polling won't give you the final answer on race relations.",
        "According to a recent New York Times-CBS News poll, they've stayed about the same since Obama became president, or, according to Bloomberg Politics, they've gotten worse under the first black president.",
        "We need to get beyond the opinions, beyond the ideas and really ask, how is race working in terms of allocating power and resources in our society?"

        "You know, I don't think they're hanging on every single result from state to state, and certainly not a Saturday night with other things to do.",
        "But it's also impossible for them to avoid all the media coverage of any turn or twist in this race.",
        "So as they absorb that kind of information from social media and from radio and television and the newspapers that they may see, they get a slightly different impression from what they might have had even 48 hours ago.",
        "Now, not to take anything away from peoples', you know, right to participate in this process and to be excited about the process, but is there a point at which one candidate or another becomes inevitable, just the numbers make it clear that this person is the person?",
        "We don't have all the results yet from tonight.",
        "But we do have the results of Super Tuesday, and we know that makes it extraordinarily difficult to catch Donald Trump unless you become the alternative.",
        "So as long as Marco Rubio's in the race, John Kasich is in the race - Rubio hoping to do well in his home state of Florida on Tuesday, Kasich - or not this coming Tuesday but on March 15 - and of course, John Kasich expected to do the same in Ohio.",

        "So home values go up and down, birth rates go up and down.",
        "What did they find - if any connection there?",
        "Well, they found that rising real estate prices are correlated with an increase in fertility.",
        "And falling real estate prices are correlated with a decrease in fertility.",
        "So if you were to imagine a metro area where every resident was a homeowner, then a $10,000 increase in home prices seems to boost fertility by about five percent.",
        "Wow.",
        "Why would that be?",
        "Well, here's the theory - the idea is that when people decide to have children many people say I want to have a stable job and get both feet on the ground before I have kids.",
        "And the prices of real estate might be playing a role in that.",
        "When you feel like your home values have appreciated, you say I can now afford to have kids because my home is now worth $200,000 more.",
        "It's like having money in the bank.",
        "I'm rich now because prices went up.",

        "Falling real estate prices seem to be associated with increased fertility, presumably, because those people now say I'd like to have a family.",
        "I'd like to buy a bigger home, and now I actually can do it.",
        "So this must be connected to this larger sense that people's feeling of prosperity does in fact affect their family planning.",
