        "A radio astronomer studies the sky at radio frequencies rather than optical frequencies.",
        "So, the optical sky, the visual sky, is just a very small slice of the full electromagnetic spectrum.",
        "So, there's much more to see and study in radio astronomy than there is in mere visual optical astronomy.",
        "Because normally we think of, you know, the sort of photographs from the Hubble Telescope, these incredible dramatic photos of far away galaxies and stars and planets.",
        "You aren't actually always looking at things; you are listening to things.",
        "Yeah, listening, that's my forte - is listening and recording.",
        "And actually, most radio astronomers don't listen to sound.",
        "They see the radio input on spectrographs or charts.",
        "So, to me, if you tune into radio astronomy spectrographs, they can be extremely beautiful, just as beautiful as Hubble images.",
        "So, what have you been hearing this past week?",
        "Well, the past week's been incredibly special.",
        "As you mentioned, we're coming out of a very long and almost a weird sunspot minimum.",
        "But in the past week, a few active regions appeared on the sun.",
        "And one region grew incredibly fast, like in a manner of two to three days and started flaring ferociously.",
        "I'm listening to this and I'm wondering when do you actually get sleep because it sounds like it's been very, very active.",
        "Well, it's kind of nice not to get sleep.",
        "I mean, I get sleep but I tend to get up quite early before the sun so I could meet it.",
        "So, it's as exciting time.",
        "I was a little bit flat before this.",
        "Now, Thomas Ashcraft, I should mention that there's an article about you at wired.com.",
        "And in that article there's a photograph of your backyard, and it's this sort of network of wires that are strung through the trees.",
        "Can you describe what that setup is and how you actually record the sound of space and of the sun?"

        "Oh, yeah.",

        "So, I have an incredibly simple radio astronomy observatory built out of simple wires, castoff short-wave radios, old VCRs that they don't even take at the Salvation Army any more, I don't think.",

        "Okay.",
        "What is that sound.",
        "Well, that sound is - now, we're switching phenomena into meteor and space dust.",
        "So, what happens is when a meteor hits the ionosphere, it makes a trail of ionization.",
        "That trail or that cone of ionization has a capacity to reflect in a far-off TV or radio transmitter.",
        "So, what that was was the reflections of distant video carriers of TV transmitters.",
        "You've got to be very careful because I suspect that DJs will start to sample your sounds."

        "Last week, United introduced a fuel surcharge of 5 percent on all domestic flights.",
