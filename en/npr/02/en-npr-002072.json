        "So it was with our chief.",
        "He guided us with loose reins and used the spurs only rarely to get us up to speed with our work.",

        "As O'Connor observed, Rehnquist was a betting man.",
        "He made wagers on sports, elections, even snowfall.",
        "`If you value your money, she said, `you would be careful about betting with the chief.",
        "He usually won.",
        "I think he'd bet he could live out another term despite his illness,' O'Connor said.",

        "Democratic senators questioning Roberts will walk a fine line, challenging a man with whom they may not agree.",
        "Roberts is, by most accounts, a reliable conservative, but he's also a man with impeccable legal credentials--Harvard Law School, a Supreme Court clerkship and more than 30 appearances as an attorney before the high court.",

        "I saw Zack Snyder's \"\"300\"\" at a sleepy suburban movie theater near Chicago.",
        "The lady behind me was telling her husband that she did not expect to enjoy the movie because it sounded too violent.",
        "Those who came for that exact reason got their fill of digital gore.",
        "To my mind, \"\"300\"\" drinks deeply at the cauldron of rage that is still boiling six years after that bloody Tuesday somewhere in the American psyche.",
        "It speaks to the desire to rave at endless ancient(ph) hordes.",
        "In this movie, Persian immortal knights are snarling beasts beneath their sinister masks, and their king is a fierce androgynous savage.",
        "More significantly, Persians are portrayed as black, and by implication, at once, Muslim and homosexual.",
        "In the meanwhile, the Spartan warrior dissolves into your typical white American survivalist - staunchly homophobic and somehow Christian.",
