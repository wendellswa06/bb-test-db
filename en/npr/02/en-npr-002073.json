        "Either that, or if he's kidnapped by aliens.",
        "Other than that, another Russian gold medal in men's figure skating is almost guaranteed.",

        "He is one of the greatest skaters ever, and he fell in Salt Lake City four years ago, and had to settle for the silver medal, so this is his moment, his time, and I certainly don't anticipate that he will make any mistakes or blow it now.",

        "Well, he's very lucky in where he's from, in the sense it's St. Petersburg, Russia, and he still trains there.",

        "So, you get this beautiful skating, terrific jumping; he landed a quad jump the other day, Johnny Weir did not, and he's really the perfect package.",

        "Less abundant animals, like bowhead whales, received slightly lower rankings.",

        "Polar bears hunt for seals on top of the sea ice, while narwhals dive down underneath it to get a fish like halibut.",
        "Laidre says the polar bears may have one major advantage over the narwhals when it comes to coping with climate change, however.",
        "They are found almost everywhere in the arctic, which raises the odds that at least some of them will survive the coming changes.",
        "Narwhals, on the other hand, live almost exclusively in isolated waters off Canada and Greenland.",
        "In other words, if something bad happens in those waters, the narwhal may have trouble bouncing back.",
        "It goes to the same place year after year.",
        "It has a very specific migration, it has a very limited diet that doesn't reproduce very fast and relative to the other species we examined, it doesn't have a very large population size.",
        "Laidre says the problems of the narwhal are made worse by the fact that it could take 100 years to reverse global warming.",
