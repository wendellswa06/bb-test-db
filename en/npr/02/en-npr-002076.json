        "That's Eileen Reynolds.",
        "She's played the bassoon since elementary school.",
        "When I started playing it, I started getting these really strange comments from people.",
        "My dad said it looked like a plumber had gotten drunk - because there's all this tubing and all these keys on it, everywhere.",
        "And then I talked to my great-uncle, who'd been a professional trombonist, and he said, you know, we used to call it the farting bedpost.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF BASSOON)",
        "You see, despite the fact that the bassoon is actually one of the most difficult instruments in the orchestra to play, people just don't take it seriously - which isn't surprising when you get a glimpse of the thing.",
        "There's this metal mouthpiece that's curved.",
        "And it sort of goes down, and it looks almost like a straw.",
        "You know what?",
        "Let's just consult a professional.",
        "And then it's attached to almost eight feet of wooden tubing that's been fashioned with a bend in the bottom of it.",
        "So it's folded in half and the top part sticks up, and it looks like a bedpost.",
        "That's Mark Eubanks.",
        "He teaches bassoon at Lewis Clark College in Oregon.",
        "And he says the bassoon has been the butt of the joke since its early days back in the 17th century.",
        "Bassoon playing was very bad in those days, because they had bad instruments.",
        "The wood warped, the reeds changed from minute to minute, and there probably weren't that many good bassoon players.",
        "So it kind of took on a role as this quirky, nasty-sounding thing.",
        "A century later, with better reeds and more keys, composers began to take notice.",
        "Again, Eileen Reynolds.",
        "Haydn may have been the person who started this bassoon-is-funny-idea because he would have a part where the full orchestra was playing, and then it would get quieter and quieter and quieter, and everything would be very serene."
