        "Ron Kessler of Harvard Medical School started collecting data about the mental health of Katrina victims about five months after the storm hit the Gulf, and the first batch of information he collected and published was pretty much what he expected.",
        "The research showed PTSD and other mental disorders were roughly double what they were in the general population, which was high but not totally out of the ordinary.",
        "What's striking, he says, about this new batch of data is that it doesn't conform to the usual pattern.",
        "For example, Kessler says, rates of PTSD almost always decline in the two years after a major traumatic event.",
        "The majority of people in that one year and certainly the two year windows time recover, and in very bad situations you fail to find that, that there is not as much recovery or in some extreme cases no evidence of recovery.",
        "But we virtually never find an increase, and were are finding a doubling in the prevalence of PTSD in most of the area affected by Hurricane Katrina.",
        "That's really quite striking.",
        "And it's not just PTSD that's on the rise in many of the areas affected by Katrina.",
        "Kessler says the research shows there's been a huge increase in the prevalence of other mental health issues, including what's called suicidal ideation.",
        "It's now up to eight percent.",
        "So that's a pretty substantial number of people; eight percent of the population is thinking about killing themselves.",
        "And, Kessler says, there's another way that the research they've collected points to something unusual.",
        "In typical disaster situations, you find that disadvantaged people, people who are disadvantaged to begin with, are affected most - poor people, the elderly.",
        "That wasn't the case here.",
        "It seemed to be a kind of an equal opportunity disaster: rich and poor, young and old, male and female, black and white.",

        "Every end of the spectrum.",
        "That's Cecile Tebo, a licensed clinical social worker who worked for the New Orleans Police Department.",

        "It is true that soccer doesn't lend itself to a manager dictating every play as happens in American football.",
        "What the game has are its own frameworks, great debates over strategy, how to balance attack and defense, where to align players on the pitch.",
        "More than that, soccer demands improvisation, Coltrane-like, where players make flash decisions about how to exploit defenses and open up space on the pitch.",
        "It's this characteristic, this quickness of wit, which Brazil produces like rubber or timber, yielding its unmatched success.",
