        "And our next guest is here to talk about this discovery.",
        "Matthew Siegler is a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and he's the co-author in one of the three papers about Mercury that appeared in the journal Science.",
        "Welcome to the show.",
        "Hi.",
        "How are you doing?",
        "I'm actually at the AGU conference that he was talking about earlier.",
        "We've heard, also, the neat, exciting stuff about planets this week.",
        "Now, how was it possible that there can be so much water on this giant - on this teeny, hot planet?",
        "Oh, well, it's hot when it's under the sun.",
        "It's pretty cold when it's out of the sun and because Mercury has essentially no tilt, places near the poles can stay in permanent shadow and be hundreds of degrees below zero.",
        "So we're measuring things down to about 50 Kelvin or modeling things down to about 50 Kelvin.",
        "We don't actually measure any temperatures.",
        "And there's a lot of water.",
        "Was I reading something about if you put it on the island of Manhattan it would be 10 - how many miles deep and spread out?",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "The one I liked was if you covered the Washington, D.C.",
        "area, it would be about two miles thick, probably, of ice.",
        "So it's pretty impressive.",
        "Can we speed that up a little bit, covering that D.C.",
        "area?",
        "Well, what about, you know, we've been talking about follow the water, follow the water.",
        "But here, seems like there's a lot of water.",
        "Why aren't we following this?",
        "You know, what's the case for Mars, Jim Green, over Mercury?",
        "Well, indeed Mercury is tough to get to.",
        "You know, it took us about six years to get Messenger launched and lining up and getting in orbit so that it could do the fantastic measurements that it's made, whereas Mars is much more accessible.",
        "We line up every 26 months so our trajectory can get to Mars quite easily in about a nine-month period.",
        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR, talking with Jim Green and Matthew Siegler.",
        "Matthew, is there a - could there be a sweet spot in that shadow that gets really close to the sun but, you know..."

        "Oh, this is what everyone is asking about.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "So basically, you got to think about what happens to a water molecule on a body with no air, all right?",
        "So here it is.",
        "Maybe - we're - this ice we're measuring, we can only see in the top meter, so maybe it goes down 10 meters.",
        "We're really not sure yet.",
        "That would take future measurements.",
        "But if you're that close to the surface, if you get even a little bit warmer than about something like 100 Kelvin - so that's real cold, right - you're going to sublimate off into space in less than an Earth day.",
        "So these are pretty short time scales to survive around.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So no hope of finding any liquid water there.",
        "But there was organic matter there, too, right?",
        "(Speaking Arabic).",
        "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #3: (Unintelligible).",
        "Yeah.",
        "So that's actually the really exciting thing from this.",
        "So the ice - we've, sort of, known that it's been there since about 1992 when we did radar measurements from (unintelligible).",
        "There has been this evidence that there was this flight reflective material down there.",
        "So the question was, was it really water ice?",
        "And the Messenger mission has been able to prove that.",
        "But it also had this laser altimeter that's been a surprise finding to it.",
        "It's just meant to measure topography",
        "But it's all - it shot a laser at some of these areas where we predict that, thermally, there should be ice, stable at the surface.",
        "It's all bright stuff.",
        "But what was really neat was where ice should be under the surface, we saw black stuff.",
        "And when we looked at the temperatures that this should be stable under, there are a bunch of organic materials that we see on the surfaces of comets all over the solar system that fit this description perfectly, and not many other materials would do.",
        "So it's pretty cool.",
        "So it could have been bombarded by comets and brought the water and the dark stuff there?"

        "Yeah, that's sort of neat to look at the origin of the water on Mercury.",
        "And we're predicting that it's most likely from comets, because we see a other material with it.",
        "And then that tells us a lot about how water came to the Earth, right?",
        "We think that the whole, you know, solar system should have been dry when the solar system formed out of a big cloud of gas and dust, right?",
        "And so somehow the Earth has water and Mercury has water.",
        "The moon seems to have a little water.",
        "Where did this come from?",
        "And we're thinking in this in this paper series that comets might be a good source of that.",

        "I mean, does it have to be shipped in?",
        "Could you make it on the planet?",
        "Could it outgas from the center of the planet somewhere or volcanoes or some...",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so the Earth, right, has more water inside of it than it does on the surface, so yeah, that could be a source.",
        "And so maybe it could tell us something about the internal structure of Mercury and then it had water vapor in there.",
        "But the fact that we see this other stuff with the water is strong evidence that this is water coming from somewhere else.",
        "We really have to land there and sample it and maybe bring it back, like Jim was talking about with Mars, to really answer some of these questions.",

        "Oh, you've got to have me back and we'll discuss more of that and maybe we can do something."
