        "As it is, most of them are making financial sacrifices by comparison to what they could earn on the outside.",
        "Here's what somebody at the Chronicle of Higher Education wrote a couple of years ago.",
        "As costs were rising above $40,000 at some of the more expensive colleges, the writer said, colleges have the bricks and mortar costs of a retail chain, the labor expenses of an airline, the high-skilled employee costs of a law firm, and the rebate costs of American car manufacturers.",
