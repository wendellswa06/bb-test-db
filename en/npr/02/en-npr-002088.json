        "Well, it's certainly a concern, because these countries are ramping up their military budgets.",
        "In the past five years, we've seen an anti-satellite test by China.",
        "In 2007, we've seen India develop an integrated space cell to begin organizing its military to be active in space.",
        "And we've also seen Japan drop a restriction on military uses of space in 2008.",
        "Now they're allowed to use space for military purposes.",
        "Is there some reason that space is a more attractive place to carry out military excursions, if you want to say that?",
        "Well, certainly there are many benefits from conducting military space activities, particularly so-called military support activities.",
        "This, you know, the gathering of information from space, which we and the Russians and other countries have done for many years.",
        "Obviously, we've also used the GPS system to help drive our ships, to locate troops, to navigate our missiles more effectively to their targets.",
        "All of these things have helped our military be more effective and also reduce casualties.",
        "The other side of the equation, though, is the space weapons part, and this is where I think many are concerned that Asia is moving in a dangerous direction.",
        "Certainly Japan - or China's decision to destroy a satellite at 525 miles up created 3,000 pieces of large debris that now imperil all of our spacecraft and frankly all of their spacecraft, as well.",
        "We're talking with Clay Moltz, he's a professor at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, and if you want to join the discussion, our number is 800-989-8255.",
        "That's 1-800-989-TALK.",
        "So what I'm not clear about is why this military concern would be Asia versus Asia and not Asia versus the United States.",
        "I mean, Pakistan and India, of course, are quite - there's a lot of saber-rattling between those two.",
        "But otherwise, you don't seem to think of them, I guess South and North Korea, but I guess otherwise it doesn't seem like there's a military strategic need for this.",
        "Or is there?",
        "There's quite a bit of rivalry within Asia, and these are very deep-seated geopolitical rivalries.",
        "You know, think of China and India, China and Japan that still have lingering issues related to World War II, as you mentioned North and South Korea, Vietnam and China, even lesser rivalries such as Malaysia and Singapore.",
        "These countries are competing with one another.",
        "They are watching one another, and frankly, many of them distrust one another.",
        "And what we're seeing in Asia today is in contrast to what has evolved in Europe over the past several decades, where the countries of Europe have decided to cooperate in the European Space Agency.",
        "There's collaborative research.",
        "There's joint funding of projects.",
        "So they don't waste a lot of money duplicating scientific projects.",
        "They collaborate in sharing information, and they also have a view that security in space is best done collectively instead of through simple national military activities."

        "Thank you.",
        "So, I mean, what - are we at a turning point, so to speak?",
        "Is this a time when we need to - I mean, even if there's no global consensus on what to do about CO2 emissions, which we might hear about later today, why wouldn't - I mean, it seems sort of get nations to get together and agree that they don't want to use space for weapons?",
        "Or maybe I'm wrong about that, too.",
        "Sure, there I think has been a great reduction overall in tension in the last several decades, particularly since the end of the Cold War.",
        "I mean, you look at the relationship with Russia now in space.",
        "We collaborate very actively with Russia in human space flight.",
        "We also in fact use Russian RD-180 engines to launch our Atlas rockets that put some of our military payloads into orbit.",
        "So we cooperate quite extensively.",
        "We see similar cooperation, as I mentioned, with Europe.",
        "In Asia, though, as these countries have accelerated their space programs, what we've seen is a lack of cooperation, particularly with one another.",
        "So we don't see the major powers in Asia cooperating with one another.",
        "They cooperated instead, with the major powers to acquire technology; and with lesser powers, to promote their own interests in exporting technologies.",
        "So is there - well, first of all, is there a military response that the U.S.",
        "is contemplating, that you know of, or - I mean, not a response in the sense of, you know, doing something proactive, but something that we can do to be prepared for this eventuality?",
        "Certainly the United States is watching these activities with concern, but as you've - if you've followed the U.S.",
        "national space policy, recently, in 2010, the emphasis on that space policy is on responsible behavior in space.",
        "So what the United States would like to see, I believe, is that these countries would begin to agree to norms of behavior such as debris mitigation, and they would begin to promote more transparency and in general to collaborate much more effectively on common problems in space such as traffic management, which is becoming increasingly difficult to do without countries sharing more information.",
        "So is there a non-military use of space that you think would be a valuable goal to try to get people to engage around?",
        "Well, certainly collaboration in a variety of areas, such as disaster monitoring, such as trying to manage the region's agriculture, prevent deforestation, all of these things are very valuable.",
        "In addition, each of the countries can provide more transparency.",
        "Where are its activities going on in space?",
        "When it moves a satellite or a spacecraft, it could inform others of this activity so that it doesn't collide with other spacecraft.",
        "So these are some of the things.",
        "But we also I think are lacking some of the built-in areas of cooperation that existed even in the hostile years of the Cold War.",
        "If you go back to the 1970s, for example, the U.S.",
        "and the Soviet militaries said that they would not interfere with each other's national technical means of verification.",
        "So in other words, we did not interfere with their military satellites, and they didn't interfere with ours.",
        "That kind of cooperation does not yet exist in Asia."

        "Similarly, we have not seen something like the Apollo-Soyuz Mission in 1975, where these two major space programs cooperated in an unprecedented joint docking and exchange of astronauts and cosmonauts.",
        "That sort of thing has not taken place in Asia.",

        "This is repetitive.",
        "It wastes national resources.",
        "It also foments distrust on the political side.",

        "Now fortunately, it hasn't escalated yet, but we see the trends in terms of the spending in these countries.",

        "India, for example, has said that it will match China's anti-satellite capability.",

        "Thank you so much for having me on.",

        "intelligence into space as opposed to putting human beings in space.",
        "And my understanding is that when you decide to put a human being into space, then, you know, the cost of your project increase just tremendously, and it becomes really inefficient.",

        "It already has had numerous astronauts on the International Space Station.",
        "But what we're seeing is a movement of these countries to compete in high-prestige activities like human spaceflight as well as space science.",

        "It's a good question.",
        "One of the problems that we have today is that much of the cooperation has become very politicized.",
        "I mentioned the rivalries within Asia, but certainly, there is a concern about China's rise, and U.S.",
        "politics have taken on that concern.",
        "Congress recently passed legislation that bars NASA from talking to the Chinese about space cooperation.",
        "And so this is a very severe limitation.",
        "We did not have those kinds of limits during the Cold War on working with the Russians.",
        "So that kind of limitation will have to be overcome if we're going to begin to normalize these kinds of exchanges.",

        "The U.S.",
        "Air Force has recently begun to provide information to Asian countries, including China, about when their satellites might collide with other satellites.",
        "The reason that we're doing that is that we don't want to see any satellites collide that would create dangerous debris.",

        "I mean, how would that play out?",
        "War in space could occur with one side using an anti-satellite weapon to destroy another country's spacecraft.",
        "The danger of this is multiple, though, for all countries in space.",
        "You cannot simply harm one asset in space without harming others.",
        "You could destroy, for example, a particular country's satellite, but then, the debris from that collision would spread through space and become, if you will, speeding bullets that could affect all other spacecraft.",
        "As I mentioned, China's anti-satellite test has generated 3,000 or more pieces of debris that will orbit the Earth for around 50 years.",
        "And already, we have had to maneuver satellites out of the way of this debris.",
        "And so a space war could even make low reaches of space unusable.",
        "In other words, there would be so much debris generated if there were multiple attacks on satellites that really all countries would have difficulty conducting much of anything in this region, particularly if you're talking about human spaceflight.",
        "You wouldn't want to put people in that area of space."
