        "Clay Moltz, you would be in a position - do you think other countries look at the United States and think they've got to be prepared to deal with us in the future?",

        "Now, the United States has adapted a policy in the last year about space security that emphasizes new transparency, that emphasizes international cooperation, that emphasizes sharing of data on things like space situational awareness.",
        "So I see this as a turning point really for the United States in recognizing that in many regards we are interdependent in space with other countries.",

        "Yeah.",
        "So you're talking about this $250 million in state election security funding that both the House and the Senate had a chance to vote on in the past two weeks.",

        "It's coming at this time when there are these bipartisan efforts.",
        "You had this one option that would allow them to put automatic sanctions on Russia or any other entity that interferes in the elections.",
        "But that hasn't really gone anywhere.",
        "And there's a separate bill that would make it so that states and the federal government would have a more streamlined way of communicating about threats.",
        "But again, that hasn't really gone anywhere.",
        "So there's been a lot of conversation and a lot of options put out there, but we haven't seen votes on anything that could actually get passed in the very near future."
