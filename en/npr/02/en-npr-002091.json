        "This past week, a federal judge said that Mr. Zazi is a different person, utterly changed from the one involved in that plot.",
        "At his sentencing, the judge said that because of his, quote, \"\"extraordinary cooperation,\"\" Zazi would only do the time he'd already served, about 10 years.",
        "So how do you know when a person convicted of terrorism has changed sides?",
        "Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism, is with us.",

        "There seems to be real agreement between prosecutors and the judge that Zazi is a changed man.",
        "What happened?",
        "Yeah, so when Zazi got picked up in the fall of 2009, he immediately started cooperating.",
        "And from then on, for the last 10 years or so, he's cooperated against a number of high-profile trials in the U.S.",
        "- the third in command in al-Qaida, another American and a British operative.",
        "He cooperated with law enforcement over 100 times, did interviews there.",
        "They described his cooperation as extraordinary, some of the best they've seen in terrorism trials.",
        "Do we know why?",
        "You know, sometimes when these things happen - and I've interviewed a few individuals who've joined al-Qaida and other groups like this - they have an awakening moment when they're looking, sitting across the table from an FBI agent.",
        "It becomes very real to them in a way they hadn't seen before.",
        "For Zazi's case, he decided that he made a mistake, and he wanted to rectify that.",

        "You know, if Zazi didn't cooperate, he was going to be facing life in jail.",
        "The other options is to go to trial.",
        "And when you go to trial, universally you end up getting sentenced to a much longer sentence than you would if you cooperated.",
        "Can you compare how we handle a case like this, which has to do with Islamist terrorism, with the domestic terrorism cases we've been hearing about recently?",
        "I'm thinking specifically about white supremacists.",
        "Does the government deal with them in the same way?",
        "Yeah, in many ways they do in terms of cooperation.",
        "They don't in terms of charges.",
        "So you can charge an individual with material support to terrorism as it relates to ISIS or al-Qaida.",
