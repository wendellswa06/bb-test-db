        "Her story set Oran on the two major paths of his life - one, to collect objects that showcased black achievement and, two, to make his own fortune in black haircare.",
        "He did it in the early 1980s by creating a new product for bonding hair extensions.",
        "I could go in with my bonding lotion and get it to stick.",
        "With just twisting it on, it would go.",
        "At that time it was revolutionary.",

        "It's almost like a destruction of the culture.",
