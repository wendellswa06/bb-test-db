        "I think it's going to be increasingly important for our students to be equipped not just in traditional journalism values and standards, but also to set themselves up as their own entrepreneurs of their careers.",
        "And I think our students are going to be playing a leading role in not only providing news content, but also helping to determine what is going to be the new business model for journalism.",

        "Why is journalism, an old-school journalism, still an important thing in this day and age?",
