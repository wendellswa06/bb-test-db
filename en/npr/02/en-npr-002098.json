        "It doesn't sound like I'm proud of it, and I'm not, but I mentioned it, because it was kind of a one-hit wonder.",
        "Why...",
        "Yeah.",
        "But see, that's the - I'm really glad you asked that, because this is - as I just said a moment ago - this is about chart performances.",

        "It's the longest chart run by any number one song.",
        "I spent that year that you danced to it not liking the song, you know, and getting kind of tired of hearing it following me around.",
        "I mean, I go to a ball park, and I couldn't escape the \"\"Macarena.\"\" So, this was not by any means an editorial list.",
        "This is a list of the songs that had the best performance, and, you know, 60 weeks on the chart, no other number-one record could say it did that.",
        "So, what does it say about our taste and - I mean, our buying taste as well as our listening taste, to take a look at, you know, kind of what really hit the top of the charts?",
        "Well, you have to remember that there's different chart rules that had been in place throughout the 50 years.",
        "We do the charts differently now than we did five years ago.",
        "We do them differently now than we did them 13 months ago.",
        "And certainly, they're different than they were before '98, and so there's been different behavior, there were different rules up until 1998.",
        "You could not appear on this chart unless there was a retail available single.",
        "Well, as the market got to the point where there were fewer and fewer hits being released to stores, we had to leave that rule behind.",
        "So part of what you see here is just, this is what Top 40 Radio was like at a time.",
        "This is what consumers were buying at the time.",
        "And you know, sometimes when you see a song that's seems weak to your personal frame of reds - reference, it might be that that record was on the chart during a weak time.",
        "For instance, in the top 10 of this lists is, \"\"You Light Up My Life,\"\" by Debby Boone.",
        "Now, that record was number one for 10 weeks.",
        "By current standards, we've had several number one's that had been on top of the chart longer than that, but for the era that she charted, 1977."

        "Now, the problem is that his credibility is low because he has said so many things in the past that weren't true.",
        "So nobody believed him.",
        "And he got a huge round of criticism for not honoring the dead yesterday, for not arriving with the other leaders.",

        "Patriotism, he said, was about values, about pride in your country's values.",
