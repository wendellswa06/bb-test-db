        "You have to feel your way down the stairs if you don't have a flashlight.",
        "No heat.",
        "It means there's no water in the building, and that means the toilets aren't flushing, for example, which is something that she was feeling a little concerned about by the time I met her yesterday.",
        "But I was the first person to knock on her door.",
        "No one in her building had come and knocked, and none of her family members had been able to reach her.",

        "And it's easier to call landlines sometimes.",
