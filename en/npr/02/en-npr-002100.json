        "But the other thing I would say - and it's one of the reasons we're doing this forum and inviting Democrats - is instead of casting out rhetoric about, well, these guys believe in one man, one-woman marriage, these guys believe God has a design for sexuality, let's go to what the reality of it is.",

        "One of the dilemmas we had in the late '90s and in the early part of this decade, was as I mentioned there were fewer singles being released to stores, and one of the beauties of the \"\"Hot 100\"\" was it's never been one pool of information.",
        "It was sales and radios, so you had a more comprehensive look at popularity.",
        "And at the beginning, it was jukeboxes too.",
        "As of August of last year, we added internet streaming and on-demand music and music video from the internet, so it's always evolving to be a more complete view.",
        "But what happened was, with the removal of singles from store.",
        "For a few years there, the sales voice on this chart was kind of like the sprig of parsley that you put on a steak, and the rest of the chart was pretty cooked up by radio information.",
        "Thanks to the advent of iTunes and the other digital merchants, there's a very vibrant a la carte song market out there, and it's made a big difference in the kinds of songs that show up on the chart.",

        "I'm the director of the charts department, but one thing that certainly been a big thing for us is the charts.",
        "The biggest traffic draw on billboard.com every week is Thursday when we refresh our charts.",
