        "Black women particularly are prone, for whatever reason, to migraine headaches.",
        "They are, however, the last people to get treatment, to go out and seek help for migraines, and I think that's probably, you know, something that's maybe a little bit cultural or, you know, we feel we have to be tough and strong and can't afford to lose work, and all sorts of issues kind of tumble into that, but for whatever reason, black women are the last to get treatment, and I really hope that changes.",

        "For whatever reason, this medication that's migraine-specific medication was something that has helped me to be able to keep, you know, a couple of steps ahead of a migraine.",
