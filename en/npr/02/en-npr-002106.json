        "And the other thing to remind your listeners of is this is really early in the winter.",
        "This is just New Year's Day, and we've got a lot of winter ahead of us.",

        "Attorney General Becerra, the way that you describe a sanctuary city makes this seem like a rather narrow issue.",
        "The term sanctuary city sounds far more dramatic than the acts you're describing.",
        "And that's, Steve, the issue is that some people have tried to turn the word sanctuary into something that it's not.",
        "Sanctuary doesn't mean that you're protecting violent, dangerous criminals from the hands of law enforcement, whether federal or local.",
        "It simply means that we are not going to go out there and engage in activities that go beyond what the U.S.",
        "Constitution says we should do with people who are law-abiding, working hard, improving the neighborhoods and communities where they live.",
        "We also don't want to have people who fear talking to police officers simply because the federal immigration authorities would like our local law enforcement authorities to be aggressive beyond what legally they're supposed to do.",

        "That's a question that has to yet be answered in a way that gives us a chance to look at the facts because the state of California, when it receives federal resources, it does so because it's sent over taxpayer dollars from the people of California.",
        "So we will do everything we can to defend our local California taxpayers from being denied the resources that they paid for.",
        "If the federal government has a reason to block funding or deny resources to the state of California, we will certainly look at that and challenge it if it doesn't seem right.",
        "But we don't believe that we should be losing money for police officers and community policing simply because we're abiding by the U.S.",
        "Constitution when it comes to the treatment of immigrants.",

        "Without a doubt.",
        "California is a donor state to the federal Treasury.",
        "We always, as taxpayers in the state of California, pay more in taxes than we get back to our state.",

        "California, as some people will know, has stricter auto emission standards than the country as a whole.",
        "You had to get, as a state, a waiver from the federal government to impose those standards.",

        "Steve, we're not turning back when it comes to climate change and clean energy.",
        "We received a waiver from the federal government.",
        "We will do everything we can to defend our position, and we will do more if necessary.",

        "There was a time when more conservative states were asserting state rights against a powerful federal government.",
        "Do you find yourself becoming an advocate of state rights?",
        "Steve, what's really interesting in that comparison of the use of states' rights is that in previous generations, some states asserted their rights under the 10th Amendment to challenge other constitutional provisions that protected the rights of individuals.",
        "Civil rights legislation, for example, right.",
        "OK.",
        "Right, or just the 14th Amendment - equal protection under the law.",
        "And using the 10th Amendment to try to undermine the 14th Amendment, to me, was not what the founders of this nation meant when they enacted the 10th Amendment.",
        "We should remind people, the 10th Amendment, if I'm not mistaken, says that all powers that are not explicitly granted to the federal government are reserved to the states.",
        "Is that right?",
        "That's correct.",
        "When we talk about the rights of states to move forward, whether it's on clean energy or our treatment of immigrants, it's to respect the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, not undermine the Bill of Rights.",
