        "And I think what I've seen is that even though we live in a rural community, many of the other of his peers have never been fishing, have never ridden a horse, don't know how to identify a crop in the field, and it's sad to me how disengaged rural people can be from their own environment.",
        "Disengaged from their own environment, not taking advantage of the things that are, well, everybody else would consider attractions.",
        "Yes, and so it's a joy when we're getting ready for harvest here in a month or two, and - (clears throat) - excuse me - you know, a combine ride would be like an amusement park thrill.",
        "It truly is.",

        "Really?",

        "That's very true.",
        "And one of the jobs in economic development, when you're dealing with a small town like Overton, is to see if you can help that town re-engage its identity, find itself again, so to speak, and that has to be done at the grassroots level.",

        "There are examples of these throughout east Texas, but it's never the lead.",
        "It's part of the overall service sector.",
        "But you can get it going if you get the momentum going.",
        "You can pull in other complimentary activities to support it, such as motels and cafes and things like that.",
        "The trick is getting it done and getting the word out there, getting people to know about what you're doing.",
        "And are you confident in the future of Overton?",
        "I have never been sideline road-kill.",
        "I've made it a point to always know where the action is and to not get caught up in it.",

        "Their eyes are getting big, and they're just kind of like - you know, my cameraman's really good about pulling me out of the way."
