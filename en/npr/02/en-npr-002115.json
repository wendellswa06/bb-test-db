        "Because we think of polls, you know, they don't close until a certain hard time.",

        "The big impulse here is not to call the race early on Election Day, and in fact, we're not planning to make any calls at all.",
        "What we're hoping to do in partnering with VoteCastr is to challenge the way that journalists think about covering Election Day and to offer voters more information as Election Day goes on.",

        "And that embargo has been in place for several decades.",
        "But I don't think there's very good reason for it.",

        "And I don't think that's a good position for journalists to be in.",
        "At the same time, what's the crying need for this?",
        "I mean, what - have we been seriously misinformed because broadcast news outlets have tried to keep the cork in the bottle for just a few hours on Election Day?",
        "Well, I mean, one reason that I think it's worth doing this is that when campaigns gather and take stock of this information on Election Day, they use it to make game-day decisions about how to market to you, right?",
        "So if you're a voter in a key state, the campaigns in that state will look at the same kind of information we're going to be gathering and publishing.",
        "They'll decide to move their radio resources around.",
        "They might send you a couple push text messages.",
        "They are going to try and drive your voting behavior based on the information they're seeing about the race and how it's going.",
        "You know, I think one of the jobs of journalism is to make its users savvier and more aware of the marketing that they're subjected to.",
        "And I think that publishing the information we plan to publish could help do that.",
        "I'm going to return to the same question.",
        "I mean, how?",
        "What's the crying need for that?",
        "Well, I mean, I think isn't it useful for voters to see the election the way that insiders do?",
        "The campaigns are trying to get you to vote in a certain way, and they are pushing you.",
        "And if you can understand why and how they're doing that, maybe you can make a smarter decision."
