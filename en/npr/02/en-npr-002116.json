        "And, you know, I know the Democrats are probably unhappy, but I'd certainly take Will Barr's judgment, Rod Rosenstein's judgment on prosecutions over those people in Congress, many of those people in Congress.",
        "I mean, Barr and Rosenstein did their job as prosecutors.",
        "That's what we expect them to do.",

        "But in summary, the reason that I chose to focus on college-educated and professional women was because that's the group that's most under attack.",
        "Morton Kondracke did a great piece back in 2007 after the Imus incident saying that it seemed to be some type of permissiveness in our culture that allowed people to attack black women, particularly the most educated and successful among us.",
        "And I would agree with that.",
        "So we focused on that demographic.",
        "That group is, you know, about 60 percent of the college graduates in this country and black people in the black demographic are black women.",
        "More black women get advanced degrees than do their black male peers, which is of course contributed to the lopsided 70 percent of professional black women that are unmarried.",
        "In our study it was 67 percent.",
        "The Yale study is the former number.",
        "And so you can see that number's pretty close, Lynn.",
        "It's a very close group.",
        "And so I think that for me, I was most concerned about what was happening with the best and brightest among us and why it was that we could achieve so much success, but we were really struggling - not all.",
        "There are many wonderful black women, as evidenced by Michelle Obama, who are successful, that are doing it all well.",
        "But the great majority are really having some challenges in trying to have that balance that we all seek in our lives.",
        "So that's why I focused on that demographic.",
        "What kind of challenges?",
        "Maybe you can just explain what you mean for that.",
        "What kind of challenges particularly this group of women are facing?",
        "Yes, I think for example chapter three is important.",
        "That's the workplace chapter.",
        "And I talk about and go through while there has been a great deal of success, as you mention in your lead-in for us, we are still under-represented in the professions and in corporate America in very devastating numbers.",
        "I mean, in many senses - there was a study done last year by University of Kansas researchers that black women are still largely invisible.",
        "Now, I know there are people who would argue with that, with Oprah and Michelle Obama how is that possible, but you have to remember, they're the exception, they're not the rule.",
        "And so black women are still challenged.",
        "They're still the most likely to file discrimination suits at work.",
        "They're still the most likely to be recruited but not retained and advanced in any profession."

        "Relationally, I just mentioned the statistics are very daunting, and then we are even dealing with issues of health disparities for black women, you know, whether it's obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, you know, you name it, fibroids, et cetera.",
        "There's depression.",
        "There's financial disparities.",

        "So it was $100 compared to $10,000.",

        "Now, I know that it's hard times for everybody in this economy, and it has been for the last couple years.",
        "So whether you're a white female, black female, white male, black male, you're having a tough time.",
        "But we do know when we look at the unemployment numbers right now and some of the disparities, they hit the black community disproportionately hard.",
        "For example, the unemployment rate is nine percent.",

        "I would just like to say that as a 50-year-old black female who has a bachelor of science in mathematics and also having worked in corporate America as a white-collar worker over the last almost 30 years, I've experienced what appears to be a lower standard of treatment for African-American women within corporate America.",
        "However, the standards for job assessment and for completion of the work are higher.",
        "By lower standard of treatment, I mean that whenever I go to my superiors with either an idea or with a question, I am spoken to, on the average, in a more condescending manner than my white counterparts.",
        "And when I have gone to them with an idea that was a great idea that even was used at some point later, I never was given the credit for that idea."

        "And so I think that I'm hoping we have a dialogue just like the one we're having now, where we can kind of talk openly about these things without pointing fingers or casting blame or, you know, getting angry with one another but simply saying, you know, there's a standard of treatment - I like the way she said that - that's much lower for black women.",

        "She said that in the workplace, people will - a woman said that she didn't like working with African-American women because they get too emotional, they're too touchy, they're too sensitive.",
        "Is that a stereotype?",
        "Is there any reality to that?",
        "Let's talk about that.",

        "That's usually the opposite of what the stereotype is for us.",
        "The usual stereotype is that we're overly strong, overly aggressive, overly assertive.",
        "And so I was a little taken aback by that, but I think probably what she really meant and what the woman was saying is - particularly in the context of diversity training that corporations go through, that law firms go through - in my experience, when it's been a backlash of people resenting that they have to be put through this kind of training or be told how to deal with other people or treat others differently, and then what ends up happening is I think what the woman that she mentioned her job may have been saying is if I am dealing with African-American women, I've kind of got this landmine, if you will, of navigating emotions, feelings, am I going to be perceived as racist, as I going to be perceived as not treating her fairly.",
        "And that's the kind of thing that I talk about in the book, again, particularly in chapter three, which is the workplace chapter.",
        "And I think that's a very rich chapter for young women, particularly young black women and young black men.",
        "But I think women can learn a lot from that chapter, as well, because what I talk about is mentorship and how important it is to have a sponsor, usually a white male or a white female.",

        "The excuse has been grades, you know, are you in your top 10 percent of your class?",
        "Are you in the top five percent of your class?",
        "Well, no, but, you know, for me, for instance, I had no - there was no reason for me not, in my opinion, not to be considered as someone who was more than I guess eligible or have the experience and the desire and the drive to get those big-firm jobs."
