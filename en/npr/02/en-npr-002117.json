        "I saw that they had very strong grades.",

        "And this is someone being very honest and candid.",
        "You know, I might not like what she had to say, but she was giving me real talk.",
        "And so I think that Naomi needs to read my book because chapter three deals with this and tells her how to navigate it through research and through great interviews, et cetera, with experts and people who have done this successfully.",
        "And I think that we again as a country need to evaluate, and we as professionals, particularly I'm speaking to my profession, now lawyers.",
        "You need to get with it and stop with the diversity window dressing, and you need to really get down to the systemic problems in your firms and in your recruiting process that allow you to say well, if we've got one or two blacks or one or two Asians or one or two Hispanics, as long as we hit those numbers, that's sufficient because we know, Lynn, that those people don't stay, and they don't make partner, and that's what's important, that they come in as associates and that they succeed, and they thrive.",
        "And that's really the challenge.",
        "So a lot of firms shy away from even wanting to hire people of color because they - again, they feel like it's loaded - it's a landmine.",
        "And I talk about this in the book.",
        "And as long as the decision-makers feel that black women are a problem versus an asset in the workplace, they're not going to hire us.",
        "It's that simple."

        "Black women in leadership really do feel good about themselves, but it's the society around us.",
        "And coming from some of the ways in which we have to deal with it, I like your idea of mentoring, but the only thing that I would add to it is that African-Americans and other people of color need two mentors.",
        "They need a mentor from their own culture or from a cultural group that is not an in-group, because you also have to learn how to survive.",
        "If you're going to be - especially in corporate America, if you work for yourself, that's different, then you're your own boss.",
        "But in corporate America, you need a mentor who is going to get you to work through institutional racism, but you also need a mentor from your own cultural group to let you know that there's nothing wrong with you.",
        "So if you're only trying to assimilate or trying to get to the top, you will forget that you come - that you have a sense of identity that comes from a different experience, and that the way in which you perceive the world and your experience is whole and healthy and right.",
        "And some of the bias and some of the racism that you will experience, if you're the only one experiencing it and you don't have someone who is also experiencing knows where you're coming from to talk to, then you will internalize it.",
        "And by the time you get to the top and get in those positions, you won't feel very good about yourself, and you will have lost yourself in the process.",
        "So someone who has been in a professional position for over 30 years, you also need to have yourself identified and validated as well as you work through you the system."
