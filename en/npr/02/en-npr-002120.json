        "Yeah.",
        "I just wonder, General Gonzales, whether you think that perhaps Mueller may have left this call to Congress, and the DOJ leadership, instead, decided to weigh in and shut the door before it got to lawmakers on Capitol Hill?",
        "Again, knowing Bob Mueller, I think he would've been quite comfortable in sort of the chain of command and knowing that, at the end of the day, it's the attorney general within the executive branch who makes the final call with respect to prosecutions.",
        "I don't think this - because the standards are different.",
        "Congress will not be looking with respect to prosecution of a crime.",
        "What Congress is going to be looking at is whether or not this is an impeachable offense.",
        "And so I think for Bob Mueller, my own sense is that what he's thinking about is whether or not - has a crime been committed here that can be prosecuted?",
        "And so I don't think this is a situation where he was thinking, I'm going to leave this for Congress to decide.",
        "Very briefly, General Gonzales - Dean Gonzales, as well, because you're dean of the law school at Belmont University.",
        "The president says he's been exonerated.",
        "Has he been, in your view?",
        "I think with respect to the collusion and cooperation, he certainly has.",
        "And, you know, whether you call it exonerate or what, I mean, I think the main objective here is that he's not to be prosecuted for obstruction of justice.",
        "So, you know, I think we're, you know, trying to make a point of whether - what words to use here.",
        "He's very happy with the outcome, and I think he should be happy with the outcome.",
        "I would be happy with this outcome if I were in his shoes.",
        "So, yes, I think, you know, getting in the semantics of, well, is this - you know, has he been exonerated?",
        "Look, he's not going to be prosecuted for obstruction of justice.",
        "That's - you know, that's the most important thing.",
        "And, finally...",
        "As far as he's concerned, I'm sure...",

        "I think he was probably helped by a very, very complete report.",
        "I think it was - the reason he was able to move so quickly is because of him having total confidence in Bob Mueller and the work of his team.",

        "It doesn't look tremendously promising right now.",
        "I think the writers are hoping that if they let Dave Letterman go out there with his writers, and Jay Leno is at a tremendous disadvantage and it's incredibly obvious, that NBC will then start to get panicky.",
        "He'll - Leno will pressure them to make a deal, and then NBC will make a deal, at which point the other networks will want to make a deal.",
        "But I think at this point the networks would rather undergo extreme torture before they would give the Writers Guild any kind of deal.",
        "So there's no way that they'll look towards Letterman and say, okay, this is a model we could follow?",
        "They may look, but they will not say this is a model we can follow because they had an opportunity to make this deal in December and the walked away from the table then.",
        "So it's hard to understand why they would then reverse themselves.",
        "I think they're - I honestly think, you know, in all of these things there's always an element of emotion.",
        "I think the networks are really mad at the writers, and at this point they don't want to give the writers a deal, period.",
        "So, as for TV in the spring, what do we expect to see if we don't see any resolution at all with this writers strike?",
        "Well, the fear, I think, in the community that depends on television is that this is not only just destroying the current television season, but that this is a time normally when it's pilot season, they're looking at what comes up for next season, and that this could - if it drags on, as it appears to be doing now, obliterate next year's season."

        "So if that happens and there's no deal and the Screen Actors are unhappy, you're talking about a strike that could really drag on for months.",
