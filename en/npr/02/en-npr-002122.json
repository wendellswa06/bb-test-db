        "Almost 30 years ago Ms. Layton was fired from her job running the libraries in Davis County, Utah, which is north of Salt Lake City.",
        "She had refused to remove a book that a county commissioner thought obscene.",

        "This would be in 1979, 1980 time.",
        "And a patron complained about a particular book, \"\"Americana\"\" by Don DeLillo.",
        "The county library applied its review process as established by the board of directors to determine if the book should be retained.",
        "They did determine it should be retained, which wasn't a satisfactory answer for Commissioner Swapp, who wanted to have it removed.",
        "Jeanne refused, because a process established by the board had been followed.",
        "The commissioner bided his time, appointed two new board members, and when they had a majority of three, the first thing they did at the first meeting, those - all three sat in - was to terminate Jeanne.",
        "How did she get her job back then?",
        "She got her job by appealing to the courts.",
        "And the determination they made, finally, and this would be at the federal level, was that she was entitled to due process.",
        "So it wasn't a decision truly about the First Amendment issue, so she was reinstated.",
        "She essentially had been doing a good job as a county librarian and it was a dispute about a particular book, and she shouldn't have been fired for that."

        "And does that affect President Trump's negotiating position?",
        "I think it's a very important question.",

        "He's losing the battle to secure his signature domestic policy - a wall on the southern border.",
        "Michael Cohen's congressional testimony is cued up to happen while the summit is taking place.",
        "So we can be sure that the North Koreans follow our politics very closely, and there's no doubt that they will take full advantage of President Trump's vulnerabilities.",
        "Can you tell me a little bit more about these informal so-called track two negotiations with North Korea?",
        "Tell me a little bit more about, like, what is your role?",
        "Well, track one, in case it's unclear, is normal everyday government-to-government discussions.",
        "But because we don't have normalized relations with North Korea, a lot of that doesn't happen.",
        "And, in fact, until months ago, nothing was taking place.",
        "So track two are informal discussions where usually private citizens and experts get together to talk out about these issues in a setting that is relaxed, where you can have a candid conversation."

        "They don't express different opinions among themselves.",
        "They really come to the table with one line, and that is the line from their dear leader, Kim Jong Un.",

        "Well, let's - getting back to President Trump's priorities, the president has said he's in no rush to get North Korea to denuclearize as long as it maintains its moratorium on nuclear testing.",
        "And there are reports that the president is now more focused on getting a peace treaty to formalize the end of hostilities some 65 years after the Korean War.",
        "How do you understand the president's goals?",
        "Well, it appears that President Trump realizes that the strategy of demanding that the North Koreans denuclearize up front before they receive any concessions is not going to work.",
        "So instead, what I think is happening is a more realistic approach, what I would call a phased approach.",
        "In other words, we do something, they do something.",

        "But I - we could still eke out some good progress.",
        "The peace declaration, I think, is a no-brainer for us to put on the table because it's not something that legally binds us to anything in particular.",
        "It simply says that the Korean War is over, and it is, it's been 70 years.",
        "For the North Koreans, it's highly symbolic.",
        "And it goes a long way to addressing why they got nuclear weapons in the first place - because they are fearful of an attack by us, a regime change operation.",
        "And this is a first step towards saying that situation is no longer on the table.",
        "So tell me about Kim's goals as you understand them.",
