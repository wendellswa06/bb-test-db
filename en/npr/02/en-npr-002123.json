        "So I've had tremendous admiration for his work, had the honor and privilege of having met him on occasion - not at all in any close quarters with, but for hello.",
        "And he was always very gracious to people.",
        "NABJ, of course, gave him a lifetime achievement award last year and the NAACP, among others, have talked about just a tremendous contribution he made.",

        "And that's what is path-breaking.",

        "The guy was amazing, and there's nobody in the field who can say that he was not amazing.",
        "And so that is the reason why he was a path-breaker for so many others.",

        "I mean the news business is posting roughly 10 percent profits, which used to be considered a reasonable way rate of return.",
        "But when you see Apple posting, you know, 90 percent profit and Google posting a 120 percent profit - if a news organization is part of a larger corporation, whose total goal is profit maximization, then you'll really never get the news.",
        "And all these other sort of independent stuff, the 24-hour cable cycle, which is really not about news gathering, it's just about regurgitation.",
        "These bloggers who have in such - you know, bloggers bring a lot to the table.",
        "All of us have had our flirtation and - in your case, Farai, some pioneering work with blogging.",
        "But the fact is that, you know, you're borrowing the news gathering function from other folks.",

        "And people are trying to find it.",

        "And I think that means that essentially, it's on the Internet.",
