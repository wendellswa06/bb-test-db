        "None of them are Jordanian, and that's the main - the thrust of this report, is that these terror suspects were picked up by the CIA and then sent to Jordan to be interrogated.",

        "They say they don't practice torture.",
        "The Jordanian authorities absolutely deny it, but there's just so much evidence pointing to the opposite.",
        "Several of these suspects, I guess, are considered high-value detainees.",
        "Yeah, that's correct, and one thing I'd like to point out is that these suspects, of the 14 that we've been able to document, which is by no means inclusive, we don't know how many there might be, five of them we know are now being held in Guantanamo, but many of the other ones we simply don't know what happened to them.",

        "How did you get this information?",
        "There are several ways that we got it.",
        "One is that several suspects were held in Jordanian intelligence prison, and they've subsequently been released, but reported having been held in cells next to non-Jordanians who told them about the rendition that they went through.",
        "So you would have a guy sitting in a cell and in the cell next to him, and they can yell through the hole in which their food is delivered or yell through the walls, they would tell their stories to each other and sometimes pass notes.",
        "So we were able to interview several former Jordanian prisoners who were housed in prison next to non-Jordanians who had been rendered.",
        "Another way was, and this was fascinating, the Jordanian authorities actually opened up their prison to Human Rights Watch so that they could show us how well the prisoners were being treated.",
        "They, unfortunately for them, let us have - to interview the prisoners without minders, and a couple of the prisoners, who are actually still in prison, told us similar stories corroborating what the prisoners, former prisoners, on the outside had already told us.",
        "And we were able to get some of these flight records, which included aircraft that were linked to the CIA, Gulf Stream jets, and Boeing 737s, that landed in Jordan on the same day that these prisoners had told us that these flights landed in Jordan, so that was another piece of corroborating evidence.",
        "In addition, we got a hold of a note from a prisoner called al-Shakarwi(ph), who actually scribbled down a couple of pages of what he endured and smuggled it out to another prisoner who was subsequently released, and he handed the note to our researcher in Jordan.",
        "And what did he describe?"
