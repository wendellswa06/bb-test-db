        "And therefore one of the key issues is how you wear that power, and I think the important thing that he brought there is that he wore it with grace.",
        "But secondly, he understood something more profound when we look back.",
        "That when he decided to step down - and by stepping down he actually acquired more power to influence us and to influence the world than he would have just remaining in that seat of power.",
        "What have you learned about the power that makes you who you are and able to do the things that you've done?",

        "It taught me not to dwell in the past by making it an excuse for my inaction or inabilities.",
        "(Unintelligible) as Mandela says at the conclusion of his long walk, which I smuggled out, he says I can just stop here for a moment and look back.",
