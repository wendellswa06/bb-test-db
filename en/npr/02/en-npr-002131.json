        "Recently, we've been revisiting some of this year's most interesting stories.",
        "One of them took place in Jena, Louisiana, a small town of 3,000 people.",
        "It was a long and complicated story about race in America and NPR's Wade Goodwyn has been covering it for us.",
        "Wade, remind us what happened in Jena and where the story began.",
        "Well, with the Jena story, even that is tricky.",
        "When the story began as a matter of some dispute and it depends on whether you're black or white.",
        "If you're black, it started when a black high school freshman asking a school assembly if he could sit under this big tree in the courtyard where the white students traditionally sat.",
        "And he was told he could sit in where he pleases, but the next morning when the kids got to school, there were nooses hanging in that tree.",
        "The school board decided the incident was a prank and they let the white boys get in-school suspension.",
        "And that punishment did not sit well with the black students.",
        "Their parents were the larger black community in Jena, which is about 10 percent, I think.",
        "Now, most of the whites in Jena believed the noose hanging was a completely separate event from the attack by six black students on a white student named Justin Barker, which happened months later.",
        "And then that was the match that led the protest fires - when those six black students were charged with attempted murder.",
        "Instead of simple assault, they became the Jena Six.",
        "Mychal Bell, who is one of the Jena Six, was the first defendant to go on trial and he was convicted by an all-white jury.",
        "But then, that conviction was thrown out.",
        "What's the latest with him?",
        "Mychal Bell's first trial ended up being something of a fiasco.",
        "Bell's court-appointed attorney seemed not up to the task of mounting a vigorous defense.",
        "He tried to negotiate a plea deal.",
        "But instead of negotiating with his client, he negotiated with his client's grandmother.",
        "And when Mychal Bell was informed of this deal outside the courtroom, he said no. And in response, Bell's defense lawyer refused to put on any defense at all and simply rested immediately after the prosecution presented their case.",
        "The subsequent guilty verdict was thrown out by an appeals court, not because of any issue with Bell's defense attorney, but because Bell was a juvenile at the time of the assault.",
        "And the court said he never should have been tried as an adult in the first place.",
        "Now, by this time, Mychal Bell and the Jena Six had become famous.",
        "And I don't think the judge, the DA, or Bell's new defense lawyers wanted any long drawn-out spectacle where the town of Jena would have ended up being on trial as much as Mychal Bell.",
        "So they had a plea arrangement.",
        "He was pleaded guilty to battery.",
        "And I've been told by his lawyers he's been moved to a halfway house and he could spend most of the next year incarcerated there.",
        "Earlier this week, The Congressional Black Caucus called on the governor of Louisiana to pardon Mychal Bell and the other five members of the so-called Jena Six.",
        "And they argued that they and their families have suffered enough at this point."

        "Wade, tens of thousands of African-Americans traveled to Jena to protest.",
        "Now, the story has passed a bit.",
        "What's it like in Jena now for the families of the defendants?",
        "I think after the protest, Jena went back to normal.",
        "And I am not inclined to believe that normal means an environment that's actively hostile to black people.",
        "I mean, the fact is in small towns across the south - and I would argue outside the south, too - law enforcement is sometimes used as an instrument of oppression.",
        "And that's not just in small towns either.",
        "When these situations do blow up, the white community often feels mischaracterized and traumatized.",
        "So there is some bitterness that ensues.",
        "But that's usually directed at the media, not really at the local black population who, by and large, the whites have known all their lives.",
        "So when the white community protests that they have always treated the black community with Christian intentions, they mean it and they believe it.",
        "And I would suspect many are trying to prove it now, more than ever.",
        "So the black community in Jena, including most of the families of the Jena Six, are still there doing the best they can.",

        "Now Afghans are, on average, better off economically, socially than they were then.",
        "But in terms of security, the situation is more difficult.",
        "The Taliban are stronger, and therefore the mission now for me is to facilitate on behalf of the United States a peace settlement, a reconciliation agreement, between the government and the Taliban.",

        "I asked Khalilzad if the U.S.",

        "He spoke to us from his hotel in New York."

        "Well, there are complications on both sides.",
        "We had some preconditions at that time in terms of engaging the Taliban that they should accept the Afghan constitution, that they should renounce violence, that they should break ties with terrorist groups that would threaten the United States and others.",
        "Those preconditions have become more in-conditions that at the end of the talk we would like them to commit themselves in a way that we can be certain...",

        "How much are Latinos, do you think, going to be able to impact the elections of 2006?",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "I'm not an expert on the politics side, but there can be no doubt that the presence of Latinos in American society is going to be exerting a profound impact on us for many generations to come across a broad front.",
        "I think the immigration issue a potential time bomb for the Republicans in that, while the president has shown some leadership in proposing, you know, some efforts to regularize the situation of people in the country, others in the Republican Party have seen it in their interest to demagogue this issue a little bit because there's a lot of resentment of immigration abroad in the country.",
        "And that could really redound to the detriment of the Republicans in the long run if they alienate the Latino voter.",
        "Finally, I would say that I think African-Americans have a particular interest in how Latinos assimilate themselves into the American political structure.",
        "It matters a lot as to whether or not Latinos are sympathetic to African-American claims.",
        "I think opportunity may be being missed for black politics in not taking the Martin Luther King legacy and applying it in a progressive way to the situation of, especially, undocumented workers in the country, because that might garnish sympathy from Latinos, which would be politically beneficial to blacks in the long run.",
        "Julianne, I remember reading a book called Black and Multi-racial Politics that examines cities where, basically, black and brown people, if you want to put it that way, were a majority in the city when put together but never really acted jointly for political goals.",
        "Do you feel like blacks and Latinos are going to begin to interact more profoundly, more deeply and more aggressively, or is it just going to be oil and water?"

        "In New York City, I'm hoping to see a day when we bring back non-citizen voting, particularly in local municipal elections.",
