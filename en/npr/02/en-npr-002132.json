        "This will happen over time and it will happen in stages.",
        "But there is some real practical experience here in New York City that I think can lead the way.",

        "And has the scandal damaged Hastert's credibility and effectiveness in maintaining party control in the midterm elections?",
        "President GEORGE W.",

        "I mean this is a, you know, it's disgusting behavior.",
        "And the president is going to meet with Hastert, the head of the House, today.",
        "But this is a scandal that seems to have legs.",
        "Julianne, do you think that the president waited too long to make a public statement?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And he's been making these equivocating statements along the way.",
        "Hastert's a good coach, what does that have to do with anything?",
        "What was he coaching?",
        "You know, so he's made these statements along the way until he got to the press conference and finally used the term disgusting.",
        "He's also - I think that the Republicans are playing a game here.",
        "They don't want to admit too much fault.",
        "Certainly pedophilia is not a partisan type of behavior, but certainly Mr. Foley not only - you know, it's clear that there was a cover-up.",
        "The only Democrat on the Page Board did not know about this while all the Republicans did.",
        "So there clearly was a partisan cover-up, and there are going to be partisan consequences for the partisan cover-up.",
        "The president really waited too long, but then so did many others in the House of Representatives.",
        "And, Walter, do you think that this issue, Foley, is really going to overshadow any other initiatives by the administration at this point?",
        "I mean it seems, you know, for someone like me, who's been observing or reporting on Washington for a long time, you look at what happened with Clinton and Lewinsky, and that just trumped everything.",
        "It seems like sex, maybe we shouldn't be surprised, trumps all sorts of other issues of national importance."

        "But I still wonder if sex isn't the sort of inciting factor, the chum in the water that brings the sharks to even cover an issue like this when you can't get folks to cover issues like Medicare or Medicaid because they're too boring.",
        "Well, Farai, certainly there are - we all have an encyclopedia of issues that we feel ought to be covered that aren't being covered by the press for any number of reasons.",
        "And people's hackles do go up.",
        "And with the 24-hour cable churn, something like this is the fodder of the MSNBCs and FOXs and CNNs of the world.",
        "But here's the thing.",
