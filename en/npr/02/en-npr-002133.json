        "And, in order to do so, he's founded a group called Students for Fair Admissions.",
        "And what's interesting about it is when NPR last week was looking for the students who were part of it, they couldn't find students who were part of Students for Fair Admissions.",
        "Yes, but there is some news on that front, and that is in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.",
        "Apparently, there is a deal between - among the Blue Dog Democrats, the fiscally conservative Democrats who have been saying that the health care bill is too expensive and it unfairly burdens small businesses.",
        "So a deal apparently has been reached with the small - the small Blue Dog Democrats, the very tall White House and the rest of the Democratic Party, and so there may be a vote on Friday.",
        "Now, of course, there's also progress being made, as they say over and over again, in the Senate Finance Committee.",
        "That's the one that's led by Max Baucus of Montana, but Mike Enzi, one of the Republicans on the committee, say, you know, hold your horses.",

        "So his numbers are still hurting, falling, and perhaps part of it is the health care bill.",
        "If they pass it, that could help his standing.",
        "But if they get a centrist bill, doesn't he risk losing some liberals on this?",
        "The liberals have been complaining that the president is too willing to compromise.",
        "Unlike Lyndon Johnson, Barack Obama does not get involved in these negotiations.",
        "He's letting Congress do all the heavy lifting, and there's many liberals who say, no, the president should step forward.",
        "He still is really a relatively popular person, far more popular than anybody else, and for him to get involved now would be very good to push that agenda forward.",
        "Just a slight diversion, he stepped into the controversy over the professor who was arrested in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a couple of weeks ago, Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Sergeant Crowley.",
        "He's inviting those two men over to the White House to repair, but he had to step back from some remarks, where he said the police had acted stupidly.",
        "Right.",
        "He did step back, but it was - actually, if you listen - if you think back to that press conference, that was the only real moment of it.",
        "The president obviously spoke about race from his heart, and while he did apologize for the wording he used, it brought up, you know, the issue of race.",
        "And, I mean, to say that just because Barack Obama was elected president, race relations are fine and race is off the table is nonsense.",
        "And the fact is that this is something that people should be talking about.",
