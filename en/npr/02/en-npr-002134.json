        "And for a while, she was going to save the Republican Party, but because of missteps, because of infighting within the Republican Party, and she did - you know, she was satirized.",
        "She didn't do well in interviews.",
        "A lot of people felt that she actually flamed out.",
        "And to have left office taking a few parting shots at her critics.",
        "We are facing tough challenges in America, with some seeming to just be hell bent, maybe, on tearing down our nation, perpetuating some pessimism and suggesting American apologetics, suggesting perhaps that our best days were yesterdays.",
        "And that's, I guess, a line borrowed from Ronald Reagan, but he sort of it put it the other way: It's morning in America.",
        "Right.",
        "And I don't think he ever used the word apologetics.",
        "I don't think anybody has ever used the word apologetics.",
        "Well, she may be facing a wonderful career as a pundit, an observer.",
        "She may get her own talk show.",
        "She'll make millions writing a book, that's for sure.",
        "But a lot of people say she will never get the nomination to be Republican president."

        "He said after he ran for governor in 1983, the only race he ever lost, that he would never get into another race in which he was not properly funded, and he sure wasn't properly funded this time.",

        "And you have the attorney general, Jack Conway, who ran for the 3rd district congressional seat against Anne Northup in 2002, and has made himself the frontrunner with very strong fundraising and endorsements.",

        "No polls I've seen on the Republican side.",
