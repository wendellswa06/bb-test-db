        "That is correct.",

        "It is.",
        "And it's a very - what's fascinating to me is that somebody just came out with a study that showed that Arlen Specter backed the Republican line about 42 percent when he was a Republican.",
        "When he switched parties, it was 68 - 62 percent Democratic.",
        "And then since Joe Sestak announced that he's probably going to run against them, Arlen Specter's now been voting 97 percent on the Democratic side.",
        "So…",
        "Has the White House weighed in on this one as they did in New York?",
        "Yes, the White House is certainly backing Arlen Specter as is Governor Rendell.",

        "But it's important to note that 43 Democrats did vote against Nancy Pelosi.",
        "That was not a record.",
        "There have been challenges in the past for the party leadership.",
        "But given the fact that the party is considerably smaller, more African-American, more liberal than it had been prior to the November 2nd results, the fact that there were - 43 votes against her, and 68 Democrats in an earlier vote, Democrats wanted to postpone the elections until after Thanksgiving, not exactly a ringing win of confidence for Nancy Pelosi.",
        "But, again, the vote was a 150 to 43, not really close.",
        "Is there precedent for a speaker - whose party has been defeated to stay on and serve as minority leader?",
        "Yes, but not for a long time.",
        "I mean, we did know that after 2006, Dennis Hastert quit Congress within a year.",
        "Newt Gingrich, of course, was still speaker when he stepped down.",
        "The nearest precedent I could think of was Joe Martin of Massachusetts, who after the Republican's lost control of the House in 1954, stayed on.",
        "He was defeated in the primary years later.",
        "It was like a intraparty coup, but he stayed on in Congress for another 12 years.",
        "There was another intraparty dispute within the Democratic Party.",
        "The number two Democrat, Steny Hoyer, wanted to retain that position as the Democrats move from the majority to the minority, but also one of the members of the black caucus wanted to move into that seat too.",
        "Well, that's exactly right.",
        "Because once you're in the majority, you have the speaker, the majority leader and the majority whip.",
        "When you go to the minority, you lose the speakership, so you lose a position.",
        "Jim Clyburn had been the whip.",
        "But because Nancy Pelosi will now be leader, Steny Hoyer moves down to whip, what do you do with Jim Clyburn, who after all is a member of the black caucus?",
        "And the black caucus made it clear that they didn't want Steny Hoyer pushing out the only African-American in the leadership.",
        "So Nancy Pelosi created a position called assistant leader, and Jim Clyburn will be that person.",
        "So again, the Democratic - despite the biggest Democratic drubbing in the House since 1938 - they lost 61 seats so far - Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn will still be the leadership."
