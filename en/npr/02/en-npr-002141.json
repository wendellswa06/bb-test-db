        "Well, mine is different from both Peter's interpretation and Albert Finney's.",
        "What happened was I started reading the novels to decide whether I wanted to do the character, because my only knowledge of him was through the movies because I hadn't read any novels prior to me being offered the role.",
        "So I started to read the role - the books and study the role.",
        "And I realized that the little man that I was reading about, I had never seen before.",
        "For some reason, Albert Finney was very, very close, but still not, in my view, the pure Poirot that Agatha Christie wrote.",
        "And self-confessed, darling Peter Ustinov said that he couldn't be, anyway, because he was just a different shape and a whole different thing.",
        "And he wanted to do something different with the character.",
        "And what I was reading about, when I read the book, is this strange, little, eccentric man.",

        "And that's what I did.",

        "Now every time I read a Poirot book, I can see you.",
        "And that was what I wanted to do, and I think that's the difference.",
        "You described him as eccentric.",
        "Agatha Christie herself once described him as a bombastic, tiresome, little man.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "He is a bombastic, tiresome, little man.",
        "He's also very eccentric.",
        "If you like two eggs in the morning, but they have to be exactly the same size, that's very eccentric.",
        "But he is bombastic.",

        "But he has taught me one very important thing, and that is he's really taught me to be a good listener.",
        "Because one of Poirot's great assets is the - his ability not only to listen, but to decipher, while listening, what the speaker really means.",

        "I mean, you do that so skillfully in your portrayal.",
        "But was that a challenge for you, and how did you go about doing that?",
        "Well, that - such interesting questions, if I can answer them briefly and to the point.",
        "I was daunted by the fact that I was going to create such an iconic character.",
        "But the one thing that sort of calmed my mind about that was that I have - I was in the Royal Shakespeare Company for about 13 years, and I had already played very many iconic roles that are being played by many greater actors than myself.",
        "So my mind was put at rest about that.",
        "All I could do is what I could do.",
        "But that fine line between over-the-top eccentricity and naturalism is achieved and still is achieved by me by making the character himself.",

        "He is not aware of his own eccentricity.",
        "If he was, you'd see the actor commenting, and then it would be very silly.",
        "I think Poirot - anybody who is eccentric, anybody who we say is eccentric, they don't know that they are.",
        "It's our observance.",
        "And the most important thing, and where I have to be very, very disciplined on the set in filming, is not to make himself aware that he's being odd or comical or eccentric in any way.",
