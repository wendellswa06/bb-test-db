        "By the 1960s, the Malian musician was breaking with tradition, developing a new kind of African dance music - one strongly influenced by places outside the African continent - places like Cuba, Portugal, the Middle East, and black America.",
        "(Through translator) I been hearing for years -since I was very young - American music.",
        "And I have heard all the great groups, so there is no doubt that they have had a influence on me and on my experience.",

        "For most of his career, Salif Keita has been in serious dialogue with Malian tradition.",
        "You might say that task was thrust on him at birth.",
        "He was born in 1949 to an aristocratic family, a direct descendant of Mali's 13-century founding father.",
        "But Salif Keita was also born an albino, a black African with white skin.",
        "In Africa, albinos are widely considered bad luck.",
        "Keita's own father, a nobleman, rejected him for years.",
        "(Through translator) I was rejected at the beginning, but afterwards my father and I become best friends before his death.",
        "But, of course, albinism is not very well understood in Africa.",
        "Because in Africa everybody's black, and we are white.",
        "It's explained by tradition, but the tradition rejects the albinos.",
        "There is an exclusion and great deal of misery.",
        "The albinos are sacrificed and their blood is used for ritual sacrifice, and there is a great deal of suffering.",

        "It turned out to be another tension father and son had to resolve.",
        "(Through translator) When I started making music, he didn't like that either.",
        "He told me that this was not our sort of work - that music was special, and we were not meant to make music because the noblemen were not musicians.",

        "But Keita says there's still work to be done, not least of all with the issue of Albinism.",
        "And so he's begun a foundation to help Albinos.",
        "He bought land in Bamako, and he's trying to raise money for a school and a clinic for people with the condition.",
        "(Through translator) I have to absolutely set up an Albino's clinic and a dispensary and a school for them, because I don't want to have lived for nothing.",

        "He's using more traditional African instruments and less of an electronic sound.",
