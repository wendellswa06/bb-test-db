        "And the Justice Department then argued in court, we don't think these oral statements should be afforded the same protection as the written ones.",
        "When they signed the written statement, it had like, you know, a big glaring warning saying, you know, you're doing this on - it won't be used against you...",

        "Yeah.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
