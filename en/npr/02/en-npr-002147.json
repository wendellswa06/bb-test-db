        "And we also saw life expectancy march up into octogenarian territory in the last decade, but the obesity epidemic could be slowing down that trend.",
        "Well, what are we going to do about it?",
        "How about a war on obesity.",
        "We already had a war on smoking.",
        "It was pretty successful, but how much of that can you apply?",
        "How many of those lessons learned there actually can apply, can be applied to an obesity epidemic, or do we need a different approach?",

        "Well, we looked at something called quality adjusted life years.",
        "We were able to look at the quality of life - activity limitation, disability - as well as the length of life.",
        "So we were able to look at those in a single number, whereas a lot of previous studies looked at premature deaths - both morbidity, sickness and then mortality.",
