        "For a while, it didn't look like the Giants would be celebrating anywhere this season.",
        "A few months ago, the team was a mediocre 7 and 7, and looked like a long-shot just to make the playoffs.",
        "Even diehard fans like Paul Lamantia(ph), of Long Island, were worried.",
        "I never pictured this to happen.",
        "It's just, you know, I never felt the Giants were - even until they got the Super Bowl, I was very skeptical because the way they played in the beginning of the season, they just didn't show us anything that made you think that they were going to win the Super Bowl.",
        "But Lamantia was there to see it when the Giants pulled out a come-from-behind victory over the favored New England Patriots on Sunday night.",
        "It's the same team the Giants beat in the Super Bowl four years ago, as New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg noted.",

        "The loudest cheers might have been for quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)",

        "Since the climate negotiations are proving difficult, some climate strategists have been hard at work searching for solutions outside of the United Nations.",
        "One involves preserving forests as carbon storehouses.",
        "NPR's Christopher Joyce reports.",
        "The idea has been floating around for years: rich countries that emit lots of climate-warming gases could just pay poorer countries to keep their forests, or even grow them bigger.",
        "Forests suck carbon out of the atmosphere.",
        "It's like paying someone to put carbon in a storehouse.",
        "And it would be cheaper than retrofitting factories and power plants at home.",
        "This is called REDD, for short: Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation.",
        "Hans Brasker, foreign minister of Norway, thinks it's a great idea, and not just to slow warming.",
        "We very strongly believe that we will have established a genuine global partnership to save the remaining tropical forest.",
        "Norway is spending about three billion dollars to make REDD happen.",
        "But skeptics question whether forest storehouses are safe.",
        "What's to stop people from cutting them down someday and releasing all of that carbon back into the atmosphere?",
        "What about indigenous people who live in forests?",
        "Will they lose their homes if the woods are turned into carbon plantations?",
        "At the South Africa climate talks, skeptics sometimes mock the idea of REDD, such as when Simone Lovera from the Global Forest Coalition announced the Muddled Moose Award.",
        "Welcome very, very much for this media event to announce the winner of the Muddled Moose Award, to alert people of the big fairy tales that are being told about REDD."

        "California businesses will need to buy so-called carbon offsets - projects where someone, somewhere removes carbon from the atmosphere because that's cheaper than doing it themselves.",
        "Brunello's group will match those businesses with states like Acre in Brazil and Chiapas in Mexico.",
        "Those places have lots of forest they can preserve - for a price.",
        "But so far there are no rules for this.",
        "How does a company in California - a Pacific Gas and Electric, a Southern California Edison - how would they legally go and talk with the people in Acre in Brazil and do a carbon offset trade?",

        "For example, you'll need to measure exactly how much carbon is stored in a forest, because companies will be paying for it by the ton.",

        "And that laser is able to pick up the three-dimensional structure of the canopy, all the way down to the ground, and all the layers in between, from the top down to the bottom.",
