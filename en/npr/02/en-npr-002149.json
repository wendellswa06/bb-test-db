        "Yeah.",
        "And what is beautiful for me is that every single character that has the power of speech has problems communicating.",

        "You know, the idea of empathy, the idea of how we do need each other to survive - and that's why the original title in the screenplay when I wrote it was \"\"A Fairy Tale For Troubled Times\"\" because I think that this is a movie that is incredibly pertinent and almost like an antidote to a lot of the cynicism and disconnect that we experience day to day in almost every medium.",
        "Can you say more about that?",
        "Do you hear a hollowness in how we connect with each other or talk to each other - try to connect?",
        "Well, yes.",
        "The most intimate spaces get invaded by this idea that often there is them, and there's never - them is an illusion for me.",

        "Right now we are in our terrible twos.",
        "You know, we are in a constant tantrum socially.",
        "And I find it very, very dangerous because it seems to be destroying and eroding civil discourse that we had worked really hard to create over decades, if not centuries.",

        "It's also used in fairy tale.",
        "In fairy tale, in fact, there is an entire strand of tales that would be encompassed by the title \"\"The Magical Fish\"\" - and not exactly a secret that a fish is a Christian symbol.",
        "Right.",
        "And the idea that he is there being - going through a via crucis, you know, by being tortured, being humiliated and then reveals himself as a life-giver, a life-restorer, a godlike figure - must come from there.",

        "There is also, in your work, flirtation with the idea of an afterlife.",
        "What is it about that idea that captivates you?",
