        "All right.",
        "Well, we'll try to follow up on that, and we appreciate your time.",
        "But one final question for you - and we know you're really busy today and we thank you for your time.",
        "But there's been speculation that, in fact, raids like this are designed, well, I guess in part for deterrents, I guess in part to punish people who are here illegally, but also in part to try to persuade Congress to get moving on immigration reform.",
        "Is that an accurate perception?",
        "All I can tell you is ICE is a law enforcement agency.",
        "And as a law enforcement agency, we're obligated to enforce the laws that Congress enacts, and we're not policymakers.",
        "We're just law enforcement agents, and we'll enforce the law.",
        "Okay.",
        "Marcy Forman, again, thanks for your time.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "And this is Rick(ph).",
        "And Rick is calling us from Geneva, New York.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "I'm just outside of Geneva and I'm a grower.",
        "We've got some apples and grapes and pears and things like that.",
        "And we've had a number of raids up here.",
        "We're in the middle of nowhere in the western part of New York state that most people never ever picture.",
        "And I have nothing against ICE.",
        "They're doing their job.",
        "But literally, if we didn't have the Mexican kids around here, we wouldn't be able to pick our fruit.",
        "And I don't know what people want to end up paying for things in the supermarket, but the reality is the few times that they've come through here this past summer, fruit was rotting on the trees, and it's not for lack of trying.",
        "We can put ads in the paper.",
        "We'll get 12 or 15 people from town that are saying they're coming, and two show up.",
        "The American-born folks just don't seem to want to do this work, and yet it's…",
        "Can I ask you a question, Rick?",
        "At what price?",
        "What are you paying these people?",
        "These guys, it's interesting because, you know, I noticed that the ICE spokesperson there said that they charged a union person.",
        "So we also go through union people and team leaders.",
        "It works out to about $100 a day.",
        "But they work hard.",
        "They work - they prefer to work for piece instead of per hour and they want to know that they can make $100 a day minimum, and some of them work a lot harder than that or work more than that.",
        "But it's a lot more than the minimum wage and it's a lot more than what people are getting paid as social workers around here by the local county governments and things like that."

        "And I wonder, has it had an effect of people like you contacting your local member of Congress and saying, look, we've got to do something about this?",

        "And for a while, he was looking favorably upon the problem that the growers have.",
        "But then, whatever reason, I guess, they decided that immigration should be a Republican issue, so they've all shut their mouths on it.",
        "It's hard to get any traction.",
        "And I don't disagree that - we're not trying to break the law up here and get anything for nothing.",
        "The ICE people are doing their job.",
        "But there isn't any alternative, especially in some of these rural areas, it's a lot more difficult than people think.",
        "I don't think people should break the law.",
        "On the other hand, people have to decide how - what kind of jobs they're going to do, you know?",
        "It's not the Mexican people coming across the border that are sitting on welfare.",

        "The first raid that did happen actually took almost 75 percent of the employees in one shift because there were so many illegals working in the Swift plant.",
        "The second raid was actually known that it was going to happen.",
        "Swift had been told - and I believe that for every illegal at their town there, they're going charge them approximately $5,000 for each one.",
        "So it was a known fact.",
        "But…",
        "At least, officially, Amanda, the ICE says that the employer was not informed of the raid in advance.",
        "So that's the specific.",
        "Well, they were too, but they weren't given a specific date.",
        "But it was known that it was going to happen.",

        "We'll have to agree to disagree on that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And - but the thing is that was - you know, really disturbing was that a lot of people took the side of these illegals that were deported.",
        "And - but the fact is not only did they lie to them once about identification but they lied to them twice when it comes to being both parents that were working in a Swift plant.",
        "They were asked, do you have any children that are here.",
        "If you do, you need to let us know.",

        "Well, right after the raid, we were in contact with ICE, trying to find out who really had been detained.",
        "And we were not able to get those names.",
        "I could understand as well that the names they were working under were probably not the real names, so it was a difficult time to try and figure out who was detained and who wasn't.",
        "But I do - I was told by an ICE agent after I called them the next day through our senators that they were told at the plant that if you have either a child or a dependent adult at home, raise your hand, you'll be sent home and you'll have to appear at a later time.",
        "Undoubtedly, fear did play a big part so they did not raise their hands and were both taken.",
        "Now, Swift is the largest employer in Marshalltown, but not the only company in town by any stretch of the imagination.",
        "But the town has changed dramatically over the past 15 years.",
        "Well, yeah, exactly, now, in 17 years, actually.",
        "1990 was when the packing plant first started hiring Hispanics who came up here to work.",
        "It is our largest employer with 2,100 employees.",
        "But we do have a diversified industries with Lennox and Fisher and Racom and Marshalltown Company.",
        "So it is certainly not just dependent upon Swift.",
        "But when Swift did have the raid, there was a major impact on the community.",
        "But it was more emotional than economic because this occurred just before Christmas.",
        "And the minute the raid happened, all of the town leaders, the church leaders, all of the educators, the school systems, the city, got together and the first thing we did was to make certain that no child was indeed at home alone.",
        "And none were.",
        "Now, what percentage of the population of the town is Hispanic now?",
        "Well, officially with our last census, it says 12 percent.",
        "But as our last census also said we have 26,008 people, I think that's a miscount.",
        "I think we're closer to 28 to 30,000 people, and our Hispanic population is really closer to 20 percent."
