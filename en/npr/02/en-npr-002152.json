        "And a lot of people say Marshalltown has, in fact, been revitalized to a degree by the immigrant community.",
        "Well, I would have to say that's true.",
        "The population that I quoted is 26,008 is identical to what it was back in 1980.",
        "Had the Hispanics not come in and set up businesses - for instance, we have 44 businesses owned by Hispanics in our community today that had they not come in and brought their culture and basically revitalized our school system as well, even though there are pressures there, we would be a different community.",
        "All right.",
        "Stay with us, if you would, Mr. Mayor.",

        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",

        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",

        "We're spending much of this hour talking about the immigration raid in Marshalltown, Iowa, and how it affected that community.",
        "We also want to talk about that city and its Hispanic population, which has grown significantly in recent years, a trend that can be seen in the cultural identity of the city.",
        "The mayor of Marshalltown, Gene Beach, is still with us here in Des Moines.",
        "And Mayor, I wanted to ask you, I know Marshalltown has a couple of official sister cities.",

        "Well, that's definitely true.",
        "Most of the immigrants we've received from Mexico have come from the city of Villachuato.",
        "And we were fortunate enough through a university professor at University of Northern Iowa and the Martha-Ellen Tye Foundation to fund a bunch of people to go to Villachuato.",
        "And they were our former mayor, the police chief, several educators that went - and medical people who went down to the community to see where the immigrants were coming from.",
        "And it gave them good insight as to why large numbers of them decided they wanted to come to Marshalltown.",
        "Interestingly, they also indicated that while they were there, they noticed a large number of 64 County pickups, which 64 County is Marshall County.",
        "So it has developed into somewhat of a sister city state as rather unofficially.",
        "And it's a symbiotic relationship.",
        "This town in the city of Mexico needs Marshalltown and you need them.",
        "Oh, definitely.",

        "Iowa - Marshalltown has probably close to 3 percent unemployment, which is as close to full unemployment as you can get.",
        "And we need workers.",
        "I go to industrial bureau meetings on Fridays of the first of every month.",
        "And I hear the same thing from all of the leaders of our industries.",
        "We need workers.",

        "There going to be a shortage of skilled workers in, you know, our factories in Iowa, about 150,000 short by the year 2012.",
        "So there is a shortfall of workers in Iowa.",
        "And right now, the packing plants, they are definitely utilizing the illegal immigrants, as well as legal immigrants.",
        "One of the things that I keep pointing out to people in Marshalltown is that not everybody who's brown is illegal.",
        "And it's a hard concept for them sometimes to understand.",
        "You know, and they will say, I don't care - I don't dislike Mexicans.",
        "They're welcome to come here.",
        "But I want them to learn my language.",
        "I want them to - you know, they start putting the preconditions on them.",
        "And I jokingly say, you know, we're basically white Anglo-Saxon community.",
        "And I sort of jokingly say that you don't want Hispanics.",
        "You want brown Germans.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It's a city, as you point out, that hadn't really changed, certainly not the demographics of it for decades, and then 17 years ago, began to change.",
        "I know that there is a lot of tension that comes when a different ethnic group, a different lingual group comes into a town.",
        "I saw you wince earlier when our earlier guests, Martha Garcia, was talking about the experience of her son in the Wal-Mart in town the day after the raids and hearing somebody say, gee, why didn't they pick up you in the raid.",
        "That's totally discouraging to me because Marshalltown had made really great strides prior to the raid.",
        "And the raid indeed set us back 10 years in forming a real community.",
        "Those kinds of comments are really unfair.",
        "Martha Garcia pointed out something really important.",
        "She worked for, like, 22 years to become an American citizen.",
        "No path to citizenship should be that difficult.",
        "We heard recently of a fellow from England who came to Iowa, loved Iowa, wanted to work in Iowa, and he was told it would take 17 years for him to get a work permit to come to Iowa to work.",
        "That's inexcusable.",
        "I mean, I have a traditional history in my family that came with the Puritans.",
        "Some came over as Hessian soldiers.",
        "Some were Irish people who came over.",
        "They did not have quotas to pass.",
        "And I guess - I don't know why they make it as difficult today.",
        "There must be some way and - to make them legal.",
        "I'm not saying amnesty, that's the buzz word that everybody hates.",
        "But I'm saying there has to be a pathway to allow people to come to this country and work and become citizens."
