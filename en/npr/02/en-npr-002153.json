        "Serge Sur is a professor of public law at University of Paris II.",
        "He says the French differ over the solutions to the country's problems, not the problems themselves, and France is far less divided than it was 30 years ago.",
        "You do not have two Frances socially.",
        "There is no longer a divide between a working class and a bourgeoisie.",
        "You have a main middle class.",
        "You have no longer an ideological divide.",
        "Because communism is dead and people who are voting for the far right it's not for ideological reasons, it's a kind of despair.",
        "It's no longer a divide in terms of values, because all region is not an act of divide between French people, and you have a lot of consensus about humanitarian values.",

        "According to the Pentagon's most recent data, an estimated 8,000 members of the military have deserted or have not reported to duty since the start of the war in Iraq.",
        "That's a tiny fraction of the armed forces, and, to put it in perspective, way below desertion rates during the war in Vietnam.",
        "Besides the numbers, we know relatively little about Iraq era deserters--who they are, or whether their motives are personal or political or both.",
        "For the most part, their options are limited.",
        "During the Vietnam War, many draft resisters and deserters went to Canada, but that is much more difficult today.",
        "In just a moment, we'll talk with one deserter who left for Canada two years ago, whose case for asylum is now making its way through Canadian courts.",
        "We'll also explore the issue with a military sociologist and talk with a lawyer about the legal consequences.",
        "Well, no. And politically, the world is very different than the situation at the end of the Vietnam War.",
        "Well, we have some definitions that are typically based on something called body mass index, or BMI, which some of your listeners may have heard of.",
        "That's an index where we divide the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters, and it's a pretty good measure of fatness, at least for clinical and population use."

        "In adults, obese is defined as a BMI above 30 and overweight between 25 and 30, and between 18.5 and 25 is normal.",
        "In kids, where weight gain accompanies our growth, how much we grow in height, we have to compare ourselves with other kids the same age and sex, and so we use what's called percentile.",
        "So over the 95th percentile is considered obese, and between the 85th and the 95th is considered overweight.",
        "All right, I'm going to have to stop you there because we have to take a break, but we will come back and talk about it some more with Dr. Lubetkin and Dr. Gillman.",
        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255 if you want to talk about the obesity epidemic.",

        "Our number, 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Dr.",
        "Gillman, you know, we talk about being overweight and eating, but how much of our epidemic is due to the proliferation of junk food and, you know, fast food because it's a lot cheaper, and maybe there is a difference in people who can't afford to buy good food, and the junk food is cheaper.",
        "Well, it's a really good question about what's caused the obesity epidemic, and I think most people think it's multi-factorial.",
        "You know, if you go back in evolution, it sort of makes sense that when we're faced with extra food, it pays to pack it on because in the past, we wouldn't know where our next meal was coming from.",
        "But in today's world, where it's feast all the time and very little famine for most people, it's hard to keep the extra calories off.",
        "And I think there are many things in our environment that have helped us to overeat, whether it be the food industry, who make profits from selling more food, so the ubiquitousness of fast food, as you say, sugar-sweetened beverages and things like that, but also the lack of physical activity, and a lot of the, you know, the energy-saving devices we have, whether they be cars or elevators or things like that, tend to keep us from getting as much physical activity as we'd like.",
        "And recently we've, you know, been learning about some other factors.",
        "For example, watching too much television, which may have its effect through either physical activity or overeating, and things like too little sleep, which may have a direct effect on hormones that tend to have us overeat.",
        "Dr.",
        "Lubetkin's sitting here like a bobblehead doll, shaking her head up and down about all these things.",
        "You agree."

        "Oh, I agree entirely.",
        "I think that the big contributors are the changes in the food in terms of, you know, eating more food, bigger portions, fast food, changes in the physical activity, especially - I'm an internist, so I see adults, but certainly at the pediatric level, in terms of less exercise, more TV-watching, static activities.",
        "Video games.",
        "Video games, exactly, and that's been correlated, as well as changes in health care in terms of lack of health insurance, not having a primary care provider - other aspects.",
        "What about, you know, when I go to a fast-food restaurant, and - what has helped me are the calorie things.",
        "You know, if I'm saying gee, maybe I'll have a vanilla shake today, and I look and see that it has 600 calories in it or something, it actually changes my habits.",
        "Has that contributed or helped people to stop eating, you know, some of the fast foods at all?",
        "Does it work, that kind of approach?",
        "I think both of you are actually sitting in New York City, which has led the way in posting calorie counts on menus.",
        "Some other cities, counties, states are following that lead, and there's ongoing research to determine whether it's really effective in getting people to eat fewer calories.",

        "Well, I think your guest may actually have some good advice for people who either want to lose weight or actually may not want to gain weight, and that is small changes over a long period of time can be very helpful.",
        "You know, our physiology, as I was talking about it before, because of evolution, tends to resist weight loss.",
        "When we gain weight, we come to a new physiologic set point or something like that, and our hormones in our body, when we lose weight after that, say oh, geez, you might be starving.",
        "Let's keep eating.",
        "So a lot of times, it's easier to keep from gaining weight than to try to lose weight.",
        "There, you know, there are various weight-losing shows on TV now, where they're actually contests, where very obese people come on to lose 20, 30 pounds, what, a week.",
        "Is this a healthy way to lose weight?",
        "Well, you know, as a clinician and public health researcher, especially who deals with - well, I deal with both kids and adults, but my view is that we really ought to be talking about prevention of weight gain starting very early in life.",
        "And a lot of our research deals with what things happen during pregnancy and infancy and early childhood that lead to either more or less weight gain.",
        "And we're learning things like the amount of weight that a woman gains during pregnancy, whether she gets diabetes, even whether she smoked can have an impact on her child's obesity.",
        "And once the kids are born, breastfeeding, the amount of sleep they get, these things are very important, I think, for having people not gain weight in the first place and not having to face the question that you're actually asking."

        "There's two things I'd like to talk about regarding that.",
        "The first is I think legal reform, on what is allowed in schools, in public schools, would be great.",
        "I think Coke and Pepsi are not all that different from, say, tobacco companies in that they try to get, you know, young people started on junk food as early as possible, and they do it in such a way that allows them to look like heroes because they enter into these contracts with public schools, and you know, they're like, you know, Powerade is a proud sponsor of this, whatever school, and it allows them to look like they're helping.",
        "And in my opinion, they're definitely causing a lot of hurt.",
        "But secondly, I'd like see a healthy-eating ad campaign of some sort that would allow us to feel, perhaps patriotic, you know, at least good citizens for eating well.",
        "You know, when we eat well, and we take care of ourselves, we're able to go to work.",
        "We're able to make money.",
        "We're able to take better care of our families, and we're just better people all around, and few people are proud to eat well.",
        "More people are...",
        "Let me get a reaction from our guests.",
        "Erica, what do you think of a campaign like this?",
        "Well, in terms of the former campaign with regard to the school-based setting, I think it's an excellent place, in terms of these habits are formed very early, and it's a good, regulated environment in terms of healthy lunches in the cafeteria, physical activity regulations, which vary from state to state, and really an emphasis on nutrition and prevention.",
        "And so I think that that's a wonderful place to start, and especially keeping the sugar, the sweet juices and sodas out of the school environment.",
        "And the second thing is, I think, in terms of our quality of life, there's been a lot of studies in terms of obesity.",
        "And certainly, if you look at - we measure what's called health-related quality of life, which is your physical, your emotional, your social well-being, and a lot of the literature has shown that obesity in particular leads to worse outcomes with regard to how you feel about yourself.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "But you can tell this to people, but do they have the willpower?",
        "Do they have the means?",
        "Do they have the money to change their lifestyle to become thinner, or to stay thin, or to change their diets or their exercise habits?"
