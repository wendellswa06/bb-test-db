        "That's a very good question.",
        "You know, I think there's been a lot of emphasis on what some people call personal responsibility in changing lifestyle behaviors, but we also have to recognize that we live in an environment that restricts our behavior.",
        "And if you're living, for example, in an urban neighborhood where it's not safe to go out and get some exercise, and the only food that's available is from a fast-food restaurant or bodega or mom-and-pop store, it's very, very hard to change your behavior.",
        "And if you're a kid, and if you're living with a single mom, and she's working two jobs, and you're a latch-key kid, it's very hard to get the physical activity or to eat right.",
        "So I think while we have to address individual behavior change, it's really important that we think about changing the obesogenic environment.",
        "And how would you do that?",
        "Any suggestions?",
        "Well, I think we've already heard, on this program, some ideas about how to do that, whether it be in the child-care setting, school setting, medical setting, the built environment.",
        "I think people are starting to do this in different ways.",
        "We heard earlier about menu labeling in restaurants.",
        "Could you subsidize?",
        "Let's say - I'm just going to think off the top of my head.",
        "Let's say a lot of people get food stamps now.",
        "Could you get more food stamps if you buy healthier food: fruits, vegetables and things, disproportionately just to getting the stamps in general.",
        "How about that as a suggestion?",
        "So you can afford to buy healthier food.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Hmm.",
        "I think that's a wonderful idea, and in terms of combating the obesity epidemic, you'll need multiple, multiple strategies.",
        "One size doesn't fit all in terms of policies, but certainly we all know that going to McDonald's, it's a lot cheaper to get a meal there than, you know, a healthy salad at a salad bar.",

        "You know, you brought up the issue of smoking at the top of the program, and I think there are a lot of lessons to be learned about the antismoking campaigns.",
        "For example, there was, you know, the combination of individual behavior change, like doctors telling their patients to stop smoking or never start.",
        "But - plus environmental interventions like taxing cigarettes that helped us really reduce smoking in the country.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "However, you also have to say that it's a little bit more complex with obesity because eating behavior is neither legal nor illegal.",
        "There's a big gray zone about what's healthy and what's not healthy.",
        "Still, some people are talking about taxing sugar-sweetened beverages.",
        "Right.",
        "A lot of these beverages really are empty calories and there's no sort of redeeming social nutritive value to them.",
        "So we can probably agree on some strategies that are fairly translatable from our experience in smoking to our experience in obesity.",

        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "We have a question in from Silver Wing Benwarren(ph) in Second Life, says: Do artificial sweeteners help people lose weight or reinforce their need for sweets?",
        "If you taste that sweetness, you say I've got to have the real thing, I guess is the question.",
        "Any thoughts on that?",
        "This is an area that's sort of still up for grabs.",
        "There have been - excuse me - some studies, both short-term and sort of larger epidemiologic studies looking at this and I don't think they're conclusive yet.",
        "But you know, there are some interesting animal studies that suggest that if you give somebody artificial sweeteners - somebody, some rat, I guess - some artificial sweeteners, they tend, actually, to eat and drink more after that because it sort of fools their appetite systems into thinking they are getting a lot of calories with sweeteners in it.",

        "And so, you know, I'm wondering why we aren't questioning more the subsidies of corn and soybeans where - I mean, it's too expensive for an average American family to eat real food, real food with real ingredients, not processed.",
        "It's cheaper for me to, you know, drive down the street and get fast food.",
        "But we find that, you know, when our kids are actually eating food that, you know, I cook at home with organic ingredients, that their health improves.",
        "I mean, I think any discussion about obesity in America has got to start with policy, policy that's going to talk about, you know, changing what's - what the American family can afford.",

        "And a lot of it is set up to actually support industry, and it hasn't been surprising, I don't think, over the years, that, you know, the farm bills and other bills that have come out have really, you know, supported production...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...but haven't really looked at the health impact.",
        "And I think, you know, there's more talk now, you know, both in scientific as well as political circles about relooking at these issues and seeing whether, you know, whether we squeeze the balloon in one area, it really pops out in another and you have the law of unintended effect, so if you produce more sugar or corn that it may be good in the short term for the farmers, but not good in the long term for the health of the public.",
        "You know, Christina asks about the subsidizing and how it's more expensive.",
        "But in some places - and Erica, you can't even buy healthy foods in some inner-city stores and some supermarkets.",
        "It's not even there, even if you want to pay for it."

        "There's a lot of processed foods.",
        "And certainly there's been more of a movement in terms of having farmers, green markets, coming and delivering fruits and vegetables, and having - people have a means to pay for it.",

        "Well, might people argue, well, if there were demand for it, they would have it in the store?",

        "I think we may come back to these issues of, you know, chicken and egg.",
        "And if we live in a society where we're bombarded with media messages about eating more and eating bigger portion sizes and that's what faces us when we go out our doors, and that's what role models do, it's hard to pin it on the demand side of it.",
        "And it's also different with regards to children and adults where - with children those messages are just so in front of them in terms of, you know, walking by a McDonald's or a fast food and seeing the Happy Meal and the product and that marketing to kids and being so susceptible, or going to the drugstores and seeing all the candy on the lower shelf, where a child - it's marketed of a movie or some other character.",
