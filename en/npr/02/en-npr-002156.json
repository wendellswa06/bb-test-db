        "As I understand it, the show has been laid out, I'm not sure on every single detail, but it's going to end completely, fundamentally, forever and ever at the end of next season, correct?",
        "Right.",
        "And in the last episode - by the end of the last episode, will all of the answers have been given?",
        "You'll have to ask Damon and Carlton about that.",

        "And I will say I was the biggest fan and a lot of friends of mine were as well.",
        "But I'm just wondering, have the ratings suffered a bit because it just seems like with the script and where it's going, there are no limitations for the characters, of course, or the world they live in.",
        "And it has become so complex that to be honest with you, besides myself, a lot of people say that they've abandoned watching the show because it's become so complex, almost to the point where it has this almost dungeon and dragon persona about it where that - you know, people put their hands up and regardless of how closely they try to follow it, it almost seems too complex to follow, maybe - have you ever considered you might be shooting yourself in the foot by just - making it just unlimited in its...",

        "All right, go ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think Damon and Carlton do have a master plan of where they're going with everything, and it is going to tie in together at the end.",
        "But as far as those, you know, those fans who have - feel like it is growing too complex for them to follow, you know, I don't know if I necessarily have anything that I can say to them that will, you know, bring them back into the fold, so to speak.",
        "But other than - I think there's enough character stories and emotional-based stories that are going on within each week's episode that they can have something to hook into.",
        "And then if the people who want more mythology or want more of a sci-fi element to it, there's definitely that aspect of it, too.",
        "But, you're right.",
        "I mean, the episodes have - I mean, the seasons have changed as Damon and Carlton have talked in the past.",
        "It's almost like each season is a book.",
        "And as - you know, like the Harry Potter novels, each book has its own feeling and its own sort of tone and character about it.",
        "And so, perhaps if they don't like this particular season or one of the past seasons, they can hook in now or in the next one and still get the story of what's going on.",

        "So, maybe they'll start to consider it.",

        "I wanted to know, do you - is it your perception, working on the show that the creators knew from day one where they would end up at the end of the seventh season or in sort of the book format, are they evolving it all the time?",

        "Well, exactly.",

        "If you think back to when the pilot aired, it was a pretty unique story, and it told its story in a different sort of way, and it didn't introduce the characters in a way that is typical for other TV shows.",
        "And so there was some sort of, you know, question of whether even the pilot would be picked up.",
        "So then, once it got picked up, I believe it only got picked up for about 12 episodes initially.",
        "And then, you know, they were sort of going towards that, and once they got the full season and realized that it was much more of a hit, I think that's - early on, Damon and Carlton sat down and said, we have to, you know, map this out of where we're going, and they set the bigger goal post of what they were headed for.",
        "And were you in on this from the beginning?",
        "Did they know that they were going to need somebody to keep track of all of the stuff?",
        "No.",

        "So I had worked with Carlton and, actually, Damon, too, on a previous show called \"\"Nash Bridges.\"\" And then...",
        "Nash Bridges\"\" is easier to keep track of, I suspect.",
        "(Laughing) Yeah.",
        "And then during the summer of - between the first and second season, Carlton called me and offered me the job, and I immediately took it.",
        "And when I went in there, I, you know, asked them.",
        "I said, where are all your, you know, your support documents, essentially, that give all the information because you guys are starting to really delve into the history of these characters and the flashbacks are starting to have cross - character crossings, and you guys are just going to have to keep a hold of this so that it, you know, goes forward and you don't make any mistakes.",
        "And they were like, that's why we brought you in.",
        "Good luck.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And you had to then - I'm sure you've been watching it, but I'm sure now as the script coordinator, you had to sit down and watch that first season, again, very carefully.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a different experience to watch it as a fan during the first season which I did, and then to watch it to create these documents.",
        "So I would actually read the scripts and then watch the episodes.",
        "Because like I said, you know, even if it was written in the script, and it didn't make it to the final cut, I still had to track that information.",
        "And Tom, by the way, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "How - do you go to school to become a script coordinator?"
