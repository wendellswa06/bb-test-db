        "But about a month into it, I was marching to the chow hall with my company, and we were repeating the chant over and over, which was trained to kill, kill we will, and our drill sergeant thought our rendition of it wasn't enthusiastic enough, and they threatened us with some extra physical activity.",
        "And what happened was I looked all around me, and all my fellow soldiers were getting red in the face, their voices were going hoarse, and their heads were bobbing up and down, you know, and trained to kill, kill we will, trained to kill, kill we will, and that's just one example of the process of becoming desensitized to what it is you have to do as a soldier.",
        "Mm-hmm, yeah.",
        "And so, I figured, you know, that would end after...",
        "Basic.",
        "...basic training, but it didn't.",
        "I got to the 82nd Airborne, who's standard, and rightfully so...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...is that we exceed the standard, and it continued.",
        "And what my issue was is that in order to kill, you can't look at the person you're killing as a person.",
        "You have to objectify them and dehumanize them, and you gotta find some way to do that.",

        "Right.",
        "And it's common, we find it, but some people actually swallow it down and just do their time and then get out.",
        "But those that have the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say I can't take this anymore, we classify them as losers, and they're not.",

        "But the one difference is, I wouldn't be putting other things, or people, hopefully, in my sights and pulling the trigger.",
