        "That's his military specialty, yeah.",
        "Yeah, one of the comments I would like to make is, I am a combat medic.",
        "And as a combat medic, one of the, if you want to call it an oath, or one of the things that is instilled to you as a combat medic is, not only do you have to defend yourself, you have to defend that fallen soldier, whether it's one of our own or one of the others.",
        "So, I hate to say it, but don't compare the combat medic into other jobs as the, kind of like the conscientious objector...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...because we're not.",
        "The second is, is I applaud this young man in the sense that, in the military--not knowing what rank he was--it takes a lot of intestinal fortitude to make a decision, stand by that decision, knowing that the repercussion of the decision that he makes is going to have a lifelong effect.",
        "And I am proud, very proud to wear the uniform of the United States Military.",

        "Well, thank you, Robert.",
        "I knew, I mean, I worked with medics, we had on in our platoon.",
        "And, of course, they have a side arm, and that brings me to my conscientious objector hearing, and why it was and why my claim was denied.",
        "When we went to Afghanistan, they gave me an M4, and I asked, kind of in a puzzled way, why are you giving me this rifle, if I'm a conscientious objector?",
        "And they said well, Hinzman, you still have the inherent right to self-defense.",
        "And if we were to be attacked, you have the obligation to defend us.",
        "So, that's what they told me, and I accept that.",
        "And had I been reassigned to be a combat medic, I'd be carrying a side arm, that's fine.",
        "But what happened was in my hearing, which took place in a tent in Afghanistan, we were sitting in our recliners, or whatever those lawn chairs are called.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the investigative officers, the First Lieutenants, probably some sort of busy work for him, but he said, you know, if our camp was attacked, Hinzman, what would you do?",
        "And I answered, well, and sincerely answered, because I said, well it's my obligation to defend my fellow soldiers, and I'm human.",
        "I'd defend myself.",
        "If my house was burglarized, I would take measures to restrain the burglar.",
        "But I'm not going to use that same logic to commit premeditated, first-degree murder on a collective level.",

        "No, any offensive military operation that is like a, well, specifically raids and ambushes, which is what we do...",
        "Mm hmmm, in the 82nd Airborne, yeah.",
        "...in the infantry, yeah.",

        "He's not a typical deserter by any means.",
        "The most serious studies done on deserters in the American Army, starting in World War II through the Vietnam War, show that about five percent of deserters are truly involved in some way with conscientious objection.",
        "The other great number, 90-plus percent are family problems, personal problems, failure to adapt, maladjustment--this was even mentioned by Jeremy, immaturity.",

        "It's also important to note that about half of all deserters, which is usually defined as 30-days absence without leave, beyond 30 days, about half of them come back under their own volition, back into the military.",
        "But in Jeremy Hinzman's case, what's interesting here is that, according to American law, to be a conscientious objector, you have to be against all wars, not just a specific war.",
        "And that makes it, you know, much more complex.",
        "You know, it's important, by the way, you might remember that the name of the most famous soldier in World War I, Sergeant York.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...the rate of desertion in the Iraq war so far is a fraction of what it was during the Vietnam War in terms of proportions.",
        "It's about eight to nine times greater desertion rate towards the end of the Vietnam War than what we are currently experiencing.",
        "An Army that included many draftees during Vietnam.",
        "And that's the other important finding.",
        "Draftees in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam had a lower desertion rate than did volunteers, which is completely counter-intuitive.",
        "I, by the way, I speak as a former draftee.",
        "The reason that the, for this lower attrition rate and lower desertion rate of the draftee was several reasons, but the main one was that they usually came from better socioeconomic backgrounds, were more mature, and therefore, and also had a shorter term of service, in many cases.",
        "So, if you really want to get desertion down, maybe one way to do it is bring back the draftee, which is not on the political horizon.",
        "But that's a very interesting thing.",
        "In World War II, by the way, soldiers with college education had a desertion rate only one-fifth that of the rate of soldiers who only had a grade school education, and that finding has been pretty consistent over the decades.",
