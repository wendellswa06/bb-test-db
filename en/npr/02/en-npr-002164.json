        "What legal grounds do they have?",
        "Well, Neal, it's very interesting, because, of course, they are under an obligation to serve, and they fall into two broad categories.",
        "We've got those individuals who are currently on active duty, and it's just going to be a deployment for them.",
        "But the more significant cases that we tend to see are those the reservists, the National Guard.",
        "As Charles just mentioned, there's such a large portion of the troops in Iraq that are reservists, and their cases actually are treated somewhat significantly differently.",
        "These are people who, by large measure, allowed themselves to believe what the recruiters told them.",
        "That they'd get college education benefits, and they'd drill once a month and two weeks a year, and didn't realize that they actually were going to be mobilized, in some cases on multiple occasions, to deploy for up to a year or two overseas.",
        "And as Charles also indicated, the small number of cases, but those that get the most attention, are the conscientious objector cases.",
        "The vast majority of the cases are like Sarah from Eugene, her daughter, who has deployed before, but she has something in her personal life that has come up, and has now caused her to refuse to deploy.",
        "What eventually they face is either obtaining a delay or exemption from being required to mobilize, or eventually that hard choice of show up or face potentially very, very serious administrative or disciplinary action against them.",
        "If you turn yourself in, are you better off than if you're found?",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "One of the aggravating factors in an unauthorized absence case, and as Charles indicated, after a soldier or service member has been gone over 30 days, they are administratively declared to be a deserter.",
        "But one of the aggravating factors of a case is did the service member return voluntarily to military control, or were they apprehended?",
        "That's the military term for arrest.",
        "Were they apprehended and then returned involuntarily to the military?",
        "If they're apprehended, they're much more likely to go into pretrial confinement at the military brig, pending a determination as to how their case is going to be handled--whether it would be perhaps at a lower level administrative or disciplinary case, then followed by an administrative separation, which will result in a bad paper discharge.",
        "Typically, an other than honorable discharge.",
        "Or they may go to a court martial.",
        "And actually, for a number of reservists and guard who have refused to comply with their mobilization orders, they have found themselves at the highest military court martial, the general court martial, which is the military's equivalent of a felony trial, have gotten a conviction, either a bad conduct discharge or a dishonorable discharge as well as potentially some fairly lengthy periods of confinement.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now, again, another factor is how long you may have been in the service?"

        "But if you've been in the military for a number of years, and you happen to be at a higher pay grade as either officer or enlisted, then those individuals are definitely looking at more severe punishment.",
        "And from your experience, is the military eager to go after people to make examples of them?",
        "Well, generally no. At this point, they do not normally send out what is called an absentee collection unit to find these individuals and bring them back.",
        "Although clearly, in particular cases, it may have obtained some degree of notoriety or publicity then they may be more to do that than others.",
        "Generally, what happens is that after the individual has been away from the military for over 30 days, they're declared to be, administratively declared a deserter.",
        "Their name and information then goes into the national crime information center.",
        "And typically, what happens is they're stopped for a traffic offense, the police officer runs their driver's license, they're identified as being a deserter from the military.",
