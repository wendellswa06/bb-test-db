        "And for me, it's kind of an experience that I kind of get when I go home for Thanksgiving, where you get to sit around with your family, and you may not be having real conversation, but you just feel good because you're around a bunch of people.",
        "And that's a big experience that I get, being a single person who works all day, and I don't want to go home to just my cat.",
        "So, I go to Barnes & Noble, and I just get a great cup of coffee and I sit down and I feel like I'm at home with a bunch of local strangers.",
        "And don't you find that somebody reading a book is a great conversation starter?",
        "I mean...",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, you always - there's always something to say about, you know, geez, you're just starting Asimov?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, I mean, you know, I find that I have probably the most deep and philosophical conversation that I've ever held outside of, you know, a classroom in Barnes & Noble with, you know, peers, people that are younger than me.",
        "It's great.",
        "I really, really enjoy going there.",
        "I meet so many different people, and I get so many perspectives from people's opinions and their insights about life in general, and you know, things that are going around in the world currently, issues and stuff about the economy.",
        "It's just nice to feel like you're connected in a part of - you know, this place in the world and - I don't know, in a computer.",
        "So, I find that I really like that interaction face-to-face with people rather than being online.",
        "Well, Johanna, thanks very much for the call."

        "Does that bother you?",
        "Well, I would certainly hope that he would do that when all the information is out and the indictments are done because there's no question that the Russians worked to interfere in our election.",
        "They were...",
        "And this is a 37-page indictment that does lay out a lot of facts and specific details.",
        "Do you have any insight into why President Trump has not come out and condemned?",
