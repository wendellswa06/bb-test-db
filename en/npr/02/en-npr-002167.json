        "But there's one small part of the game that seems to be particularly problematic: The part where you could play as the Taliban.",

        "A disturbing and thought-provoking look at the last day of Dylan Harris and Eric Klebold.",
        "So the idea was that this video game, regardless of it's content, the very form of a video game with the subject of Columbine, inherently trivialized the subject of the shooting.",
        "This double standard between movies and games stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the psychology of play, says Eric Zimmerman, co-author of The Rules of Play and a professor at NYU.",
        "The things that make a game a game are only experienced when you actually interact with it.",
        "Which is why there's such a big difference between looking over the shoulder of someone who's playing a game and actually playing the game yourself.",
        "Here's where the big misconception about play happens.",
        "It can actually be more intense to watch the game than to play it.",
        "While you're playing, you have to think about things like jumping and shooting and strategizing, so you're held just outside the fantasy world the game creates.",
        "When you play a game, you are always aware that you're playing."

        "That nip signifies a bite.",

        "So a nip signifies a bite, but it signifies the opposite of a bite at the same time.",
        "And that is what happens when you're playing a video game as well.",
        "It's easy to see when dogs are just play fighting, but when you watch someone else play a video game, it can be hard to understand that it's just a game.",

        "See how far apart we are?",
        "On the other hand, Beck says maybe including both sides is a sign that Mr. Obama is really serious about an immigration overhaul, since winning over Republicans is the only way it's going to happen.",
        "Immigrant advocates say the strong Latino vote for Mr. Obama last fall also makes it more important that he address the issue.",
        "Still, given that an overhaul twice failed in Congress in recent years, Beck says the safe bet is that the president won't press for much anytime soon.",
        "He's trying hard to be, I think, kind to this lobby, but they're asking him to sort of commit political suicide.",
