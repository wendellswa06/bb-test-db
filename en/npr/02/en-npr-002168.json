        "Joining me now to talk more about the fires in both California and Florida, and what might be in store for us in the weeks and months ahead, are my guests Johnny Keeley, adjunct professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles.",
        "He is also a research scientist with the U.S.",
        "Geological Survey Western Ecological Research Center at Sequoia National Park in Three Rivers, California.",
        "Also with us is Kevin Robertson.",
        "He's a fire ecology research scientist at the Tall Timbers Research Station in Tallahassee.",
        "Thank you, gentlemen, for being with us today.",
        "Good to be here.",
        "Thank you for the invitation, Ira.",
        "You are welcome.",
        "Kevin Robertson, can you give us an update on what's happening in Florida?",
        "Well, right now, the Bugaboo fire, which is the biggest fire, is - have a fire break all the way around the perimeter of the fire.",
        "So, they are hoping that, that would be contained soon.",
        "The only parts that aren't put out yet are the ones that are headed towards those fire lines and of course, there's a lot of peat and muck burning on the interior of that fire.",
        "And about the same thing is true on the Georgia side on the north side of the Okefenokee or the Sweat Farms in the big turnaround fires, which have breaks around them, but they're just trying to hold those breaks and keep it from getting outside that perimeter that they've built up.",
        "This is a fire that's in the swamp, is it not?",
        "We have not yet got to what is thought of the height of the fire season, which is usually June.",
        "We are getting pretty close there but again, June is usually the biggest month.",
        "It's usually not quite there yet.",
        "Senator, President Trump has also tweeted a couple of things that could be read as critical of the Russia probes that are underway, including the one that you're working on with the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
        "He tweeted over the weekend about, quote, \"\"all the committee hearings and investigations.\"\" And then he added - and excuse my language - but he added, quote, \"\"they are laughing their asses off in Moscow.",
        "Get smart, America.\"\" He seems to be suggesting the Russian probe should end.",
        "What's your response?",
        "Well, I would hope that's not so.",
        "I think the Russia probe should end when the - all the evidence is in and is done and we can wrap up and give a complete report 'cause this benefits the future of the country.",
        "Again, the intelligence services saw some of these things as far back as 2014.",
        "There wasn't a reaction from the previous administration.",
        "There wasn't an aggressive confrontation with the Russians on this behind the scenes and to say knock it off other than just a verbal statement.",
        "We need to learn from that and to be able to know, what do we need to do to protect our election security in the future?",
        "How can we confront this in the days ahead, and what lessons can be learned?",
        "That can only be done once we complete the report and get it all out there in the public."

        "And the sentencing today caps an extraordinary week.",

        "There was a giant standing ovation in the courtroom, a lot of embraces, a lot of crying, joy, shock, relief.",
        "I mean, it is still really sinking in for the women that I've talked to and for their families that after this living hell that they have been going through, they have finally confronted this man who abused them, and they have been heard and believed at last.",
        "And you mentioned that we heard from 150 women - more than 150 women.",
        "You know, we started this out last week thinking that we were going to hear from about 80 women.",
        "Wow.",

        "Can you tell us a little bit about how she ran her courtroom during this extremely long sentencing hearing?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, like you said, she cleared seven days of her docket and let each and every single one of these women and girls come forward on their own time and confront Larry Nassar.",
        "And she really responded personally to each and every single person who got up there, telling them how powerful they were.",

        "How did they respond to that piece of what happened today?",
        "So while Nassar is apologizing, it was pretty emotional.",
        "You heard women just break into these open sobbing.",
        "But then as soon as he finished, Judge Aquilina said, you know what?",
        "I don't believe you.",
        "I'm going to read a letter that you sent the court before this hearing about how you are totally innocent, you have been forced into this plea deal.",
