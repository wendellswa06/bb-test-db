        "Some Guantanamo detainees, he warned, may end up at the maximum security military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.",
        "Because you move the detainees to Fort Leavenworth, a place where we're not set to handle, it's going to cost hundreds of millions dollars.",
        "If you could even put a facility there that would be safe from terrorists, the people in the community are going to feel very threatened.",
        "This is in urban environment, an urban setting, and for what?",
        "Why are we doing this?",

        "Yes or no?",
        "Republicans need to get another set of talking points.",
        "That's Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.",
        "Asked by reporters about the GOP's Guantanamo offensive, Reid clearly sounded annoyed.",
        "They have marched down the Senate floor often and said that very same thing, we don't want these detainees walking the streets of America, or words to that effect.",
        "Well, nor does anyone else.",
        "Let President Obama execute his plan."

        "At this point, we have not made any determinations, any final decisions as to what is going to happen with regard to any of the 241…",
        "A supplemental spending bill passed by the House yesterday had none of the $80 million the Obama administration had requested for closing Guantanamo.",
        "The Senate does have the $50 million for Guantanamo in its supplemental bill up for debate next week.",
