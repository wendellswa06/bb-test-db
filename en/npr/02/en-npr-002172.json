        "Now President Bush has cited two legal bases for waging the war on terror.",
        "The first is his constitutional authority as commander in chief of the armed forces.",
        "Do you think that that authority is broad enough to include a secret domestic surveillance program?",
        "Well, certainly his commander in chief authority is the basis on which he defends us when military action is involved, and, of course, part of that defense will naturally involve collection of intelligence.",
        "And so that's the predicate on which such actions would be taken in a time of war.",
        "And the president has also pointed to a joint resolution passed by Congress in the days after the 9/11 attacks that allows him to, quote, \"\"use all necessary and appropriate force to fight terrorism\"\" and that has been reiterated by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales today, in fact.",
        "Does that seem like a solid legal ground for this program?",
        "Well, I think what we have here is the theoretical proposition that we are in a war--it's quite an unusual war, as I think everyone would observe--but that we have congressional agreement that going back to the 9/11 attacks, it was appropriate to take this type of military action invoking then the president's powers under Article 2.",
        "I think the question, however, that many would ask is: Just how long does this state of war continue, and are we continuing in the same state of emergency today as we were at the time of the 9/11 attacks?",
        "And in fact, the courts and the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act give the president broad powers in obtaining these warrants for domestic surveillance.",
        "So why would he have to not go to the courts, go circumvent the courts, to do this kind of operation?",
        "The argument is made by the administration that the court procedures were simply not adequate to support the action that needed to be taken with sufficient speed, and that's something that the oversight committees are in a position to review and consider.",
        "Presumably they understood this when they were first briefed but, for reasons known only to them, seem not to be clear about it presently.",
        "And where might this come in conflict, do you think, with the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures?",
        "If you've watched Animal Planet recently, you've probably seen a lot more of one species: people.",

        "Altmann said the golden portrait of her aunt and five other Klimt paintings hung in her aunt and Uncle Ferdinand's palatial home throughout her childhood.",
        "Her aunt, Adele, the subject of the portrait, was just 43 when she died in 1925.",
        "Thirteen years later, Ferdinand would flee Austria just weeks before the Anschluss, the union with Hitler's Germany.",
        "Everything was left behind and plundered by top Nazis, such as Hermann Goering.",

        "Her will asked that her husband, Ferdinand, donate the Klimts to the museum upon his death.",
        "The language of the will was framed as a request and was called not binding because Ferdinand had paid for the paintings.",

        "They weren't hers to give away even if she wanted to.",
        "And the Austrian museum knew that.",
        "What's more, Ferdinand, who died impoverished in Switzerland at the end of the war, made a will of his own, leaving all his property to his nephews and nieces.",
        "Maria was the only one still alive in 1998 when a series of investigative articles in the Austrian press revealed the paintings true ownership.",
        "In our 2004 interview, she furiously stated one additional and obvious fact.",
        "Adele would never have wanted her portrait given to the Austrian Galerie had she known the history that would unfold after her death in 1925.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "She had no idea.",
        "She would have never requested her husband even in a dream to leave these to the gallery after a number of her friends were murdered, committed suicide.",
        "I mean, it is totally incomprehensible that such a thing would have happened.",
        "Maria could not have won the battle to recover the paintings alone, though.",
        "Her legal spear carrier was a 32-year-old legal nobody named Randol Schoenberg, the grandson of Austrian composer Arnold Schoenberg, and a family friend.",
