        "Well, the Griffith Park Fire wasn't a particularly large fire, something on the order of about 800 acres.",
        "And how do you go about deciding what to replant once the life stuff is burnt?",
        "Well, that's actually a very contentious issue right now.",
        "The Griffith Park - just to give people a little background - it's one of the largest urban parks in the country.",
        "It's something over 4,000 acres in size, has a variety of values to it.",
        "It has a lot of recreations sites, zoos, museums and that sort of thing.",
        "But it also has a lot of the natural vegetation that used to cover the Los Angeles basin but now it's pretty much obliterated.",
        "Things like chaparral and walnut woodlands and communities that you just can't see anywhere else within the basin or very few places in the basin.",
        "And so there's some concern about how to manage the conditions after these fires.",
        "The people who are particularly concerned about the recreation value of this land are very concerned about mudslides and erosion, and that's not necessarily a given, but we have a good rainfall year this winter, we could have problems like that, and so there's concern about managing to prevent erosion on those sites.",
        "Oftentimes, the practices that are used to inhibit erosion, though, may have negative impacts on natural ecosystems.",
        "And so those citizens who are most concerned with the natural heritage of the park are concerned that managers don't - do the wrong type of treatment, and that might have negative impacts on the values that they mostly value.",
        "Do people want to just go out and reseed the park with, you know, new plants?",
        "Well, reseeding has been a practice that has been used in the state for probably 75 years or more.",
        "And so it's a natural response to reseed.",
        "There's a lot of concerns about seeding.",
        "One is that you often create more problems by seeding than you have initially.",
        "For example, one of the characteristics after fire in many parts of the Los Angeles basin now is that you get this growth of this exotic mustard all over the burned area.",
        "And this is basically a result of seeding practices from the 1930s and '40s when mustard was routinely spread across burned areas.",
        "And the seeds have just stayed there, and they come back after each fire.",
        "And so it's an example where the - somebody once told me it was an example of what they call Seboride(ph) effect, which apparently is after the newscaster Eric Seboride who apparently said, on a number of occasions, that most problems begin as solutions.",
        "And when it comes to seeding, a lot of people believe that.",

        "I mean the insurance companies are usually got their finger in the wind and know which way it's blowing, no pun intended.",
        "They have - aren't they telling their policyholders now, those living in wildfire areas, that if they don't clear the brush away from their homes, they're not going to be insured?",
        "Well, I can't speak for the insurance companies, what they're doing at this moment.",
        "For the last several decades, though, the insurance companies have been changing the conditions under which they will ensure people.",
        "And I used to live in Southern California, and I know my policy in one company was revoked because of the big fire in the area.",
        "So it's been an issue for many years.",

        "We had a big hurricane season just two years ago, but last year, it's kind of funny to say, unfortunately, we haven't had any hurricanes or hadn't had much tropical activity, which is part of the reason that we have such a bad drought this year.",

        "It takes a long time for the hydrology to bounce back.",
        "That's why this longer-term drying period has not really been corrected by big hurricanes like the ones that we had a couple of years ago.",

        "If we have a few years of extra precipitation or more than usual, then we'll start to make it up.",

        "For example, pinion pine in the southwest has experienced, in the last several years, massive dieback.",
        "And those pine woodlands are probably not going to recover for centuries - if they recover at all - depending on what the future climate holds.",
        "I think the answer to the question about whether we're seeing climate change is that the evidence is pretty clear that on average, we are seeing an increase in temperatures, and as temperature goes up, fire season usually becomes longer and oftentimes associated with bigger fires.",
        "But there's nothing about the data on climate change to suggest what will happen on any given individual year.",
        "We expect there will be wet years and dry years over the next century, even if there is an average increase in temperature.",
        "But should there be places where people should not live and should be discouraged, or told if you're in there and there's a fire and it goes in there, you're on your own?",
        "Well, I think there certainly are places where we're starting to see that may be the answer to catastrophic losses from fires that we've seen in recent years.",
        "For example in 2003, there were thousands of homes burned in Southern California, and people often attribute this to the size of the fire, but we have had massive fires in the past with a relatively no damage.",
        "For example, 1932 was the second largest fire on record, and not a single home was burned.",
        "Today we have urban sprawl that has moved people into watersheds of dangerous fuels, and so now, we are seeing the possibility that these fires are causing a lot of damage.",

        "They feel like they've got what they need to build those perimeters, but they are a little nervous looking into the next month without much prediction of rain in the near future, and pretty soon we'll have thunderstorms coming in off the coast at this time of the year, which is usually where the fire - fires get worse in June, which might bring some precipitation, but it also brings lightning, which probably means more wildfires, so we don't think we're out of the woods yet.",
