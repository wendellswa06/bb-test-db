        "And just a very special thanks to all of America for praying with us.",
        "Late Tuesday a signal was received from a climber's cell phone and the Hood River County Sheriff's Department expressed optimism that the climbers are still alive.",
        "But the weather's not cooperating.",
        "High winds, expected to reach over 100 miles per hour and more than a foot of snow are blocking the rescue effort, and officials don't know when they'll be able to reach the stranded men.",
        "Fran Sharp, is the president of the National Mountain Rescue Association, and she joins us by phone from her office in Washington State.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Thank you for having me on the show.",
        "We'd also like to hear from climbers and hikers.",
        "If you've been on a search and rescue team or if you've climbed in bad weather and been rescued, join the conversation.",
        "Our number here is 800-989-8255 or send us an e-mail to talk@npr.org.",
        "Fran Sharp, what is the most difficult thing about this search that's going on right now?",
        "Well, definitely Lynn, it seems like the weather is just hindering the efforts of the rescue teams to get even close to where they're at.",
        "From what I've heard they can't really even see their feet very well, because the visibility's so poor from the blowing snow.",
        "So that makes it very difficult to search.",
        "You know, nearly impossible to see much more than just your own footsteps.",
        "It's also a dangerous time for them to be on the mountain.",
        "High avalanche conditions, of course hypothermia is always a danger as well, even with experienced rescuers.",
        "So, yeah, Mother Nature's not helping us at all.",

        "I have, yes.",
        "And is it particularly difficult to climb?",
        "You know, it's a very popular mountain to climb.",
        "It's close to a large city, Portland, and not too far from Seattle, so there's a lot of folks who can go to this mountain.",
        "There are routes that are relatively easy to do.",
        "You can do with just basic experience.",
        "Then there's routes that are much harder, like on the north side where you need much technical expertise.",
        "Now, one of the climbers, Kelly James, managed to call his son and he told him that he was in a snow cave near the summit.",
        "Is that a good place to be?",
        "That is a good thing.",
        "Experienced mountaineers know that they have to get shelter and get out of those conditions.",
        "You know, the wind chill, the blowing snow, they need to get some shelter.",
        "And on a mountain where there's no trees, of course no housing or other shelter.",
        "You actually dig a snow cave, which is basically a hole in the snow that you stay in and it really offers very good protection.",
        "And can you stay warm there?",
        "Will you - you're in a snow cave - so, I mean, you still can get hypothermia I assume or…?",
        "You can because it's, you know, still in the 30s or, you know, it can be a little bit colder, but it gives much more protection than being exposed or even being in a tent.",
        "It's a lot of, you know, high altitude expeditions they will spend many, many days and sometimes even weeks in a snow cave.",
        "And it offers very good protection from the elements.",
        "We are talking about search and rescue missions.",
        "If you've ever been involved in one, either as the rescuer or as the person who was saved, give us a call.",
        "The number is 800-989-8255.",
        "Now, what are some of the things that rescue teams do to coordinate what's going on during a search?",
        "Well, there's always - it's called an incident commander.",
        "And they are typically like the Sheriff's Department in this case and they organize the search with all the different rescue teams.",
        "It's not just, you know, folks from rescue teams just showing up and heading off.",
        "It's a very organized search."

        "Well, the Fourth Amendment, as most of your listeners will understand--it really relates to domestic law enforcement activities.",
        "There is certainly a Fourth Amendment aspect to any information that might be collected in an intrusive way even though for national security purposes.",
        "And one of the problems that the current war on terrorism creates is the blending between law enforcement on the one side and more traditional foreign intelligence collection in support of military action on the other.",
        "The last time we heard a president being criticized for warrantless wiretaps was with Richard Nixon, and I'm wondering if you thought about the difference legally between Nixon's wiretaps and these ones that President Bush has authorized.",
        "At the time Nixon did his wiretaps, the reasons behind them seemed more to be about First Amendment rights of certain individuals who were criticizing his conduct of the war in Vietnam.",
        "Here we've heard nothing to suggest that anything other than a concern about protecting against further hostile actions in a network that, as we know, operates in the shadows and is very nimble and difficult to identify is the reason for the surveillance.",
        "That said, I think this president has a particular problem with regard to some of the actions that he's taken in prosecuting this war on terrorism that have been the subject of tremendous criticism.",
        "So I think that's another reason why Congress has a very serious responsibility here to review what was done and make sure that they're comfortable with the actions taken.",
        "The irony, of course, is that the two oversight committees presumably were doing this all along, and yet they've been notably silent in the discussion in the last several days.",
