        "There's a lot of search theory that goes on.",
        "Many people take classes and become experts in search where you look at terrain, how old the people are, what their skill level is, what the weather's doing, possible routes down, and you try to find - they call them an area with a high POS or POD, which is probability of success or probability of detection, and you try to get your teams to those areas first.",
        "And so all the teams will be reporting to basically one commander, and they'll be assigned different, you know, assignments through the whole search area, depending on where they think those climbers are.",
        "Now, something that's happening in this particular rescue mission and that is new to this whole kind of endeavor is the use of cell phones.",
        "I mean, the signal from this cell phone was tracked by the cell phone company.",
        "How does that work?",
        "How does that help the rescue efforts?",
        "Well, it's definitely becoming more of a help for us.",
        "It depends on the - from what I understand, the authorizing agencies like the sheriff's department, have to actually contact the phone companies and get that started.",
        "No one can just call the cell phone company and try to track a cell phone.",
        "That could lead to a lot of other problems.",
        "But it does - you can triangulate from different towers where the cell phone is actually - the transmissions going through those towers, and then they can triangulate and pinpoint fairly close to where the signal is coming from.",
        "So, yeah, cell phones, gosh, they're - people would not have known they were missing for a while without that original cell phone call on Sunday.",
        "So it can definitely initiate searches much earlier than not having one.",

        "I just wanted to comment that I was in the Grand Canyon in July and had sort of the opposite conditions: the heat wave, very humid.",
        "And while they offered to rescue me, they also made it clear that I would need to reimburse them.",
        "So I wonder, in the end, when people do these dangerous things, especially these expeditions that are planned, are they expected to pay for all the rescue costs?",
        "Well, actually, the Mountain Rescue Association has a very strong stance on charging for rescues.",
        "And in some of the national parks now, they are starting to have some rescue cost recovery fees.",
        "We don't like to see that.",

        "I was with an Austrian who didn't realize that as you go down instead of up, it gets hotter and more humid, and it was record temperatures - quite a few years ago.",

        "I am.",
        "I'm a climber.",
        "I summitted Hood a few years ago, and this is obviously extremely concerning, and my heart goes out to the families.",
        "But the comment that I wanted to make is that there are certain windows of time that expeditions are safer or more dangerous.",
        "There are certain months that Hood is a safer mountain to climb, and December is probably the apex of when it's not safe to climb because of the potential for weather.",
        "So I recognize that as the climbing community, we look out for one another; and I recognize that we don't want to set up ridiculous barriers with costly fee recovery.",
        "But by the same token, it seems to me that when people chose to climb into dangerous times of the year and potentially climb into weather, there's a heightened degree of responsibility for the circumstance you put yourself in and then, in the end, the circumstance that you put rescue teams in.",
        "I'd to take you comments off the air.",
        "Thanks for your call, Steve.",
        "That's an interesting point, Fran Sharp, that at times, people really are taking risks when they get into these situations, and…",
        "Well, definitely there are.",
        "And as Steve pointed out, there's, you know, there's safer times to climb, although things happen during those safe times, as well.",
        "And I'm sure that there're - you know, the folks on the mountain are looking at the responsibility that they chose.",
        "And although they are responsible for it, any of the mountain rescue teams can always say no, we don't feel like we should be doing this, it is too dangerous for our rescuers.",
        "And those decisions are made on a regular basis.",
        "As far as the cost for recoveries, 95 percent of the rescues - particularly for outdoor wilderness in the United States - are done by volunteer search and rescue.",
        "So there is no - it's kind of a myth because we see on TV many helicopters and lots of people on the mountain - large, large majority are volunteers.",
        "So there's no additional cost to the taxpayers.",
        "Many of the military helicopters and airplanes that are used are doing it as a training mission.",
        "So again, it's very good training for them because it's tougher conditions - more realistic than just, you know, doing a little flight around.",
        "So again, no extra cost there.",
        "So it's very - it's kind of a myth that these are very expensive operations.",
        "And congratulations on getting the break for Thanksgiving.",
        "I know that's probably just going to be great for you and your family.",
        "We do put ourselves at risk, and that absolutely is part of it.",
        "And that remains a personal decision for each person on the team, as well as the leaders of the team have to assess that constantly.",
        "But we train very - a lot.",
        "We're very experienced in this, so we try to minimize that risk, of course, and we carry a lot of gear.",
        "We're not going, you know, for a summit climb.",
        "We're going to rescue people.",
        "So we really take that into account.",

        "Well, what happened was that I lost all the radio in the airplane, radios, but all small airplanes are equipped with what's called an ELT, Emergency Locator Transmitter.",
        "And these are direct satellite hookup, which works on military reconnaissance, and they can track.",
        "As soon as this gets the - the radio is impacted, it sets off a signal, which sends the signal to a satellite.",
        "And what I wanted to comment was on that I think all climbers should be equipped with something in that kind of category, as far as technology.",
        "And they work incredibly well, I mean, with an accuracy of 100 or 200 yards.",
        "I mean, and if you're really searching for someone in a wilderness area - and I was about 14 miles into the wilderness.",
        "And what I found was that not only did I have an ELT, it had a voice transmit, which most of them don't have.",

        "I believe they have a resource you can use on Mount Hood for that.",
        "They're not perfect.",
        "In fact, I'm a fixed-wing pilot as well, and there is a high failure rate for ELTs.",
        "But PLBs are more reliable because you typically hit the switch and turn it on when you're in trouble.",
        "It's something that we're seeing a small amount of people use.",
        "The problem - I think, again, getting back to the myth of search and rescue - is that it's a very, very small amount of people we go after are climbers.",
        "Primarily - I believe it's in the high-90s - our missions are for hikers, for people who just want a day-walk in a park - you know, folks who drove off the road, those type of things.",
        "And so to really get bang for the buck, everyone would have to have a PLB.",
        "So, yes, it would definitely help for climbers.",
        "In this situation, we still would not be able to get to them.",
        "We would just know, you know, where they were on the mountain.",
        "The weather would still prohibit getting to them, probably.",
        "It's just - it can help, but it's not the cure-all, and certainly in search and rescue in general, you'd have to have everyone who goes outside using a PLB.",
