        "Yeah, that was my next question because the mythology says usually it's overweight people who are doing the snoring.",
        "Well, I think weight certainly plays a role in snoring.",
        "You're more apt to snore if you are overweight.",
        "If you snore, your snoring may get worse if you gain weight, but what's important to keep in mind is that many people who are very, very heroic snorers are not the least bit overweight and conversely, many people who are severely overweight do not snore.",
        "So, weight is a risk factor for, but certainly not the sole cause of snoring.",
        "Well, let's talk about the cause of snoring.",
        "Is there one cause inside your throat that causes you to snore?",
        "Well, there's one cause and that is increased resistance of air moving through the upper airway.",
        "There's not one location in the upper airway and that's why there are so many generally ineffective treatments that are available for snoring.",
        "It's actually (unintelligible) the more treatments that are available for a given medical condition, the least apt that anyone of them is to be effective.",
        "I mean, if there were one good effective treatment for snoring, we wouldn't be bombarded by ads for 30 or 40 different purportedly effective treatments.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Dr. Mahowald, when someone comes into your clinic with complaints of snoring, what do you do?",
        "Is there a set of tests that you conduct?",
        "Well, the first order of business is to make sure that the snoring is not one of the manifestations of obstructive sleep apnea because that's a completely different issue in terms of treatment and in terms of medical consequences."

        "So, the first order of business is, does the snorer likely have obstructive sleep apnea.",
        "If the answer's yes, then that individual does need a form of sleep study to identify the presence and/or severity of any underlying sleep and breathing problems.",
