        "In the first half of 2012, Americans downloaded nearly 760 million songs using the software known as BitTorrent.",
        "It's safe to say most of those downloads probably were not authorized, and most of them happened in cities and towns near universities, says study coauthor Marie-Alicia Chang.",
        "And when you looked at the top download charts, they were predominantly the big, kind of club hits.",

        "I still feel the same.",
        "Take Care\"\" was downloaded more than a million times using BitTorrent.",
        "The Musicmetric researchers focused on that technology because it's most often used for unauthorized file sharing.",
        "The study also found what might be seen as a little hope for the ailing music industry: Over the six-month period, there was a slight drop in unauthorized downloads in the U.S., Great Britain, Canada, Sweden, Norway and a few other countries where there are alternatives - free legal streaming services like Spotify and Pandora.",
        "Rich Bengloff is the president of the American Association of Independent Music.",
        "The research firm Musicmetric is a member of Bengloff's organization.",
        "He says providing alternatives is a no-brainer.",
        "Just making music available the way consumers want their music made available - in other words, serving them as opposed to saying, here's the way you can get it, and pricing it at a level that is attractive enough to them that they don't want to pirate the music.",
        "But there is some skepticism that the drop-off in unauthorized file sharing is related to the availability of legal services.",
        "Joshua Friedlander evaluates online music data for the Recording Industry Association of America.",
        "And he says the Musicmetric study didn't look at all of the other ways to get music for free.",
        "They were only looking at torrent traffic, and there are actually a number of other illegal sites out there that provide illegal access.",
        "So I'm not sure that that was a complete view of the market.",
        "Friedlander says the industry's tactic of closing down unauthorized sites has helped drive people to legal alternatives.",
        "He points to a study by another research firm, NPD Group, which looked at what happened after Limewire was shut down two years ago.",
        "There was an immediate increase in digital music sales, and that's actually been sustained, you know, more than a year out.",
        "So whenever one of these sites closes, we're definitely moving some people on to the many legal services that are now available.",
        "And there may be one other reason that unauthorized downloading has declined: people don't need to download anymore when they can just click on YouTube and hear their favorite song there for free anytime they want."

        "Kagame's concept was, if we can have a country that really worked - everybody speaks English; the Internet is super-fast; the airport is totally free of corruption - we can then lure to Rwanda all the companies, and economic interests, that are working in this entire region.",
        "Kagame brought in American agronomists to help boost Rwanda's low-quality coffee to super-premium grade.",

        "Now, looking at old medical journals from London in the 1840's, even back then, obviously, snoring has been a problem for a long time, but surgeons back then were trying to decrease, you know, the floppy palate in the patients that had a lot of heroic snoring and sleep apnea."

        "After that, there was a long amount of time where there wasn't much that was not much in terms of evolution, but in the 80's or so, in the U.S., a palatal procedure, a uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, or UPPP, became very popular in which part of the palate is cauterized and part of it is removed and the tonsils are removed and that is a very destructive procedure and it was created with the thought of curing snoring.",

        "Now, this is mainly talking about patients that have snoring.",
        "What we see in patients that snore is that the palate, when they're sleeping, about 80 or so percent of folks where snoring arises, is floppy, as if you would see if it were in a wind tunnel.",
        "And, what we're trying to move towards are clinic-based procedures that are less , and just as effective where we stiffen the palate and out of this idea was born procedures such as LAUP or laser assisted uvulopalatoplasty, CAPSO, cautery assisted palatal stiffening operation, the RFA treatments or radio frequency ablation where we actually put a probe into the soft tissues and deliver energy which creates scarring and most lately, injection snoreplasty where we actually inject a sclerosing agent of some sort into the palate for it to stiffen and mostly recently, the pillar implant system where small implants are actually placed into the palate, will stiffen it and thus decrease snoring.",
        "And are these painful?",

        "The earlier procedures such as a UPPP, if you--you were talking earlier about the dinner table discussion...",
        "Right.",
        "...I can guarantee you that, not only would, you know, snoring bring up a good discussion, but if anybody had undergone a UPPP, they will discuss their post-operative course--because these are very painful.",
        "You know the typical way to perform this procedure is with cautery units, basically a hot stick that burns the tissue and removes it.",
