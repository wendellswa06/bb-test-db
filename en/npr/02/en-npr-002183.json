        "With regard to the palate procedures, you know, one problem with snoring is that it can arise from multiple different levels of the upper airway and very rarely from the nasal passages.",
        "And that's why the nasal dilating strips tend to be ineffective because snoring is almost never coming from the nose per se.",
        "Mm hmmm.",
        "In many people it is coming from the soft palate in which case, one of the palatal procedures may be effective.",
        "But many people, snoring it's coming from the base of the tongue or even the layer of pharyngeal walls.",
        "So what people need to know is that if they're snoring is coming purely from the soft palate, then one of the palatal procedures may be effective.",
        "What we don't know is how, for how long these procedures are effective.",
        "And if we look at the uvulopalatopharyngoplasty procedure as an example, the short- term effectiveness for snoring, again this is not for sleep apnea, but for snoring it was very, very high: 75, 80 percent.",
        "However, after four years, 50 percent of the people are snoring again which tells us that for many people, snoring is a progressive condition.",
        "It gets worse over time and these procedures may buy some time in the progression of the underlying condition but many of the palatal procedures, we don't have any long term follow up data.",
        "And I think that if the extreme procedure like uvulopalatopharyngoplasty shows the decrement in effectiveness over time, I think it's likely to suspect the palate procedures may also; but again, we just don't know.",
        "You agree, Dr. Michaelson, that it's a temporary fix?",
        "Well, actually that's true and we actually in the ear, nose and throat literature we have, as well as sleep literature, there are some studies that have followed the UPPP patients out.",
        "When we start moving past the three to five, we're actually past the two- to three-year mark, we start to see the patients that had in moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea will often revert back to the same symptoms that they had before the surgery.",

        "Neither yielded for half an hour.",
        "However, the difference is, is now they don't have much of a palate, they don't have tonsils and what do you do with that patient?",
        "And that's an addition to the additional problems that that procedure can sometimes move those folks into when they try to have additional therapies, such as continuous positive airway pressure.",
        "But that is exactly why the majority of otolaryngologists are moving towards the newer therapies because the newer therapies are not designed to cure snoring.",
        "They are designed to control it."

        "1-800-989-8255; and when I rudely interrupted Dr. Michaelson, he was telling us about something that was I was so sorry to hear about it: that the surgical techniques you were saying, some of them don't work.",
        "And then you have to go on to the next stage that might be controlling if not curing the snoring.",
        "Well, exactly when these, some of these procedures came out, when the UP3 came out there was so much excitement because it was so effective for snoring.",
        "And initially, it helped a lot of the patients with apnea.",
        "But like I said, as we follow those patients out, a lot of them kind of wound up in the same boat that they were in when they came in for treatment initially.",
        "And the newer treatments that we have, now these are the treatments that I can offer as an ENT doc, such as the clinic based-procedures: the RFA, the palate and or tongue base, injection snoreplasty, the pillar system.",
        "These are designed to control snoring.",
        "They are designed to help stiffen the palate now and that's a whole other discussion: where exactly is the snoring coming from?",
        "This is based on the fact that we know about 80 percent of the folks that come in with simple snoring and that is snoring without apnea, the source, by and far, is the palate so that's why a lot of our procedures are aimed at treating the palate."

        "They're small implants that are basically with a special implant device are placed into the palate, into the soft tissue of the palate in front of the uvula.",
        "And they're submucosal so they're basically under the skin.",
        "And these implants, probably by a combination of the implant itself and the reaction to the implant in the soft tissues over time, will decrease the palatal flutter during sleep and decrease snoring.",
        "So it doesn't eliminate the snoring it controls the snoring, as you're saying.",
        "Well, it depends, first of all, on the patient and second of all it is probably one of the newest devices out on the market.",
        "We're still awaiting, we have some data on the pillar implant system, which is multi-year.",
        "We're actually anxious to see the data that brings it out further because there are obviously are all so some potential complications of all of these procedures.",
        "Such as if you place a foreign body into the palate, your body's natural reaction is to get rid of that foreign body.",
        "And well, it could be spit out--will you get an infection?",
        "Following these patients out long term is something that is data that I'm anxious to see.",

        "I'm particularly looking for long-term data from studies that are not sponsored by the pillar's manufacturer.",

        "I did study some other commercial snoring agent in the past and in working and using all of these methods in the clinic, they seem to be somewhat equally comparable in efficacy.",
        "And if the patient such as the injection snoreplasty or RFA gets treated, the thought is if they reoccur in two to three years they can come back in, get another treatment, go back to work that day and sort of like come in to get a booster shot for snoring.",
