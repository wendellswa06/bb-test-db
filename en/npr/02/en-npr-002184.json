        "And so as you move the lower jaw forward the base of the tongue is moved forward and for the people who snoring is not coming from the palate region, but rather is coming from the tongue region, this may be very effective.",
        "And in the hands of the dentists that we've worked with for the last 25 years with this their success rate ends snoring again, not apnea.",
        "I think everybody should know what we're talking about today is snoring and not apnea is about 75 or 80 percent.",

        "Well CPAP is an achievement for obstructive sleep apnea.",
        "It's spelled C-P-A-P and that stands for Continuous Positive Airway Pressure.",
        "It's simply a mask that typically goes over the nose and out the mouth and is attached to a blower that blows in room air and not oxygen just room air.",
        "And it serves as a simple mechanical splint to keep the upper airway open.",
        "And it is used for people that have obstructive sleep apnea and it's effective in virtually everybody.",
        "Now some people have trouble tolerating it, but it is very, very effective.",
        "It will eliminate snoring and obstructive sleep apnea because it eliminates or reduces resistance to the airflow going through the upper airway.",
        "I don't know what my colleague's experience is with this, but for snoring, I don't think, we have 15,000 people using CPAP from our sleep center who are using for apnea.",
        "I don't believe we have anyone who is using it solely for snoring.",
        "I think that the CPAP is cumbersome enough and uncomfortable enough that there has to be a bigger payoff to the patient.",
        "And usually the patients who have obstructive sleep apnea have severe excessive daytime sleepiness--which is almost immediately treated by using nasal CPAP.",
        "So they have a payoff and they feel much better the next day.",

        "And scientifically to figure out which ones to study didn't seem like the way to go either.",

        "And third were the head positioning pillows.",

        "So that basically each patient with their own control.",

        "Now of note, the sleep test that I used, was a home sleep test.",
        "It's called the snap test, and one of the, one of the benefits of using this particular type of polysonogram is it also utilizes, it studies the acoustics of the sounds of your snore when you sleep.",
        "So not only can it give us some, give us an idea of the presence of apnea, but it can also give us an idea based on the frequency and duration of your snore.",
        "Tell us possibly where the snore is coming from.",
        "Is it coming from palate?",
        "Is it coming from your tongue base?",
        "And we looked at all this data, and went through Stasta Medical Center(ph) and found that none of these devices worked period, none of them.",
        "And that was not only objective sleep data, but the subjective questionnaires with the patients asking the patients would you use this again?",
        "Spouses, would you have your spouse use this again?",

        "Now unfortunately, most of these devices already been utilized when you discover that they're not working.",
        "Now for some people they might but objectively we looked at it, and they did not.",
        "And what I envisioned doing and I hope will be done is further studies on the more available commercial products.",
        "But it's very disheartening.",

        "Sometimes they go straight to the drugstore.",
        "There's a sort of study we need.",

        "It was a very, very nicely done study, and what we need are objects of studies and not Oral Roberts testimonials.",
        "And despite the fact that this information is now in the medical literature, those devices are still widely purchased by people which underscores the fact that the story really is a big problem.",

        "And if you have a snoring problem and you don't know it, you might be having a sleep apnea problem and that can be dangerous right?",
        "Right.",
        "Why is that dangerous?",
        "Well sleep apnea is a kind of extreme form of snoring where the resistance becomes so great, that the airway actually closes.",
        "And the individual is trying to move air and is unable to.",
        "And then what terminates the breath holding spasm very brief arousal just enough to open the airway, not enough to actually, actually awaken the individual.",
        "That allows the patient, the individual to take a few deeper breaths, but as soon as they, he or she falls asleep again, this just happens repeatedly.",
        "And many people with sleep apnea stop breathing anywhere between 50 and 100 times an hour, completely unbeknownst to them.",
        "So this has two major consequences.",
        "One, it makes them too sleepy during the day, and that's because of the fragmentation of their sleep.",
        "So they will present with the complaint of falling asleep inappropriately during the day without apparent reason.",
        "Because again, they are completely unaware-- astonishingly unaware--of the fact that they've stopped breathing 50 or 100 times an hour.",
        "Some people have told me that they've been in a traffic light and just fall asleep.",
        "Well if you look at motor vehicle crashes, I mean falling asleep crashes, kill more young Americans under the age of 26 than alcohol related crashes.",
        "When you fall asleep in the midst of driving, it's a very serious problem.",
        "With people with apnea, and there have been studies on this, there's seven to eight times apt to have fall asleep crashes than people without apnea.",
        "So it's serious from a public safety standpoint.",
        "The other consequences related to fall in the blood oxygen level, which happens during the breath holding spell.",
        "And over many years, this very clearly could resolve in problems with high blood pressure, heart trouble and diabetes so.",
        "The socio economic consequences of sleepiness and the medical consequences of hypertension, diabetes and heart disease underscore the fact that obstruction sleep apnea is indeed a very serious condition.",
        "And it's so easy to treat.",
        "All you do is put nasal c-pap on you.",
        "You put, blow air in their nose that splits the airway open and completely eliminates the snoring and the apnea.",
        "But you have to get use to this device right?",
        "You do.",
        "And there is some getting use to it.",
        "But again, as I mentioned earlier, the majority of the people with sleep apnea have very unpleasant symptoms during the day namely severe daytime sleepiness.",
        "And just after a couple nights of wearing this, their sleepiness is virtually gone.",
        "I mean this completely eliminates sleep apnea.",

        "And then roll off your back onto your side and your stomach.",

        "and if they wanted to sleep on their back, they're going to sleep on their back even with the tennis balls there.",
        "Or the tennis balls are going to keep them awake and they're not going to be able to sleep at all.",
