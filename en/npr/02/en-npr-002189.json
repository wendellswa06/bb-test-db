        "This is hardly the worst thing that's happened in boxing.",

        "And that's where the dispute stemmed from last April when it looked like Erdogan's candidate would win the post of president and those elections were blocked.",

        "It's called for a cap and trade system with kind of a safety valve to prevent economic harm if the price of carbon credits rise too high.",
        "So you've got these two competing proposals going on right now.",
        "And then there's a third one from Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican of Nebraska, and he has support from Senator Mary Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, and George Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, that essentially would kind of codify the Bush administration's current voluntary emissions reporting program.",

        "And it's one that a lot of Democrats have supported actually, and indeed, it's very--you know, they said yesterday at a meeting with reporters that the Bingaman proposal is a fig leave and a joke, because it does--it's much less than what they would offer.",
        "And so they intend to follow through with theirs.",
        "But Bingaman's proposal--or the National Commission on Energy Policy proposal has been gaining a little bit of traction because Senator Pete Domenici, the Republican chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, also from New Mexico, has been meeting with Senator Bingaman and also the White House to address some way to address climate change.",
        "And Bingaman's focus has been on this National Commission on Energy Policy proposal, but it's unclear just what's going to happen.",
        "It seems that what appears to be happening right now is an effort to try to water it down a little bit so that it comports more with what the White House is trying to do in getting companies to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.",
