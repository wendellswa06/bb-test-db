        "Her proposal was a pretty aggressive plan that would require the president, by 2025, to reduce US oil demand by--it would effectively reduce oil demand and oil imports by about 40 percent.",
        "And the Republicans--Senator Domenici and many other Republicans and some Democrats got up and said, `This is a back-door attempt at trying to impose CAFE standards, because the only way we could ever comply with it would be to raise CAFE standards for automobiles by a hundred and eighty-five percent,' and so the--through the debate, they had a vote and it failed, not by a wide margin, but it did fail.",
        "Has the president said he might veto the bill for any other parts of it, that...",
        "Ms.",

        "The Senate, however, this year is addressing that issue through the budget process, because the problem is is that they could probably get enough votes to open up the Arctic to oil and gas drilling in the Senate, but not a veto-proof majority or a filibuster-proof majority--excuse me.",
        "They would need 60 votes, and they never quite get that many votes.",
        "So what they have done is that the Senate is addressing that through the budget reconciliation process that only requires that they get a min--the bare majority of 50, plus one.",
