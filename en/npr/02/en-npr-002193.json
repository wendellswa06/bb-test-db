        "Okay.",
        "I can explain in a nutshell.",
        "What happened was I enlisted in the Army for a few reasons.",
        "I mean, one was kind of the Jerry Maguire, show me the money, but also another part of it was that I wanted to be a part of an organization that has some more meaning involved rather than just the ordinary give and take of commerce.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so I enlisted.",
        "And I knew that, based on U.S.",
        "history, every four or five years we're involved somewhere.",
        "It may not necessarily be in a war, but it can be some sort of action, such as Grenada.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And given that I was enlisting in the Airborne Infantry, I had no illusions that I wouldn't be deploying somewhere at some point during my enlistment.",
        "The issue that I had really started to come about a month into basic training.",
        "I joined not with any sort of real bloodlust, but figuring, you know, if I'm in the situation, I can do what I have to do.",
        "And we, so I went to basic training, and it's kind of like it, right now, it's a tamed-out version of what you see in Full Metal Jacket.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It's not as hard as it used to be, and it's mainly just playing a game.",
        "But about a month into it, I was marching to the chow hall with my company, and we were repeating the chant over and over, which was trained to kill, kill we will, and our drill sergeant thought our rendition of it wasn't enthusiastic enough, and they threatened us with some extra physical activity.",
        "And what happened was I looked all around me, and all my fellow soldiers were getting red in the face, their voices were going hoarse, and their heads were bobbing up and down, you know, and trained to kill, kill we will, trained to kill, kill we will, and that's just one example of the process of becoming desensitized to what it is you have to do as a soldier.",
        "Mm-hmm, yeah."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...is that we exceed the standard, and it continued.",
        "And what my issue was is that in order to kill, you can't look at the person you're killing as a person.",
        "You have to objectify them and dehumanize them, and you gotta find some way to do that.",
        "I mean, there's a variety of ways, whether it be...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...racial or religious, or you name it, but you have to find a way to objectify them.",
        "And so, yeah, that's fine for the enemy, I guess, but you also have to objectify your coworkers, and I became cognizant of this, because every time we would go on a training jump, when 100 people jump out of an airplane, statistically, maybe, you know, two or three are gonna break something.",
        "Right.",
        "And the person who breaks something, they could've been all laid up as a soldier, you know, and, like, had no hope, or they could've been fast-tracked into sergeant, but it didn't matter.",
        "They no longer served a function, and they wouldn't be, you know, going out with the boys drinking on Friday night.",

        "So, you know, personally, am I in, you know, is it my right to judge someone who actually had to face a war where they personally felt that it's something they weren't ready for?",
        "Some people do make that decision and later on feel like, uh, you know, it's just not for them.",
        "But, I guess, my final comment would be that, you, if you make that decision, you kind of have to, you know that it's something that you're deciding for a four-year period, an eight-year period, you have to stick with that decision.",
        "So, before someone joins, think very hard about what you're doing.",

        "You knew what you were getting in for.",
        "Well, I think what he's getting at is that there's a sense of honor involved, and you have to live with the consequences of your decision.",
        "I agree."
