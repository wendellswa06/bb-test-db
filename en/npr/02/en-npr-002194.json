        "And they said well, Hinzman, you still have the inherent right to self-defense.",
        "And if we were to be attacked, you have the obligation to defend us.",

        "He's not a typical deserter by any means.",
        "The most serious studies done on deserters in the American Army, starting in World War II through the Vietnam War, show that about five percent of deserters are truly involved in some way with conscientious objection.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Problems with the command structure, all things are the big reason.",
        "It's also important to note that about half of all deserters, which is usually defined as 30-days absence without leave, beyond 30 days, about half of them come back under their own volition, back into the military.",
        "But in Jeremy Hinzman's case, what's interesting here is that, according to American law, to be a conscientious objector, you have to be against all wars, not just a specific war.",
        "And that makes it, you know, much more complex.",
        "You know, it's important, by the way, you might remember that the name of the most famous soldier in World War I, Sergeant York.",
        "You know, originally, a Mennonite, started out as a conscientious objector before he became the famous hero, you know, of that war.",

        "During World War II, we locked up Jehovah Witnesses in our jails.",
        "By the way, these Jehovah Witnesses were killed in Germany and in Stalin's Russia, too.",
        "So, those are the true, I say, conscientious objectors who are willing to suffer.",
        "Now, the issue of desertion as a phenomenon, as you mentioned earlier, Neal...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...the rate of desertion in the Iraq war so far is a fraction of what it was during the Vietnam War in terms of proportions.",
        "It's about eight to nine times greater desertion rate towards the end of the Vietnam War than what we are currently experiencing.",
