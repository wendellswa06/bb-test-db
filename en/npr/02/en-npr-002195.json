        "And that's the other important finding.",
        "Draftees in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam had a lower desertion rate than did volunteers, which is completely counter-intuitive.",
        "I, by the way, I speak as a former draftee.",
        "The reason that the, for this lower attrition rate and lower desertion rate of the draftee was several reasons, but the main one was that they usually came from better socioeconomic backgrounds, were more mature, and therefore, and also had a shorter term of service, in many cases.",
        "So, if you really want to get desertion down, maybe one way to do it is bring back the draftee, which is not on the political horizon.",
        "But that's a very interesting thing.",
        "In World War II, by the way, soldiers with college education had a desertion rate only one-fifth that of the rate of soldiers who only had a grade school education, and that finding has been pretty consistent over the decades.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",

        "Very well, thanks.",
        "My comments are about going AWOL in perspective of my career as soldier and as a civilian personnel specialist.",
        "Now, I had a troop while I was stationed over in Germany who went AWOL just to stay with his girlfriend, and the military did pursue him.",
        "We, the Germ Politzi(ph) at the time, did capture him, or should say, capture is the probably the wrong word, but did apprehend him and brought him back to us.",
        "He tried escaping twice more by climbing the fence, but he was tried in the military court, and, you know, a dishonorable discharge.",
        "But the most interesting case I ever had to deal with AWOL was while I was stationed with Miami, in Miami, a civilian came up to me and said I'd like to turn myself in.",
        "I've been AWOL for six years.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And he was living in Miami.",
        "And that was extremely unusual.",
        "I had a chance to talk to him for over an hour waiting for military police to come and take him to Fort Bragg.",
        "But his case was he went home on leave and disappeared.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And stayed as the term is, on the lam for six years, and then he decided that it wasn't worth it anymore, trying to hide.",
        "And he turned himself in and was tried and discharged immediately, and came back and actually said thank you for being nice."

        "Huh.",
        "Charlie Moskos, those sound, at least from your description, like more typical deserters.",
        "Yeah, those are the more typical ones.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "I said over half of deserters, as defined, actually returned back to the military under their own volition.",
        "As David did point out here, you do get an interesting question here.",
        "The cases that get the more attention are the deserters who've done it for moral reasons, whether it's religious or political or philosophical.",
        "And that counters the more standard definition of the deserter, which is somebody who's left his comrades, who are moral cowards, not brave people.",
        "And somewhere between those two dichotomies, two opposing viewpoints, you probably are going to get closer to the truth.",
        "But the fact of the matter is that a great majority of deserters are not doing it for conscientious reasons, but are doing it for, you know, personal problems.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And that's what I thought of the gentleman that turned himself in in Miami.",
        "It wasn't during a time of war.",
        "This was after Grenada.",
        "This was before Panama, so there was no conflict.",
        "There was no moral justification at the time.",
        "He just was fed up with the lifestyle of being a soldier.",
        "And it's common, we find it, but some people actually swallow it down and just do their time and then get out.",
        "But those that have the intestinal fortitude to stand up and say I can't take this anymore, we classify them as losers, and they're not.",
        "David, thanks very much for the call, we appreciate it.",
        "Have a good night.",

        "Yes, I would definitely have more empathy for the gentleman you interviewed a few moments ago if it were not a volunteer army.",
        "But as a mother of two sons who are in the Army, both of whom have participated in tours in Iraq, and one of whom is there now, I wonder if anyone considers the effect that people who volunteer for positions, and then when they don't like what is happening, to decide to leave, about the effect that has on the unit.",
        "I mean, they automatically don't just get someone else to plug that hole.",
        "What they have to do is go shorthanded.",
        "Go without trained personnel.",
        "Which, in turn, affects the ability of the entire unit, and puts them in greater jeopardy than if they were going full strength.",
        "And as a mom of soldiers, this is particularly upsetting to me.",
        "As if this young man's feelings for home and family and so on were more important than those feelings of my son's.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Charlie Moskos, there's no question that desertion certainly leaves a hole in the unit.",
        "It certainly does.",
        "But it's also important to note, and I certainly empathize with Nancy's views, that virtually all of desertion occurs, you know, before the deployment.",
        "You don't desert in Iraq.",
        "You don't desert, you know, in Vietnam and places of (unintelligible), because those are hostile areas.",
        "So, it isn't quite as traumatic, because usually these things can be filled, and there's always a lot of turnover even normally in any kind of a unit.",
        "But the issue is, I would think, that the great majority of these deserters probably were never bonded, you know, with their comrades.",
        "It's a failure of leadership in some respects, isn't it?",
        "Well, it's also a failure of followership.",
        "We always talk about leadership, but don't forget, as one officer told me, there are some soldiers the 12 Apostles couldn't lead.",
        "So you get this kind of situation.",
        "I think if you had more privileged youth serving, I think you would find desertion lower, because people say if the top of the social ladder's serving, than I ought to serve, too.",
        "For example, it's interesting to note that all of the Kennedy brothers served.",
        "And none of the Kennedy cousins did.",
        "And that's the change, I think, without a draft.",
        "A draft, not like the Vietnam era draft, but a draft that starts at the top of the social ladder.",

        "How's she doing?",
        "You know, she has PTSD, she suffered from severe sexual harassment daily in Iraq, and the thought of going back for any amount of time just sent her over the edge.",
        "Charlie Moskos, is there any evidence that people going back for second or third tours in Iraq are more likely to desert than others?",
        "We don't have the data on that yet, but common sense would seem to imply that.",
        "But again, if the issue's largely personal and familial reasons that probably won't be as big of a factor as we think.",
        "One thing that has not yet been mentioned, unlike Vietnam, today we have a huge known percentage of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan are Reservists, or National Guards members, and that is another kind of condition that we haven't looked at.",

        "President Ford in 1974 made an interesting kind of decision.",
        "By the way, the deserters were largely pardoned by, you know, Clinton subsequently in the late '70s.",
        "But President Ford said he would give clemency to any deserter who came back in return for doing a sum of a stint of civilian service.",
        "And I think that would be a very good idea to sort of reintroduce here for deserters.",
        "Yes, we'll give you clemency, you know, shame on you, point the finger and all of that, but at the same time, here you are a full citizen again, but you have to do some civilian service instead of the military service you deserted from.",
