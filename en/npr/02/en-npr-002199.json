        "If the Democrats gain four seats in the Senate and Hillary Clinton gets elected president, making Tim Kaine the vice president and the Senate tiebreaker, then the Democrats gain control of the Senate.",
        "That's the presidency plus four Senate seats.",
        "Hillary Clinton was in North Carolina this week talking up the Senate race.",
        "That's where incumbent Richard Burr, the Republican, is in a surprisingly close race against Democrat Deborah Ross.",

        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "You know, she will be an independent voice for the working families of this state, and she will help break through the gridlock in Washington.",
        "An interesting race in North Carolina.",
        "David Brooks, first you.",
        "Do you think the Senate is likely to change - change hands?",
        "And what's an interesting race you're looking at?",
        "Yeah, I think it - I think it is likely to change hands.",
        "There are six states where they're sort of toss-up races - Indiana, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina, Missouri and New Hampshire.",
        "And the Democrats have a slight lead - very slight lead, but a slight lead in five of those six.",
        "North Carolina is the only one where the Republicans have a slight lead.",
        "And they only need to take three of those six, so you'd have to think the odds benefit them.",
        "E.J.?",
        "Right, and I think the Senate races in the last couple of weeks - we'll see what happens in the last 11 days - but the last couple of weeks have tilted the Democrats' way as a reaction has set in against Trump since that \"\"Access Hollywood\"\" video came out.",
        "What's fascinating is - David listed the targets right - North Carolina's very interesting because that's a state where there's a backlash against the Republican Governor McCrory for a whole lot of different things."

        "Well, to be clear, very often when people talk about evangelical voters in a political context and especially in the context of Republicanism, people are talking about white evangelicals.",
        "White evangelicals a majority of the time tend to vote Republican, whereas black evangelicals and black Protestants as a whole, for example - they tend to vote overwhelmingly Democratic.",
        "So in these political discussions, the word evangelical has become a shorthand for white evangelical.",
        "So as to how many there are, it depends on how you measure it.",

        "When you measure it that way, you get about 35 percent of the adult population that says yes.",
        "However, there are other ways to measure it.",
        "You can measure it by belief system.",
        "You can measure it by denomination.",
