        "Janice Hurley manages a Vermont inn and speaks to industry groups.",
        "What was really interesting for me was to watch the reaction in the industry as a whole.",

        "In Vermont, B&B owners can be a tradition-bound bunch, and for good reason.",
        "Their inns are often 19th-century farmhouses.",
        "Recently, Hurley told a gathering of the state's innkeepers that their future depends on attracting new and younger guests who have 21st-century tastes and demands.",
        "What we're going to talk about is who are the Gen X and the Gen Y traveler, and how can we avoid being left behind.",
        "Hurley says a good website is key to marketing to customers who do everything online, and it can dispel stereotypes about B&Bs.",
        "But first, owners should make sure their inns don't fit those stereotypes.",
        "Judging by a show of hands, private bathrooms are the norm these days at Vermont inns, but there's more to be done: more power outlets, less wallpaper and new color schemes are all part of appealing to younger guests.",

        "Hurley says it's not necessary to remake every room, and the changes should be consistent with the character of a place."

        "A lot of our younger Gen X, Gen Y clientele are living in smaller apartments in cities.",

        "Yeah, I totally do.",
        "I think you see that in terms of the whole notion of Barack Obama being foreign; the idea that someone even named Barack Obama would not just represent the country, but that he would actually be our commander-in-chief.",
        "This is a different sort of power wielded by an African-American.",
        "Now, there's a lot of questions that your thesis raises, and maybe this is the first one: when you suggest that when President Obama speaks up on something, and a lot of people say that they're then against it, that there's something to do with race there.",
        "Isn't it actually just a partisan moment?",
        "The president says he's going to take this position, and so Republicans take the opposite position.",

        "What was not said was that health care was reparations - Glenn Beck going on TV and saying that the president is a racist guy with a white mother; somehow, has something against the - quote-unquote, as Glenn Beck put it - \"\"the white culture,\"\" against white people.",

        "I think what Obama actually did that really pissed people off, was a recognition of history; the notion that - not just that he brought up race, but that race somehow was part of why Trayvon Martin ended up dead.",
