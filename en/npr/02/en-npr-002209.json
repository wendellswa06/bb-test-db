        "That's a good question.",
        "I know that a lot of them are frustrated because of being out of work, you know.",
        "But since then, Ciardelli says, his members have rallied to the president's cause.",

        "The union representing state and government workers lost 50,000 members as a result of widespread layoffs.",
        "But the union has already managed to spend one-and-a-half-million dollars on political ads targeting Republican presidential hopefuls, and Secretary Treasurer Lee Saunders says his members as are mobilized for the November race as they've been in a long, long time.",

        "Perls studies centenarians -people who live to be 100 or more.",
        "He's not a geneticist, but he's convinced that genes play an important role in how long someone will live.",

        "Maybe we haven't solved it completely.",
        "Sebastiani developed a computer model that used 150 genetic markers -specific bits of DNA scattered around the 23 pairs of human chromosomes - to predict who would be able to join the centenarian club.",
        "And the accuracy of this model is 77 percent."

        "And the fundamental definition of progress that President Obama made last fall in making this decision was that by committing more troops and staying for a longer period of time, the U.S.",

        "But according to a Gallup poll released, yesterday I believe, a pretty significant majority of the American public is sympathetic to that very tough law passed in Arizona.",
        "And I read that not as detailed knowledge of the law itself, but rather a sense of how difficult this issue is, especially in a time of economic turndown.",
        "And the reason why this is as hard an issue as health care reform is that the American public sort of wants contradictory things or economy is based on the presence of a large, sort of quasi-legal or illegal population, and yet that has social and legal and other ramifications that a lot of people don't like."
