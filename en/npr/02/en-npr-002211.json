        "Hmm.",
        "When you would knock on some of the doors of the white families, what was their reaction to learning not only their connection to the first lady, but their connection to slavery?",
        "People had mixed emotions, as you might imagine.",
        "On the one hand, there's this, wow, really?",
        "I might be related to the first lady?",
        "I mean, that's pretty amazing.",
        "And then there is this knowledge that this connection dated back to such a painful period of our history.",
        "And you can imagine what it might be like if someone were to knock on your door and say, hi, I think your family owned the first lady's family.",
        "Whoa.",
        "And many of these people had no idea that they had ancestors who owned slaves.",
        "The white Shields were not wealthy people.",
        "And so, these descendants - some of them had no idea.",
        "In fact, they said things like, well, I always thought the Shields never had two nickels to rub together.",
        "And, in fact, they're right.",
        "The Shields were not wealthy people.",
        "They inherited the slaves.",
        "You write about how Michelle Obama's maternal grandfather, Pernell Shields, would pass along all of these things to his grandchildren about his love of music and barbecue and his spirit.",
        "But you say that the one thing he did not pass down was the story of his white ancestry.",
        "Why did he keep that a secret?",
        "This kind of silence went across many generations.",
        "There were so many people I spoke to who said - when I asked about slavery or when I try to find out more about our mixed ancestry, people simply didn't want to talk about it, a sense of wanting to distance oneself from a period that was really painful and really difficult and, in some ways, to raise children that were unburdened by that period.",
        "And in some ways, that was probably a gift.",
        "But it made it much harder to find out really what happened in the past.",
        "Rachel Swarns is the author of the new book \"\"American Tapestry: The Story of the Black, White and Multiracial Ancestors of Michelle Obama.\"\" Rachel, thank you so much for joining us.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",

        "This week, Sudanese government planes have been bombing towns in the new republic of South Sudan after South Sudanese troops captured a contested oil hub.",
        "The fighting comes less than a year after the south declared its independence and peacefully broke with the government in Khartoum.",
        "The problem is independence requires a border and what now passes for a border runs right through some of Sudan's richest oil fields.",
        "I'm joined by Jonathan Temin.",

        "She spoke of the civilization she uncovered after finding elaborate pottery, house foundations and signs of extensive agriculture.",
        "Many others later followed deep into the jungle, including Augusto Oyuela, the University of Florida archaeologist.",
        "(Soundbite of hacking forest with machete)",
        "What you have here is a high content of charcoal, phosphorus and calcium.",
        "The main difference is in the weight.",
        "I really strived hard to make it a lightweight motorcycle, and I have a lot of experience in aerospace and in the bicycle industry.",
        "So I made a frame that's about 18 pounds.",
        "It's really, really light, thin wall, aircraft aluminum frame.",
        "But it also uses a very small battery pack, you know, comparatively.",
        "Like most electric cars actually have a very big battery pack and actually weight more than their gas counterparts, and our electric motorcycle actually weighs about two-thirds the amount of a gas motorcycle.",
        "And so it's very, very snappy, very quick performance, very easy to maneuver and really very safe because 85 percent of injuries are when the motorcycle falls over and falls over on your leg.",
        "We hardly ever have those fall-over problems because they're just not very heavy."

        "Wow, makes absolutely no sound.",
        "And there's none of that vibration that you have.",
