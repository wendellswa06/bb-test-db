        "What's happening is we were starting to see some of that kind of technology integrate into home systems and not just new homes, also existing homes.",
        "Omar, I imagine it varies from product to product, but give us a sense of how much all this costs?",
        "Well, traditionally, you're talking about tens of thousands of dollars even in a medium-sized home.",

        "For instance, there's a company called Savant Systems that actually uses the Apple OS and uses Mac hardware for flat panels in the homes.",

        "You're using the iPhone or the iPod Touch as the remote control instead of $1,000 remote control.",
        "So, this stuff is coming down in price and you're talking about from tens of thousand of dollars to maybe, you know, $5,000.",
        "The Savant Systems has a system called Protege that's meant to be kind of a starter kit for about $5,000 for a medium home, but that's kind of where it starts.",
        "Hopefully in the next five, ten years, we'll see this stuff go from thousands or tens of thousand of dollars to hundreds of dollars.",

        "With real estate agents I think the same thing is likely to happen.",
        "If you think about what real estate agents do for their clients, the biggest service, historically, they provided is hooking up a seller of a home with buyers through what's called a multiple listing service.",
        "But now, with the Internet, there are all sorts of alternative ways to get your property out into the hands of buyers.",
        "And in particular there are now flat-fee brokers who are willing, for just a small amount of money, $300 to $400, to list your house for you on the multiple listing services.",
        "So I think real estate as we know it is in the process of completely changing.",
        "In the face of this sort of competition from the Internet or from innovative ways of offering these services for less, might not real estate brokers lower their fees?",
        "What I think is inevitable over time is that there's going to be a much more direct tie between the hours that a real estate agent works on your property and how much you pay them.",
        "You know, when you go to the dentist, it depends how long you spend in the dentist's chair, how much you pay them.",
        "To think that we would just pay six percent of the value of our home when really an agent provides the same services if the home sells for $200,000 or $2 million is, I think, an archaic incentive structure, which under the burden of the new ways of transferring information through the Internet, is going to buckle.",
        "You give an example of a couple, actually, who have a company where they not only list your house, but they will also offer other services that are priced for the individual service.",
        "And it still adds up to some fraction of what a broker's fee would be.",
        "That's correct.",
        "If you take a house that sells for $500,000 today at a six-percent commission, that's a $30,000 payment to real estate agents.",
        "Now, if you start breaking down the services that agents actually provide and how many hours they spend per house, it comes out to be an outrageous fee per hour.",
        "So it takes maybe, I would estimate, 40 hours for a real estate agent to sell your house.",
        "So, on an hourly basis, they're making an absurd amount of money.",

        "Well, it's because of course there were twice as many real estate agents in Boston as there were in Minneapolis.",
        "And there were twice as man real estate agents precisely because when there's a lot more money to be made selling real estate, every Tom, Dick and Harry rushes in to get their real estate license to go and start selling homes.",
