        "So we're in the middle of what's supposed to be a ceasefire, but these men here have been skirmishing with a tank all morning.",
        "They had a big battle lasting two or three days this week.",
        "They believe they have pushed back the government forces about 100 meters.",
        "Well, this past Wednesday, Paul Wood was hiding inside an orchard along the Syria-Lebanon border, an area used by smugglers and gunrunners.",
        "He was trying to sneak back into Lebanon.",
        "He eventually did make it, and that's where we reached him.",
        "It was the most difficult crossing of the four I've done.",
        "There are supposedly more than 1,000 troops on the little bit of border that we tried to cross, including nine tanks.",
        "We sort of hid out in a part of the orchard looking at an army patrol and a checkpoint, which was only about 100 meters away, waiting for them to direct their attention elsewhere and then sort of making a run for it.",
        "We were really quite close to them, so that's an indication of the kind of pressure the Free Army is under.",
        "Other crossings we made haven't been so problematic.",
        "But I think the army is trying to get a grip on the border, trying to get a grip on the Free Army's supply lines and having some success at doing that.",
        "Paul, you've been covering this now for more than a year, and you've been going in and out.",
        "Do you think the Assad regime will be in power a year from now?",
        "In January, I got suddenly swept up in the opposition's very optimistic estimates of President Assad only having weeks to go in power, possibly, you know, a few months.",
        "The crushing of the Free Army in Baba Amr, where they made a stand in Homs, I think that really reversed the situation.",
        "This regime does look rather strong there, and it would be foolish to think that President Assad has no support.",
        "He is there still because he does have support.",
        "My own suspicion is that the window for solving this peacefully and through reform closed a long, long time ago, and this is - we're now on kind of a one-way street, at the end of which is a very vicious sectarian war, the first hints of which we are seeing in Homs Province and places like Houla.",

        "What are your thoughts on that?",
        "Well, in fact, the Western power is already intervening through a political solution, through the Annan mission, and also through the military option by the rumors that we have about weapons being sent to the Syrian opposition movements, the militia groups in Syria.",

        "This is a regime that is not willing to compromise.",
        "Now, the Syrian opposition has called very explicitly time and time again for foreign military intervention.",

        "And this is where a full-fledged civil war might erupt.",
        "But there will be other international sanctions which could be taken on regime officials in terms of freezing their assets, issuing travel bans, increasing the pressure, and I would say maybe working on Russia.",
        "And in that sense, if there's an international effort, which is happening now, that would bring, somehow, a political solution.",
