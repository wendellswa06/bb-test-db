        "What had Roosevelt accomplished at this point in his first term?",
        "I think he had stabilized the system, which was in meltdown when he took office.",
        "So Roosevelt became president at the bottom of the Great Depression, and he didn't end the Depression in his first year, but he eased it considerably.",
        "Obama was in a different situation where, when he took office, the challenge was to prevent us from falling into a depression, and I think he's also accomplished that, but that gets less credit than actually bringing the economy, you know, some of the way back.",

        "They felt, almost immediately after Roosevelt had saved their fortunes, that somehow, he was wrecking the country, and of course, you hear that now on the part of conservatives about President Obama after he, in many cases, saved their fortunes.",
        "Give us a sense of the context.",
        "I mean, there was a real fear among Roosevelt's critics, as there is among Obama's critics, that he was pushing policies that would eventually take this country down the road of socialism, or fascism to some.",
        "What were they saying about Roosevelt at the time?",
        "Both the word socialist, even communist and fascist were thrown at him.",
        "But it's also important to remember that a lot of people wanted a dictator at the time.",
        "People weren't sure that democracy and capitalism were going to survive.",
        "So there were quite a number of Americans who wanted a strong hand.",
        "Studebaker had a car called the Dictator that sold pretty well in 1933.",
        "The comparisons that are made between Obama and Roosevelt aren't necessarily comparisons between the ability of the two men or the potential of Mr. Obama's presidency versus Roosevelt's, but more about the circumstances in which they found themselves at the beginning of their presidencies, with a massive economic crisis.",
        "Roosevelt had an advantage over Obama in a sense because he didn't have to deal with any major foreign policy issues at the time.",
        "Oklahoma passed a similar bill last year, which is being challenged in court.",
