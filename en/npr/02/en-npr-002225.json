        "We're governed essentially by their legislative delegations.",
        "And to change any law, even to pay a probate judge or to establish a bingo game, you have to amend the 1901 constitution."

        "People who had lots of property didn't want to pay property taxes.",
        "And the best way to make sure they didn't pay property taxes was to make sure that no African-American voted, because African-Americans didn't own a lot of property and therefore, were anxious to tax it in order to provide decent public schools, not only for their own children but for white children as well.",
        "So the core of the issue is, basically, the way in which white property owners were trying to protect their property, and the best way to do that was to disenfranchise blacks.",

        "That's absolutely right.",
        "The result of the way in which the tax structure was developed out of the 1901 constitution is that the tax rate was shifted from property to, first, personal income taxes and corporate income taxes and then finally, and most dramatically, to sales taxes during the 1930s, so that a poor person in Alabama pays about 11 percent of his or her income on state and local taxes and a wealthy person pays about 3 percent.",
