        "Rutledge contends illegal immigration is spawning a culture of lawlessness.",
        "After breaking one law to get into this country, Rutledge argues that it's not much of a stretch for immigrants to drive without a license or ignore other laws.",

        "But in the last couple of months, illegal immigrants have either been leaving Tulsa or laying low.",
        "In this way, Rutledge says the new measure has already been a success.",
