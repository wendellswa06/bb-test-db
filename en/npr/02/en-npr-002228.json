        "Nicola and Chad Johns of Roseville, California, believe the nation's product recall system is broken.",

        "In April of 2005, they put their 9-month-old baby boy, Liam, to bed in a crib.",

        "So his chin was resting on the mattress and the rest of his body was hanging straight down.",
        "The crib was made in China by Pennsylvania-based Simplicity Inc., also marketed as Graco.",
        "Like many cribs, it had one side that could drop down to make it easier to reach the baby.",
        "In this crib, that drop side came loose, allowing Liam's neck to get wedged between the side and the mattress.",
        "When I pulled him out of the crib, he was not breathing.",
        "And we gave him CPR until the paramedics came.",
        "And he was pronounced dead at the hospital.",
        "He was 9 months old.",
        "Liam's death prompted Nicola and Chad Johns to file suit against Simplicity Inc. They argued that a design flaw and unclear assembly instructions created the deadly hazard.",
        "Their lawyer, Charles Kelly, alerted the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the CPSC, of the danger.",
        "I alerted the CPSC in June of 2005, two months after Liam's death, and it wasn't until over two years later that they sent a field investigator to come and look at the crib and take it away.",
        "By then, the cribs had killed two more babies, temporarily trapped seven others and prompted more than 50 complaints.",
        "Finally, this past September, two and a half years after Liam Johns death, the CPSC and Simplicity recalled 1 million cribs, the largest crib recall ever.",
        "The question now, how effective is the recall?",
        "Again, Attorney Charles Kelly.",
        "It's woefully inadequate because the recall itself allows the company to simply send a repair kit to parents and ask the parents to repair the defective crib themselves."

        "They said after one month that there were 45,000 responses to their recall action.",

        "That's a serious problem.",

        "An investigation by Consumer Reports found that almost a third of all recalled vehicles, more than a half of all toys and appliances and three quarters of child car seats are never repaired or returned to stores.",
        "But Julie Vallese, spokesperson at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, says the CPSC doesn't rate the success of a recall by how many products are returned.",
        "The way the CPSC determines whether or not there has been a successful recall is if the number of incidents or reports and complaints to the agency go down, once the recall is announced.",
        "Vallese couldn't talk about why it took the Consumer Product Safety Commission more than two years to investigate and recall those Simplicity cribs, she's not allowed to without Simplicity's permission."
