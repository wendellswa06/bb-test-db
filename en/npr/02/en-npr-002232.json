        "And then we can vector a helicopter in to them and they come outside and they wave to us.",
        "When you spoke to me on Monday, the Coast Guard had already, I think, rescued about a hundred people and you had had a list of 200 addresses that you were trying to pinpoint and get to.",

        "The first time that we spoke this week you said that after the rescue mission, beyond that the Coast Guard's mission was to clear up the shipping channels along the coast so that commerce could resume.",
        "Is there any progress on that front at all, or has that all been really put on hold while you deal with the rescue operation?",
        "Well, actually there's been substantial progress.",

        "I expect to have the Port of Mobile fully functional by close of business tomorrow, and should have the Intracoastal Waterway from New Orleans all the way to Carrabelle, Florida, open probably by tomorrow, certainly no later than Sunday.",
        "Gulfport was absolutely hammered.",
        "Pascagoula took a major hit as well, but we believe we may have them open by early next week, which is essential because there's major industry there, including a refinery that supplies a great deal of gasoline to Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.",
        "Mississippi is in your patch.",
        "There--I mean, if there are people who are still stranded, is the main problem figuring out where they are, the numbers of them merely or the inability to get the helicopters down on the ground near them?",
        "In coastal Mississippi, for the most part, most people are not cut off and have probably been reached by ground crews, certainly by today.",
        "The one--and this is coastal Mississippi; I can't speak to interior Mississippi.",
        "But there's also still individual small groups in individual houses that have some water around them but they're still able to stay inside, and we're still looking for them as they call in."
