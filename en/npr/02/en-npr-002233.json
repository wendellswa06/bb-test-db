        "You know, undoubtedly, there was a fair amount of chaos.",
        "But I think the sense of the chaos was hyped up by the media and politicians, who were talking about atrocities at the Super Dome, they were talking about gangs of looters, and really the situation on the streets was not as dire as the media portrayed it, and as politicians portrayed it.",
        "Were you able to determine to what extent, if any, there was looting, and to what extent, if any, there was reason, if there was for these people, to be concerned about other folks coming in to their neighborhood?",
        "The issue, of course, is the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, a problem that's been with us for quite a while, a problem that's not yet solved by this agreement but which we hope can be solved eventually.",

        "You're talking about a huge structure, and I just don't see how they could possibly build any structure 400 feet tall, regardless of whether it was a copy of, I don't know, the Venus de Milo 400 feet tall, that anyone would find attractive on top of one of our mountains.",
        "Richardson predicts the windmills will hurt tourism, just about the only industry in Highland County.",
        "And Shawna Bratton(ph), whose family owns 900 acres near the proposed wind farm, worries about its effect on property values.",
        "I don't people would be near as likely to invest in this county.",
        "In fact, I know some people who have come to look at property in this county have already stated concerns about the wind turbine project and put some of their plans on hold.",
        "Similar opposition has surfaced in other east-coast towns where wind farms are proposed.",
        "West Virginia residents have filed a nuisance suit to block construction of one wind project, while opponents of turbines off the coast of Cape Cod are hoping for Congressional intervention to stop them.",
        "Indeed, even in communities already living with wind farms, you'll find little consensus about them.",
        "(Soundbite of wind, windmills turning)",
        "Rural Tucker County, West Virginia has 44 mountaintop windmills, tall enough that their rotating blades can be seen for miles, and loud enough that their whooshing sound is heard in the nearby hollows."

        "The wind farm has become one of the County's largest taxpayers.",
        "There's little evidence it's hurt property values, and Robert Burns, the County's former economic development director, says tourism has actually grown as sightseers are drawn to the unusual towers.",
