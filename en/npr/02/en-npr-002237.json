        "That's our show for today.",

        "From NPR News, this is News & Notes.",
        "I'm Tony Cox.",
        "Seven hundred billion dollars.",
        "That's what President Bush is asking Congress to approve in order to rescue some of the nation's financial institutions.",
        "And investments banks have seen their last days.",
        "The Federal Reserve is allowing Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to become holding banks and take on commercial transactions.",

        "He is the chair of Howard University's department of economics.",
        "Bill, welcome.",
        "Hi, Tony.",
        "Listen, there are changes everywhere in the world of the economy.",
        "Part of that change, though, involves investment banks.",
        "Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs now to become bank holding companies.",
        "What exactly does that mean?",
        "It means that they will be under the umbrella of regulation that the Fed has.",
        "The financial sector in the 1930s was dominated by commercial banking, and since then it's become much more complicated, so that banks tended, the last couple of years, to be only about a third of economic activity, with insurance companies and investment banks and others playing a role that was twice as big.",
        "So when we think about things like the Community Reinvestment Act which governed commercial banks, it didn't govern those other actors, and they were free to put in sub-prime mortgage instruments that were outside of our regulatory purview.",
        "Now does that mean mortgage banks are another form of banking that is going to go by the way side also?",
        "Well a lot of them have already gone under because of these difficulties, and a lot of them are being bought up as well.",
        "So we'll have to see what will in the end be the case of the mortgage banks and we'll have to see what happens with Washington Mutual as well.",
        "Let's talk about the 700-billion-dollar bailout package that the president has asked Congress to approve this week.",
        "There are several parts to it.",
        "But I want to talk about the reaction to it.",
        "The Democratic Congressional leadership isn't necessarily criticizing the plan per say.",
        "But they do have concerns, and they do want to make sure there is appropriate oversight review.",
        "What do the Democrats specifically want?",
        "Well there's a big concern about, how are we going to value these assets?",
        "Because if we do it at a rate that is too high, which of course the banks would love us to give them a dollar for dollar for these mortgages, then that means that any losses involved in these are going to be borne by the American taxpayer."

        "Similarly, the members of the House and the Senate are concerned that these are mortgages held by individuals who would like to stay in their homes.",
        "And we're going to be rewarding the financial institutions by giving them a sure bet, Treasury bills, and they're looking at, well, these presidents and vice presidents of these investment houses were paid millions of dollars and got bonuses in the hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars.",
        "And so how does that balance between those kind of pay bonuses and homeowners then being told, you're going to get the short end of the stick?",
        "So there are some equity concerns.",
        "There are some concerns because the real problem is in the household net worth.",
        "That's what's causing all of the crisis.",
        "And over the last two quarters, the net worth of American households have dropped by two trillion dollars.",
        "So if we don't get the household balance sheet in order, we don't really have a way to move forward, even if we do save Wall Street.",
        "Is this going to be a partisan battle, do you think?",
        "Despite the calls - the urgent calls, for cooperation and bi-partisanship?",
        "But the characterizations of it that I hear on Fox News with Sean Hannity and other conservatives who are making it out like a branch of Louis Farrakhan's temple, just don't fit reality.",

        "The reputation is a very good one.",
        "I mean not a political, heavy political reputation.",

        "He has had a lot of political interest himself.",
        "He also has known Minister Farrakhan in the past.",

        "Wright.",
        "And his sermons, many of them are for sale by the church.",
        "And so ABC quoted the pastor talking about what the U.S.",
        "Government does to black Americans and Rev.",
        "Wright said, the government gives them the drugs, builds bigger prisons, passes a three strike law and then wants us to sing God Bless America.",
        "Oh, no, no, God damn America for treating our citizens as less than human.",
        "God damn America for as long as she acts like she's God and she's supreme.",
        "Now Bill, there's a couple of different threads here.",
        "One is, in many branches of Christianity the whole idea that no one is supreme to God is just a basic tenet of the church.",
        "Another thing is that, of course, in many black churches over time have dealt with civil rights, have dealt with being antagonistic towards what they perceived, rightly, as government oppression.",
        "Where does that critique, the righteous critique end and speech go out of bounds and how is this playing out in the press?",
        "Should there be an examination of the history of the church in the context of these sermons?",
        "Well he's been blasted in the mainstream press for criticizing George W.",
        "Bush, for, as Clarence was saying, for praising Louis Farrakhan.",
        "But there's a whole story here that we need to talk about.",
        "As Clarence was saying, in Chicago, now I'm looking at this from afar coming from Los Angeles, but I have looked at the Web site and the church says that it's committed to the black community.",
        "It's committed to the black family.",
        "It's committed to pursuit of excellence for education and for the work ethic.",
        "So it's not just a simple story.",
        "But the problem is, we're in an election year and in an election year, everything gets heightened.",
        "There's not a simple statement that's said.",
        "And when you've got a minister who is so closely tied to a candidate as the Rev.",
        "Wright is with Obama, I guarantee you will hear his name again and again and again through out this election year."

        "So Bill, what do you think that the Senator needs to watch out for in terms of how this story plays out and do you think it's going to have legs?",
        "If he is the nominee, if he is finally chosen as the nominee for the Democratic party, I guarantee you this will have legs.",
        "But what Obama has said repeatedly, is that this is his minister, and the minister is speaking words that resonate with him and with his congregation - he is not speaking for Barack Obama.",
        "I think he's made it pretty clear that they are two separate people speaking two separate messages.",
        "But whether he's going to be able to hold on to that distance through, until November, that's the big question.",
        "I want to ask you, Clarence, and then go back to Bill with the same question.",
        "This week, earlier this week, you had a huge amount of outcry over comments by Geraldine Ferraro, who was on the vice presidential ticket.",
        "And what is — what responsibility do advisors, pastors, supporters have to play by the rules that the candidates play by?",
        "What's the difference, in terms of how Geraldine Ferraro's remarks played out and how the minister's remarks will play out?",
        "Well for one thing, Obama can't ask Rev.",
        "Wright to retire or resign from his campaign because he's not in the campaign.",
        "Geraldine Ferraro was a fund raiser, not a inner circle figure, but still one who was involved in trying to help Hillary Clinton get elected.",
        "Rev.",
        "Wright is not, he's not even the active pastor of his church.",
        "He retired recently.",
        "So it's a bit different and Obama has already distanced himself from remarks the minister, his minister made.",
        "These new quotes have come up.",
        "I'm sure Obama is going to be approached to renounce those remarks as well or distance himself in any case.",

        "You know, Pastor Hagee, John McCain came under a lot of fire for that.",
        "Right.",
        "I want to circle back Bill, to Geraldine Ferraro.",
        "How much of a lasting impact will those remarks have?",
        "I mean it sounds like there may be legs for this question about Rev.",
        "Wright and Obama.",
        "Is the Ferraro discussion going to leave a bad taste in some voters' mouths?",
        "I think so.",
        "I think it's just this constant drip, drip, drip of injecting race into this campaign as though you could not have race in this campaign this year.",
        "But it's seems like such a long time ago but it was just back before South Carolina when people were questioning whether Barack Obama was black enough and talking about, well the black vote was sort of split between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.",
        "And now that seems to have solidified.",
        "And comments like this don't really help, especially since the Democrats are going to need both women and African—Americans come November.",
        "And right now, it almost seems as though, well it makes me wonder if Ferraro and Clinton were just tone deaf as to how hurtful this was, not just to Obama and African—Americans, but to the part in general or if, it sort of makes you wonder if there might have been some method to the madness.",
        "Was this sort of something they perhaps wanted to get out there?",
        "I'm confused about that myself to tell you the truth.",
        "Well I want to leave us with a final note about Lieutenant Governor David Patterson of New York who's about to become the governor.",
        "He has not gotten as much press as the man leaving the office, Eliot Spitzer, but then again, he doesn't have to deal with reports that he spent $80,000 on prostitutes."

        "So folks are not expecting Patterson to be as aggressive of a reformer.",
