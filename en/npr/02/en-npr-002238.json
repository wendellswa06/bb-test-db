        "Yeah.",
        "And you reply: I'm sure you meant that as a compliment, and it gets a laugh, but maybe not exactly for the reason that Gore Vidal intended.",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "I think maybe - I think, you know, in 1960, when you think about it, television was still relatively new, I suppose, and it started seeping into our lives during those years.",
        "And I think Gore Vidal had a bit of distain for the medium, perhaps, or at least Bill Russell, my character, does.",
        "So I think that perhaps there's more laughs in this play than I originally thought, although I thought when I first read it that comedy was important to find in it because sometimes it has a tendency to be a little - not pedantic, certainly, but it talks about philosophy and it talks about morals.",
        "And sometimes it's difficult to act, so I wanted to make the audience as comfortable as possible by making them laugh as often as possible.",
        "And your character, well, it could be played another way, towards the pompous.",
        "Yes.",
        "I'm - yes, it could.",

        "And, you know, I didn't see the movie.",
        "I didn't - and when I thought when I was offered the role, thinking to step in any shoes that Henry Fonda may have occupied might be really treacherous if I try to play it truly earnestly, but with tongue and cheek I thought I could probably pull it off.",
        "And when you were offered the part, did you know that you would have to swap lines with James Earl Jones?",
        "Yes, absolutely, because James had signed on, I think, either first or second and then Angela in that - or maybe not in that order, perhaps reversed.",
        "But when Jeffrey Richards, the producer, who came to see \"\"How to Succeed\"\" several times, which I was very complimented by, and he would talk to me after the show, that's what he said - James Earl Jones is doing this, and I basically said yes before I even read the play.",
        "That's a little intimidating, though, isn't it?",

        "And there is plenty of rooms for skyscraper districts, and I also point the densification, the increasing density in Midtown East in New York and the rezoning makes perfect sense.",

        "They come from older neighborhoods with mixed-use buildings that have warehouses and industrial areas, and those are the areas, which are not only dense - they're certainly much denser than a suburb - but where people can mix and mingle and interact, combine and recombine.",

        "They can emulate many of the functions of the city.",
        "So as we begin to build denser cities, the key is not just piling up people in buildings higher and higher and higher and creating vertical suburbs where people just interact in the building, it's to build cities that can be dense, that can have multi-story buildings, that can be close together.",
