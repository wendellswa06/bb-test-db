        "If this is the price that Bush has to pay in order to get conservatives on board for a guest worker program, then I think it's an acceptable though regrettable price to pay.",

        "The jury has the case now in the sentencing trial of Zarcarias Moussaoui.",
        "Earlier today, lawyers for both sides gave closing arguments on the first question for the jury, whether Moussaoui is eligible for the death penalty.",
        "If the jurors decide he is eligible, the trial will move to a second phase.",
        "Moussaoui had already pleaded guilty to conspiring with al-Qaida to commit terrorism.",
        "NPR's Laura Sullivan is with us from the federal courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia.",
        "Laura, the prosecution says Moussaoui is directly responsible for the deaths on 9/11.",
        "How did they make that point in their closing arguments?",
        "Well, what prosecutor David Raskin told the jury was very straight forward.",
        "He said people would be alive today if Moussaoui hadn't lied to investigators when he was picked up.",
        "And he said he lied on purpose because he was trained to lie from al-Qaida.",
        "And much of his opening statement was really very heavily weighted on what Moussaoui himself said in his own testimony, that he was going to crash a fifth plane into the White House, and he said because of that testimony it just blew all the defense arguments, he said, completely out of the water.",
        "And to back that up he drew a lot of parallels between Moussaoui and the hijackers.",
        "And he reminded the jury that they only have to find that if Moussaoui had told the truth it would have led to them stopping one plane or one hijacker.",
        "And he said that that's really a no-brainer, that the FBI would have easily been able to stop the plot.",
        "And how about the defense?",
        "They tried their best to pick apart the prosecution's case."

        "Well, they did.",
        "And it was really interesting, because this had to be a first in a federal death penalty case, because McMahon called his client ignorant, prejudiced, manipulative, a propagandist.",
        "At one point he called him an arrogant, dangerous, stubborn person.",
        "And that's not what you usually hear from defense attorneys arguing on behalf of their own client.",
        "How did the defense answer the government's claim that they could've shut down 9/11, prevented it, if they only knew what Moussaoui knew?",
        "He was humorous, self deprecating, he had terrific grasp of issues but was never high on himself.",
        "He took his work very seriously, but himself not at all.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "But I spent my youth in small crowded rooms where actually in those days you could smoke cigarettes and other things.",
        "And in New Orleans - and I loved it - had radio stayed the way it was between '67 and '69, at least in my world, I don't think I would have left it.",
        "But it started to get commercialized, and so you had less time to play music and more commercials on your log.",
        "And so it was more difficult to be sort of free form."
