        "The best man wins, let's just put it that way.",
        "Correct.",
        "That by the action that William Russell takes at the end of the play, does it, in any way, indicate that he has either no balls or huge balls?",
        "Because I wasn't sure, after reading the play it several times and starting to rehearse it, which of those answers was correct because it had to be one or the other.",
        "As an actor, obviously, I have to think that my character does the right thing, at least that he thinks it's the right thing.",
        "So I sort of answered it for myself, but Gore Vidal did answer me.",
        "And so I used that, his answer, to look at how William Russell actually removes himself from this.",
        "Because when you think about it, if you know the play, there are other routes he could take in order to ostracize Cantwell without himself sacrificing his presidency.",
        "But he doesn't take them, this obvious one, which is to go to the governor John Merwin character, and say, come on.",
        "Let's join forces and beat the hell of this guy.",
        "So it had to be - it has to come to point where Russell cannot be part of the system at all, secondarily.",
        "If he can't be, he's got to stop Cantwell from being.",
        "Because Cantwell is so egregious, but in a...",
        "And it's that, you know, that's, again, a personal and subjective thing, I supposed, although that's what William Russell thinks.",
        "Although even James Earl Jones' character has, you know, he vacillates about whether or not that's a good thing to be or not."

        "No one has brought that out as, wow, how could they do that?",
        "It's just - and if you noticed, the play - if one reads the play and sees the play - there's not one mention of race, I mean, even forgetting, you know, looking at Gore Vidal's original text, that does not come out as an issue in the play, and the communists and homosexuality and promiscuity do.",

        "You know, it's funny how things come around.",
        "I was - I met the director in Colorado in 1969.",
        "And when I went to L.A., he contacted me because we had spent some time together in Colorado and said, I directed this movie, and I need a favor.",
        "I don't have any money.",
        "And so I went into the studio and I did this narration as a favor for him, and that was it.",
        "I've never seen the movie, and I never spoke to the director again, Tobe Hooper, but I did this a favor because he was, you know, a head from Colorado, like I was, and he was directing a movie, and I had moved to L.A., you know.",
        "So that's how it happened."

        "I had an open-ended deal at NBC, and I should have been - we - Don Reo and I should have been a little more conservative in pushing that dark element.",
        "I mean, as it, you know - but the first 12 or 13 episodes were wonderful.",
