        "But most important, I think that they then as they wrote their studies over the next bunch of years, including a landmark study in the New England Journal of Medicine, did not disclose in those studies that they had been underwritten in part by a cigarette maker.",
        "Had they disclosed that, they probably would not have been published in either the New England Journal of Medicine or in the Journal of the American Medical Association where they also had a study and some letters.",
        "So, it's a fairly big deal in lung cancer, if you take money from a cigarette company.",
        "People in lung cancer particularly are extremely sensitive about that, so you have to be very upfront about it.",
        "The tobacco companies used to sponsor a lot of medical research or what they said was medical research, that always reached inconclusive results about the health effects of tobacco.",
        "And I think that's why these medical groups and medical journals have said we are not going to publish material if it comes from the tobacco companies.",
        "Right.",
        "The tobacco industry particularly, as you say, Alex, has a terrible history in medical research.",
        "They sponsored research basically to sort of cloud the waters on the dangers of cigarettes for decades, and they did this both directly funding studies, and they also had a history of setting up independent - founding foundations and funneling money through them to then sort of launder their money to then support research.",
        "And the reason this is all important is that there are - there's lot of evidence, there have been lots of studies that show that the source of funding for research can have substantial impacts on the outcome of the research.",
        "Which is why medical journals over the last ten to 15 years see disclosure of this source of research as so important because it tells something about the research.",
        "Well, I think there are two things there that I wonder about.",
        "One, it looks as though while Cornel Medical College did try to hide from the New England Journal of Medicine the source of the money, the tobacco source of the money for this study.",
        "And second, and perhaps more importantly, what can one conclude about the utility of these CT scans - that's computer tomography, in these sort of analysis of lung cancer?",
        "On your first question Alex the university basically says they did disclose this because Vector, which is the parent company of Liggett Group, put out a press release saying they were going to give this money.",
        "But it is important to disclose where your funding comes in research, and you shouldn't have to require that readers have a computer nearby, and are able to do very sophisticated sort of Google searches to come up with the funding for your research.",
        "Which is why people believe that you need to be very straightforward, you know, from the get-go, and have those statements go along with your papers.",
        "Second, there is a huge controversy right now in the field of lung cancer about whether CT scans, CAT scans, or computer tomography scans can be helpful, and there is a very large trial that has been launched by the National Cancer Institute to study this very thing.",

        "Well, I don't get into this in the piece, but I do know enough people who know more than I do about real estate, and they tell you that new construction is typically more expensive.",
        "If you look at the cost of some of these high-rises going up in Hong Kong or even in the United States, they're quite pricey, you know, quite well in excess of $1,000 or multiple thousand dollars per square foot.",
        "You know, Jane Jacobs, who I invoke in the piece, and I look at this great report done by Peter Gordon in Sanford Ikeda, and they actually studied this and contrasted crude density, the piling and packing of people ever taller, what they call Jane Jacobs density, after the great urban theorist who wrote about Hudson Street in New York and the vibrancy of older areas.",
        "And she always said that new ideas require old buildings, that having affordable space with big floor plates that is reusable, that is, you know, connected to one another.",
        "And Google paid a remarkable sum.",
        "And for folks listening in, it paid $1.8 billion to be in the middle of, I guess, the intersection of Chelsea in the meat packing district.",
        "It bought the old Port Authority Terminal.",
        "So some of these can be quite expensive.",
        "But if it doesn't happen there, it happens, perhaps, in Brooklyn.",

        "But what I was cautioning against is, in a rush to density that particularly in other societies, not necessarily our country, in other societies which are building up, one of the remarkable things in America is during the urban renewal period, you know, people united in their neighborhoods to save these old districts.",
        "And what we find is that many of these old districts that were saved and weren't particularly advanced or particularly beautiful - those are the districts were now companies and high-tech entrepreneurs and in and(ph) outer areas, artists and musicians, are now streaming.",
        "But the urban development process is quite dynamic.",
        "And these older industrial areas seem to play - in innovation and creativity, in arts and technology and entrepreneurship - they seem to play an increasingly very special role.",

        "They have incredibly diverse economies.",
        "And I think the best thing I can say, and urbanists would say, is that when you have a diversity of neighborhood types and a diversity of building types, that's when you have a great city.",
        "So I think making sure that that diversity is maintained...",
        "And the other thing that I really want - and it doesn't come up in this piece, but it comes up in other things I've written in a bigger conversation.",
        "In this rush to shrink some of the - they called it the shrinking cities, some of our older industrial centers, like Detroit or Buffalo - that many of these older neighborhoods are the neighborhoods that are being cleared and older buildings are being knocked down.",
        "And in this rush to shrink, I think, the other caution is that that many of these neighborhoods, one can never predict and one wouldn't never predict - because they're been to comeback centers of so many communities - that they have just the sort of buildings that often are affordable and reconfigurable and exciting to people that bear the seeds of a comeback.",
        "So I think thinking about the diversity of cities, but particularly these older warehousing and industrial areas, which were where food was distributed, where products were distributed in cities which - and many cities are rundown in an afterthought - they play a very, very special role in generating innovation and creativity.",
        "And in a rush to density, we should make sure to have that diversity and to make sure they're productive.",
        "So this is not just the mega cities of - that you write about so much, the New Yorks and the Chicagos and the Shanghais, for that matter, and the Londons, but places like Buffalo and Cleveland."
