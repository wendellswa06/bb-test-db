        "And I think it's very interesting.",
        "When I looked at what really gives the U.S.",
        "competitive advantage in the world economy - and I have to think after the tough time we've had and that we still have, so many people are struggling in so many communities - what creates an enormous competitive advantage is the diversity within our cities, of building forms, of people, but also the fact that we have so many cities.",
        "So in this recovery, the knowledge centers, not only the Silicon Valleys, but so many of the college towns.",
        "I was struck in my own research and in this revisited look at \"\"The Rise of the Creative Class,\"\" how spectacularly a community like Ann Arbor has done, right in the shadows of Detroit; or a community like Madison, Wisconsin, or Gainesville, Florida, or Lexington, Kentucky, never mind Boulder and Austin.",
        "And the other kinds of communities that have done very, very well in the United States are the natural resources communities in the Houston area and the Texas area, parts of Oklahoma.",
        "So what I think gives the United States a lot of its vibrancy is how diverse our communities are within themselves and the fact that we have so many different kinds of city.",
        "When one type of city is down, an industrial city, a Sun Belt city of sprawl, another kind of city seems to be bouncing back and recovering.",
        "That said, and all very interesting, if diversity and density are two of the key elements, how does that explain what you describe as the suburban Nerdistan of Silicon Valley?",
        "Well, it was...",
        "You know, they think they are the cool.",
        "They do have the schools, but yeah.",
        "Well, it's clear, now, that the Nerdist Stand model of technology development was been very successful.",
        "Silicon Valley, like it or not - and I'm an urbanist.",
        "I prefer big cities.",
        "I prefer San Francisco or New York - where we're talking from today, Toronto.",
        "But you have to give it credit, that the Silicon Valley model has been inordinately successful.",
        "And certainly, if you compare it to our new competitors in Shanghai, or Sao Paolo, or Mumbai or Bangalore, that model, which is far less dense, is quite successful.",
        "What is happening, of course - and I'm writing more about this and will write more about this - is that we do see a move, a - maybe it's an inflection point, where more and more technology based companies are seeking out older city neighborhoods with this medium-rise mixed use industrial buildings.",
        "You not only see it in Chelsea, in Tribeca, in Midtown south, in the Flatiron District of New York, you see it in the migration of companies back into downtown San Francisco.",
        "You see it in the migration of companies from the Route 128 band of suburbs that surrounded Boston, back into downtown Boston and Cambridge.",
        "And you're even seeing little dribs and drabs.",
        "You see, well, a bigger burst of this in Pittsburgh where I lived for many years.",
        "But you're even seeing a little bit of that kind of activity happening in a place like Detroit where a few little start-up companies and a big installation, Quicken Loans, and moved back downtown.",
        "So it's a balanced approach.",
        "It's certainly a certain big floor plates, an Apple computer, a Microsoft that employs a lot of people needs to be in a suburban area.",
        "But other companies and installations thrive in urban centers.",
        "So as those big vertical suburbs go up in midtown, again in New York City and other cities around the world - you talked about some of them - can there be anything to ameliorate, to help along, this innovation and creativity, even those big high-rise buildings?"

        "I think that what smart urban designer - it's like a fellow named David Lewis, who's taught at Carnegie Mellon.",
        "David is in his 80s.",
        "He would always say that even when you pack density, the street level, the storefront level, the ability for people to mix and mingle and not be, you know, stuck in these giant plazas, no man's land, that is between big buildings, you know, these wind-swept corridors.",
        "That if you activate the street level - and I think in New York, I think New York is doing it right.",
        "You know, I think New York is really - had a phenomenal comeback.",
        "But if you can think about it as a series of districts or a series of neighborhoods, some with large skyscrapers and towers, others with these more historic and warehousing districts with - in many cities, not so much New York - many cities with less expensive space... Another example of this would be greater Miami, which has built a very, you know, high-rise towers, has brought people back into the downtown core and has a culture and entertainment district and sports arena.",
        "But it has the Wynwood Arts corridor where artist studios and galleries are very affordable.",
        "And the Design District, which has design companies, and now has a commercial renovation.",
        "So I think the best cities are a mix - mixture of the areas' kind of building types.",
        "And it's important to preserve that diversity, not just build a homogenous city of skyscrapers or a homogenous suburb of sprawl.",

        "He might have included Senator Margaret Chase Smith of Maine and six other Republicans for denouncing McCarthy in 1950 when that really called for courage.",
        "But John Kennedy's book doesn't make room for such a chapter.",
        "Yet, \"\"Profiles in Courage\"\" is still a book worth reading because it's the view of an ambitious politician with the kind of courage maybe he wished he had, and that so many American voters say they want.",
