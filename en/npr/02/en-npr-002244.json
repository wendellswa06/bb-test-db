        "Or he has to flee.",
        "I mean, there are three options.",
        "He could be captured.",
        "He could be killed, or he could flee and seek asylum somewhere else.",
        "Right now, he has said he's not going to leave Libya, that he will fight to the end.",
        "I think a lot of people believe that's in fact what he'll try and do.",
        "But the end of this conflict won't end with his death or capture.",
        "There will be a whole new phase, which is who rules Libya after he goes, and that's still a very open question.",
        "And continues to be a question as these different - I mean, at the moment, these disparate groups are united in toppling Gadhafi.",
        "When they lose that united cause, then maybe the differences among them become even more exacerbated.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The history of Libya, it's a very tribal country, and tribe matters a lot.",
        "Gadhafi was able to play - base his power on three main tribes around Tripoli.",
        "And by lavishing great amounts of money and perks with them, got their support while he stiffs other tribes, especially those in the east and around Benghazi.",
        "So there's an element of tribalism under this, and these tribal conflicts will emerge as someone battles for takeover of the government, the new government.",
        "That's the great concerned of a lot of analysts.",
        "(Laughter) I somewhat made it up.",
        "And we also heard about the challenges you face.",
        "A few themes came up again and again - lack of Internet connection, trouble accessing health care, and several people brought up education.",
        "We have trouble attracting and keeping good teachers.",
        "Sometimes we have substitutes keeping a class for half of the year.",
        "That's retired teacher Cheryl Sebrell, who left us a message from Littleton, N.C.",

        "Only a few hundred people live in her little farming town, and Sebrell loves it.",
        "You know everybody.",
        "There's no traffic.",
        "I go down to the post office if I've got a package, and they don't have to ask my box number.",

        "And over those many years, she watched as things got harder for teachers and for students.",
        "In the '80s and the early '90s, there was a big focus on education in North Carolina, and we were a leader in the country.",
        "It's all about cost cutting and budgets and things now.",
        "And it's tough to be in a rural area when that is happening.",
        "Well, let me ask you, what were some of the challenges in a rural area that are different from the city?",
        "Well, one of the things is it's very hard to find qualified teachers who will stay.",
        "There's not always a lot to offer to people who are coming in to teach.",
        "Housing sometimes can be a problem.",
        "Living in a home in the country, you're going to deal with leaking roofs and mice, and sometimes that can be a problem, finding a place that you want to live in, just a house, so that you're not driving back and forth.",
        "So a lot of our teachers do come in from the triangle area - Raleigh, Durham - and they drive, you know, an hour in the morning or an hour and a half in the morning and again in the afternoon.",
        "And when you have long hours, that makes it really tough as well.",
        "I'm curious.",
        "You mentioned funding.",
        "Give us an example of some of the challenges of funding when you were a teacher.",
        "The school gets a budget, but it just meets very basic, bare-minimum needs.",
        "I used different grants to get novels and other literature that I wanted to use in the classroom.",
        "You had to write those grants yourself.",
        "I did.",

        "But Teach For America is a program that's been trying to fill that gap.",
        "Is that helping?",
        "Absolutely, it helps.",
        "They're very active in our school, and that has really saved us.",
        "Obviously, they're not there for the long haul all the time, but we've had a lot that have stayed three or four, maybe even five years.",

        "I think it's powerful to see the students' response to people who come back and teach.",
        "But of course, a lot of students, once they go out, they've lived in the big wide world, they don't necessarily want to come back.",
        "That was Cheryl Sebrell, a longtime teacher in rural North Carolina.",

        "Most of them had dial-up, which is just archaic.",

        "We just feel it's an investment that the phone companies and cable companies are unable to make.",
        "So the folks in this very conservative part of Minnesota decided that they wanted to put their tax dollars on the line and enable this network.",
