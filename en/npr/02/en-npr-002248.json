        "And there was a real similar pattern.",
        "He would talk big picture about the urgency for action, about how things needed to be done.",
        "But then we'd say, well, what are the specifics?",
        "And he never really had a specific answer.",
        "He would either go back to that big-picture need for general change or say we could do a wide range of things.",
