        "And I'll never forget his funeral.",
        "We were all packed together there, crying and holding onto each other.",
        "And all I kept thinking is here we all are gathered for his death, but where were we for his life?",
        "I mentioned this is something he has talked about before.",
        "And I've seen him tell this story in jam-packed rooms in South Carolina.",
        "And I've seen voters really deeply moved by a story like this.",
        "And I think that is something that Booker brings to the campaign trail that a lot of other candidates don't - really seeing firsthand the problems that he's trying to fix.",
        "OK.",
        "Big picture, how does Senator Booker fit into the broader slate of 2020 candidates for Democrats right now?",
        "He's really in the middle of the pack in polling, media attention, fundraising.",
        "He's one of many candidates just in the low single digits, and he really hasn't had that one breakout moment.",
        "Booker is focusing really hard on Iowa and New Hampshire.",
        "His thinking is these are the two early states that really reward that one-on-one relationship building.",

        "The poles are showing it too close to call really, in both states, in both Texas and Ohio, but having said that, there's a little bit more to be gleaned from these polls.",
        "In Texas Barack Obama has erased a 20 point lead for Hilary Clinton from say several weeks ago, right after Super Tuesday and actually taken a small lead on average.",
        "Taking all the polls together, he seems to have a point or two advantage.",
        "That's not statistically significant but it does suggest that he has caught her, that it is close enough for him to represent well in the primary voting during the day tomorrow and we'll talk in a moment about the caucuses that are coming up in the evening tomorrow.",
        "But he should hold his own in that primary voting during the day, and that may be the one most significant sentence to say about the March 4th primaries.",
        "Over in Ohio, still looks like Clinton country.",
        "Most of the polls showing her still with some small advantage.",
        "It's statistically not that significant but there is one poll out, the Ohio poll from the University of Cincinnati that still shows her up about 10 percentage points.",
        "That would tend to indicate that she is going to pull out Ohio.",
        "Ohio was this real bell weather last election.",
        "And it's been a bell weather many times.",
        "But Ohio was the make or break state last time around in the general election.",
        "What makes Ohio special in terms of what it represents for America?",
        "Ohio almost always votes with the winner.",
        "Ohio votes for the man or the woman, perhaps the 2008 case, who winds up winning the presidency.",
        "So Ohio has a diversity that is representative of the country in terms of north and south, urban and rural, white and black and Latino.",
        "It has a blue collar/white collar mix that reflects the country.",
        "It's a kind of microcosm for the whole 50 states.",
        "When you think about all of the issues that are swirling around this election, this primary season, superdelegates and earned delegates and brokered conventions, is tomorrow really the moment of truth or is it just another moment?",
        "It's potentially the moment of truth.",
        "And more than any Tuesday or Saturday that we've had thus far in 2008, this date has the potential to close it out.",
        "For example, on the Republican side, John McCain is almost surely going to go past the magic number of 1,191 delegates and he will become the presumptive nominee of the Republican party.",
        "Could that happen on Democratic side?",
        "No. Nobody is going to go over the magic number needed to nominate on the Democratic side.",
        "For one thing, it's about twice as large a number.",
        "They are just are going to have to have lots more delegates to get this thing resolved.",
        "What could happen, at least in theory, is that Barack Obama could win Texas and Ohio if he pulls off something of an upset in Ohio, Vermont as well, probably not Rhode Island.",
        "But let's say he throws in Rhode Island too and just adds that to this big long string of eleven victories he's already put together.",
        "And if that were to happen, by whatever narrow margins, it really wouldn't be of consequence what the margin was.",
        "If he were to win all these events, then I think most everyone in the Democratic party who was not a hardcore Hilary Clinton partisan would have to say, look, he's wrapping it up.",
        "There's really no point in Hilary Clinton going on.",
        "He keeps winning.",
        "He's got the delegates.",
        "He's going to have the delegates, there's really no point in Hilary Clinton continuing.",
        "You can also apply that to we know more about the back side of the moon, than we know about the deep oceans.",
        "But as NPR's Richard Gonzales reports, Dellums's bid for City Hall hasn't been the cakewalk many had predicted.",
        "No one has ever lost money betting on the ability of Ron Dellums to fire up a hometown crowd."

        "During Oakland's day as a bastion of black political power, Dellums might have walked away with the mayor's race.",
