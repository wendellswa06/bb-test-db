        "It's also the story of your family.",
        "Yeah, it's the story of one guy's invention and sort of, if you take a mildly dysfunctional like mine was from Brooklyn in the 1930s, inject a couple hundred million dollars that resulted from the fortune, and it's like a lab experiment.",
        "You watch everybody go insane.",
        "Now, your part of the family, your mother and all of her children have been disinherited from the Sweet 'N Low empire, so to speak.",
        "Is this book sort of sour grapes for you?",
        "I don't think its sour grapes.",

        "And to me it's sort of like the greatest story I know.",

        "And he started making this tea and nobody bought it.",
        "And he's sort of out of money, out of ideas and he's sitting at Cookie's Diner in Midwood Brooklyn with my grandma Betty, and I see it like a movie in a split screen.",

        "Now, during that time your Uncle Marvin is very involved in running the company, but your grandfather Ben is still there, right?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It was a classic patriarchal three generation American fortune where my Uncle Marvin, who we used to call Uncle Marvelous, was into his 60s, he was still sort of taking orders from his father.",
