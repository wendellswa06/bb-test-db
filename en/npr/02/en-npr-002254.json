        "In recent years some horses have come close, including Funny Cide and Smarty Jones, and this year it could be Barbaro.",
        "He races tomorrow in the second leg of the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes.",
        "It's Friday and that means sports writer Stephan Fatsis of the Wall Street Journal joins us to talk about the race.",
        "Stephan, first let's talk a little bit about why there hasn't been a Triple Crown winner in so long.",
        "Is this purely a random thing?",
        "Outside of politics, there's a lot of evidence from a lot of different disciplines that women actually are more likely than men to value cooperation and collaboration.",
        "But partisanship complicates things.",
        "And the incentives to stick with your team keep women and men voting in much the same ways.",
        "The baggage that she and Bill Clinton bring back to the White House that hasn't fully been vetted, whether it's his overseas business connections, or exactly what his role was going to be, it creates a really powerful get-out-the-vote machine for the Republicans, who already are warming up to taking on Obama and have been waiting in the wings for another shot at Clintons.",
        "So for those reasons alone, outside of the minor policy differences and their strong personality differences, I think they're much stronger than the demographic concerns that you just raised."

        "Desmond, what about ideas and issues?",
        "I mean, there's been a lot of talk about things like change or firsts and you know, first black, first woman, etcetera.",
        "But when it comes down to it, you've got a country that's dealing with four-plus dollars a gallon for gas, you know, billions of dollars in debt that we've accumulated, the war, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.",
        "This is time for heavy lifting.",
        "What would you like to hear from the candidates at this point?",
        "Well, I'd like to hear some substance, some really - from my understanding, Obama is somewhat of a policy wonk, but we've never been able to really vet that out because we've been focused so much on race and sex, sexism if anything.",
        "At least, that's what Hillary led us to believe - would like us to believe, that it's about sexism.",
        "Honestly, I think that, if these two can get beyond some of the being pitted against each other as far as their respective demographics, maybe we could see some of these issues come forward.",
        "But right now, as you just stated, this is going to be an ultimate litmus test to see if it's going to be about dealing with the economic issues domestically as opposed to dealing with the color of his skin.",

        "And I think he believes it, too.",
        "So I look forward to getting into the meat of those policy differences.",
        "I look forward to that, but I have to tell you, I think it's aspirational.",
        "I think this campaign right through November is going to be plagued with a lot of identity politics, whether it's done by 527s, whether it's done by spokespeople or allies of the candidates, I think you're going to still see some things that - you're going to see some dirty pull.",
        "Well, how about this.",
        "What abut the other side of it, which is, you know, someone was saying to me the other day that they thought that Senator Obama could not campaign on the issues because he was the magical African-American friend.",
        "And that's a phrase that writer, Christopher John Farley of Time, wrote once.",
        "But it's like this whole idea of, like, you know, in the buddy movie, where you've got the black buddy.",
        "And it's like, he's my black friend, but he's such a nice guy.",
        "He's not like all those other black people.",
        "And you know, to a certain extent, if Senator Obama rolls up his sleeves and starts, you know, taking some hard shots, will he ruin, Carmen, this idea of the magical African-American friend?",
        "Well, I wrote about that very early in his campaign.",
        "So I agree with you 100 percent.",
        "But the tricky thing is now walking that line between explaining his policies and keeping people comfortable that he's not too strong, which is a very hard line for an African-American man to walk.",
        "Let me turn to another issue, a cultural issue.",
        "One of the things that's come up as this campaign unfolds is a question of where are we.",
        "Where are we as a nation on the issue of race?",
        "Do we have, you know, more cross-racial friendships but not racial justice in systems like, you know, the justice system.",
        "Now, there's a controversy.",

        "There's a giant Confederate flag that might go above the tree line near Tampa.",
        "There's a group called the Sons of Confederate Veterans, and they want to put a 30-foot-high 50-foot-long flag atop a 139-foot pole.",
        "It would be the world's largest Confederate flag.",

        "What does that say about the differing strains of culture in America today?",

        "And so we actually spoke with Rob Fields, a pop culture expert and blogger, and here's part of what he said on how Bo Diddley affected black musicians.",
        "One of the things that Bo Diddley represented was this artist who was very clear from the beginning that he wanted to do his own thing and have his own sound.",
        "He was clear that he did not want to sound like anyone else.",
        "That's what black rock artists in the larger sense of the term have always been about, sort of exploring their own personal taste but filtering it, certainly, through, you know, a black cultural sensitivity.",

        "I mean, do you see him as one of the people who really blazed a trail in rock and roll?",

        "Even he was, I guess, noted for the first rock and roll record, \"\"Rocket 88.\"\" I guess in some ways, it bothers me as to how the music scene right now is, and how we just do not have enough musicianship in the African-American community that's being highlighted."
