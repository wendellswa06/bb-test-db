        "It looks as though the president agrees with you.",
        "He's going on \"\"60 Minutes\"\" this weekend, you know, to talk obviously about Iraq, and it looks as though he knows he needs to build support for this, and I wonder, can he really go forward with this troop surge idea if he doesn't manage to rally some support?",
        "Well, of course he can.",
        "He's the commander in chief, and so he has the ability to order the troops there.",
        "He has the money in-hand right now.",
        "He invites the critics to really come out of hiding, and you saw this yesterday on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
        "Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was testifying, and the tone of the questioning was so aggressive, it was really a break with the normally decorous, cautious, respectful attitude that's shown among the members and to their guests, and in this case to the secretary of state.",
        "It wasn't there yesterday.",
        "You saw Barack Obama...",
        "Or else what?",
        "Or this plan is not going to work.",
        "The question is not whether the plan is going to work or not.",
        "The question is what are the consequences to the Iraqi government?",
        "I'm out of time, but I have to ask this question.",
        "Are there any circumstances that the president or you are willing to share in which we would say to the Iraqis, we are no longer maintaining American combat troops in Iraq?",
        "The senator from Illinois saying enough.",
        "Chuck Hagel's saying, you know, your information and your intelligence is at odds with the intelligence that I'm receiving, Madam Secretary.",
        "That kind of aggressive tone and questioning, it reminds people of the hearings that William Fulbright held during the Vietnam era, and it caused President Johnson no end of trouble because it basically stole away the media and with it public support for the war.",
        "But Juan, let me play you one clip of tape now.",
        "This comes from a hearing today.",
        "There are more hearings today.",
        "There are going to be more next week.",
        "This is the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
        "Here's Senator John McCain, and he is questioning the secretary of defense, Robert Gates.",
        "Here he is.",
        "I know that some of my colleagues disagree with the troop increase in Iraq, and I have heard the calls for a withdrawal to begin in four to six months.",
        "Those who advocate such a policy have a right, even an obligation, to join the debate on this issue.",
        "But I believe these individuals also have a responsibility to tell us what they believe are the consequences of withdrawal in Iraq.",
        "That's Senator McCain, Juan, and you know, that is a question that the Democrats and the opposition, which now includes Republicans, are going to have to answer."

        "Right.",
        "And so what you see is that there is a larger conversation going on, and this has politics as well as Middle East geopolitical consequences to it, Alex.",
        "In the political sense, McCain is running as supporter of President Bush, as he seeks the Republican nomination for 2008.",
        "He's making a play for the right wing of the party, and he's very aware that people like Mitt Romney and Rudy Giuliani, his likely competitors for that nomination, are also standing by the president.",
        "But in the larger geopolitical issue, what you see is McCain putting the pressure on the Democrats and saying what's your plan, and the Democrats coming back.",
        "For example, I thought it was interesting that Senator Biden made it clear yesterday that he is not going to authorize the president to get into any conflict with Iran or with Syria without coming to the U.S.",
        "Senate, and said that there's a threat of a Constitutional crisis if the president would pursue that course.",
        "And the Democrats for the most part saying we might not have an exact plan, but we can tell you that the plan as it's been executed by the president has not brought us to any good place, and we've seen the loss of life, and we've seen the tremendous loss of American investment dollars in Iraq.",
        "And that is sufficient at this point in terms of the swing vote, or the middle of the American electorate, which is why the president is out there selling, selling, selling on the war at the moment.",
        "NPR's senior correspondent Juan Williams joining us today from NPR member station KPLU in Seattle.",
        "Juan, thank you again.",
        "You're welcome, Alex.",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "There have been 11 Triple Crown winners since 1875 when all three of these popular stakes races, the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes, were run for the first time.",
        "That's about one every ten years, so we're definitely mathematically overdue, but horses are bred selectively these days so they're racing more against genetically similar horses and more horses are trained for speed not distance and the last Triple Crown race, the Belmont, is the longest and that's where the recent candidates have faltered.",
        "Well the hope this year is Barbaro.",
        "He won the Kentucky Derby two weeks ago.",
        "Could this horse go all the way?",
        "Oh, even money is the line right now, and the main reason is that Barbaro blew away the field at the Kentucky Derby.",
        "He won by six and half lengths, and he's never lost a race, even though he's raced in just six races, so just six times, and that may not seem like a lot, but it's not uncommon for a three year old.",
        "Just six times, having races so few times, is that considered to be an advantage or a disadvantage?"

        "Well, it depends.",
        "The horse's never raced on less than five weeks rest, but what trainers do is try to build up a horse's work regimen over time so ideally by now he's ready to go on shorter rest, and two weeks is short rest for these horses.",
        "But of course we're not going to know until the race is over whether that strategy works out.",
        "Barbaro has two main challengers, tell us about them.",
        "Well one is Brother Derrick, whom the odds maker at Pimlico Race Course lists at three to one, and the other is Sweet Northern Saint, who's at four to one.",
        "Brother Derrick is seen as the real threat.",
        "At the Kentucky Derby he had to start in the number 18 post position in a crowded field of 20 horses, that put him all the way on the outside of the track.",
        "He had to slow down a couple of times in the pack, but still he recovered to finish fourth and the feeling is he really didn't get a chance to show his full power.",
        "Stephan you said that there were 20 horses in the Kentucky Derby field but there are only nine entered in the Preakness.",
        "What's the story there?",
        "Well, the Kentucky Derby is the Kentucky Derby.",
        "Everybody wants to be there.",
        "Win it and you and your horse are stars and you're profitable, and if you don't win it, there's a lot of disincentive to come into Baltimore for the Preakness.",
        "First there are the $20,000 in race fees, there's the cost of transporting the horse.",
        "This is not a cheap sport and when there's a clear cut favorite like there is this year, some owners just cut their losses and don't bother to come.",
        "The three horses that we've mentioned are the only entries that also raced in the Kentucky Derby.",
        "Yeah, but the purse is a million dollars, isn't that enough of a lure?",
        "Well it sounds like a lot and the winner is going to get 650,000 of that, but as the Washington Post's horse writer Andrew Beyer notes in today's paper, the Preakness doesn't even make the list of the top 80 richest horse races in the world this year.",
        "The Triple Crown races, they depend on prestige to keep horses coming to all three of them, but for a lot of owners, economics dictate otherwise.",
        "Stephan perhaps it's not fair for me to ask you this, but are you a betting man?",
        "I am not a betting man actually, but when you read as much as you've read about this horse, you do think that the gap that he led, that he wound up winning with at the Kentucky Derby, does make him the prohibitive favorite here.",
        "The last two that you mentioned, Funny Cide, Smarty Jones, they also did very well at the Preakness.",
        "The Belmont was their undoing though."

        "And I think until the advent of her breaking into the world of dance, very little regard had been paid to the art form of the dance for the people from those regions.",

        "A certain largeness in her torso.",
