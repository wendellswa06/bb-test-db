        "It's more than twice as many as the number of Democrats who are planning to leave, but it's been encouraging to Democrats who are very eager to take back control of the House.",
        "But on Tuesday, Democrat Keith Ellison flipped the script.",
        "The progressive party leader from Minnesota, deputy chair of the DNC, made the surprise announcement that he will not run for re-election in his district, Minnesota's 5th.",
        "Instead, he entered the race for Minnesota attorney general.",
        "We wanted to talk to him about that and other things related to the party, and he was kind enough to come by our studios in Washington, D.C.",

        "attorney general, has said he will not defend legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act.",
        "So that's bad because if they don't defend it, then what happens?",
        "I mean, maybe it just goes down.",
        "But states attorney general led by Xavier Becerra, organized his colleagues around the country and they are the ones defending the Affordable Care Act.",

        "You know, the Trump administration is trying to inject a question that is likely to reduce reporting in compliance with the census.",

        "As I mentioned, you are already deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee, so you're already a political leader.",
        "It seems that if the Democrats do succeed in taking over the House, as they hope to do, that you would become a leader in the House as well because of your seniority.",

        "And that is very important work and I've actually done that many times.",
        "But as state attorney general, as attorney general for the state of Minnesota, I could say, you know what?",
        "What happened to you is not only not right but it's illegal, and we're not going to stand for it and do something direct and immediate.",
        "And that appeals to me.",
        "There is concern that the Democratic National Committee is still trying to figure out how to bring the Democratic Party back together after a very fractious presidential primary season.",
        "It's been reported that there are still, you know, hard feelings from the so-called Sanders wing and the so-called Clinton wing.",
        "Now we've seen this big surge of interest in running for office this year to the point where some of these Democratic primaries are so crowded that people are kind of worried that some of the party is going to cannibalize itself, and that didn't happen in California, which is what the concern, you know, was."
