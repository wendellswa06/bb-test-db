        "And in many ways, your story is a profile of a president who is himself a former Islamic rebel who's at war now with former colleagues as the head of a government that commands little more than his presidential compound.",
        "That's right.",
        "Yeah, one of my main purposes was to kind of answer the question for myself - one of my main purposes in going to Somalia was to answer the question for myself: What is power like for a president when he controls little more than the airstrip outside the capital city, his president palace and, with the help of foreign troops, the sea port?",
        "Hmm.",
        "And so I had a 10-day sort of ire on this failed state sort of at the elbow of President Sharif.",
        "It was fascinating.",

        "And it is a dismal picture you come away with, that this man who Secretary of State Clinton describes as the best hope at the moment for Somalia clearly could not survive a day, a week without the protection of the African peacekeeping troops, or -they're paid for by the United Nations.",
        "And the place would devolve again into utter anarchy.",
        "That's absolutely right.",

        "special representative for Somalia, it's a new post, to try and create something - he calls it a white zone - in Mogadishu in order to kind of create an international flag, to create a secure zone where the government can be seen to be doing something and the international community can return for the first time visibly to Mogadishu.",

        "And if they're incapable, in some cases, of stopping pirate attacks from Somalia, a thousand miles into the Indian Ocean from Somalia's shores, it follows that small boats perhaps setting forth from Pakistan or that part of the world carrying al-Qaida people for Somalia or going back and forth, might not ever be seen, might never be detected.",
        "You do recount an attack by US Forces on a man described as an al-Qaida recruiter who is killed by helicopter-borne troops.",
