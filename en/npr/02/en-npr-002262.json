        "There were many women there suffering mostly from genital urinary infections.",
        "And this is a result of poor hygiene, poverty and the fact that a very extreme form of genital - female genital circumcision is practiced in Somalia and often causes many problems for the women who suffer from it, especially nowadays, with virtually no medical treatment.",
        "So it's, you know, it's a benighted place, with, you know, with many, many people living at the very, very extreme edge of poverty.",
        "It's one of the biggest feeding programs the international community has.",
        "Many people live very precariously.",
        "And there's not much between them and death, just as was the case in the early '90s, when the first Americans went there to try to stop the starvation.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Yolanda.",
        "Thanks.",
        "And Jon Lee Anderson, I have to turn to the conclusion of your piece, which was - it goes really back to Abdulli's question about how does Somalia got the attention of the world again, and that they have found ways to get the attention of the world through the piracy that has become, as you say, a bigger problem in the Red Sea, in the Indian Ocean, and indeed the idea that al-Qaida might be able to establish a foothold there.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think, yes, Somalia's problems have kind of reached a critical mass.",
        "Clearly, the country is hemorrhaging.",
        "It's shown with its piracy - we now hear about these young boys from the Somali-American communities who have been lured back to Somalia for whatever reasons and have served as suicide bombers in a few cases, these very worrying trends.",
        "The idea that al-Qaida, maybe if very squeezed in Pakistan or Afghanistan, might decide to use Somalia - which is very receptive at the moment with the Shabaab there -as a final readout or an alternative place.",
        "And, yes, I spoke to a very interesting man, a senior former military officer and actually an Islamic scholar, who told me the following: In a kind of cynical way, Somalis often speak in parables.",
        "And this was an example.",
        "He said Allah has finally come to our rescue.",
        "We've served as a Cold War proxy battleground, as a regional battleground, and we've been in a civil war.",
        "We appealed to everyone to help us, but no one came.",
        "And so finally, we appealed to Allah.",
        "We asked him to give us oil so as to interest the Americans.",
        "Or else, we said, we need a couple of fighters from Afghanistan.",
        "So now, the Somalis have a weapon.",
        "We are a staging ground for the fight against global terrorism.",
        "After so many years, with our piracy and our jihad, we are finally able to project fear.",
        "Jon Lee Anderson's piece on the most failed state appears in the December 14th issue of the New Yorker Magazine.",
        "Jon Lee Anderson, I hope it was your idea to go there.",
        "No editor sent you, I hope.",
        "It was - no, I always wanted to go to Somalia.",
        "I don't know what it is, but I was fascinated by the place.",
        "Thanks very much for being with us today."

        "Researchers created nanofibers that will spontaneously twist into intricate braids, according to a new study in the journal Science.",
        "It only happens under certain conditions, though.",
        "The nanofibers are dunked in liquid, and as the liquid evaporates, the hairs pull together, wrapping around each other.",
        "My next guest says it's just like how dreadlocks form.",
        "And the nano-knots stay twisted, which means they could be use for energy storage or adhesives or - well, we'll find out what other kinds of uses these tangled and untangled nanoparticles might be good for.",
        "Here to tell us more about what we might do to these and how we might use these self-braiding fibers is Joanna Aizenberg.",

        "Have these braids been - like these ever been observed in nature before?",
        "In nature, yes.",
        "Nature is full of examples of spiral, braided structures, but in synthetic milieu, in experimental work, we can only produce spirals, so at least, mostly, we can produce spirals, even on very small molecular scale or on the very large scale.",
        "So, these are really tiny, little braids, nanofibers?",
        "These are very little braids.",
        "Indeed, they resemble dreadlocks, but exactly thousand times smaller."

        "So, there is nothing new there.",
        "But we decided to look at this issue and see whether we can make it curl, if we want.",
        "So, we designed them where everything about these structures is carefully controlled - their geometry, liquids that we use for assembly and how adhesive they are - and when all the parameters are chosen just right, which is not that easy, by the way, then these braids really want to have maximum contact possible, which means they curl around each other.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And is there a way to predict how it's going to - the braid's going to work before you make them curl?",
        "We're looking at it right now.",
        "And yes, indeed, it can be predicted.",
        "When one looks on this tiny interplay - very important balance between how flexible the hairs are, how adhesive these hairs and how strong is the evaporation front.",
        "So, it's like you wet something and you sort of take a hair dryer and dry it, and like, a hair forms in little knots, these things form in little knots, too?",
        "The president was on vacation in the south of the country and appeared via FaceTime on CNN Turk to call people into the streets.",
        "And they they heeded his call and flooded the streets and took over tanks and greeted him by the thousands when he flew into the airport to reassert power.",
        "There were just compelling images all night of battles taking place and competing forces battling for control - scenes I've never seen before."

        "The details were vivid enough to make a Secret Service agent blush.",

        "We found that the internet is a very handy research tool for people, but it doesn't have a lot of effect on their final choice of purchase decision when you look at items such as a cell phone, looking for a place to live, or buying music.",
        "So, if the internet isn't influencing what we buy, what, or who is?",
        "It's more about the internet as a handy tool in the journey toward buying something, but it is not the information source that has the most influence over what people buy.",
        "So, people will go online, and do a lot of research on the various features that they are considering getting on a cell phone, for instance, and that will help people illuminate irrelevant alternatives, and have a more effective shopping experience overall.",
        "But, couldn't you say, if there are finding all this information about something, doesn't that, to a certain extent, qualify as influencing their purchases?",
        "It certainly influences what people look for, but when we conducted our survey and said, where do you hear about the music you buy?",
        "People would say that they hear about music through the mainstream media, such as movies or television.",

        "I know when I am looking to buy something, you know, I will go online and I'll research things like price and quality, but there is something about going to the store, and actually seeing an object, and actually being able to touch it, you know, first hand.",
        "Does that count for other people?",
        "Is that why we are maybe waiting till we get to a store to buy?",
        "Absolutely, we found something like 80 percent of people say they prefer to see and touch a good before they buy it.",
