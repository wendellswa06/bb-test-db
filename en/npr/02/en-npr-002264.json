        "What you are going to see, though, is that a lot of defense lawyers and a lot of states are paying attention to what will happen with Romell Broom, because if they come up with a situation that's similar - where a state is taking too long or it's not working right and it's something similar to what he went through - they're going to have grounds for an appeal.",

        "And he did that so that the state prisons department could come up with another way to do this, either a backup, a system where maybe they'll inject the drug straight into bone marrow or into muscle, or maybe that will become the primary method that they'll do that by.",
        "That's a problematic approach, because if the state dramatically alters the way it puts inmates to death by injection, then, in fact, it does open itself up to legal challenges, because up until now, our system has been similar to the one that the US Supreme Court upheld.",
        "But if we change it dramatically, then it would be something that could be challenged.",
