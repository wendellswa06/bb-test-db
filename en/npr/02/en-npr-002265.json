        "That's a wonderful - it's exactly what I would like to say - that it resembles the way nature assembles things and how these affect color in butterfly wings, in beetles and in whole range of other wonderful organisms.",
        "So, let's talk about anything, any practical possibility.",
        "The fact that they - these hairs - they can twist and grip something tightly, I would imagine making them into an adhesive would be something you'd think about?",
        "That's correct.",
        "Adhesive is the first thing that we shown in our paper - that it can grab particles and stay adhered very strongly to surfaces due to this mechanical interlocking that results from this assembly.",
        "The other applications related to the fact that they change color and change optical properties.",
        "So, we will - and will certainly have a lot of research trying to control (unintelligible) properties of these structures, just like butterfly wings have all these varieties of structures and the whole gamut of colors.",
        "Now, these are - they are purely mechanical devices, right?",
        "They change mechanically.",
        "Do their electrical properties change, too?",
        "I mean, could you unravel them with an electric charge or a current or something?",
        "There is - that's a good question, and there is a possibility to that, depending which material we use to generate these hair-like structures.",
        "So, these hair-like structures can be made out of magnetic materials, so they can be then either assembled or disassembled using magnetic field.",
        "We can grab magnetic particles with them, and then, using magnetic field, remove the particles and disassembly will happen.",
        "They can be made out of a polymer, in particular electro-active polymer, then electric field can be used to affect their assembly.",
        "So, you could have maybe a storage device, permanent memory or something like that?",
        "Mechanical memory.",
        "Mechanical, yes.",
        "That's right.",
        "So, you could carry these around.",
        "Here's a question coming in from Second Life from Riada(ph) who says, do they have strength under tension or compression particularly?"

        "So, not only we are looking for applications, but we are looking for new science that can describe biological phenomena or self-assembly phenomena that hasn't been yet described.",
        "Yeah, because, you know, we usually try to steal the stuff that nature does, and we look at sponges and things like that, or we look at how self-assembly occurs in nature.",
        "You've got self-assembly here that's mechanical that you've created.",
        "And possibly find a way to interact with biology?",

        "Yeah.",
        "Usually, we take interesting lessons from biology, and they help us produce new materials.",
        "But surprisingly, we sometimes have some interesting understanding or describe a phenomenon in synthetic system that helps us understand biological systems.",
        "And this is probably that case - that it's not that we're mimicking biology, but rather having phenomenon that can potentially describe the whole range of biological features.",
        "So, where do you go from here?",
        "There is a lot of science in front of us.",
        "We would like to understand what is going on there.",
        "From there, we will, in parallel of course, try to use this approach, this new phenomenon, to control pattern formation and use it for capture-and-release systems, use it to create an efficient adhesive, use it to create tunable dynamic optical structures that change color or other optical properties at will."
