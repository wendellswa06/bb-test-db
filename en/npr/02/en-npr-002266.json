        "Indeed.",
        "And that is the economy and where it's heading, and just - I know you're not an economist specializing in this kind of question, but we must take into account, though, we - the fact that there may not be money for lots of these things.",
        "I've been thinking about that continuously.",
        "The - so, I think what got you to call me in the first place was this report from the Center for the Study of the Presidency, the panel in which I sat that was ran by Anne Soliman and Richard Meserve, the President of the Carnegie Institution.",
        "And you can roughly think about the report's recommendations in two classes, policy for science and science for policy.",
        "So (unintelligible) in the first now, policy for science, how are we going to pay for the kinds of research that we think is important, and how are we going to pay for the publicly-funded research through agencies like the National Institute of Health that will sort of be the font of innovation for biomedicine and health care.",
        "It's really a terrible quandary right now.",

        "OK, let's get into some of these questions about science and policy, and policy of science.",
        "What do you see are some of the great issues that we'll be facing in the next administration and the next Congress?",
        "Well, if we want to pivot to the issues that we deal with at the Hastings Center, basically bioethics, ethics, science and medicine.",
        "That's a long list.",
        "But let's mention a few things.",
        "Let me begin by asking why bioethics is important in the first place.",
        "My friend Nancy Gibbs from Time Magazine was visiting at the center some time ago, and you know her question was, why should anybody be interested in bioethics?",
        "I said, well, you should only be interested in it if you care about what happens at the beginning of life, at the end of life, and at many, many points along the way.",
        "So, if you'd follow me that far, then you realize that bioethics issues are particularly difficult ones politically, because they - all of them vary along two dimensions.",
        "They vary along sort of the standard, political dimension of interest - they're conflicting interests.",
        "Physicians, pharmaceutical companies, and families all have interest in the shape of health-care reform, because it will affect how much money they make, how much money they have to spend.",
        "Parents of children with juvenile diabetes care a great deal about what happens in stem-cell-research policy.",
        "Right.",
        "Not a long shot.",
        "Actually, right before the race, they were talking about him being kind of a savvy pick for the race, because everyone was focused on Barbaro.",
        "Bernardini is owned by Dubai ruler Sheikh Muhammad.",
        "He's got good bloodlines.",
        "He's sired by AP Indy(ph), who was the 1992 Horse of the Year.",
        "Ran a very good race, but tragically not many people were watching it, and not many people, you know, were really paying attention, and we never really will know how good Bernardini is, because Barbaro left the race so quickly."

        "It is definitely within the realm of possibility, because it is within easy driving distance of the place he was last seen.",
