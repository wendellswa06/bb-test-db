        "That's probably been the most important comment about science policy that at least I heard from the various campaigns, and that's been Senator Obama's proposal to sort of rebuild an American industrial economy on green technologies.",

        "These are very tough things to try to articulate, and they're extremely difficult for policy makers to understand how to think about, and how to bring into their judgment on their shaping policy.",

        "They didn't have a lot of - maybe they had a dozen people from outside of the Congress people, their families and their senior staff.",

        "But the fact that he's on a committee that has jurisdiction over this, and nobody had ever explained that to him was a little frightening.",
        "The setting, because it was private, no reporters there, enabled him to ask an embarrassing question that he otherwise might have, you know, never asked.",
        "We need more settings like that.",

        "So there was something that was out there.",
