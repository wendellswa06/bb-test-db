        "Do you put in basic research?",
        "Those are very difficult questions of judgment and value.",
        "During the last debate, Senator Obama and McCain differed, I think the first time I'd ever heard it spoken so succinctly about health care, whether it should be a right or it should be an imperative.",
        "You know, should it be something you have a right to or something that is something a company can decide to give you one.",
        "Yeah, I think the question was framed, is healthcare a privilege, the right or an obligation?",
        "And Senator McCain answered, an obligation.",
        "Senator Obama answered, a right, and then told the very touching story of his mother dying of cancer and fighting with insurance companies.",
        "Americans have struggled with this for a long time.",
        "In the early, around 1983 I think, it was, that was 25 years ago, there was a presidential bioethics commission that started under Carter, but finished under Reagan.",
        "So, by the time the final report which is (unintelligible), access to health care was written.",
        "The commissioners themselves were overwhelmingly Reagan Republicans.",
        "They nonetheless said that all Americans - America as a society has an obligation to make sure that all Americans had access to needed health care.",
        "That was a pretty radical statement for that time.",
        "And it slipped unnoticed into the world, and no one has acted on it since.",
        "But I think quite frankly between that kind of genuine deep social obligation to provide each other with health care and calling it a right, is not a great deal of difference.",
        "There was a bill, and we're going to talk about this in another program, but there was a bill that was passed last week amid the bailout bill that requires doctors and the health-care system to treat mental illness on the par with physical illness."
