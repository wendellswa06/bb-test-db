        "As NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, it's causing a lot of uncertainty.",
        "It's either much ado about not much or it's the thing that will stop tens, maybe hundreds of thousands of foreclosures cold.",
        "Banks claim the problem that has caused them to suspend much of their foreclosure activity is nothing more than a minor procedural error: someone in charge of handling loans signed affidavits saying they had reviewed the documents when in fact they had relied on other people to do the work.",
        "They claim that they haven't found any substantive problems in the loans they have reviewed so far.",
        "But is that really the case?",
        "Maybe, says Ronald Mann, a law professor at Columbia University.",
        "The volume of mistakes is impossible to assess from the outside.",
        "The crucial issue is whether the sloppiness that tripped up the banks is just the tip of the iceberg.",
        "If so, it might call into question the validity of perhaps hundreds of thousands of foreclosures.",
        "And if that's the case, Mann says, we as a country are, you might say, in a house of pain."

        "I think it poses a risk for banks that will have sold homes that they perhaps didn't actually own.",
        "For the sake of argument, let's say it doesn't unfold that way, that most of the suspended foreclosures will stand.",
        "In that case, much of the doomsday scenario goes away.",
        "But it doesn't mean the process goes unaffected.",
        "I think it's likely that these investigations are going to slow foreclosures even after any moratorium ends, largely because judges are likely to be more skeptical than they have been in the past about the propriety of the way that banks have handled their paperwork.",
        "More delays means delinquent homeowners might be able to stay in their homes longer.",
        "Meanwhile, pending sales of foreclosed homes face potential limbo.",
        "And that, according to Rick Sharga, does not bode well for a housing market that is still trying to recover.",

        "The goal of our research was to use SharkCam to see what these sharks do when they disappear into deep water and also what they do at night, you know, which is a really tough time to study the behavior of animals, particularly if they're in the ocean.",
        "And the SharkCam did its job.",
        "We saw that the sharks were almost in a catatonic state.",

        "No one had ever witnessed that type of behavior from a shark before, even though the constant movement makes it hard to definitively prove that the shark was sleeping.",
        "It's almost impossible for us to actually determine whether it was napping, whether it was sleeping or just going into kind of a resting state where it's slowed down perhaps its metabolic rate, it's slowed down its swimming movement.",
        "It went to a bare minimum in terms of keeping itself alive.",

        "What are the numbers at MIT in terms of percentage of tenured faculty that are African-American and percentage of adjuncts or associate faculty?",
        "Well, we have about 950 faculty and about 50 - I believe 54 are under-represented members of the faculty.",
        "Now, that's a number we'd like to be a lot larger, but it's pretty comparable to our peer research institutions.",
        "So if I'm getting this correctly, out of 900 odd, you have 54, which means that you have seven percent or less that are minority not just African-Americans.",
        "So what do you think the figure is for African-Americans?",
        "Let's see.",
        "The African-American number - I'd have to get back to you on.",
        "But I would say it's roughly half that number.",
        "But if only 30 percent of professors get tenure, and tenure is basically like being given the keys to the kingdom for life, if you only have 54 professors - period - tenured or nontenured, you've got a very small pool that can even be considered for tenure.",
        "Is that not correct?",
        "Well, the pool who can be considered for tenure is refreshed regularly.",
        "In the period since Professor Sherley's case was reviewed, we've tenured three minority faculty and we have hired one from the outside with tenure.",
        "So we certainly would like to have tenured more but we have been working on this issue with great energy, and with some success.",
        "We are very proud of the cases we've brought in and we are working harder to do more.",
        "And we have announced a race initiative, which is the effort to redouble our efforts in this regard.",
        "So let's move on to Sherley - Professor Sherley, and embryonic stem cell research.",
        "Does his opposition to this factor into the equation of his not getting tenure?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "We are very particular about not judging facts with numbers based on their particular point of view on a controversial matter.",
        "But I can assure you that Professor Sherley is not the only faculty member who has this particular view on the stem cell issue.",
        "In fact, there are probably 10 other faculty members who would share his view, both tenured and untenured."
