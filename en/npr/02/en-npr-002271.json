        "This idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc, it's not new.",
        "What's different this year is the ongoing debate in the Democratic Party about whether its focus on people of color in 2016 came at the expense of the white, working-class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters in 2020.",
        "To Michelle Neely, it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters.",

        "Every election cycle, no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to affect their chances of being re-elected.",
        "If black women had a choice - if we had a stronger voice, this would actually be an urgent issue.",

        "But these women also talked about education and, like many other voters, the cost of health.",
        "More than anything, Rabiah Burks resented the implication that it's a zero-sum game, that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote.",
        "You have to show up to the community every now and then and say, hey, I'm with you or something.",
        "Like, if all of your resources and all of your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you, then you make the other group feel like they're not even worth being heard.",
        "This is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic Party about the idea of identity politics, so I reached out to California Congresswoman Barbara Lee.",
        "Right now, she's making her own bid to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress.",
        "I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted.",
        "It's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it.",
        "And I think that's part of the problem.",
        "They take us for granted.",
        "And over the years, it's been up and down, up and down.",
        "But for the most part, I don't believe that - until now at least - there's been a recognition of the value of African-American women, not only to the Democratic Party but to the country.",
        "Is there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this voter bloc more seriously?",
        "I think, in this moment, we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia.",
        "African-American women led the effort to, you know, make sure that we won both of those races.",
        "And so black women have decided that, you know, no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others.",
        "In this instance this year, we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices.",
        "And that's a major breakthrough.",

        "What are black women getting out of voting for Democrats?",
        "We definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it.",
        "Well, black women - I tell you, voting for Democrats - first of all, look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of the Republicans.",
        "But when you look at the policies that the Democrats champion - right now especially, as it relates to education, health care, housing, reducing the cost of prescription drugs, it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone, especially African-American women, as it relates to pre-existing conditions.",
        "Who has these pre-existing conditions disproportionately?",
        "It's African-American men and women.",
        "And so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic Party, why we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all, that's our agenda.",
        "And that's our platform.",
        "When you look at the Republicans, they're just the opposite.",
        "And so you know, as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat, I'm trying to make our party more responsive, more inclusive and more progressive.",
        "And that will help African-American women achieve parity, equity and justice in this country, as it will for everyone.",

        "Well, the CBC is a separate entity from the CBC PAC.",

        "Last August, we went looking for it with the help of a company called Williamson Associates with side scan sonar.",
        "And what that does is you drag it along at the bottom of the ocean - it's almost a mile down and it shows up on a monitor, sort of a blips on the monitor.",
        "And the blips gave us a pretty good clue because it was almost exactly where we predicted it should be.",
        "And then what we did this year is we went back again in August and this time we went with an ROV, which is a remote operated vehicle, but basically it's a camcorder, and videotaped and took digital photographs of the target that we found last year.",
