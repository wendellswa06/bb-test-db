        "They are excavating, as we speak, a few blocks from here a huge cavern right under Grand Central Station.",
        "How do they do that all without damaging the foundation of the busy city above?",
        "How do they do it without cutting electric cables, water mains, sewer pipes?",
        "The president has vowed to replace the catch-and-release system with something he calls the catch-and-return system, particularly those who are immigrants who come here from countries other than Mexico.",
        "If you do indeed beef up enforcement, where are you going to put all the people who are intercepted at the border?",
        "As I understand, there's not enough detention space, not enough detention employees at this point.",
        "Well, there are a couple of elements.",
        "One is, of course, 85% of the people that we do catch coming across the border are Mexicans and we are usually able to return those to Mexico within less than 24 hours.",
        "For the balance, it's going to be a mixture of reducing the amount of time it takes to send people back to their home country and also some additional beds and personnel.",
        "Now, one of the things the president has requested is additional money so we can ultimately get the number of detention beds up to between 27,000 and 28,000 next fiscal year.",
        "We've also been successful in cutting the average time it takes to send people back home from about 66 days to about 21 days.",
        "And you can look at that in a way as tripling the number of beds because the less time people spend in a bed, the more beds become available for new detainees.",
        "Working all of these elements, I think we're confident that even with the increased apprehensions, we can complete the job of moving from catch-and-release to catch-and-return.",
        "You know the folks who actually work along the border are somewhat skeptical.",
        "The head of the Border Patrol Council, the group that actually represents the Border Patrol agents that work along the border, said that there is a sense among the rank and file that this is \"\"smoke and mirrors.",
        "Well you know I have to say that the people I've talked to at the border, the working Border Patrol agents, seem enthusiastic about the additional Border Patrol we're looking to put on the border.",
        "They're enthusiastic about the technology and the equipment we're rolling out on the border.",
        "You can always find anonymous people to be critical or some people who are going to disagree.",
        "It's hard to say this is smoke and mirrors.",
        "This is literally billions of dollars in well thought out, proven technology and people resources that are going to make a huge difference in terms of what we can deploy at the border."

        "But right now you are throwing quite a bit of money at the border and in this world of limited resources in Washington what are you going to have to cut in order to pay for this?",

        "We've built into the budget for next year additional enhanced resources for the border.",
        "So I mean, this is not a question of adding a huge amount of additional resources, it's rather a question of taking what the president has asked for, having Congress give the president that money, and then having us roll out the program.",

        "We'll also hear about how long it takes for immigrants to become financially successful in this country.",
        "But first we're going to Capitol Hill, where the Senate is making a second attempt to pass an immigration bill.",
        "Here's NPR's David Welna.",

        "The Isakson amendment would essentially gut the sense of our comprehensive immigration reform bill because we would not be able to deal with that reality and we would not be able to deal with the guest worker program that the President of the United States is proposing.",
        "The Isakson amendment was defeated 55 to 40.",
        "Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions, who backed the losing amendment, conceded this was a test vote.",
