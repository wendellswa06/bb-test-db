        "(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)",
        "And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.",
        "In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in.",
        "Very nice.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "There's 46 of them.",
        "They're called the indefinite detainees, or, as we call them, the forever prisoners.",
        "People who the panels and the taskforce of the Obama administration concluded are the enemy, are dangerous but not necessarily guilty of a crime.",
        "And we're holding them kind of as war prisoners.",
        "And what happens to them is case by case they'll get review, and that they will have the opportunity to argue that they're not the enemy.",
        "And there's these parole panels just getting started in which the forever prisoner and his lawyer, if he has one, can go before a representative of the Pentagon, the Justice Department, Homeland Security, the State Department and make an argument.",
        "And they can conceivably get off that forever prisoner list but it's a long, slow process.",
        "And those are the people who they would most like to move to the United States because those are the people who will be the hardest to get out of Guantanamo any other way.",
        "Do you get a sense from those who work there and work on detainee issues that this is a prison that's on its way to closing down?",
        "Is that the expectation?",
        "No.",
        "When you go to Guantanamo - and I go about once a month - there's really no sign that this is going out of business any time soon.",
        "It's an unpopular mission.",
        "The soldiers have rotations lined up through, I don't know how many years out, and they have built a sprawling infrastructure of prison camps and dining facilities and headquarters.",
        "And you come and go and there really is no sign that anyone there thinks that this is the last month or the last year of the detention center complex.",
        "Carol Rosenberg.",
        "She covers military affairs for the Miami Herald.",
        "Carol, thanks so much for talking with us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf has returned home after four years of self-imposed exile in Dubai and London.",
        "Security was unusually tight as he arrived at Karachi Airport today.",
        "The Pakistani Taliban has issued threats to kill the former president.",
        "And a Pakistani court has named Musharraf for possible involvement in the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.",
        "Joining us now from Islamabad is NPR's Julie McCarthy.",

        "So, why now?",
        "Why is Musharraf ending his self-imposed exile and returning home?",
        "Well, it's in the hope of returning to power and by capturing the election, which was just declared for May 11th.",
        "Musharraf, who's 69, told a crowd at the airport today, \"\"I got orders from the people of Pakistan to come and save Pakistan.\"\" Now, people who know him well say he's deeply homesick, but some columnists here and a lot of journalists and observers of the scene in Pakistan are calling his return politically naive, perhaps egomaniacal.",
        "And they wonder aloud whether this isn't a man's personal battle against irrelevance, against the idea that his day has come and gone.",
        "As we mentioned, he's been in self-imposed exile.",
        "But remind us, Julie, why he left Pakistan in 2008 in the first place.",
        "Well, he accumulated a lot of power and he accumulated a lot of enemies by overreaching with that power.",
        "He jailed political activists.",
        "He removed members of the judiciary, including Supreme Court justices.",
        "He was vilified by militants for joining the U.S.",
        "war on terror after September 11th.",
        "He declared a state of emergency to reassert some of his fading powers, and then the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in 2007, as you mentioned, turned public opinion even more decisively against him.",
        "His party lost parliamentary elections to his enemies - that would be Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party - and her widower, Asif Ali Zardari, formed the new government that threatened Musharraf with impeachment.",
        "So, he went into exile, formed his own party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, but most independent analysts view it as politically marginal.",
        "He has posted bail in the main legal cases against him, which has cleared the way for his return.",
        "Julie, is he going to be met with a different kind of Pakistan than the one he left?",
        "I mean, after all, Pakistan did just mark something unusual in its history, right?",
        "An elected president served an entire term.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "And that's the frame in which this thing has to be seen.",
        "For the first time in 65 years of its history, a democratically elected government has just completed its five-year term.",
        "It's seen as a watershed for this place.",
        "And so this is a different Pakistan from the one Musharraf left.",
        "And there is a huge mountain for him to climb as a result of that.",
        "Now, plenty of Pakistanis took issue with the government of President Asif Al Zardari, whose term has just ended.",
        "It was mired in corruption scandals and allegations of malfeasance and graft and openly fought with the Supreme Court.",
        "But flaws and all, Rachel, Pakistanis like determining their own leaders.",
        "And while they may feel patriotic about their army, they don't want to be governed by it.",
        "And though he's now a civilian, Musharraf's legacy is as a military dictator.",
        "So, is he popular at all, Julie?",
        "I mean, how much support does he really have in the army or among business leaders or just the general population?",
        "Well, I think the best way to answer that is by way of a comparison.",
        "Musharraf was greeted not by throngs of supporters today.",
        "It was not an overwhelming presence of people, more in the hundreds of people.",
        "What was overwhelming is the comeback of sorts for Imran Khan, the cricket star-turned-politician here.",
        "He ignited a huge crowd in Lahore yesterday of some 80,000 people.",
        "Storms rolled in, cut his speech short, but even the foul weather didn't dampen the enthusiasm of the crowd - many of them young, who were on their feet when Imran Khan told them I'll always tell you the truth, I'll establish the supremacy of law, I won't have property and bank accounts abroad, no nepotism in my government.",
        "So, Musharraf's been gone for four years, and by the sound of it Pakistan has moved on.",
        "For many Pakistanis, he is seen as yesterday's man, and that's not how the youth of Pakistan views Imran Khan, for example.",
        "So, that's the reality that Musharraf finds himself in the run-up to the May election.",
        "NPR's Julie McCarthy speaking to us from Islamabad, Pakistan.",
        "Julie, thanks so much.",

        "In the old days, they just used - they blasted it out with dynamite?",
        "Well, I think Michael's answer that they need money is the best one.",
        "That's always been true.",
        "The original subways were really built by hand.",
        "They used dynamite, but there were people using picks and shovels.",
        "They had almost no mechanized equipment like we would think of today, bulldozers.",
        "It was remarkably labor-intensive.",
        "And I think that's probably the biggest change to today.",
        "Michael, you agree?",
        "Well, partially.",
        "The subways of the past were primarily what we will call today cut and cover.",
        "That means we cut a channel into the street, and then we end up building the walls, and it's irrelevant for the moment how we - what was done, it was done by hand, and the material used was concrete, was cast iron, whatever way it was done.",
        "But it was done by cutting channels into the street.",
        "I have, in the lobby of my office, pictures of the building of the IRT along Broadway, in which there are two huge channels to the left and right, where the roadways are today, with total disregard of what happened to pedestrian traffic, to people living in adjacent buildings or anything.",
        "That thing is a thing of the past.",
        "What we have today is - the biggest difference is that, number one, we have to build in a much denser urban setting, in which we upset many more people than before, people that now look at the environmental impacts that were - at the beginning of the 20th century were really - they existed, but people did not know what they were called, so therefore they didn't complain.",
        "And today we have - the biggest difference is we have what is known as a tunnel boring machine.",
        "That means we can actually bore tunnels at a much greater depth than before in a mechanical fashion.",
        "That means we can advance much faster than we would have done it in the past, when we actually needed to shoot and blast.",
        "That means we put dynamite, blasted it, hauled it out and then repeated that over and over again.",
        "So this machine is like - I've seen pictures of it.",
        "It's like a giant disk that rotates and cuts through the rock.",
        "Right.",
        "The front of the machine is a 200-ton disk that cuts through the rock.",
        "Now, there are various types of machines, but to make it simple, the one that is being used primarily now, in rock, has lateral grips.",
        "Think of it as some shoes that press against - like a brake that presses against the sides of the tunnel.",
        "That keeps the machine in place.",
