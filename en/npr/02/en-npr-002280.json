        "When the subway - when New York subway was being developed in the 1890s, electric power was just about five or six years old.",
        "And so the chief engineer goes over to London.",

        "We found out that Second Avenue, on the west side of Second Avenue, the rock is relatively okay.",
        "But it precipitously falls towards the East River.",
        "So there is a location.",
        "There is a spot, there is a stretch, in around 92nd and 91st Street where the ground, the rock is totally fragmented, we have lots of water.",
        "And there's a fear is that if we go there and we go with a TBM, we will not be able to go through without the potential collapse.",
        "So what we have done is to introduce long pipes that go down about 90 feet or so.",

        "That when you freeze ground, the freeze and thaw cycles tend to actually move the ground up and down, and this is something that you do not want to do to the buildings surrounding it.",
        "Yeah.",
