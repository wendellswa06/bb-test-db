        "Because I think that if we talk about building subways, there is - in 1901, people decided that in order to make proper provision for the large number of electric cables and gas and water pipes and sewers which lie beneath the streets of the city, they were going to create a gallery alongside of the tunnel -the rapid transit subway, to place these utilities, so one would never have to dig again.",
