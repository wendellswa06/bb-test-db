        "So does that mean there will be no more trivial fights about crowd size, Ivanka's fashion line or \"\"Saturday Night Live\"\"?",
        "If so, this speech will have marked the long-awaited pivot to a more presidential President Trump.",
        "That's NPR's Mara Liasson reporting there.",
        "NPR's Scott Detrow is still in our studios here in Washington.",
        "And Scott, let's check a couple of facts.",
        "First, the president described the murder rate and correctly cited a statistic I believe that he's gotten wrong again and again and again.",
        "What was it?",
        "Yeah, many times President Trump has said the murder rate is the highest it's been in 45, 47 years.",
        "Now, that is not the case.",
        "False.",
        "What he said last night was that the year-to-year increase from 2015 to 2016 was the highest in many years.",
        "That is the true - that is true.",
        "But it's kind of a forest-trees situation.",
        "While the year-to-year uptick went up, by and large, the United States still has a far lower rate than it did several decades ago.",
        "OK - but correctly citing the statistic there.",
        "Second, the president cited a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the high cost of immigration.",
        "What does the study say?",
        "Well, in the typical intersection of academics and politics, several sides are claiming it and saying it proves their point.",
        "President Trump said that the immigration system costs American taxpayers billions.",
        "The study said first-generation immigrants do cost state and federal government a lot of money but that second-generation immigrants are among the strongest contributors and that, big picture, immigration does help the American economy.",
        "OK - so a question of the frame that you're in.",
        "So Scott, let's talk about how the Democrats responded to this address.",
        "This is what happens - one party's president gives an address.",
        "The opposing party puts up a person to give a countermessage.",
        "Steve Beshear, former governor of Kentucky, was tapped for that task..."

        "But what did he say?",
        "What was his message last night?",
        "A lot of what he talked about - as a governor of a red state, Kentucky, he presided over a state that embraced Obamacare.",
        "So he was making the pragmatic case that Democrats are trying to make, saying this is a system that's done a lot of good.",
        "It's gotten a lot of people the health care they need, and we need to keep part of it.",
        "So that was a big part of his response.",
        "And - which was really interesting because - I mean, Beshear is a 72-year-old...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...White guy...",

        "They are doubling down on the issue of Obamacare and how they can save it.",
        "And I think he played a symbolic role, talking as somebody who helped put the system in place in a state where he said it had benefits.",
        "But I think there's also - I mean, that says something about the Democratic Party right now and the state that they're in that they pick somebody who's not in office.",
        "And, you know, I was just at a big Democratic meeting - the DNC meeting this weekend, and their keynote speaker was Jason Kander, who lost the election last year.",
        "So Democrats do not have many success stories...",
        "Yeah.",

        "Counting approximately from Teddy Roosevelt right to the present day, Americans have liked to link their presidents with the West, with Westerns, with big cowboy hats.",
        "It's a kind of merger of two myths, the leader of the Western world and the Wild West.",

        "And it's those characteristics, I think, that draw people to the cowboy ideal, the cowboy image.",
        "Its appeal is especially strong during periods of national crisis and trauma, whether it'd be war or depression, because cowboys appeal to strength, stability and core values.",

        "In fact, the term \"\"cowboy culture at the White House\"\" came up in the campaign from Democrats who were describing something that, you know, is not exactly myth making.",
        "Well, one has to remember that from World War II on virtually every American president has been criticized, particularly in the foreign media, as being cowboys: reckless, dangerous, juvenile.",
