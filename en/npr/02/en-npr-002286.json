        "I mean, it would be easy, like the Hitler diaries, to you know, fake an autobiography by someone who's dead, but what were the odds that Howard Hughes, who had really not spoken to anyone in 15 years, would actually do a live, telephone news conference to debunk this?",
        "I mean, I'm sure Clifford Irving probably felt pretty safe in trying to perpetrate that without Howard Hughes actually coming out and saying it was a fake.",
