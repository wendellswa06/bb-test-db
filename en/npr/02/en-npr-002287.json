        "Thank you very much.",
        "We were just talking with Gregory Gilderman, who compiled one instance after another of the news media being duped.",
        "Why do they, we, keep falling for this?",
        "Well, we do look like morons on occasion, I must confess.",
        "On occasion?",
        "But look - well, on occasion.",
        "I mean, it does seem like this happens more often than it used to just a few short years ago.",
        "Look, people who want to fool journalists have learned what the weak spot is in the media defense system, and it's live cable television, because you're watching these stories unfold and because the default setting seems to be throw up the pictures on the air - at least if they're sexy enough - and we'll try to gather the facts in the meantime.",
        "We saw that, of course, most dramatically with the balloon story.",
        "People have learned how to do that, whereas it's, I think, a little harder - not impossible - but a little harder to fool a newspaper, which has, say, eight or nine or 10 hours to assemble a story and actually check it out.",
        "You often write about how politicians manipulate the media to achieve their ends.",
        "The Balloon Boy instance seems like one good example of lay people, civilians, learning to manipulate the media in exactly the same way.",
        "Although I don't know that I'd call Richard Heene a complete civilian in this regard, since he had been on �Wife Swap� and clearly was sort of - had this very strong urge to be on television again.",

        "But, you know, he obviously was clever enough to figure out that if he concocted this story and he sent this balloon up in the air, and, you know, it was - the pictures were very compelling, that everybody in the world would go live with it.",
        "Now, I'm not going to come down too hard on the cable networks in this particular instance.",
        "I have criticized them for falling for the runaway bride story and numerous other instances where we kind of shot first and asked questions later.",
        "But the authorities in Colorado were taking this seriously.",
        "They had what they considered to be a criminal report that there was or might be a kid aboard, and I've got to tell you, I was in two different offices during those two heart-wrenching hours, and everybody was gathered around the TV watching this.",
        "It would have been awfully hard for any producer, for any television executive to say, you know what?",
        "We don't have all the facts here.",
        "Let's just breakaway and we'll come back when we've got this nailed down.",
        "So I cut them a little slack during those two hours, although not afterward.",
        "Right.",
        "So afterward, the balloon landed, the boy was not in it and rather than saying hey, what these people want is media attention, let's go someplace else, everyone was fighting to have the family on the air.",
        "Especially once we learned - because it was a couple more hours before we learned, you know, had the kid fallen out, where was he, that he had never left the house in Colorado.",
        "At that point, you know, you could just hear the journalistic adrenaline flowing because we had had what seemed to be a dramatic kind of happy-ending story because nobody was killed.",
        "And now it was like, why did they do this?",
        "What's their motivation?",
        "Let's send bookers to their home.",
        "And so suddenly, you know, a few hours after supposedly learning that their six-year-old son was alive, the Heene family is sitting in front of the cameras, first on �Larry King Live� and then, you know, what was 5 o'clock in the morning Colorado time the next morning doing the CBS, ABC, NBC.",
        "And the most sickening thing here - and I'm sure most of your listeners have seen this - was watching this poor kid, who obviously had been put up to this by the parents, you know, throw up first on �Good Morning America� and then on the �Today Show.� I mean, you couldn't ask for a more dramatic rendering of why this was wrong, and it made me feel sick to my stomach that all these shows were rushing to exploit this story when it was no longer life-and-death story.",
        "It was just a story about weird people who do weird things.",

        "Hi.",
        "I wanted to get your guest's take on the Charles Stuart hoax in Boston, which actually took place a little bit before on the explosion of cable news.",
        "In 1990, Charles Stuart called state police on his car phone and said he and his pregnant wife had been shot - robbed and shot by an unidentified black man who was waiting for them in their car.",
        "And come to find out, you know, the whole thing was a hoax, even though all of Boston kind of shut down as people looked for this unidentified black man.",
        "And then six weeks later Charles Stuart jumped to his death after he found out his brother was going to go to police and talk about his complicity in this particular event.",

        "I happen to be familiar with it, because it was featured in one of the books I've written.",
        "And so that was very different, because that story was driven by the Boston Globe and the Boston Herald.",
        "It was, I mean, there was still CNN, but it was not the era of local tabloid crime stories going national, as is so common today - another thing I'm critical of, by the way.",
        "But now, the Immigration Minister's line is so tough that the public is starting to say, now isn't that a little bit unfair and is it really going to work in the end?",
        "But there, the difference between this and the balloon saga, for example, is that you had the police and you had prosecutors leaking night and day, it seemed like, the notion that there was some unidentified black man who had killed this poor woman who - and that was the account that Charles Stuart had given, as well.",
        "And so all the stories that were written came from unnamed sources from the authorities and - who obviously were trying to show that they were on the case, they were doing their job.",
        "And that just like, perhaps, the Richard Jule incident, the Atlanta Olympics bombing in 1996, shows that another flaw in the journalistic system is being too willing to take these leaks from police, detectives and prosecutors who aren't willing - to go on the record and to publish them almost as if they were fact and sometimes to blacken the reputations of people involved who may, in some instances, turn out to be innocent.",
        "Anne, thanks for the call.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You know, Howard Kurtz, it occurs to me, talking about the Charles Stuart story, there was a similar case in South Carolina.",
        "Susan Smith was a woman who said that her kids had been abducted by a black man, and it later turned out she had drowned them.",
        "Are the media too quick to believe stories about black men run wild?",
        "It seems to be a theme in so many of these hoaxes.",
        "I think so.",
        "I think there's a racial aspect here.",
        "In the case of the runaway bride, Jennifer Wilbanks, she said she had been abducted by a couple of Hispanic guys.",
        "That turned out to be completely fictional.",
        "She was just ducking out of her own wedding.",
        "But in those cases, unlike when you have, you know, the undeniable drama of a helium balloon racing across the sky at 10,000 feet, there was no compelling reason for any news organization to run with an unsubstantiated report about black guys and Hispanic guys or white guys, for that matter, being involved in some alleged crime without any evidence, without any police spokesman confirming it on the record, without any arrest warrant, without any search warrant.",
        "And it just shows, you know, it's a hypercompetitive business.",
        "Everybody wants to be first.",
        "It's a juicy story.",
        "And so, in too many instances, somebody goes with it and the rest of the pack follows because, well, you know, it was in the Boston Globe.",
        "It must be true.",
        "And there, I think, you know, holding off until we have something confirmed would be the wiser course.",
        "But unfortunately, that's not always the case.",
        "We're talking about the greatest hoaxes of all time.",

        "That is an interesting question.",
        "I'm a big Twitter fan, and I learn a lot from Twitter and I offer my thoughts on there in 140 characters or less.",
        "And certainly, I have seen rumors spread on Twitter, or just things that were unconfirmed about the Iranian street demonstrations and otherwise.",
        "So you have to take it for what it is.",
        "But it does tell you something about 21st century communications that even if something doesn't make it to cable news or the newspapers or even the blogs, anybody can dash off a message and have it read by other people on Twitter.",
        "And sometimes you have to be cautious at the same time.",
        "I've seen instances where people have used Twitter - and social networking services like it, Facebook and others - to knock down reports that the media may have floated because they live in the area and they may know something about it.",
        "So it can be a bit of a double-edged sword.",
        "And speaking of the cable news networks, you've been covering the media for the Post since 1990.",

        "All journalists, as well as the viewers, get to follow stories in real time, and that can be very valuable.",

        "I think it's not a sense of self aggrandizement, which is seen as a (unintelligible), but more along the lines of just trying to get a political ideology forward that's going to change people's minds, or at least have people take another look at something that might be more (unintelligible).",
