        "Today, the Senate Armed Services Committee learned that the U.S.",
        "commander in Afghanistan would like 10,000 more.",
        "Well, if you served in Afghanistan or Iraq, give us a call.",
        "What will it take?",
        "Our phone number 800-989-8255, e-mail is talk@npr.org.",

        "Good to be with you, Neal.",
        "And you famously said Afghanistan is a conflict we cannot kill or capture our way to victory in.",
        "Why do we need more troops?",
        "Well, we need more troops to provide the security together with our Afghan and coalition partners so that a variety of other tasks can also be performed.",
        "You have to provide security for the people.",
        "They have to be with you, in a sense.",
        "You have to be seen to serve them.",
        "And we cannot achieve that threshold of security that's necessary to make the progress in terms of governance of the provision of basic services of improving their basic quality of life without indeed having the additional forces on the ground.",
        "And that sounds very similar to the principles that you applied in Iraq that the first - the first priority had to be to protect the people.",
        "Is that right?",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "In fact, in the guidance that we issued then, the very first words were that we had to secure and serve the people and to be seen by the way, by the people to be doing that.",
        "In Afghanistan, it's almost even more important because it's a country that has never taken kindly to those who would be conquerors, if you will, or outsiders.",
        "So we have to be very sensitive to that.",
        "And you have to have a nuanced appreciation of the differences between Afghanistan and Iraq when applying lessons that we did learn in Iraq over time and applied there.",
        "And as we now shift our focus in many respects to Afghanistan and also to helping the Pakistani military with their effort.",
        "Two very different countries however: Iraq more populous, a much more urban country than Afghanistan, which is nearly twice its size, obviously extremely mountainous, very rugged.",
        "Well, you're exactly right.",
        "In fact, I gave a speech here in Washington at the U.S.",
        "Institute of Peace a couple of months ago that pointed out specifically all the differences between Afghanistan and Iraq.",
        "And in fact, cautioned that we not, in a rote manner, apply what we learned in Iraq, in Afghanistan.",
        "Having said that, many of the basic principles, as you noted, do necessarily obtain.",
        "And the first of these again comes back to the provision of security for the people.",
        "One difference - another difference is that, the forces against which you're battling in Afghanistan appear to have pretty much of a safe sanctuary across the border in Pakistan.",
        "And many questioned the dedication of Pakistan's government to eradicating those forces.",
        "Well, you're right.",
        "There is no question but that there are safe havens and sanctuaries, areas particularly in the federally administered tribal areas of the rugged Western border region of Pakistan.",
        "Also then down and their farther west region in Baluchistan, south of Afghanistan.",
        "And in these areas indeed this so-called syndicate - that term that General McKiernan, the commander of the NATO forces in Afghanistan, uses to describe the group of al-Qaida and the other extremist allies that they have there together with the Afghan Taliban."

        "All of whom can cause serious problems and do cause serious problems in Afghanistan.",
        "And so there's no question but that the Pakistani military, and really the whole of the Pakistani government, has to take action.",
        "Now this is important not just for the effort in Afghanistan, this is important to Pakistan because as they increasingly recognize the leaders there, the most important existential threat - the most important threat to Pakistan's very existence is these internal extremists.",
        "It's not India anymore, their traditional enemy against whom they have a huge number of military forces arrayed.",
        "And as they shift their own intellectual focus and go through a process almost similar to what our military did several years ago when we transitioned from the focus on conventional military operations, sort of the Desert Storm Model if you will, to one that looked at complex counter-insurgency operations still having offense and defense but now a very substantial component of stability and support operations - that is a very wrenching transformation.",

        "Well, the timing is a good question, but he's been speaking about this issue since he came into office.",
        "You know, a president gives a prime time speech when he thinks it could make a difference and let's think about the political context we've got right now.",
        "The Senate is taking up the issue this week, trying to reach a compromise on a guest worker program.",
        "The president, I think, may see this as a brief window before the midterm election year really heats up and so the White House decided this could be the moment to try to fight hard for a compromise and reach out to some of those lawmakers who are standing in the way, especially during this election year.",
        "If you make the move to tighten security, at least the White House hopes, and you give some conservative House members something they can go out and talk about on the campaign trail, they hope is that some of these lawmakers may be open at some point to a compromise once a bill goes to conference.",
        "And how much of a difference does the White House think that this issue might make in trying to get those conservatives back?",
