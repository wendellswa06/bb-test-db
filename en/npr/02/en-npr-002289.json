        "Congress in the driver's seat on driver's licenses.",
        "In Washington this week, senators and members of the House are working on an agreement to require that before anyone gets a license to drive in any state in this country that they first prove that they are here legally, a citizen or a legal resident.",
        "Joining us now to talk about this issue is NPR congressional correspondent Brian Naylor.",
        "Brian, welcome back to the show, and give us a little background on this dispute.",
        "This comes out of the 9-11 Commission's report last year on its investigation, yes?",
        "Hi, Alex.",
        "That's right.",
        "The report found that a number of those involved in the 9/11 plot were here in the country with expired visas, and some of them had obtained valid US driver's licenses.",
        "And one of the groups that's supporting this what's called Real ID Act has a blown-up placard of Mohamed Atta's Florida driver's license that it posts at every news conference.",
        "And so the backers say what they're doing is simply implementing one of the recommendations that driver's license requirements be tightened up to make sure that people here illegally can't obtain them.",
        "But this proposal, it didn't actually make it into the law that was passed late last year in response to the report from the 9-11 Commission.",
        "Correct.",
        "One of the reasons was because senators objected.",
        "This provision is the brainchild of James Sensenbrenner, who is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, a Republican from Wisconsin.",
        "And he tried to insert it in that bill that implemented some of those recommendations.",
        "The Senate said, `Well, wait a minute, you know.",
        "We haven't had any hearings on this, we haven't really talked about how this would all play out.'",
        "In the end, Sensenbrenner was forced to withdraw that provision with the promise from leadership in Congress that he would get another chance; the next must-pass bill would contain it.",
        "Here we are today, the next must-pass bill is an appropriations measure, a spending measure that would fund the military for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and so he's attached it onto this.",
        "Senators are saying once again, `Well, jeez, we still haven't had any hearings on this yet.",
        "The Senate has never taken this bill up at all.",
        "Nonetheless, it is on the bill and it will be on the final conference report that comes out this week.",
        "So it looks as though this definitely is going to pass and will pass this week.",
        "It's going to change our lives when we go to the DMV to get a license?",
        "Well, it may well.",
        "In fact, the opponents say that this is going to create havoc at driver's license bureaus, that people who were once concerned about whether you can parallel park are now going to be looking into whether you're a terrorist.",
        "The states are against this.",
        "They say it's a huge unfunded mandate, going to cost them hundreds of millions of dollars.",
        "And immigration groups are also--and civil libertarians are also very concerned with this measure because they say it is going to be, in fact, a national ID card.",

        "But, you know, first I want to talk to a subject that gets very little attention and has with Hurricane Katrina and Rita and other hurricanes that have passed through the Gulf Coast, and that is devastation that we don't hear about.",
        "That's like the impact on the medical research in the Gulf Coast, and it has been significant as well, when you think that the electricity is out, there are all kinds of research laboratories there, there are samples and tissues and whatever that have to remain to be refrigerated and many of them are gone forever.",

        "Well, you know, like most people, David, I'd intuitively assumed that on MLK Day, most people would have an elevated view, not just of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., but of African-Americans in general and prominent Americans in our midst, people like President Obama or former Secretary of State Colin Powell.",
        "I recently spoke with Sara Konrath at Indiana University.",
        "And she told me that she and her colleagues William Chopik, Ed O'Brien and Norbert Schwarz - they decided to test this intuitive belief that I thought many of us share.",
        "They had volunteers describe their feelings about African-Americans in general and a prominent African-American like Colin Powell.",
        "She told me that she was surprised by what she found.",
        "People see Powell in a negative light on MLK Day compared to how they see him on days that are before or after.",
        "But on MLK Day, people actually see African-Americans, as a group, more positively.",
        "OK, explain what's going on here.",
        "People see African-Americans in general more positively on this holiday.",
        "But someone like Colin Powell they see more negatively.",
        "Why does that happen?",
        "On the service, David, it makes no sense.",
        "And initially, the researchers thought maybe this has something to do with Colin Powell.",
        "So they retested the experiment, and this time they used Barack Obama.",
        "And they found again the same thing, that people dislike the president more on MLK Day compared to other days.",
        "This wasn't just white people, by the way.",
        "This included African Americans.",
        "They found the same thing did not happen to prominent white leaders.",
        "So people such as Bill Clinton or Mitt Romney, for example, were not rated more negatively on MLK Day compared to other days.",
        "So things President Obama, Colin Powell have in common - I mean, political leaders, luminaries in the African-American community.",
        "Is that part of what's happening?",
        "And I think that's exactly what's happening, David.",
        "The researchers think this might be less about racial bias and more about how our minds make judgments about other people.",
        "Konrath asked me to imagine another scenario.",
        "Imagine that there's a university professor who wins a Nobel Prize.",
        "She asked me to think how this would change my views of the department where the Nobel Prize winner works and my views of individual professors at the same department.",
        "Here she is again.",
        "So as a whole, people are going to rate my department as, like, very good and very prestigious.",
        "But then, the individual faculty members, who are not Nobel Prize winners, suddenly look bad compared to that Nobel Prize winner.",
        "OK, so what she's saying is it's not like people are going to have a negative view of all researchers in the world.",
        "But she's being compared - she's seen as in the same category somehow as this Nobel Prize in her department.",
        "It's a matter of contrast, in a way.",
        "That's exactly right, David.",
        "So people are rating Colin Powell and Barack Obama worse on MLK Day because they're unconsciously comparing these prominent African-Americans to the Reverend King.",
        "Now, everyone would look worse compared to Dr. King.",
        "The interesting thing is how our minds choose these contrasts.",
        "And our minds choose these contrasts very selectively.",
        "Reverend King was not just a prominent African-American.",
        "He was a prominent African-American political figure and a man.",
        "So are Colin Powell and Barack Obama.",
        "And that's why the volunteers are unconsciously reaching for this contrast.",
        "When the researchers analyzed people's feelings about prominent African-Americans who are not politicians - Oprah Winfrey or Will Smith, for example - they were not affected in the same way.",
        "They were not evaluated more negatively on MLK Day.",
        "So the interesting thing, David, here, is that sometimes, being close to a star allows us to bask in reflected glory.",
        "Sometimes, if the star has many of the same characteristics that we do, we can end up looking worse by contrast.",
        "Shankar, interesting stuff as always.",
        "And that might explain why I feel less well-received when I'm in the studio with you."
