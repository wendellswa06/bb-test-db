        "Good afternoon.",
        "I'm really grateful and honored to be able to speak to General Petraeus.",
        "My main concern, I would have to agree with him, is about the impression that we're giving to ordinary Afghani people and Pakistani people - I don't know how to say it - the civilians, and I understand the previous caller's, her husband's frustrations.",
        "Her wonderful husband needs to realize that some of those guidelines are for - to keep the Taliban from, you know, winning over the hearts and minds of the civilians to someday shoot him or any of our other soldiers one of these days.",
        "We, ourselves, are not in Afghanistan, but we do have a next door neighbor who was, and I do have a brother…",
        "And Michael, please.",
        "A lot of people, can you get to the question?",
        "My question is, towards that end, I don't know what all has happened lately.",
        "The news media hasn't told us about rebuilding the infrastructure in Afghanistan, not only with child-sponsorship charities and other charities, with foreign humanitarian aid there, but also with roads and highways, other types of agriculture like they used to grow before the Soviets invaded, alternatives to the Taliban.",
        "You know, in treating them - what's the word - tempting them to grow poppies because it pays more.",
        "And I do remember the wealthier countries in Western Europe, New Zealand, Australia, et cetera, promised to join with the United States to help rebuild it, but how much of that has been done for the rebuilding of Afghanistan infrastructure since then?",
        "Let's give General Petraeus a chance to respond.",
        "Well, you've highlighted a very good point, Michael, in fact.",
        "And first of all, let me just say that you're exactly right that the guidelines that govern the use of force, if you will, are indeed very important, and they are intended, in fact, to avoid alienating the population that we're actually trying to secure and serve.",
        "In fact, General McKiernan, the commander, the NATO commander, in Afghanistan recently issued counterinsurgency guidance that gets right to this.",
        "And we think the operationalization of that guidance over time will certainly help our troopers who are on the ground.",
        "With respect to rebuilding the infrastructure, that's an enormously important task, and I should actually point out that it's not rebuilding.",
        "Unlike in Iraq where it was reconstruction, in Afghanistan, in many respects, this is building or construction.",
        "Afghanistan didn't have much at all back in the 1970s before they went through these decades of war that have since destroyed much of what it was that they had, but that effort has been ongoing since 2002.",
        "There have actually been a number of important areas of progress in terms of paving roads, building roads, building schools, extending health clinic access and also in the effort to combat illegal narcotics, although the authorities for that were recently revised last year to provide General McKiernan and his troopers much better capabilities and authorities to take on that very, very difficult mission."

        "The fact is that the illegal narcotics industry provides a good bit of the money that funds the insurgency.",
        "It's the oxygen in the movement, in many respects.",
        "And as you pointed out, you have to provide alternatives.",
        "You have to provide alternative livelihoods.",
        "You just can't mow down the crop and tell them, so be it.",
        "You have to provide them some other way of earning a living and that's a hugely important part of the overall effort.",
        "Michael, thanks very much for the call.",
        "I just wanted to follow up.",
        "Does it help that the Karzai government is so widely perceived as being corrupt and inefficient, ineffective?",
        "He's often portrayed as the Mayor of Kabul.",
        "It does not.",
        "And first of all, just to be fair, I think we should remember the very courageous actions that he took in the very beginning, entering the country in the midst of the toppling of the Taliban, risking his very life, actually, enormous physical danger, almost captured at one point in time, and has done, contributed tremendously to the development of the new Afghanistan.",
        "But there's no question, also, that there are perceptions and realities of corruption in the governance that have grown over time, of linkages to the illegal narcotics industry and so forth.",
        "Ambassador Holbrooke, my diplomatic wingman as we sometimes call him, talks of the cancer of corruption that literally eats at the legitimacy of the government in Afghanistan.",
        "President Karzai has very much acknowledged this.",
        "He has taken this on.",
        "We actually had the representative of the Pakistani embassy with us last night for an event.",
        "And they, in fact, fully recognize it, they acknowledge it.",
        "And now, frankly, it is incumbent on them to do something about it in a very concrete way.",
        "Let's get Lance on the line.",
        "Lance calling from Denver, Colorado.",
        "Hi.",
        "My question has to do with sort of the bottom line.",
        "Our stated purpose for being in Afghanistan is to prevent the re-growth of the training camps and the safe havens, and I'm wondering why that couldn't be done from the air or by increased surveillance as opposed to sending in more troops and attempting to, you know, pull a 10th century country into the 21st century.",
        "Well, Lance, that's a great question, and in fact, it was a point of some debate during the Afghanistan-Pakistan , the AFAR strategy review, as it came to be known.",
        "The fact is this is actually what we tried to do before 9/11.",
        "You may recall that we launched cruise missiles into what we thought were camps and were indeed.",
        "We tried a variety of different means, but the fact is that when you do it from afar, it is generally ineffective.",
        "And indeed, that was the case at that time.",
        "And those sanctuaries existed.",
        "They were able from those locations to plan, and then, in a sense, launch what ultimately became the 9/11 attacks.",
        "So, not allowing the very group that allowed those sanctuaries to be created in the first place, that's the Taliban, and of course, allowed al-Qaida to establish those safe havens, and training camps and command and control facilities, is indeed truly a vital interest of the United States.",
        "And I think that President Obama sought to focus attention on that quite effectively in his speech this past Friday."

        "All right.",
        "As you know far better than I, those same groups have now established training camps in Pakistan, in the western part of that country.",
        "As you know better than I, the head of the Pakistani Taliban said yesterday that he would soon launch an attack against the United States, against Washington, D.C.",
        "that would amaze the world.",
        "Can the United States tolerate those camps in western Pakistan?",
        "Well, at the end of the day, the answer of course is no. Now, having said that, what we want to do very much, what the Pakistanis want us to do is to enable them, to help them, to assist them as they deal with what is an extremist threat to their own country.",
        "No country in the world has suffered more from al-Qaida and its affiliates, including Bitola Meshed, who's the individual that issued this threat.",
        "And by the way, of course people are taking that very seriously.",
        "I talked to a senior official of the National Security Council staff this morning about this.",
        "Having said that, there are questions about that particular group's transnational capacity.",
        "But over time, what has to happen, of course, is that the Pakistanis are able to develop the kinds of not just counterterrorist capabilities, this is much bigger than that.",
        "This requires a counterinsurgency approach that is a whole of government, not just military, but also the other elements of the Pakistani government to go in and literally over time, to clear, hold and build in these areas that currently contain sanctuaries.",
        "Would you like to be able to send troops in there?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "And not just because we don't want to risk our troops needlessly, if you will, or - but the fact is the Pakistanis are willing to do this.",
        "What they need is greater capacity and capability to do it.",
        "And as I explained on Capitol Hill today, the resources in some of the various requests that are out there would help us to help them in a much more effective way.",
        "Let's get Scott on the line, Scott calling from Jacksonville, North Carolina.",
        "Yes.",
        "General Petraeus, first of all, sir, it's an honor and a pleasure to speak to you.",
        "I am an active duty Navy physician serving with the Marine Corps, and I've been to Iraq twice.",
        "Sir, my question and my concern is just I've had a chance to see kind of the emotional toll that, as you well know, sir, the long deployments and now with us going into Afghanistan, what you thought, how we're going to be able to sustain this, not only for the troops, but just for the families, the children, everyone involved, long term."

        "We actually conduct surveys of our own soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen in theaters like Iraq.",
        "And we were concerned to watch it go down year after year.",
        "And then all of a sudden, as we started to make progress, morale is measured by this survey and that may be a different term for it, but they started feeling much better about what was going on.",
        "And we think again that a great deal of this, of course, is if they feel that they are doing something that is of enormous importance to our country, they see their fellow citizens recognizing the sacrifices that they and their families are making, and they see progress being made in such an important task, they are willing to make continued sacrifices to do that.",
        "I have to say I'm pretty familiar with this, having - my family is.",

        "And that includes criminal actions.",
