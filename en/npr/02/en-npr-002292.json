        "An individual named Fadil Mashaddani(ph), in truth, this discussion began well back when I was still the commander in Iraq with Prime Minister Maliki.",
        "We knew that this individual has implicated allegedly a criminal boss, basically.",
        "So, yes, he did help achieve peace in his neighborhood but, he was also extorting, kidnapping and carrying out violent actions.",
        "So, this is a sense, as with the militia, where we knew there was going to have to be an operation, the decision was finally made to conduct it.",
        "There were a couple of days of real tough business down there in the area of Fadil, of Baghdad that he controlled, but that seems to have been passed through now, and we'll see how this goes along from here.",

        "Is that going to have to be the same policy in Afghanistan, the so-called moderate Taliban?",
        "Well, this is the issue of the reconcilables and the irreconcilables.",
        "This is a whole endeavor that requires a very, very nuanced understanding of local communities and areas.",
        "And what has to happen is our soldiers have to be so detailed in their knowledge of the situation that they can identify who the no-kidding irreconcilables are.",
        "These are the true extremists who are never going to become part of the solution and will remain part of the problem.",
        "They literally have to be killed, captured or run off.",
        "That leaves the remainder, who in many cases, have, because they were intimated, paid or just tacitly went along with the bad guys, accepted the bad guys in their neighborhood.",
        "And they can then be embraced and the traditional authority structures can be returned to an area and they can move forward.",
        "And we'll end with this email from Gary in San Antonio.",
        "I think if the U.S.",
        "mission in Iraq is to be a success, it will due almost entirely to the tremendous efforts of General Petraeus.",
        "I think it can easily be said he's taught us much about how we will succeed in future conflict with insurgent groups.",
        "However, I must ask an important question: What was it like to toss the coin at the Super Bowl?",
        "Well, first of all, let me just say that this was a team effort.",
        "And it was truly a team of teams.",
        "This was everybody.",
        "And it wasn't just U.S., it was coalition, it was courageous Iraqis, it was everybody achieving unity of effort in an important task.",
        "And as to flipping the coin, I felt like a pretty small individual out there next to all these guys who were kitted up, and 6'5\"\", and weighed twice what I did and unfortunately, can probably run twice as fast.",
        "General Petraeus, thanks very much for your time today.",

        "Now there's some hurdles you have to jump through, like if you are being claimed by someone else, that you won't have any unearned income that exceeds $300.",

        "And it's not just the murky situation on the ground, says Bennett Freeman, who was, until recently, the Vice Chair of the board of United to End Genocide, an follow-on organization from the Save Darfur Coalition.",
        "He says, activists are war-weary after Iraq, and that worries him.",
        "I would like to have thought we would have learned the lessons of Rwanda and Bosnia from the 1990's, and then Darfur from a decade ago, that when there is genocide or mass atrocities or use of weapons of mass destruction against unarmed civilians, that nations like the United States would be willing to intervene.",
