        "Blanche Lincoln, who barely went ahead of Bill Halter in the May 18th Democratic primary, was forced into a runoff, and yet with a very important, crucial visit from Bill Clinton and also very hard-hitting ads where she attacked the Washington labor unions - you don't hear too many Democrats doing that.",
        "No.",
        "But the labor unions and the net roots and the left, you know, the progressives spent up to $10 million to defeat her in the runoff, but she won pretty handily, by four points, considering most of us thought she would go down to defeat.",
        "And a big night for women elsewhere, beginning, I guess we have to say, in California.",
        "Well, California was big.",
        "For the first time in history - for the first time in California history, Republicans have nominees for both the governorship and the Senate seat.",
        "The Senate seat, of course, is the one held by Barbara Boxer, and Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive at Hewlett-Packard, is the nominee there.",
        "And for the governor's race against Jerry Brown, the former governor, will be Meg Whitman, who spent $80 million, $71 million of her own money, to win the nomination there.",
        "And no surprises on the Democratic side.",
        "As you said, the people we expected to be...",

        "It's got a great history in research, a number of Nobel laureates; many firsts.",

        "Yeah.",

        "We've learned over time, because of flooding, not to do that.",
        "But we do have labs there, and certainly for our population sciences studies, where we see participants in the community and for our clinical research, that all goes on on the first floor.",
        "So that was a total write-off.",
        "We just had to throw it all out.",
        "We really worked really hard.",
        "Our faculty were just magnificent in the immediate post-Katrina era and they managed to feed and water the animals.",
        "So we did manage to save a lot of our animals, the important transgenic mice.",

        "Going into Mexico after Pancho Villa with Blackjack Pershing, yeah, some pretty amazing stories.",

        "Well, what's tax deductible is if you put your kid in a summer camp, that may count as an expense towards your child and dependant care credit.",
        "And you can claim that credit if you put your kid in a day camp.",
        "That's not overnight camp, but a day camp.",
        "So you want to - you know, it's just like when you go to work during the regular school season, and you have to put them in before or after care that will allow you to work, and that can be deductible - the same thing with summer camp."
