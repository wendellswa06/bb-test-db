        "Rove was defiant in the face of criticism from the president's own base.",
        "He said conservatives who complain about the administration's deficit spending are missing the facts.",
        "He said he's happy to defend the president's record on budget restraint, at least in the area of non-defense discretionary spending.",
        "The administration issued 39 veto threats on six major spending bills and Congress responded to those veto threats by restraining spending to the levels proposed in the president's budget.",
        "To put it mildly, the impact of the president's veto messages have been an unreported achievement.",

        "They want the president to do something he's never done before.",
        "Frankly, I'd rather see a veto because it would highlight what's going on.",
        "It would bring attention to the fact that the president finally has vetoed something and it would allow us to have a debate about spending and the president as the guy vetoing the spending bill would win that argument all day long.",
        "Religious conservatives are also disappointed in the Republicans and in response the White House and congressional leaders are planning several weeks of votes on issues like gay marriage, stem cell research, internet gambling, abortion, and of course, judges.",
        "Tom McClusky of the Family Research Council said he hopes that will reenergize the president's core supporters in time for the fall campaigns.",
        "Among all Republicans, there is a disparateness between spending and also a lack of focus on the social issues.",
        "Right now, the Republicans, they're not going to win the fiscal conservatives by 2006 with the spending that's going on.",
        "So with a focus on the social issues, we're hoping that it will help to galvanize the base, at least around the social conservative issues and to get them more involved in the political arena.",
        "Of course some of the discontent among activists is about the same issues that have disappointed other voters, the war in Iraq and high gas prices."

        "But in a place colloquially known as Chocolate City for its African-American majority, demographics have changed.",
        "It's now more than 42 percent white, which to Fauntroy means the next mayor might not be black.",
        "And I think the reason there's many people in the race suggests not only the ambition of those who are running but also suggests that there's an opportunity to win."
