        "Back then, 1984, was the year of the woman, with Geraldine Ferraro and all the women who ran for the Senate.",
        "But most of the women that year lost, including, of course, the Mondale-Ferraro ticket.",
        "This year, of course, there are more chances, more opportunities for women and much stronger candidates, I think.",
        "And how do we assess the Tea Party influence, and indeed, the influence of I guess the Tea-Partier-in-chief, Sarah Palin?",
        "Well, I mean, you know, if you look at a scorecard, you'll see wins, and you'll see losses, but Sarah Palin did back Carly Fiorina in California, and she won handily.",
        "She backed - the Tea Party backed Sharron Angle in Nevada to run against Harry Reid, and she won pretty big.",
        "Nikki Haley, the state representative from South Carolina, was backed by the Tea Party and Sarah Palin, and she won that nomination.",
        "Well, actually...",

        "Right, exactly.",
        "She's going to go into a runoff.",
        "And as we look at this idea, as you mentioned, this idea of the anti-incumbent fervor, we've seen, well, several incumbents already knocked out of their parties in primaries.",
        "Yes, but the thing - if you look at those who have lost, I think there's specific reasons why they lost.",
        "If you look at Arlen Specter and Alabama Congressman Parker Griffith, they switched parties, and the new party never warmed up to them."

        "So we always keep talking about these anti-, this anti-incumbent feeling out there, but ultimately, I think these are individual cases.",
        "If there really was an anti-incumbency, I suspect Blanche Lincoln would have lost, Jane Harman in California, who was challenged by the left, might have lost.",
