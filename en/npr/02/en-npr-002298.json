        "Jon, I mean, I've heard before that, you know, Democrats always wish they had the right candidate, and they got the right candidate in Sharron Angle.",
        "And I do remember Democrats saying the same thing about Ronald Reagan in 1980: Boy, I would love to run against Ronald Reagan.",
        "Both - actually Pat Brown said that for governor.",
        "So be careful what you wish for.",
        "But fill us in, Sharron Angle has said some controversial things about some topics.",
        "That's an understatement, and we don't have enough time on this program, and they're already putting those out, and they started last night.",
        "It's interesting you mentioned the Reagan analogy, Ken, because when she got up last night to give her victory speech, she said exactly what you just said: They said Ronald Reagan was too conservative, too.",
        "Sharron Angle is not Ronald Reagan.",
        "Sharron Angle has made a bunch of controversial comments, being against fluoridation of water, trying to - she's very pro-life, saying that abortion could be tied to breast cancer.",
        "She had supported this program that came out during the campaign that would've - was tied to the Church of Scientology, that would have given prisoners massages and saunas as therapy in prison.",
        "That's just the tip of the iceberg.",
        "There's a lot more that's going to come out, and you can be sure that the Reid campaign is ready to do so.",
        "In fact, even before the final returns were in last night, two websites went up, including one not coincidentally called The Wrong Angle, with a lot of these old, very controversial statements and pieces of legislation she's proposed.",
        "You know, Jon, Neal and I have said on this show many times that even though polls always showed Harry Reid losing to any Republican, once you focus on a Republican, things are obviously different.",
        "Yeah, and it's going to be very different.",
        "The last poll that was taken shows this race within the margin of error.",
        "I think that you're going to see the Reid campaign now just try to stop Sharron Angle dead in her tracks right away, to try to dissuade all the national money they thought was going to be coming in to help Sue Lowden from coming in to help Sharron Angle.",
        "You know the Republican Party nationally and in Nevada is absolutely committed to taking out Harry Reid.",
        "They want to do what they did to Tom Daschle six years ago, take out the leader of the Democratic Party.",
        "So I still think there's a lot of money that's going to come in.",
        "But once Sharron Angle's record is exposed, it's going to be very, very difficult because 15 percent of the electorate here are independent voters."

        "Right now, they're against Harry Reid, but as you say, Ken, when they start to focus on who Sharron Angle really is, it's going to be a very difficult proposition for the Republicans.",

        "Sharron Angle was my assemblywoman, and I've got to tell you, she's a dogged campaigner.",
        "She hits the ground, goes door to door.",
        "She beat an incumbent assemblyman, I think Greg Brower, and she works real hard.",
        "She has a heck of a following out in the rural counties, and - but the question really is, I mean, I've talked to a bunch of Republican friends of mine, and they said about the only thing that could make them vote for Harry Reid would be if Sharron Angle was the nominee.",
        "And so again, they may have gotten what they feared.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "I think the Republicans are worried about that.",

        "And the real question you have to ask yourself is - even as that caller points out - even if he can get some Republicans and independents to vote for Harry Reid, say we don't like or him, or we'd rather not have Sharron Angle, will they get down to - tick down to the next race on the ballot and say, well, one Reid, maybe, two Reids, I don't think so.",
        "What about Dave's point?",
        "Is Sharron Angle, does she has some respect for her work as a legislator as opposed to some of her more eccentric policy positions?",
        "She has very little legislative record.",
        "She has very few successes.",
        "In fact, she was on the wrong end of a very, very bad 41-to-one vote.",
        "In fact, the joke in Carson City was the vote was 41 to Angle.",
        "But what the caller said is true.",
        "She's an amazing campaigner.",
        "She thrives on it.",
        "And unlike Harry Reid, not to put too fine a point on it, she's very likable.",
        "She's a genuine human being.",

        "But, you know, U.S.",
        "Senate races are not generally won by retail politicking.",
        "They're won by 30-second TV ads, and Harry Reid has $9 million he's about to start spending on 30-second TV ads.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Dave.",
        "We'll get one more caller in from Nevada, and this is Curtis(ph), Curtis with us from Gardnerville in Nevada.",
        "Yes, hi.",
        "And I'll tell you, I've never voted in my life for a Republican, and living here in Nevada and working as an educator with the conservative element, I just could not rule Angle out.",
        "I just go day to day listening to birthers and such who have death panels, and I just scratch my head."
