        "Just two weeks before her - before the primary, one of her long-time supporters, a former staffer, now a political blogger said he'd had an affair with her.",
        "And then about five days later, a political lobbyist said, I had a one-night stand with Nikki Haley.",
        "And to both allegations, Nikki Haley said, no, I've been 100 percent faithful to my husband of 13 years.",
        "And in fact, the allegations so far unproven, seem only to have solidified her voter base.",
        "And she really brought out a lot of people to yesterday's - almost a record number of voters in this Republican primary yesterday.",

        "Julie, I heard a lot of Republican officials, first of all, very excited about Nikki Haley's showing yesterday.",
        "She got 49 percent of the vote.",
        "She barely missed winning the nomination outright.",
        "And they basically talked about her as if she was the nominee.",
        "How much pressure is there on Congressman Barrett to drop out of the runoff?",
        "There's a quite a bit of pressure, although, so far - I mean, in the last 24 hours, he has given no indication that he plans to drop out.",
        "He did only get 22 percent of the vote to Haley's 49 percent.",
        "And in South Carolina, it's also important to remember that only people who voted in the first primary can vote in the second primary, the runoff.",
        "So Haley - Nikki Haley definitely has the deck stacked, if you will, coming into this June 22nd primary.",
        "And let's get Denise(ph) on the line, Denise with us from Columbia, South Carolina.",
        "Yes, Neal.",
        "I just wanted to say that don't crown Nikki Haley the governor yet because the minority faction of South Carolina has not spoken yet.",
        "And we plan to galvanize our support for our candidate.",
        "I think, overall, the state is tired of the Republicans, regardless of whether it's Nikki Haley or Barrett or anybody.",
        "But we need to move forward in a totally different direction, and I think we got a real shot at it.",
        "Julie Rose, do the polls support that?",
        "She makes a good point, your caller does.",
        "The Democrat running for - that will face whoever comes out of this runoff between Haley and Barrett is Vincent Sheheen.",
        "And he has run a very solid campaign, overcoming a state - as a state superintendent of public schools, actually, a statewide officeholder there.",
        "And he is unknown.",
        "He has less baggage, less connections to the establishment.",
        "And so, there definitely is a sentiment according to the polls in the South Carolina that people are tired, first of all, of having their lawmakers' sex lives dragged through late night jokes and...",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And they're eager to see a change and to kind of - and one thing that Vincent Sheheen, the Democrat, has been talking about is, you know, look, we've seen what we've been through with Governor Sanford in office for the last year.",
        "Do we want another Republican who also potentially has sex scandals attached him or her?",
        "Let's move on.",

        "I mean, Governor Sanford endorsed Nikki Haley as his chosen heir just right before, I think, the whole Argentinean affair, hike down the Appalachian Trail thing happened last summer.",

        "Well, I think everybody feels yes.",
        "The question is how much, how close the Republicans will get.",
