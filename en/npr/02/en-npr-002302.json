        "But Broon says even these labels can't be trusted.",
        "Regulation of these products is really crucial because it's - yes, it's comforting to see that this particular product says it doesn't contain phthalates, but without a chemistry set right here in the lab, there's really no way to be sure.",

        "If San Francisco's phthalate ban passes, which is widely expected, the city's health and environment departments would spend a year and a half coming up with a list of products that contain more than 0.1 percent of the chemicals.",
        "Retailers would not be allowed to sell any product on that list and would be fined if they violate the law.",
