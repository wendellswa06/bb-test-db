        "That nomination has been under a darkening cloud after Thursday's revelation that the National Security Agency, which General Hayden headed, has been collecting the phone records of millions of Americans.",
        "Yesterday, two lawyers filed a class action lawsuit against Verizon, one of the companies that reportedly provided the phone records.",

        "There's three areas that I'm sure members of Congress will pursue.",
        "First of all, you have basic fourth amendment requirements that say people are protected against unreasonable searches and seizures.",
        "So the question is, was this an unreasonable search?",
        "The second question has to do with federal statues that protect against warrant-less gathering of electronic communications.",
        "And finally, the issue is, did the phone companies breach any kind of telecommunications law that says that their customers' information should be protected?",
        "So those are the three main areas that are at issue here.",
        "Let's start first with this idea that we have this constitutional protection against search and seizure.",
        "Is this an illegal invasion of that?",
        "Well, it looks like, as a threshold matter, it would not be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, because what the Supreme Court has said is that there are different kinds of electronic communications here.",
        "There's something in the content of our conversations, and that is more protected, what we say to each other.",
        "But there's a lower level of protection for pure phone numbers, who we call, the traffic back and forth.",
        "And in the late 1970s, the Supreme Court actually ruled that the Fourth Amendment doesn't protect just the pure phone numbers, but then there's another legal hurdle that has to do with what's in federal statutes.",
        "The most basic statute at issue here could be one that covers special national security issues.",
        "That is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act that essentially says that when the government wants to collect information from our electronic communications that might have to do with matters of foreign intelligence, government agents have to go to a special court and get permission."

        "So we have three telephone companies that have allegedly turned over tens of millions of records and we assume that the government did not go through this process.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The reason we can assume that the government did not seek a warrant is because one of the major telecommunications companies, Qwest, that said no to this, had said why don't government lawyers actually go before this special court related to foreign intelligence and say, can we have a warrant to do this?",
        "So there is a presumption that the government did not seek a warrant here.",
        "Was there anything of this scope that you could find as you dug through presidents?",
        "No.",
        "As a matter of fact, the laws that are at issue here, the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act and laws governing the devices that are used to tap into phones and to trace phone numbers were really written with the idea that government would be going after individuals or government would be going after discrete criminal networks, not massive data collections, as we apparently have here.",
        "Now, since it's collecting the phone numbers and we have reason to believe that names are not attached to these phone numbers, so does that change the legalities?",
        "It does in some ways, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.",
        "It is aimed at content generally, but the definition of communications and identity is fairly broad, so perhaps this so-called FISA court might think, would it be appropriate to pass on numbers in this day and age that can so easily lead to identification?",
        "And I guess in this day and age when you can just put a telephone number into Google and find out who it belongs to, it sort of changes things.",
