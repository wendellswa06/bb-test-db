        "So what we've learned is that essentially humans can learn about categories of smells simply through sort of passive exposure and training and as little as a three-minute sensory exposure is sufficient to engender this learning, which can persists for up to 24 hours.",

        "Well, could you distinguish between different kinds of minty smells?",
        "That's precisely what we are doing.",
        "So there are peppermint smells, spearmint smells - a whole family of minty smells.",

        "What's interesting about the experimental paradigm we used is, it really is a reflection of how we engage the olfactory world on a day-to-day basis.",
        "We usually don't sit down and study the smells and try and categorize them in any active or conscious fashion.",
        "We sort of experience smells in a fairly passive format.",

        "Right.",
        "So the areas we found involved in this learning mechanism were sort of deep primitive structures of the olfactory brain, one area is called the piriform cortex, and another area you called the orbital frontal cortex, in which really interesting about the second region in particular, the orbital frontal cortex, which sits sort of on the base of the brain just behind the eyes, is that it's critically involved in emotion, behavior, and motivational states.",
        "And if you think about smell in evolutionary terms, smell is really the original sense that drove most of animal behavior.",
        "So whether you're dealing with food and foraging, mating behavior, kinship recognition, maternal bonding, escaping predators - all of this was sort of under the control of sensory - sorry - smell information.",
        "So it comes as no surprise, really, that the same areas we see involved in smell processing are also those involved in emotion, memory and goal-directed behaviors.",
