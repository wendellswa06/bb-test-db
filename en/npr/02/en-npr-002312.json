        "Earlier today, the Supreme Court heard arguments in Hamdan v.",
        "Rumsfeld, a case which could have sweeping implications for the war on terror.",
        "Salim Hamdan, once Osama bin Laden's driver, was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2001, and later transferred to the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.",
        "The Bush administration wants to try him before a military commission, a system that was established by the president to try suspected terrorists after 9/11.",
        "Lawyers for Hamdan argue that the president exceeded his powers and that the military tribunal system violates their client's rights.",
        "It's a complicated case that tests executive power in time of war, and whether the Geneva conventions apply to the men held at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "The case became even more complicated late last year when Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which strips U.S.",
        "Courts of the right to review cases brought by detainees.",
        "The Justices heard arguments on that issue as well.",
        "And in an indication of their belief of public interest in this important case, they decided to release same-day audio recordings of the proceedings.",
        "Shortly after Hamdan's lawyer, Neal Katyal, began, the newest Justice, Samuel Alito, interrupted to ask why the court should hear this case now, before the trial, when judicial review usually comes after a decision.",
        "In criminal litigation, review after the final decision is the general rule.",
        "There generally is not any interlocutory appeal in which you say could happen in any criminal case, if you assume bad faith on the part of the people who are responsible for making the decisions along the way.",
        "They could delay indefinitely and postpone the entry of a final decision.",
        "Justice Alito, if this were a final, if this were like a criminal proceeding, we wouldn't be here.",
        "The whole point of this is to say we're challenging the lawfulness of a tribunal itself.",
        "This isn't a challenge to some decision that a court makes, this is a challenge to the court itself.",
        "And that's why it's different then the ordinary criminal context that you're positing.",
        "In the ordinary criminal context you're positing, and I'm thinking of a case like Schlossing (ph) versus Councilmen (ph), a court martial case.",
        "What the court has said is that it's the predicate for abstention is the idea that Congress has fairly balanced the rights of both sides, an independent branch, and has made certain determinations.",
        "Here, none of that has happened.",
        "It's all been made by the executive.",
        "And the difference is crucial in military justice, because as Justice Kennedy said for the Court in Loving, the framers heard the deep distrust of military tribunals.",
        "And the thing that makes it different then the ordinary criminal context, the thing that is, as this court said, stops military justice from being lawless, is the Congress of the United States setting clear limits on the use military justice.",
        "Now if those limits have been observed, if this court, if the military commission complied with the rules of courts martial, we wouldn't be here.",
        "Our whole point is that they don't, and that it falls outside of the well recognized abstention exception for courts martial cases.",
        "An excerpt from today's arguments before the United States Supreme Court.",
        "You heard Neal Katyal, Mr. Hamdan's lawyer, and earlier, Justice Samuel Alito.",
        "We're going to take your questions about this case and its implications later in the program.",
