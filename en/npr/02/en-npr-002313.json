        "And it's not that government has a role, Farai, it's really up to individual corporations and employers to take on a bigger role, because I'm not sure how you connect economics to motherhood, because the problem with the study here is that we're taking tasks that everybody else has to do in America out there, whether it's laundry and cooking and providing whatever their needs are to keep up their households, and we're trying to apply economics to it.",
        "We're saying, `Because you're a mother, you therefore should being get paid for these things,' and that's just the extreme to the point of where we are a society.",

        "On the one hand, you do have all these jobs that women do.",
        "Deborah's arguing that you can't really put a price tag on it.",
        "On the other hand, one of the sort of sore points in American divorce law has been, you know, how should women who've stayed at home be compensated for the time that they've spent with their families if the family is breaking up.",
        "Do you think that there should be more give either in terms of the relationships between men and women or government's role or business' role?",
        "If women are just out there on their own, that seems awfully unfair.",
        "Well, first of all, I don't think that you can put a price on raising your children and what kind of job you do in raising your children, how much time you spend reading to them, how much time you spend being a soccer mom or, you know, the football coach or the basketball coach or any of those kinds of things.",
        "I don't think you can put a dollar on it.",
        "But the other thing here is that in valuing your children and in putting value on your family becomes a personal thing for a woman to decide whether she's going to give up her career, so to speak, or take some time out of the workplace, and what we used to call the rat race, and take care of their family.",
        "In terms of--when we get to the question of divorce, for instance, the bottom line is that if you stayed at home and the husband has worked, you are entitled to some of that income because you have shared in his success because you've stayed at home and taken care of those children, you've allowed him to do a much better job in taking care of his career, and that's what it should based on.",
        "Not so much on how many, you know, loads of clothes, laundry that you do, but the fact that you have been part of a partnership, and as part of the partnership, when that partnership is dissolved, you're entitled to some of those assets.",

        "What do your friends say about the balancing act between motherhood and work?",

        "Well, I still get asked the question of, `When are you going back to work?",
        "And just because, you know, it's something that you don't go to outside your home, I think a lot of people don't realize that working within the home is a lot of work, and I think this issue often--you mentioned the article in The New York Times--it's presented as sort of an upper-class, upper-middle-class phenomenon where women whose husbands make a lot of money so they can drop out, but I really think that there are a lot of people who aren't in that upper-income bracket and there's a lot of gray area where in--with a lot of varying degrees where people have to decide, you know, on how to juggle whether to work inside or outside the home, and for me personally, it's just been a trade-off with having fewer material things in terms of having a full-time salary, you know.",

        "Yeah, but there was an implication that women somehow are different.",
        "Women are different in the case that women can bear children biologically, so is that difference really causing differences in income and earnings, or is it more of a question of life choices?",
        "Because I think that's something that people are fighting over right now.",
        "Well, it's an interesting topic because there is this observation out there that women are dropping out because they're married to these rich husbands, as an earlier guest had said, but there's also the question that we're coming across anecdotally about women who are being pushed out once they have children.",
        "We know plenty of lawyers who went back to their firms after having children, tried to go into a part-time schedule and then was told by their partners or their managing bosses that, you know, `We just don't have the appropriate work for you,' and so that's what we're trying to undergo at this kind of time is to look at the anecdotal evidence and also seeing how to quantify this evidence, really where things are at and how it's gonna affect the economy long term if we don't have these women in the workforce.",
