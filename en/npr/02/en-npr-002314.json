        "They seemed troubled and really offended that Congress would have tried to take away their power to decide this case.",

        "How is what you're arguing consistent with the language I quoted?",
        "And two, how could it, if we accepted your interpretation, possibly avoid the most terribly difficult and important Constitutional question of whether Congress can constitutionally deprive this court of jurisdiction in Habeas cases?",
        "Well, Justice Breyer, let me answer both pieces of that.",
        "I certainly think that such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitutional laws of the United States.",

        "Circuit, at the end of the day, could decide whether or not there was a requirement that the Treaty Challenge be brought.",
        "Senator Clement, if you can...",
        "And that, we just heard Justice Ginsburg there, a little bit at the end.",
        "And David Savage, the Justices, as you're suggesting, really challenged the Solicitor General, not only on the substance of the case, but also on this whole issue of jurisdiction.",
        "That's right.",
        "There's two big questions here in this case.",
        "First of all, does the Supreme Court still have the jurisdiction to hear this case?",
        "And secondly, are these tribunals unconstitutional the way they are set up?",
        "It seemed to be clear that five of them were inclined to say, yes, the court has jurisdiction.",
        "Congress cannot just casually suspend habeas corpus.",
        "And they also seemed, five of them seemed troubled by, as I say, this sort of made up quality of these military trials."

        "One of the issues that came up was whether in fact the crime with which Mr. Hamdan is charged, and that is conspiracy, whether he can be charged with that under the laws of war.",
        "Yes, Neal Katyal has consistently made the argument that conspiracy is not a war crime around the world, because in a sense, it's too broad and too vague.",
        "In other words, everybody on the other side is sort of conspiring against you.",
        "So if conspiracy alone is a war crime, then everybody on the other is a war criminal.",

        "Circuit Court, he was a member of that court.",
        "So, he heard it in that context, so the procedure is he can't hear it twice, so he wasn't sitting today.",

        "But his point is, if we say this is okay, the president and Don Rumsfeld can sort of make up this system, what's the limit, what's the boundary?",
        "So, I think their concern is, this is a situation where the president is claiming a lot of power and the courts want to say, is this really law or is this going too far?",
        "Is this sort of the chief executive sort of making the rules as he goes along?"

        "Why wouldn't the Geneva Convention hear?",
        "And what the Geneva Convention basically says, if you're going to try prisoners from the other side, you can try them for war criminals, but you have to try them under the procedures you try your own soldiers.",
        "So, the notion is, if the Geneva Convention applies, all that Hamdan would get was a sort of court martial procedure.",
