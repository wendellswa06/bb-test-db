        "Joe McMillan, why don't we start with you?",
        "I think you were in court this morning, what did you make, what did you hear that most interested you?",
        "Well, what I heard that most interested me, I think, first was the extraordinary interest of the justices in the jurisdictional question...",
        "Mm-hmmm.",
        "...that was posed by the Detainee Treatment Act passed by Congress in late December of last year.",
        "And I think as Mr. Savage indicated, there was very considerable interest on the part of the court as to whether or not Congress indeed intended to strip the court of jurisdiction over a pending case, which would be a fairly extraordinary action.",
        "And I think it was Justice Ginsberg pointed out had not, in fact, occurred since the 1860s.",
        "So, there was quite a bit of questioning of the solicitor general in connection with the intent of Congress in that statute.",
        "And in fact, Justice Souter and others on the court went farther to say that, in fact, if we interpret the Detainee Treatment Act the way the government suggests, does that not affect an unconstitutional suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...and some of the most, I suppose, emotional portions of the argument related to the stature of the great Writ in the entire Anglo-American legal tradition, and that certainly the government couldn't be suggesting that Congress inadvertently intended to suspend the Writ.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Andrew McBride, as Joe McMillan was just saying, this is an important issue for the justices today.",
        "Oh yes, I think so.",
        "I think it's pretty clear that the argument the United States made, that the Detainee Treatment Act had mooted this case and stripped the court of jurisdiction, is not going to be successful, and that the court is going to say either the Detainee Treatment Act is not retroactive and doesn't apply to Mr. Hamdan's case, and/or it has in the past, we are going to be very wary of reading any statute to completely strip anyone of the ability to file Writ of Habeas Corpus to challenge the jurisdiction or the procedures of a body that could administer a sentence of years of imprisonment or even the death penalty.",
        "So, I would have to agree that on that first jurisdictional argument, which was injected into the case by the passage of the Detainee Treatment Act in December of 2005, I think the government is going to \"lose.",
        "The court will find that there is jurisdiction to hear this case and will get to larger issues upon which it originally granted tertiary(ph)."

        "And on that, Andrew McBride, again you filed a brief on behalf of the Attorney General in support of the administration's position.",
        "What about that substance of the case, the president's right to establish a set of military tribunals independent of the judiciary system?",
        "Well, I'd have to say it was a tough 90 minutes for Mr. Clement, and I thought he did a good job.",
        "The good news for the United States is I don't think there's a dispute and I think they will find five, perhaps six votes for the proposition that the president does indeed have the authority, either as Commander in Chief under Article 2 of the Constitution, and/or in this case, under the congressional authorization to use military force passed after 9/11...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...to use military commissions, and that they are part of the Commander in Chief's prosecution of the war, much in the same way that the president can decide to use a submarine or a bunker buster, that a military commission is part of really accomplishing two things.",
        "One, deterring the enemy from violation of the laws of war, and telling our troops, essentially, bucking up the moral of our troops by saying, if the enemy violates the laws of war, fires upon you under a flag of truce, we will punish them.",
        "So, on the power issue, I don't think there's any dispute.",
        "I do think, and I would have to say, the administration appears to be in trouble over procedure.",
        "And whether or not these military commissions comply with the Uniform Code of Military Justice and/or with the Geneva Convention, and Justice Kennedy who appears to be a key-swing vote on what as Mr. Savage pointed out is an eight-member court with the Chief Justice recused, appeared to me to be extremely concerned about prosecutions under the laws of war that in his view did not comport with the laws of war.",
        "So, I think we may see an opinion of five, perhaps, that rejects the jurisdictional argument, affirms the president's general authority, but perhaps says that these particular commissions do not have sufficient protections, such as defending presence throughout the proceedings, and other protections, that are necessary under either Geneva or under the statute, the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",

        "She wears many hats.",
        "Crystal is the morning news anchor at Channel 6 in Marquette, Michigan.",
        "Well, it may well put us back to square one.",
        "And in fact, that in some respects is what our case was all about.",
        "It was, I think Mr. McBride put it very well, which is, if the administration is indeed going to try this individual for a war crime under the laws of war, which is, after all, what a military commission is designed to do, then our position is simply it must itself comply with the laws of war.",
        "And the Supreme Court, I won't venture a guess on how it will come out on this issue, but we've argued to the court that it should require that the laws of war be applied, the protections of the laws of war, as well as the penalties of the laws of war.",
        "And in fact, Congress is required that in one of the statutes of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
        "In which, it indicated that military commissions only have jurisdiction to try offenders or offenses tryable by commission under the laws of war.",
        "And our client is not an offender.",

        "As a matter of fact, I think Major Andre, the British Spy who was hung by military commission, commissioned by General George Washington, was charged with conspiracy to spy along with Benedict Arnold to obtain the plans of West Point for the British Army during the Revolutionary War.",
        "So, I think there's good historical precedent.",
        "And I think Karin provides Supreme Court precedent for the proposition that conspiracy to violate the laws of war is a charge that could be tried in a military commission.",
        "Obviously, Major Andre, before there was a Constitution, much less a Geneva Convention.",

        "There were some questions from the bench today about the Geneva Convention.",
        "The position that we argued to the court was, and it didn't come up so much in oral argument as was submitted in the briefing, that this was a capture of an individual in the context of an armed conflict between two members of the Geneva Convention, the United States and Afghanistan.",
        "He was apprehended in Afghanistan in November of 2001 and in that context, the longstanding practice of the United States, ever since the ratification of the Geneva Convention in the 1950s, has been that in that context, if someone claims the protections of the Geneva Conventions, they are afforded P.O.W.",
        "status until an Article Five hearing makes a determination of whether they deserve that status.",

        "It, this seems like a perfect example of what I find very frustrating about the contradictions and the way we've been prosecuting the war on terror, because many people, including the president himself, have argued that the war on terror is really against an ideology or a movement.",
        "And therefore, actions like these military tribunals really undermine our ability to mount a war against an ideology, because they make us look like hypocrites.",
        "They make us look very morally flexible on very basic principles that are supposedly at the foundation of the values and the democratic institutions that we're trying to promote.",

        "There is some fundamental threshold requirements that we must meet.",
        "However, in response to Chuck's question, remember most of these people, we are told, were picked up on the battlefield in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and so there's no question that a military commander has the authority, even under common international law, to prosecute those of the enemy who violate the laws of war.",
        "Again, that's the only jurisdiction here.",
