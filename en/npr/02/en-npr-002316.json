        "I also wonder if, given the nature of terrorist organizations, which is to say they're divided up into small cells so that no single individual can really compromise the whole organization, if we even need to go to these extremes, given that, I think they do undermine our credibility in a very crucial way, and in a way that makes it a lot harder to achieve an ultimate advance of and defeating this ideology.",
        "You know, so it's not, it's not is there a legal justification if you kind of have a smart enough lawyer, but are we really advancing our own cause most effectively by doing this?",

        "It doesn't have any effect on the argument.",
        "The question is, are the tools that the president has claimed he has the authority to use, are they legally predicated, and do they meet fundamental minimum standards according to the Geneva Convention?",

        "And one other thing Neal, going back to something that David raised, which I think is very, very significant.",
        "How the court decides this case in the context of a military commission will definitely spill over into the views on how much authority the president has in other aspects of his fight against the war on terrorism, whether it be surveillance domestically, whether it be authorizing the CIA to do things.",
        "This case is a watershed case dealing with the ultimate authority the president and the war on terrorism, and we need law in this area.",
        "And I should correct myself before the emails come pouring in.",
        "I think later that same month, in December 1941, the United States declared war on Germany and Italy too, so, all right, I sit corrected.",

        "Remember that the government's argument, through Paul Clement, is basically that when we are at a time of war, the president must be given great deference, and given the authority to fight the war as the Commander in Chief.",

        "Again, if in fact we are at war, and the court is going to have to wrestle with this implicit question, then the president should be accorded those tools.",

        "Would they win on all the issues?",
        "I mean, if they split four to four on all of the, I mean, for example, the jurisdiction case, the law at issue here was not even passed by Congress by the time, when that lower court made its ruling.",

        "Yes, they could say five to three that we have the jurisdiction to hear this case, but then on the merits we're split four-four.",

        "Um, my question is regarding the Guantanamo prisoners in general, not necessarily Mr. Hamdan specifically.",
        "I was wondering about the issue, the basic issue is that these prisoners were picked up on the battlefield.",
        "And I was wondering, is there any evidence to suggest otherwise?",
        "Because I have encountered evidence in multiple places that some of these prisoners were not necessarily in fact picked up on the battlefield.",
        "I was wondering if that would have any influence on the Supreme Court.",
        "I think the solution is to think about the city problems, to think about solutions to them on a metropolitan basis.",
        "Things like the collection of sales tax, the sharing of property tax revenues that feed the school.",
        "But I could imagine about 90 mayors who would have a stake in that not happening.",
        "That's correct, Neal.",
        "And again, what Brad's talking about is the United States' argument that it can detain enemy combatants as long as the war on terrorism goes on.",
        "And the screening mechanism which the government has set up to deal with that is what's called the Combatants Status Review Tribunals.",
        "That's not really at issue directly in the case of the court heard this morning.",
        "That issue is awaiting a decision in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.",
        "But obviously there are related issues here.",
        "That court in the District of Columbia will probably wait to see what the Supreme Court does with regard to military commissions.",
        "But the question of can we detain them for as long as the war goes on is really a different question, that if we can prove a violation of the law of war, rather than just that they were enemy combatants, can we prosecute them in a military commission in a criminal type of proceeding, and what procedures must we use to do that.",
        "Brad, does that answer your question?",
        "Yes, thank you very much.",
        "I appreciate it.",
        "Thanks for the call.",

        "This is going to be going through the courts for years, it seems safe to say.",
        "Yes, there are quite a few cases coming along.",
        "I think in regard to the last call, we don't really know the answer to the question of who are these men who are being held at Guantanamo?",
        "There's really not been a very good public accounting of that.",
        "There's a Seaton Hall law professor who did sort of an analysis based on the government's own interviews with these men, and says something like only five percent were picked up by American troops.",
        "Most of them, as you said, Neal, were handed over by Pakistanis or whatever, sometimes for a bounty.",
        "Very few of them were actually found on the battlefield.",
        "Don Rumsfeld said early on, these were the worst of the worst.",
        "And they created the image that these were really hard-core terrorists.",
        "I don't think we -- there's a lot of independent evidence to say one way or the other as to who these 500, 400 or 500 men are.",
        "Were they really big fish and really terrorists, really al-Qaida fighters?",
        "Or where they people who happened to be foreign, Arab men in Afghanistan when the Pakistani troops and the American troops said we want to round up foreigners who are here in Afghanistan?",
        "So, I think it's a long ways to go before we have a real accounting as to who are the people being held at Guantanamo.",
        "And Scott Silliman, yes, these hundreds of men being held at Guantanamo, they are all men, by the way, but then there is another category of prisoners, al-Qaida seniors, who are being held we don't know where, under what conditions we don't know, and we don't know if they're ever going to be charged with anything.",
        "That's correct Neal, because the Supreme Court's decision of a year and a half ago, which started all this going as far as giving these detainees at Guantanamo Bay some access to our federal courts, does not include anyone held outside of Guantanamo Bay.",
        "They are in a legal limbo right now.",
        "But you mention American citizens.",
        "Your listeners need to know we are still waiting to see whether the Supreme Court will grant cert in another major case, which is Jose Padilla, and whether he could have been held in military confinement without access to a lawyer, without being charged, for almost four years.",
        "That case is still pending in the Supreme Court's docket.",
        "That's another big case.",
        "We need decisions in both of them."
