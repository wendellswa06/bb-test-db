        "For several months now, scientists have been reporting that some oil from BP's blown-out well was staying underwater.",
        "Christopher Reddy from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts told a news conference yesterday, this was a big surprise.",
        "If you'd asked me - and I've been studying oil spills for 15 years - whether or not you would see oil in the subsurface, I would said, no - doesn't oil float?",
        "That's fascinating, he says, but also troublesome, because if scientists don't know where the oil is, they don't know what harm it might be causing.",
        "In June, Reddy and his colleagues from Woods Hole, took a research boat to the scene of the spill.",
        "They lowered a sensor deep into the water and towed it in a large circle around the blown-out well, looking for particular hydrocarbons that are easy to detect.",
        "The sensor picked up a signal southwest of the well, in a layer of water 3,000 feet down.",
        "Richard Camilli, another researcher from Woods Hole, says they then sent down a new device, a small unmanned submarine with sensors onboard, called Sentry.",
        "And we had Sentry fly at a constant depth in kind of a zigzag pattern, moving out from the well site, tracking the plume.",
        "The hydrocarbons were highly diluted in the water.",
        "They were coming from the well but they weren't spreading out in all directions.",
        "They followed an invisible underwater channel just over a mile wide and 650 feet deep.",
        "The researchers tracked that channel southwest for 22 miles, until bad weather forced them to stop."

        "Murawski says more reports are coming, about oil in the deep sea around the well.",
        "But he'd like to see more scientists working in other areas, on the continental shelf, for instance, the wide, shallow areas closer to shore.",
        "This is the area where fisheries primarily occur; now we've got a very vigorous fisheries seafood safety monitoring program, but we need to do water chemistry up there as well.",
        "Murawski says he's drafting plans to expand such research, gradually painting a more complete picture of where the spilled oil went.",
