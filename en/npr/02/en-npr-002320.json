        "The volunteers are trained in genetics.",
        "Here's what they are doing.",
        "They have two boxes of puzzle pieces.",
        "One box is small.",
        "It's the unidentified bodies from Katrina.",
        "They don't know the names of these people, but they have DNA from their bones.",
        "The other box has a lot more pieces, hundreds of families who have reported a relative who's missing and still unaccounted for.",
        "What this team is trying to do is to see whether the DNA from any of the bodies matches DNA taken from any of the families.",
        "A match means a family finally knows what happened to a loved one.",
        "Amanda Sozer says the problem is the volunteers have to find those families, brothers, aunts, sisters, fathers, daughters, and take a swab of cells from the inside of their cheeks.",
        "This is much more complex than it sounds because these families are located all over the United States, all over the world and they move.",
        "They may be in a hotel in Texas and then after they are out of that hotel, they may move to Georgia and then they may move to Florida and this is the group that's trying to track them down to get those samples.",
        "This is Jennifer Gam, I'm calling from Louisiana Family Assistance Center.",
        "And you were listed as the person who called in a missing person and do you know her?",
        "Some of these geneticists helped identify victims from the World Trade Center.",
        "Then technicians went to the homes of missing people and got DNA from a toothbrush or hairbrush and compared it to the human remains.",
        "Tammy Pruet, the DNA manager for the Louisiana State Police, said that won't work here.",
        "We had people in homes that were destroyed, and there are no personal effects like toothbrushes are hairbrushes that we can look at.",
        "We have had a couple, I believe three to date, where we've used personal effects.",
        "We had a family, a distant family member who came in, they had a letter, an old letter from someone reported missing who had licked the envelope, and we were able to make the identification from the envelope.",
        "The saliva left on the stamp and envelope yielded DNA that matched the unidentified body.",
        "Pruet says it took three months after the hurricane to finish the paperwork and find people with the right skills to start this project.",
        "Even now they have to send some DNA samples all the way to Sarajevo in Bosnia, where experts learned this kind of detective work after investigating mass graves from the Balkan war.",
        "So far the Louisiana team has identified 126 bodies.",
        "Team member Laura Gun (ph) is a genetic technician with a company in Texas.",
        "She keeps coming back."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF BELL RINGING)",
        "It is very satisfying.",
        "Well, I think there's a number of things.",
        "I think by appointing someone who has emergency management experience, I think President Bush has taken one step out of many, but there's going to be many others that need to be taken, including kind of revamping the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
        "Revamping for the long haul or right now to deal with this emergency?",
        "Well, I think there's--both of those situations need to be addressed.",
        "Over the past several years, especially after 9/11, FEMA has been buried in a bureaucracy.",
        "It's had a lot of power and decision-making authority taken away from it.",
        "And we need to really rebuild this agency because a lot of good employees have left in light of some of the changes that have taken place lately.",
        "And replaced by people who don't necessarily have the requisite experience?",
        "Well, that's part of it.",
        "After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security was created, and frankly, some of the people who have established policies for the federal government in terms of responding to disasters may have come from different backgrounds, and they've created policies that in some cases people have scratched their head at.",
        "For example, the National Response Plan was initially written by someone in the Transportation Security Administration, not from someone from FEMA, and it was not until it was reviewed several times and went through several drafts and received many comments that it kind of was brought back in line.",
        "And so those types of things have taken place.",
        "And I also understand that a lot of the responsibilities that FEMA used to have are now being contracted out."

        "Yes.",
        "And that worries me to a great extent.",
        "Of course, we want to get everybody involved in emergency management whether they're from the non-profit sector or the private sector, but what happens is in some cases, you know, companies are there, they want to make their money, and then they move on to other things.",
        "And it's important for us to develop long-term capability to deal with disasters, and I worry that the private sector may not always have that commitment to the public.",

        "How do we prevent that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think there's two parts to your question here.",
        "First of all, FEMA has only 2,500 employees plus another 4,000 people who respond to disasters when they occur, but it's a very small agency.",
        "And frankly, it's woefully understaffed and undermanned, and so we need to put more resources into FEMA to make it the agency that we want and perhaps the agency that we once had.",
        "But in addition to that, I think you're right.",
        "There will be fraud.",
        "There will be people coming out of the woodwork to get their hands on some of this money whether it's to clean debris or to help rebuild and provide assistance or those even seeking assistance who don't deserve it.",

        "ALLEN: Well, we've kind of progressed through a couple different phases; the first one was a response phase and we were involved extensively in, as you know, urban search and rescue--the tough task of remains removal; the unwatering of the city and so forth.",
        "That has all been taken care of.",
        "We are shifting now to taking a look at some of the needs of our folks that went to evacuation shelters or were put up in hotels, and trying to come up with better transitional housing solutions for them.",
        "There was an extraordinary displacement of people as a result of this natural disaster, and I think when the numbers finally come in, we're going to find out it's one of the largest displacements of US populations after one of these events in our history, and trying to reconcile where these people need to go and get them into the housing is probably the biggest challenge I've got before me right now.",
        "As you know, FEMA had goal of getting everybody out of emergency shelters by last weekend.",
        "It was not able to realize that goal.",
        "How many people still need shelter?",
        "Vice Adm.",
        "ALLEN: Well, you have to look at the entire population.",
        "We had approximately 1.5 million people that evacuated the New Orleans area.",
        "And we, at one point in early September, we had about 270,000 people in shelters.",
        "That's down to less than 10,000 right now, and those numbers are dwindling off, and we will ultimately take care of all that.",
        "I wasn't held to a fast deadline on the 15th of October; it was a goal; we tried to achieve it, but I think there are certain cases, especially special needs folks where you need to make sure they're taken care of before you move them out of shelters.",
        "But there's a much larger number of people that were put up temporarily in hotels and motel rooms, and that is a bad transient situation for anybody, and we're trying to get them into more permanent solutions right now.",
        "That larger figure--upwards--I think we're talking about in the hundreds of thousands now, dispersed all over the 50 states, is the real challenge that lies before us right now.",
        "Do you still have people living in tents?",
        "Unidentified Woman #8: Yes.",
        "Sir, as you can imagine, for a potential recruit between the ages of 18 and 25 where an individual is thinking about their first career choice and an early start to their life, a parent, a mother or father, a grandparent, a high school coach--these are very important people.",
        "In fact, we call them influencers, they are so important in influencing critical decisions that young people make early in their lives.",
        "Has the Army done research on this point?",
        "Oh, yes, sir.",
        "In fact, we have focus groups on these sorts of issues on a regular basis.",
        "We speak with aspiring recruits as well as with their parents, and we know from the research that we've done that parents want to know as many details as possible about what it means to serve in the Army today, and of course, the issues dealing with everything from career choices to safety of their son or daughter.",
        "It's very important to them and it's very important to the Army.",
        "We've gone so far as to even include on our www.GoArmy.com Web site a special Web page to answer questions that parents may have.",
        "Now this is true, you say, even though young men and women between 18 and 24 you're talking about--they don't need their parents' permission.",
        "They do not, but as you can imagine, it's very important when you are making a major decision early in your life, be it a career choice, purchasing an automobile or a house or an apartment or some other expense, that they wish to get information from people who mean so much in their lives and to seek their knowledge and guidance before making an important decision, and we encourage that as well."
