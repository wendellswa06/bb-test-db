        "One issue though--a public opinion survey suggests that parents are very worried about the violence in Iraq.",
        "What can the Army do to counter that?",
        "Well, obviously, we've in fact got soldier recruiters on the trail today in cities like New York and San Antonio, actual soldiers who have just returned from the front lines in Afghanistan and Iraq, to sit down with the parents and talk with them about their personal experiences, what they saw and what they went through and how they succeeded in both countries and around the world.",

        "What's the message for parents there?",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "The message behind this ad is very much what you told your listeners in the set-up for today's program, which is the young people tell us in focus groups, `I want to be acknowledged for what I'm doing in my career.",
        "I also want to be something larger than myself, a strong link in a strong chain,' and we believe that you could not ask for a better opportunity than the US Army to serve your nation, to also do what's right for you and your family.",
        "Remember, in many cases, these young recruits are also already married, so this is an important decision not only for them and with their parents, but also their entire family.",
        "But this is a very different approach from the older peacetime approach of, you know, this is a job and you can get great training and benefits and go on to college.",
        "We're still doing the--as you referred to it--the older approach as well, as you can imagine.",
        "In fact, bonuses range up to a maximum of $20,000 now.",
        "But at the same time, though, we found last year with the first series of ads similar to this that we ran in February, as well as this year, that we need to make certain that in a time of a global war on terrorism that we also address some of the concerns that are associated with the safety of young men and women serving in the Army or in the armed forces today.",
        "So that's why we take the time to point out in these ads and in the Web site, GoArmy.com, exactly what is the situation today and what a young person can expect.",

        "Unidentified Man #3: Good training?",
        "Unidentified Man #2: It's the Army.",
        "Mmm.",
        "This is a somewhat different strategy.",
        "Well, the strategy, as you can imagine, has been through the years to emphasize, back to the time some 30 years ago when the all-volunteer armed forces first started with great success over the past three decades, the importance that young people place on education, be it college education, be it military training education.",
        "And in both, as you can imagine, we offer money for college, we offer opportunities to learn leadership, organizational skills that are so important, be it for a short-term career or a lifetime career with us, the US Army.",
        "Sure.",
        "Exactly.",
        "As the Army falls short of its recruiting goals, there have been some stories, including one in The New York Times, about the difficulties that recruiters themselves are facing, terrible problems meeting what they see as their mission, because of--well, I think the article quoted one man who said, `I would rather be in Iraq getting shot at than face the ridicule and anger of some of these parents that I talk to.'",
        "Well, obviously in the world where we are getting a great deal of information about both the good and unfortunately the bad that's associated on a day-to-day basis with achieving a long-term goal such as peace and stability on a national level, you do have people that are very much concerned about this, they want to know more about it, they want to talk to the recruiter about this with a great deal of sincerity, and yes, this is a time where our recruiting force is rising to a number of challenges.",
        "We also know that this is a time historically where as the colleges and high schools in America graduate during the May and June period, that this also is a great supply of new people who are very much interested in a potential career, be it with the Army or another armed services, or with a corporate counterpart to us.",
        "So we are very much--we take a great deal of comfort in the fact that because of the nature of what we do today and how we are literally serving and protecting the world, that the Army is an excellent opportunity for a personal transformation, for leadership, for education, for benefits for their family for young people to consider.",
        "I apologize to some of our callers.",
        "We've been having some telephone problems.",
        "We're I think sorting them out, so they should be done shortly, so again, our apologies.",
        "Here, though, is an e-mail we got from Ann Kent(ph) in Independence, Missouri.",
        "`My 17-year-old son, a junior in high school, has been inundated by recruiters at his high school as well as through the mail.",
        "While he's seriously contemplating the military as a career, I am extremely opposed to it because I do not want to lose my son fighting in an unethical and unjustified war in Iraq.",
        "As long as the current administration's in power, I will fight him on this with everything I have.",
        "Of course, 17-year-olds do need their parents' permission.",
        "In general, though, is that representative of some of the resistance that you're trying to counter with some of these ads?"

        "Well, obviously, our young men and women who serve today in the armed forces don't have the luxury of questioning the decisions of our government, but it is the government's policy that we will help in this particular situation to help this nation to get back on its feet, so while we obviously talk with the parents sincerely about that, we also talk with the parents about what it means to serve in the Army today, the opportunities that are available for a young man or a young woman, the many career fields that are available, the bonuses for considering the US Army, the college education that's available.",
        "So you must obviously sit down with a parent, concerned or very much propense to the idea, and let them know if they in fact want to know more about it on behalf of their child what to expect.",
        "And as you can imagine with anything, half of coming to understand something is the research and the talking with others, and that's why we're trying to reach parents today so that they too feel like they're part of the process, because they are and it's very important that they also share in any decision that a young person in their family makes, and we encourage them to do so.",
        "In our society today, as you know, there are fewer and fewer people who've had the opportunity to serve in the armed forces as grandparents pass away, to include, as you know, this weekend when we honored the victory in Europe events on their 60th anniversary.",
        "So we encourage veterans, we encourage officials, clergy (technical difficulties) and parents to all share in the experience and help in advising young people when they consider an important career, to include one with the US armed forces in the US Army.",

        "But when you have fewer than a dozen members of Congress having children in the armed forces, it's a scandal, and I was addressing a group of recruiters this past fall and I said, `Would you prefer to have your advertising budget tripled or have Jenna Bush join the Army?",
