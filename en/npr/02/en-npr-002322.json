        "One other point here, too.",
        "It's interesting that the two most famous names that come out of the Iraq War so far have been Jessica Lynch and Lynndie England, both, you know, working class young women up in Appalachia.",
        "You're not seeing the Ivy League, you're not seeing Northwestern students.",
        "I have done some studies on college campuses as to how one could recruit college graduates, which is not the market that the military's aiming for right now, and I think that's the direction that we have to go into.",
        "They're not aiming for college graduates.",
        "They're going to high schoolers.",
        "They're going for high schoolers, and by the way, if you're talking about the influence of parents, of course it's very, very pronounced, but if you're talking about college graduates, that influence is going to be less so.",
        "I surveyed students at UCLA, a major state university, at the University of Illinois at Chicago, more of a working-class university, and my own university at Northwestern, a selective private university.",
        "And the results were similar across the board.",
        "These students were interested in educational benefits and a short-term enlistment.",
        "In the military, they're always trying to get career soldiers; these people are not going to be career soldiers.",
        "We now graduate 1.2 million bachelor degree students every year.",
        "If you could get 5 percent of those to join the military, our recruiting woes would be over.",
        "And a third of those say they intend to go to graduate school, which makes that interesting; there are more people going on to graduate school today than in the post-World War II generation that went on to college.",
        "I might add, too, Neal, there's an interesting historical footnote here, that starting in late 1943 in World War II you could no longer volunteer for the military.",
        "You could only enter as a draftee.",
        "This is because too many of the greatest generation were trying to join the Navy or the Army Air Corps, like today they're joining the Navy or the Air Force, in order to stay out of the ground combat arms.",
        "That seems to be pretty much of a perennial concern.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line, and Dave is calling.",
        "Dave's with us from Oakland, California.",
        "Yeah, hi, How are you?",
        "OK.",
        "I just had a quick question.",
        "I don't have any personal experience or I haven't done any extensive research, but I was just curious why it seems on the surface to be more prevalent that recruiting occurs in neighborhoods that tend to have less income--in other words, you don't see tons of recruiting done at Beverly Hills, but you know, in other smaller communities like inner cities and places where there are lower incomes--you don't really see the predominant resource allocation toward recruiting there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Oakland as opposed to maybe Berkeley, I guess is what you're saying, Dave.",
        "You could say that."

        "Is that accurate, Charles Moskos?",
        "Yes, it's accurate because you have, again, essentially was is a marketplace influence recruiting strategy rather than trying to get a true cross section and getting our elite youth into--the children of our elite into the military.",
        "No country, by the way, will accept casualties on the long term unless the children of the privileged classes are also putting their lives on the line, which is not happening here in Iraq.",
        "It's interesting that, you know, in terms of killed in action we've lost about 1,100 in Iraq.",
        "By historical standards not a large number; of course, still very tragic.",
        "Yet the support for the war has dropped precipitously because we do not have the children of Congress, we don't have the children of the Fortune 400, we don't have the college graduates serving in the military.",
        "I think this is the real problem.",
        "Especially, one would think, Charles, if the emphasis is on this new patriotism and leadership, which they seem to be stressing in these ads.",
        "No, what we have in America now is patriotism light.",
        "People talk it but they're not willing to do it.",
        "They're not even willing to cut back on buying, you know, gas-guzzling vehicles, much less having their children serve in the military.",
        "I think the people at GM may disagree with you on that last point, but go ahead.",
        "But there is an appeal, and it has to be try something different in your life, that you'll meet a cross-section of Americans that you'll never run into again, from different races, ethnic groups, regions, class background.",
        "That's what makes the military experience a memorable one.",
        "If you ask the--by the way, the survey data's very interesting, too, that the average draftee is more pro-military than is the average volunteer veteran.",
        "Draftees, by the way, had a lower desertion rate in both Worlds War II, the war in Korea and the war in Vietnam than did volunteers, and because they tended to represent more of the middle-class background, and that's the kind of soldier we have to get in there.",
