        "You're on the air.",
        "Hi.",
        "I guess my--I was going to relate an experience that I have with my son, who was recruited out of high school by the Marines, and the Marine recruiter called him, was very persistent in calling him at home, making promises to him that he would never carry a weapon, never be sent to Iraq, Iran--I mean, excuse me, Iraq; that he would be only in the Marine Corps band, because my son played a musical instrument in high school.",
        "And I finally--you know, I am of the Vietnam era, and I am not a supporter of the war in Iraq, and I finally had to get on the phone with the recruiter and tell him to leave my son alone, that he would not be allowed--I would not allow him to go into the Marines, and that he was misleading him and promising him, you know, college education funds, etc., and that he could not possibly promise that he would not be fighting.",
        "And your son was 17 or below 18 years old?",
        "He was 17.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He was 17 years old.",
        "Christopher Joyce, NPR News.",
        "Well, Charlie Moskos, we hear a lot about these promises made by recruiters that are not kept.",
        "Is this a problem?",
        "Well, it's going to be--well, it's a minor problem.",
        "Of course, there's always going to be--any system, civilian, military, is going to have people bending the rules.",
        "But it's going to become more of an increased problem because of the difficulties in recruitment that we're hearing about, both from the parents and from the recruiters.",
        "You're also going to find, in addition to sort of perhaps misleading people, there'll be a dropping of standards, both officially and unofficially, of people with less than a high school diploma that will be formally recruited, but at the same time you're going to see maybe wink, wink, nudge, nudge, let's look at certain other problems that somebody might have and not put that on the record anymore.",
        "That a recruiter would tell a potential Marine recruit that he will never have to hold a weapon is, of course, just a scandal.",
        "The first requirement of every Marine is to be a rifleman."

        "You're welcome.",
        "Some, Charlie Moskos, have suggested that one way to at least repair the problem of numbers of recruits is to recruit foreigners.",
        "Well, I think that's on the horizon.",
        "What's interesting--I'm, of course, a pro-draft person.",
        "I think this country needs a three-tier draft: one for the military; one for homeland security, which is also understaffed; and then civilian service in a variety of roles as well.",

        "He was a high-school dropout at the time, but then through--the Army straightened him out, then he went on to college, law school and, of course, eventually Congress.",
        "So it works both ways.",
        "You can upgrade people who come from impoverished backgrounds; at the same time, you need to get privileged youth to serve.",
        "But this having a foreign legion, which we're obviously going to call a freedom legion in America, is something that's on the horizon.",
        "The other thing that's going to happen, too, is more and more work will be civilian contracted out, which, by the way, affects re-enlistments.",
        "And here's a Special Forces soldier who can make 10 times that money in Iraq working for a civilian contractor than he would serving in the military.",
        "The military's just not offering certain Special Forces re-enlistment bonuses of up to a hundred thousand dollars in order not to have them join a--private contracting firms.",
        "You know, it's also interesting, for example, that West Point today is guarded by civilian contractors, not by soldiers anymore.",
        "This would be perfect for a short-term enlistment.",
        "I think that's the other option and one that I am proposing is that generous educational benefits coupled with a short enlistment, say, of 15 months, you could get people.",
        "I surveyed my students at Northwestern this past fall and said, `If I could forgive you your student loans and pay for your tuition to graduate school, would you be willing to be a prison guard at Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo?",
        "And 25 percent said they'd seriously consider it, not that they would do it.",

        "Vice Adm.",

        "(Technical difficulty) accomplished; the city has been unwatered, and the city is basically dry.",
        "The Corps of Engineers is going through an exhaustive survey of all the levee systems in and around New Orleans, including down the Mississippi River to Plaquemines Parish, which is the basic entry into the Mississippi River from the Gulf.",
        "There are a number of levee systems down there, not only federal levees systems but private levee systems, and we've pretty much completed repairs on all the levee systems.",
        "The goal is to bring them up to pre-Katrina standards by the start of the next hurricane season, and so the city can withstand the type of storm that the levees were authorized to do when they were built.",
        "I imagine that you hear reports of things like Hurricane Wilma and keep your fingers crossed.",
        "Vice Adm.",
        "ALLEN: Well, there are concerns about Wilma because even if Wilma comes ashore in Florida, if there is a storm surge into Louisiana we're going to have to assess the effect that might have on the current heights of the levees that are there, and those are the kind of assessments we're doing right now in advance of the surge.",
        "Now, as you mentioned, it's the Corps of Engineers that has authority to rebuild the levees to the height and strength of before Katrina, and again the hope is that that can be done by the start of the next hurricane season.",
        "Can you offer protection to residents of New Orleans since--in the meantime?",
        "We're not out of hurricane season.",
        "Are there plans in place to work with local officials to evacuate the city if the necessity should arise?",
        "Vice Adm.",
        "ALLEN: Well, that's exactly what we've been doing, and as the Corps of Engineers is aggressively repairing the levees and building them back up to the pre-Katrina levels, what we have done is especially in Orleans Parish, St. Bernard Parish and Plaquemines Parish is look at evacuation plans on how we would remove the populations if we needed to do that.",
        "This is a finely balanced risk-management equation where you need to repopulate the cities, they need to restart their economic engines.",
        "A lot of these cities don't have the revenues to pay their work forces and so forth, and you want to be able to help them come back.",
        "But at the same time, you want to have enough safety net where if a storm's approaching, you can evacuate those people, and we are working with those parishes on evacuation plans that we would execute if we needed to.",
        "In the hope that maybe there's no additional problems from the weather in the next month or so, clean-up, debris removal--how is that going?",

        "We also after negotiating with the state and gaining right-of-entry approval from private homeowners can do that also.",
        "There are some legal issues associated with that because there's some indemnification required.",
        "If for some reason the property was damaged, but we have a very, very robust debris removal project that's going on right now, and actually we call it debris management because, depending on what you recover, it's disposed of in different ways.",
        "Vegetation is chipped and reduced; you have what they call white goods, which are like refrigerators.",
