        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "(Reading) The point is, said Anna, as her friend came back from the telephone on the landing, the point is that as far as I can see, everything's cracking up.",
        "The Golden Notebook\"\" has been called one of the great and most complex novels of the 20th century, and Lessing, one of the century's most clear-eyed observers.",
        "Indeed, even in the science fiction which she considered her finest work, Lessing's characters live firmly within and are utterly the products of history.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Well, my life certainly has been.",
        "First, it's been dominated by war, right from the start.",

        "Lessing was raised by British parents in what was then called Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.",
        "She left school at 13, left home at 15, married for the first time at 19.",
        "By the age of 30, Lessing had married again, become disenchanted with her second husband and his communist beliefs, and moved to London with their son."
