        "The NIH's Laura Lyman Rodriguez says most genetic data is more tightly protected.",
        "But she acknowledges the new study shows that the privacy of research subjects can't be guaranteed.",
        "And what we really think needs to happen at this point in time, now that this threshold has been reached where individuals have been identified through the connection of research and non-research information, is to have a public dialogue.",
        "A public dialogue about how best to protect privacy without inhibiting research.",
        "In the meantime, the NIH has removed some details about the people whose genetic data is on the Internet, in an effort to keep a similar privacy breach from happening again."
