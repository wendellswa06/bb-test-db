        "Rhee says he asked Giffords to show him two fingers, and she did.",
        "He says the congresswoman is not able to talk because she's on a ventilator and she can't see anything because her eyes are closed due to the nature of her injuries.",

        "That's the part that controls the right side of the body and speaking in most people.",

        "Overall, this is about as good as it's going to get.",
        "You know, when you get shot in the head, and the bullet goes through your brain, the chances of you living is very small, and the chances of you waking up and actually following commands is even much smaller than that.",
        "So this so far has been a very good situation.",

        "We can use medical agents to dry out the brain.",
        "We can literally put a tube into the center of the brain, into one of the center fluid spaces, to measure pressure and then relieve that pressure if necessary.",
        "But because she looks good right now, there's no need for that."

        "I dont want to make it sound like 3.8 is nothing.",
        "But thats what they were expecting.",
        "And they were actually a little nervous, maybe they wont get it all.",
        "So when the number was 5.3 billion for this short-term immediate response money and almost 10 billion for the long-term, the Haitians were really thrilled and really surprised.",
        "It was a lot more than they expected.",
        "You noted the challenge is to make sure the money is spent well.",
        "I understand there is also a fundamental tension at the conference.",
        "Countries want to donate but few have faith that the Haitian government is able to execute this reconstruction on their own.",
        "Does the fact that more money was raised than expected mean countries perhaps are more comfortable with Haitis ability to govern and spend that money wisely?",
        "They came up with a solution that seems to have been a rip-roaring success.",
        "I mean, you nailed it on the head.",
        "The issue here is that the Haitian government consistently scores as one of the most corrupt in the world, one of the least well-governed countries in the world.",
        "By the way, thats stuff that the president and prime minister have told me.",
        "So its not like a fringe group thats saying it.",
        "I mean, everyone in Haiti says it and everyone in the international donor community says it.",
        "What theyve come up with is a very complicated system of sort of three different international governing bodies.",
        "The full details arent in yet.",
        "But whats clear is at least for this initial round of five-plus billion dollars, an international commission co-chaired by former President Bill Clinton and current Haitian president Rene Preval will oversee that spending, along with Haitian government officials and a whole lot of experts from all over the world.",
        "So I guess that was enough to make donors around the world say, okay, we trust that our money will be wisely spent.",
        "And did the money come with any conditions?",
        "Thats the big question.",
        "And again, the presidents economic advisor, Gabriel Gurette(ph) was telling me, I still dont know the conditions, Ive really got to sit down with these numbers and figure it out.",

        "Look, my product is made of the United States, under regulations that are actually followed, and you know, I have an edge here over the people who import from China.",
        "I haven't seen that, but you're making a good point, and that is regardless of what the government may do, and regardless of what might be able to do on inspections or other things to ensure that products are safe, there's the tough lesson of the marketplace that's going to go on here.",
        "And if producers in China are not living up to standards or producers anywhere else, you know, I think that the marketplace will in turn teach them that it's important to make sure they're living up to those standards.",
