        "The way that unions view immigrant workers is changing.",
        "For over a century, organized labor has had a wary attitude toward immigrants.",
        "The reasoning was, the more foreign workers in the labor market, the less bargaining power for unions.",
        "Recently some unions have made a dramatic shift.",
        "As NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports, they are now recruiting immigrants, in some cases no matter the worker's legal status.",
        "In the mid-1990s, Gig Rittenauer was a roofer in Ohio, a loyal member of the United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers, and Allied Workers.",
        "He was frustrated by the increasing number of immigrants he'd see staffing construction jobs.",
        "So Rittenauer and some colleagues started keeping cameras in their cars and paying random visits to work sites.",
        "We'd take pictures.",
        "Loved to pop out a camera and just start snapping pictures.",
        "And it really - it drives them off because they know that they're illegal.",
        "And that was a ploy just to scare them really.",
        "The ploy made Rittenauer feel like he was having an effect protecting his union job, but eventually he realized the immigrant workers weren't going away for good and the federal government wasn't going to make them.",
        "That's when Rittenauer decided that if an immigrant is here working anyway, it's best if he joins the union.",
        "If he doesn't, he's going to continue to do our work for much, much less wage and benefits, probably no benefits.",
        "And it's just the nature of the beast.",
        "You either rise people up or you let them pull you down.",
        "These days, Rittenauer travels the country recruiting for the roofers union.",
        "This week, it's Baton Rouge where Hurricane Katrina brought a rush of Hispanic workers and where more recent damage from Gustav is keeping roofers in high demand.",
        "Rittenauer and his colleague, Baldo Diaz, have pulled up to a bustling commercial construction site.",
        "They find the roofers, a dozen men, all Hispanic, sitting along a chain-linked fence on lunch break.",
        "The recruiters ask about the project, how things are going.",
        "The roofers union does not check workers' legal status, but Rittenauer says the companies he sends them to likely will.",
        "After a few minutes, Diaz launches into the benefits of union membership.",
        "(Spanish spoken)",
        "It means better salaries and benefits, he tells them.",

        "She says the assumption has been that these workers were only here temporarily, so wouldn't invest in a union, and that they were too afraid to join, worried that if their legal status were discovered, they'd be fired.",
        "Milkman says these are real concerns.",
        "And stepped-up federal immigration rates have probably heightened fears.",
        "But Milkman says recruiters have learned something else too.",
        "Undocumented workers had experienced things much riskier than trying to form a union.",
        "There's one immigrant worker I once interviewed told me, she said, in my country - this was El Salvador - if you organize a union, they kill you.",
        "Here you lose a job that pays the minimum wage.",
        "In fact, Milkman says, studies show foreign-born workers are more receptive to joining a union than the native-born.",
        "And she's seen that eagerness grow since the spring of 2006.",

        "And most experts say not to use these products with children without a doctor's approval.",
        "But melatonin and other herbal supplements have been available in pill form for decades, so why is adding them to food and drinks suddenly all the rage?",
        "Dr. Shaman says putting the herbs in sodas and brownies automatically targets them at teens and young adults, who are more likely to be up late and have poor sleeping habits.",
        "And Mayo's Brent Bauer says marketing them as natural alternatives to medicines adds to the appeal."

        "The president, unlike any other party to these negotiations, has put forward detailed spending cuts, as well as detailed revenue proposals.",
        "All together, that plan calls for about $600 billion worth of spending cuts over the next decade.",

        "Okay.",
        "What kind of cuts is the president actually talking about?",
        "Well, it runs the gamut, Robert.",
        "About $30 billion in cuts to agricultural subsidies, cuts to federal retirement benefits, a $4 billion cut to flood insurance.",
        "Medicare, of course, is the big enchilada, although most of the cuts the White House is proposing here don't affect the benefits that Medicare beneficiaries receive, but would instead affect the payments to health care providers.",
        "For example, reduced payments to teaching hospitals.",
        "One big cut would be demanding bigger discounts on prescription drugs.",
        "That alone would total about $135 billion over a decade.",
        "And also, the White House wants to strengthen the so-called IPAD, that's the expert panel that's been set up to make recommendations to try to curb healthcare inflation in the Medicare program.",
        "Now, one thing the White House is not touching is Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.",
        "Remember, under the new health care law, states have the option of expanding their Medicaid programs to cover more of the poor and the White House doesn't want to do anything that would discourage states from exercising that option.",
        "Well, Republicans say they want to see bigger cuts in spending proposed by the Democrats or at least agreed to.",
        "What are they proposing?",
        "Yeah, they're calling for about twice the level of cuts that the Democrats have called for - $1.2 trillion, of which they'd like about half to come from the government's health care programs.",
        "Now, they haven't provided a lot of details, or really any details, of what those cuts might be.",
        "However, in the past, congressional Republicans have talked about things like raising the eligibility age for Medicare up to 67.",
        "Now right away, but over a period of time.",
        "That alone would save about $148 billion from the Medicare budget, although it's possible the government would have to pay some of that out again in subsidies to private health insurance because those folks between 65 and 67 would now perhaps be in the government health care exchanges.",
        "Republicans have also talked about cutting subsidies for private insurance under the new health care law and doing things like paying out Medicaid to states in block grants, which would grow more slowly.",
        "Now, one of the most complicated, but I gather one of the more important ideas in all of this is revising how we measure inflation.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "Right.",
        "There's something you might have heard talked about, the chain CPI, which is it's a technical adjustment to the way inflation is measured.",
        "And so inflation would grow more slowly.",
        "This would, over time, save the government money because, for example, Social Security cost of living adjustments would grow more slowly.",
        "It would also bring in more revenue because things like tax brackets would ratchet up more slowly.",
        "And over a decade, you're talking real money, something on the order of 250 to $300 billion.",
        "This is not without some controversy, but it's probably one of the easier changes to make."
