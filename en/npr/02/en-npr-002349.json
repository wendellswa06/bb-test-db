        "Last night, the scene was particularly frenzied, perhaps because this is an election year.",
        "That same circumstance led many lawmakers to believe there will be little appetite to take on even the scaled back agenda the president outlined in his speech.",
        "For instance, Republican Congressman Clay Shaw of Florida liked the president's call for a bipartisan commission to look at the problem of social security.",
        "But at the same time, Shaw couldn't hide his skepticism.",
        "God bless him if it will work.",

        "Though there were a few specifics Brownback generally liked what he heard.",
        "What I thought you saw though from him was a clear game plan, instead of this broad visionary type speech, which serves a lot of vision, but I thought you saw more of just a series of game plans of here's what we need to do to deal with pressing topics of the day.",
        "It was really the business of government it seemed like to me that he outlined and discussed.",

        "But let's not forget that 56,000 Israeli reservists were mobilized and gathered on the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip in preparation for a possible ground offensive.",
        "And although it's very hard to find Israelis who will say to you that they did not want to support the national cause and so on, there must be Israelis who are very relieved that they did not have to, at this stage, partake in that operation because I don't think there's much doubt that it would have been extremely messy.",
        "Leila, back to the issue of the negotiations.",
        "How big a sticking point in these talks is the issue of the Israeli blockade of Gaza going to be?",
        "Well, this was the major sticking point, the reason we didn't see a cease fire a day earlier because the Israelis have been really hesitant to ease this blockade on the Gaza Strip, essentially a siege on the territory of 1.7 million people, but also what Israel calls a protective measure for Israeli territory.",
        "So what they essentially did with this agreement was put it off.",
        "So the negotiations on how much easing there will be begin now.",
        "And also, Leila, I want to ask you quickly about the Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi.",
        "I mean, after his international diplomatic triumph arranging the cease fire, he also adopted some sweeping new powers domestically.",
        "What can you tell us happened there?",
        "He essentially now is an unaccountable leader.",
        "He is able to issue laws and decrees and they cannot be appealed in the court system.",
        "He also said that the court cannot dissolve the constituent assembly tasked with writing Egypt's most important constitution, nor the upper house of the parliament.",
        "So basically, for now, until the constitution is written, Mohamed Morsi has all the power in his hand.",
        "Prior to this, he already had both the executive and the legislative powers.",
        "So critics of Mohamed Morsi and also other political groups are really concerned that this is a new dictatorship in the making.",
        "And Philip, in Jerusalem, the death toll from the eight day conflict actually rose today with the death of another Israeli soldier.",
        "Can you describe what the mood is there?",
        "Well, I think the mood is very wary.",
        "And, yes, an Israeli reservist soldier, a 28-year-old captain died of his wounds, wounds that he received yesterday.",
        "Now that brings the number of Israeli dead to six.",
        "Of course, when you compare that with the Palestinian death toll estimated at 161, that is a great deal smaller.",
        "But nonetheless, these issues have great impact on public opinion and, of course, of extreme importance to those mourning the loss of life.",
        "So that has occurred during this tense period where people are evaluating the cease fire and some of this wariness, remember, is coming from the fact that only yesterday there was bus bombing in Tel Aviv and that is reviving for Israelis very unpleasant memories of the second Palestinian intifadah, which began just over a decade ago.",
        "That's Philips Reeves in Jerusalem and NPR's Leila Fadel in Cairo.",
        "Thank you both."
