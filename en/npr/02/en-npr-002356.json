        "That group came out with a new ethics guideline that basically said that if a doctor could not provide what they called quote, \"\"standard reproductive services\"\" that that doctor had the obligation to tell patients that upfront and to refer those patients to a doctor who would.",
        "And again we're not just talking about abortion here.",
        "We're talking about birth control, emergency contraception.",
        "Secretary Leavitt got in a fight with the board that certifies doctors about whether or not they would be willing to certify doctors, who refuse to refer, and that's basically what led to this argument and that's what led to these regulations.",
        "So this is obviously being fought by pro-choice groups, right?",
        "Yes it's being fought but not just by pro-choice groups.",
        "You've got the EEOC, The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that says that these regulations basically interfere with existing Civil Rights laws.",
        "You've got attorneys general who were worried about the way that this might conflict with other types of laws.",
        "You've got all kinds of possibilities, for instance you could have a doctor who would refuse to give an HIV test to a gay person because they morally objected to the fact that that person was a homosexual.",
        "So you've got basically all kinds of possible ramifications to these laws that go well beyond abortion and possibly well beyond birth control.",
        "So you've got objections coming from beyond the Abortion Rights Movement.",
        "All right.",
        "So come January 20th when there's a new president in town, can't he just simply over turn these regulations?",
        "Well, actually, the new president can't overturn these regulations, but because the administration has waited so long, it's possible that the new Congress can.",
        "There's something called the Congressional Review Act and because these regulations are coming so late in the administration they are falling within the window of that Congressional Review Act.",
        "There are expedited procedures.",
        "Congress would only have to get a majority vote in the House and Senate.",
        "And in the Senate it couldn't be filibustered and because these regulations are so controversial.",
        "It would be likely that this would be the type of regulation that could be taken up and overturned under the Congressional Review Act then the new President would merely have to sign it.",
        "But it sounds like a fairly lengthy process.",
        "It's not that lengthy.",
        "It's certainly a little more lengthy than some of the other things that President-elect Obama is expected to do on the Reproductive Rights front but it's certainly easier than having to go through the entire regulatory process again, to put through an entire rule and to go in and take more public comment.",
