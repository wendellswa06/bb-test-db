        "Drucker immigrated to America in 1937 and it was in his adopted country that he did his most influential work.",
        "In his very first book, \"\"The End of Economic Man,\"\" Peter Drucker analyzed the causes of totalitarianism, the insecurity, fear, depression and unemployment, the demons as he put it, that created the conditions for the emergence of a dictator.",
        "Joseph Maciariello was a friend and colleague who now teaches at the Drucker School of Management in Claremont, California.",
        "He explains how Peter Drucker was able to reshape modern management theory.",
        "He's been a critic but from the inside.",
        "He's been a friend of business, so he has spoken eloquently to executives about how to improve their performance while also being a critic.",
        "So, yeah, that's a tough act.",
        "Today, the idea that business management is a field worthy of serious academic study is uncontroversial, but before Peter Drucker, there really was no theory of management.",
        "His 18-month in-depth examination of General Motors led to the publication in 1946 of one of his most influential works, \"\"Concept of the Corporation.\"\" The book was disavowed by GM management.",
        "Within a decade, Drucker published the work that would seal his reputation as a business guru, \"\"The Practice of Management.\"\" Peter Senge, a senior lecturer at MIT who worked with Drucker, explains why the book holds up even today.",
        "One of the reasons his books in general, as well as the classic one in 1954, have held up is he has a remarkable ability to kind of intellectualize from a very practical foundation.",
        "So I think he's had a big impact on managers, not just academics who have read his material because they get a feeling this is a person who kind of knows what my life is like, knows what it feels like to actually be in an organization.",
        "Drucker counseled managers and union leaders to give employees more control over their work environment.",

        "(Soundbite from vintage PBS interview)",
        "Leadership is performance and not personality.",
        "What you accomplish and what you enforce others to perform is just a great function of making incredible demands, not making it easy for people.",
        "And Peter Drucker did not exempt himself from those incredible demands, writing well into his 90s, often on a manual typewriter.",
        "In a 2004 article for the Harvard Business Review, Drucker had some advice for today's business leaders: Listen first and speak last.",

        "In a country where one leader, Vladimir Putin, controls the political system from top to bottom, you might think voting is just a formality.",
