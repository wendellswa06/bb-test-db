        "A trillion dollars, how did we get here?",
        "First I should say that, you know, the Federal Reserve has disputed this number, and they point to the fact that the reason that the credit card rate is down, or the debt is down, is because people have literally torn up their credit cards.",
        "They can't afford to pay for them anymore.",
        "And you also have the fact that, you know, that the reason the debt for student loans are up is because college enrollment has skyrocketed.",
        "And continues to skyrocket, even though people know they're going to end up with college loans to pay.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now here's a figure, though, that is interesting.",
        "About 82 percent of the outstanding student lent today, as we speak, accrued over the last 10 years.",
        "From 1999 to 2011, student loans have grown 511 percent.",
        "That's amazing.",

        "I got a job I could not afford to keep.",
        "So it has influenced my job decisions.",
        "I have no children, as I wasn't going to start a family until I could pay off my loan debt, and now it's too late.",
        "I have moved 2,500 miles from my family for better job options and lower costs of living.",
        "Munsey says the jobs and the archival history he's fighting to save are treasures undervalued by both Congress and the public.",

        "I think there is no question that a trillion will be unbelievably helpful.",
        "We know that you can't get them all off immediately.",
        "So I think the way Secretary Geithner said is, we absolutely start, and everyone we get off, helps confidence and the question's going to be how, how far does it need to go?",
        "Well, that's the next question then.",
        "Could you end up in a situation where you do this investment, you get $1 trillion of bad debts off the books of banks and other institutions, and they still have several trillion dollars in debt; they're still zombie banks, as they're described; they're still not in a position to loan money; they still don't have enough capital?",
        "The important thing to realize, and something we've been trying to work with people that have been thinking about what we're doing, is to point out that it's just one of many things that we're doing.",
        "So, when the secretary of the Treasury announced his overall plan, right, it had the housing piece; it has the small business piece; it has the consumer and business lending initiative.",
        "The toxic assets is a piece, and we certainly think it's important - and so we have put this plan in place, we are executing this plan, and we're going to be monitoring it."

        "Wait, you're saying, you're not spending your last dime yet, on this particular program?",

        "We very much have the money that we think we need to make an important start on this program.",
        "Meaning that, if you decided that you needed to buy $2 trillion in bad assets - if that was necessary because other investors just don't come in any other way - you've got the resources now, without going to Congress, to do that?",

        "Right?",

        "And then what I have great confidence in is that the whole government will do what it needs to get the American economy working again.",

        "Do you feel like you're improvising now?",
        "I feel like we've learned a lot from the Great Depression.",
        "I think in the last 60 years there've been crucial innovations - and I'll give you just an example, right?",
        "Roosevelt had kind of the idea of doing fiscal stimulus - did a quite, sort of small, fairly half-hearted.",
        "I think one of the things that we learned is that if you have a major downturn, if you're going to do fiscal stimulus, it needs to be bold and aggressive.",
        "And that's exactly what we did.",
        "So I think we are definitely learning.",
        "I would say that we're certainly open to - I wouldn't call it improvisation - but to learning, right?",
        "If something doesn't work, we're going to be the first people to say, that didn't work, let's try Plan B.",
        "When you think about the average consumer - people right now are spending less, they're saving more - do you think that's a fundamental thing that is going to be true for years to come, and that any economic plan will have to take into account?",
        "I think that's very likely.",
        "We do know that people lost a lot of wealth when the stock market crashed, when the housing prices came down.",
        "And that is surely going to affect behavior - I think it's not necessarily a bad thing.",
