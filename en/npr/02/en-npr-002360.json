        "Everyone stands to benefit from such security, including Iran.",

        "But another senior official, who preferred to speak off the record was more explicit.",
        "We would like the United States to formulate an exit strategy for Iraq that would include, he said, training and equipping Iraq security forces, bolstering the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and rebuilding the country.",
        "There's not much difference between this formulation and President Bush's strategy for Iraq.",
        "And this official said the U.S.",
        "should work with Iran to achieve these goals, because he said the Americans know we have influence in Iraq.",
        "Instead, complained Foreign Minister Mottaki, the U.S.",
        "has only words of scorn for Iran's role in Iraq.",
        "(Through translator) The Americans are constantly looking for a scapegoat when it comes to Iraq so that they can blame that party for the failure of their policies.",
        "This is a commonly held view among Iranian leaders and experts in and out of government.",
        "The U.S.",
        "accuses Iran of smuggling deadly explosives into Iraq that have been used to kill American soldiers, and of training Iraqi militants to carry out such attacks.",
        "Just as the U.S.",
        "increasingly blames Iran for much of the instability in Iraq, Iranian leaders turn the same charge back on the U.S."

        "Sure, he's used this politically to say that do-nothing Congress, you know, has forced me to do this.",
        "But everybody agrees that unless Congress acts and takes up this issue in a bipartisan way, with the president, the whole pricing structure of higher education, as well as the long-term fixes that are needed to bring these loans and at least the debt down, the default rates down and so forth, which is creeping up, you're really not going to see much movement.",
