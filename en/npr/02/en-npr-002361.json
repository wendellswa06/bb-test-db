        "And I spent about three years trying to find a decent-paying job, going through my deferments for my loans, and couldn't find one.",
        "And now I decided just to go back to school - I'm a film major - in order to not have to repay those loans because I really don't have the money for it.",
        "But in essence, I'm borrowing more money.",
        "And I'm getting myself deeper in debt.",

        "You know, the one - not that this is less of a, I guess, sad story that we just heard, but when you consider that a lot of medical students who, you know, accrue debts of upwards of half-a-million dollars sometimes after they got done, what it's really doing in some areas is forcing people to go into the fields or the specialties that are least needed.",
        "I mean, when you look at some doctors or at least some people who said they wanted to be family practitioners, that they wanted to go to rural communities so that they could - you know, maybe the only doctor in the area, these are folks who are now having to make that tough, tough decision to say, well, look, I mean, I'm not going to get nearly as much as if I go into some other more lucrative area.",

        "As an aside, my brother is a 50-something unemployed Ph.D. humanities graduate with lots of debt and very few possibilities for employment.",
        "He's been unemployed for three years.",
        "And, you know, it's interesting that in stories that we've done, as you may recall, the Occupy Wall Street movement, you know, raised this precise issue of, you know, forgiving student debt and at least trying to compel the government to do more for some of these students who cannot find jobs.",
        "The bottom line is that a lot of people are having to just rethink what decisions they make.",
        "And, you know, for people with a humanities degree or a Ph.D. in that area, sure there's always teaching, but if you're not - you know, if you don't want to do that, then what are the options, really?",
        "And I think that that's why people are being a little bit more reflective about the specialties or the fields that they choose.",
