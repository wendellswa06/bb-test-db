        "The graduation rates for for-profit schools, like the one that Rachel went to, is only a fifth, 22 percent, for first-time, fulltime students in a four-year program.",
        "That's compared to 55 percent for most - or typical public institutions.",
        "The numbers are just all whacky when it comes to these for-profits.",
        "These are schools that rely almost entirely on students getting federal aid or some kind of loan.",
        "Ninety-seven percent of students who graduate from these institutions had to borrow money.",
        "Many are low-income students.",
        "A fourth of them have to - had to take out more than $40,000, on average.",
        "And, again, that's very high compared to public institutions where only 5 percent of students take up - or take as much as $40,000 in loans or more.",
        "So the Department of Ed has said we're going to crack down on these so-called bad actors.",
        "Now, there's been a lot of political debate over this on Capitol Hill because some folks there, especially Republicans, feel that, you know, this is an industry that is actually taking up the slack and giving students a more practical education.",
        "They're putting them in jobs earlier for better wages.",
        "And giving opportunities to people who don't have those opportunities are traditional jobs.",
        "Exactly, because these are people who often wouldn't have made it, or at least qualified for undergraduate education programs in a state school.",
        "But the problem here is that maybe, you know, the numbers speak for themselves that there's something really wrong if you graduate with that much debt and still don't have a job.",

        "These people are generally more employable, but if all we focus on is practical job training, we lose much of the purpose of a college education.",
        "I don't want to lose that liberal arts focus.",

        "I mean, you - the fact that you have a piece of paper in front of you, and you understand little or nothing that is on that paper - you know, certainly, it's the responsibility of an individual to find out what they're signing.",
        "But this is a process that could be so much easier and could be so much more simple.",
        "And yet, you know, it's often thought that it's in the interest of institutions and the bureaucracy to keep it complicated.",
        "So, you know, there really hasn't been a major move other than in the initial phase, during which people apply for financial aid - called the FAFSA - you know, to go ahead and streamline that process.",
        "But other than that, I mean, the whole lending business just hasn't done nearly enough to get people to understand what exactly they're signing on to."
