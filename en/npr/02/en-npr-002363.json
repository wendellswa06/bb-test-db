        "He also endorsed those red flag laws.",
        "But when reporters, including me, pressed him on it yesterday, he really didn't want to engage on the idea of background checks and kept coming back to mental illness, even going so far as to suggest building new facilities for those in need or, really, mental institutions, bringing back these institutions that went away decades ago.",
