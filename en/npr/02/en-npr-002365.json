        "Well, there was a peace accord, as you said, that took place and everyone was hopeful, I was very hopeful, that something was going to work.",
        "The problem is the government of General al-Bashir in Khartoum was less than forthcoming in terms of moving the peace agreement and establishing clear borders.",
        "And then the discovery of oil in the Southern Sudan made that land that much more valuable.",
        "So, the government in Khartoum was less interested in a full settlement.",
        "The Sudanese People's Liberation Movement, the political arm of the SPLA, had, some months ago, was prepared to pull out of the unity because it felt that the Khartoum regime of al-Bashir was really not serious.",
        "But then they backed off from that, and then, just recently, we had this major clash in the Sudan between the armies of their respective forces and, essentially, what appears to be almost an ethnic cleansing carried out by the Sudanese army against the people from the South in that particular city.",
        "I wonder if there is ever compassion fatigue about a place like Sudan, where you have not only this conflict, but, of course, Darfur.",
        "And how do you see Americans reacting to this?",
        "I mean, there's been a lot of celebrity activism, there's been a lot of, you know, sort of grassroots and intellectual community activism, but how much are ordinary Americans involved in or invested in trying to deal with these issues?",
        "Very important question.",
        "We could spend an hour talking about that.",
        "And the problem is that, yes, there is a certain level of fatigue that develops, but partly because we don't spend enough time trying to understand the situation.",
        "We look for simple answers, so we look at the Sudan sometimes as Islam versus Christianity.",
        "That's not really what's at stake.",
        "Or we look at it as the Arabs against the non-Arabs.",
        "We don't look at the problems that are the result of the boundaries that were set up.",
        "We don't look at the impact of the changing climate.",
        "We don't look at the issues of oil, we don't look at the corrupt government that's running the Sudan.",
        "So, we don't spend the time, and then what happens is we throw up our hands when there is no easy solution.",
        "I think part of what would help, frankly, is more programs like yours, where there's a deeper examination as to the roots of the situation.",
        "And, I think, then people would be less likely to fall into fatigue.",
        "But when you're looking for simple answers and they don't arrive, I think people would rather just hide under the pillows.",
        "Here's another case of tough decisions to be made.",
        "We have talked about attacks against African immigrants who come to South Africa.",
        "Now, it seems that there is Ugandan - attacks against Ugandans, there have been attacks against Zimbabweans and Mozambiquens.",
        "There's a new commission by the president to try to look into this attack - series of attacks.",
        "What's that commission trying to do?",
        "Well, this is a situation, Farai, that's been growing since '94, since the end of apartheid and the election of African National Congress.",
        "The problem is this.",
        "Fundamentally, the issue of poverty has not been tackled in a satisfactory way by the government.",
        "And you've had among the mass of poor people at the bottom, the so called black Africans, a very high level of patience actually waiting for something to turn around, and it hasn't.",
        "Instead, there's been much more emphasis on the development of a black capitalist class, opening up the borders to trade, et cetera.",
        "And not enough paid attention to the grievances of people at the base."

        "Power to Russia, they said, and, White Power!",
        "But I can tell you one thing, Neal, that Libya is not really waiting for details at this point.",
        "It seems very clear that people have decided that this is the end of the revolution, at least, you know, the end of the struggle to rid themselves of Moammar Gadhafi, and they're reveling in the moment.",
        "Grant Clark, thanks very much for your time, appreciate it.",
        "You're welcome, Neal, good talking to you.",
        "NPR producer Grant Clark on the line with us from Tripoli in Libya.",
        "Joining us now, NPR foreign correspondent Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, who covered much of the conflict in Libya, and she's now by phone with us from Dohar in Qatar.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Nice to be here.",
        "And this is the triumph of the revolution that began as a protest movement and then started organizing in the eastern part of the country and held on against Gadhafi forces as they threatened to crush it.",
        "This is the day that I think most Libyans have been waiting for.",
        "You know, the euphoria when the rebels swept into Tripoli, they felt that they had sort of won their revolution, but this is really the exact thing that had to happen so that they feel they can move forward and put the past behind them.",
        "Maybe Libyans that I spoke to over the past months really wanted to see Moammar Gadhafi dead.",
        "They felt that any trial would be divisive and - because he still has many supporters in Libya - still to this day - and I think going ahead, that's going to be a problem how you bring these people into the fold and move into a new era in Libya.",
        "So, so many people I know are celebrating in Tripoli, across the country, because they really do feel that Moammar Gadhafi's 42-year-old rule is effectively over."

        "The National Transitional Council, what kind of legitimacy does this group have now?",
        "Well that's a very good question.",
        "I mean, a lot of people, because of the ongoing struggle, because they have been involved in an armed conflict, have given the National Transitional Council some leeway.",
        "There's been a lot of infighting.",
        "They haven't really proven themselves yet to be able to run a country.",
        "And so now that this struggle is effectively over, they have a great many challenges ahead of them, not least of which is what to do with all the guns on the streets, what to do with all these fighters, how to rebuild the cities that have been destroyed in the fighting, how to get Libya's wealth back online, the oil wealth that will be the engine that drives the economy and puts people back in work.",
        "So they have a huge, huge task ahead of them.",
        "The clock now starts ticking.",
        "When they declare that Libya has been, quote-unquote, liberated, then they will declare an interim government, and then that will pave the way towards elections, at least that's the way it's supposed to be.",
        "But of course we've seen in the past that these things have been delayed.",
        "The path to democracy is not an easy one.",
        "It is not, and as part of the Arab spring movement, this movement moved in a very different direction than did Tunisia or Egypt, on either side of Libya, elections today in Libya, talk of a coalition government, very different developments today in and around the city of Sirte.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, if you look, you know, at the city of Sirte, I was there last week, and it's a city that's been completely devastated.",
        "I think it's going to become a symbol of just how divisive this civil war has been: And make no mistake, it was a civil war.",
        "This was Libyans fighting Libyans in many cases, even though there were, of course, foreign mercenaries involved, as well, and NATO forces involved, as well.",
        "But Libyans will have to now try and reconcile themselves to what happened, all the bloodshed that took place.",
        "And while they are celebrating tonight, you know, the dawn comes, and many people will have to, you know, be called to account for what they did.",

        "Hi, I'm calling because - well, I'm in the Pennsylvania National Guard, and I was deployed 2009 and '10, and, you know, I voted for President Obama, and I am really happy for the news out of the Middle East.",
        "Some of our worst enemies he's taken care of.",
        "And I know this is indirectly, through NATO, but, you know, between the Arab spring, more freedom for everyone and things like Obama being taken out, it's been a great year, so just wanted to say that.",
        "All right, Neal, thanks very much.",
        "I assume you meant Osama being taken out.",
        "But Moammar Gadhafi today, Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, and this was an operation, well, started by the United States at the urging of Britain and France, as NATO led the way, with some support from Arab countries, including Qatar, where you are today.",
        "How is the reaction going to be across the Arab world that one of the leaders, Moammar Gadhafi, one of the most charismatic Arab leaders for four decades, has been killed?",
        "Well, Moammar Gadhafi had very little friends in this region.",
        "He managed to alienate many of the Arab leaders here, and you see by Qatar's involvement in the Libya conflict, it's been heavily involved, providing weapons and money to the rebel forces, now the National Transitional Council forces, just how that has - how that has paid them back.",
        "So I think there'll be mixed feelings, certainly when you have - the Arab spring has, you know, seen Mubarak imprisoned, now Gadhafi killed, seen Ben Ali from Tunisia fled.",
        "And so, many of the leaders in this region will be looking at that very warily.",
        "It's very difficult to predict what's going to happen.",

        "There's many different, you know, regional differences, tribal differences that still have to be ironed out.",
        "Putin defended the harsh response, saying people have the right to protest but only if they act in what he called the interests of the country.",
        "The crackdown betrays the Kremlin's nervousness about the election but also had its intended effect.",
        "And while that can happen democratically would be a good thing, but there are still many people who are armed and a lot of people with a lot of antagonism.",
        "You know, Libya's become a very lawless country in the past eight months.",
        "People have been fighting for their very lives, have seen their brothers killed, have seen their fathers killed.",
