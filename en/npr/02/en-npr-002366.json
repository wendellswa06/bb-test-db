        "And the way forward is littered with challenges, including remnants of Gadhafi's forces, tribes who have been aligned against each other for years with no real experience at democracy or government.",
        "We'll get to all those questions in just a moment, but a few minutes ago, President Obama spoke about this at the White House Rose Garden.",
        "Let's hear the president.",
        "Good afternoon everybody.",
        "Today the government of Libya announced the death of Moammar Gadhafi.",
        "This marks the end of a long and painful chapter for the people of Libya, who now have the opportunity to determine their own destiny in a new and democratic Libya.",
        "For four decades, the Gadhafi regime ruled the Libyan people with an iron fist.",
        "Basic human rights were denied.",
        "Innocent civilians were detained, beaten and killed.",
        "And Libya's wealth was squandered.",
        "The enormous potential of the Libyan people was held back, and terror was used as a political weapon.",
        "Today we can definitively say that the Gadhafi regime has come to an end.",
        "The last major regime strongholds have fallen.",
        "The new government is consolidating the control over the country.",
        "And one of the world's longest-serving dictators is no more.",
        "One year ago, the notion of a free Libya seemed impossible.",
        "But then the Libyan people rose up and demanded their rights.",
        "And when Gadhafi and his forces started going city to city, town by town, to brutalize men women and children, the world refused to stand idly by.",
        "Faced with the potential of mass atrocities and a call for help from the Libyan people, the United States and our friends and allies stopped Gadhafi's forces in their tracks.",
        "A coalition that included the United States, NATO and Arab nations persevered through the summer to protect Libyan civilians.",
        "And meanwhile, the courageous Libyan people fought for their own future and broke the back of the regime.",
        "So this is a momentous day in the history of Libya.",
        "The dark shadow of tyranny has been lifted, and with this enormous promise, the Libyan people now have a great responsibility: to build an inclusive and tolerant and democratic Libya that stands as the ultimate rebuke to Gadhafi's dictatorship.",
        "We look forward to the announcement of the country's liberation, the quick formation of an interim government and a stable transition to Libya's first free and fair elections.",
        "And we call on our Libyan friends to continue to work with the international community to secure dangerous materials and to respect the human rights of all Libyans, including those who've been detained.",
        "We're under no illusions, Libya will travel a long and winding road to full democracy.",
        "There will be difficult days ahead.",

        "Well, quite frankly, there's no legacy left now.",
        "The political system he invented has gone.",
        "The state he constructed on the basis of that system has been dissolved.",
        "There is, of course, the detritus of the civil war, which destroyed large parts of the infrastructure he built up in that state.",
        "His army is dissolved, and the money he spent, vast amounts of money, on weaponry, has been wasted.",
        "So it has to be said there's not very much, but there is something.",
        "There is still - maybe now it's going to be amplified because of his death at the hands of the revolution - there is still the memory of him as a martyr, and that could be very dangerous in the future, because his ideas haven't died.",
        "They are still around.",
        "People still do believe in them, surprisingly enough.",
        "And that means that there are people who will see him as someone who was martyred for a cause, a cause he defined as anti-imperialism, as anti-colonialism and as an attempt to reconstruct the developing world.",

        "No, I don't think so.",
        "I mean, I think he goes far further than that.",
        "First of all, Libyans have a sense of being Libyan.",
        "And that's been acquired over the years, and partly through the experience of the Gadhafi dictatorship.",
        "They therefore are aware that they have a common heritage and a common destiny, too.",

        "They share a common language.",
        "They share a common religion.",
        "And those are important factors, as well.",
        "And despite the fragmentary nature of the Libyan state as it evolved, and the fragmentary nature of Libyan society, too, I think those things are going to turn out to be the glue that guarantees that the state, despite the very difficult days it faces, will actually hold together.",
        "And I wanted to turn back to you, Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, to talk about some of those things that unite and divide the Libyans.",
        "There were, for example, as you said, very sharp regional differences, nowhere sharper than in the city of Misrata, which suffered under such a long and difficult siege.",
        "Yes, I think we're seeing Misrata evolve into quite a, sort of, powerhouse, if you will.",
        "It's become almost a city-state in many regards.",
        "It has its own military council.",
        "It has its own sort of local council, and they don't answer to the National Transitional Council in real ways at the moment.",
        "To get into the city of Misrata, you need almost a visa, as one person quipped to me, but you definitely need a letter.",

        "If you do have family there, that family member has to come out and vouch for you.",
        "That is a product of the fear, obviously, that Gadhafi loyalists could come and sabotage the city or wreak havoc in the city.",
        "But also, it speaks to, I think, one of the problems that will evolve.",
        "I mean, definitely, Libya is a country that is united by a common language and a common heritage and a sense of being Libyan, but I think one of the legacies of this particular conflict, of this revolution are that these regional differences have been brought into sharp relief, and that many of these groups now believe in itself to be very autonomous and are acting very independently.",
        "And I think that will be very difficult to rein in under the interim administration.",
        "George Joffe, Lourdes Garcia-Navarro did some wonderful reporting from the mountains in the southern part of Libya about people there who think, well, we were really the ones who conquered territory and fought against the troops and drove the Gadhafi forces back.",
        "We're the ones who liberated them.",

        "Yes, of course, they are, and there are other factors beyond that, too.",
        "There's a tribal basis, too, to Libyan society, and that may reassert itself.",
        "We just don't know yet quite what that will mean.",
        "And it's true that there are enormous fractures inside the Libya that existed before February, and they do demonstrate a series of antagonisms, self-interests and specific concerns.",

        "I think their particular job in Nafusa and the Berber populations who quite clearly are going to demand some kind of autonomy inside the new state.",
        "So on top of these very real challenges, now we have this new policy where a migrant claiming asylum has to stay in Mexico while the claim is pending.",
        "How will that affect the ability of these applicants to access lawyers and their ability to collect evidence for their asylum cases?",
        "But all these things are open for discussion.",
        "No one's yet suggesting that Libya should fragment.",
        "Indeed, one of the things that came out from the revolution earlier on was a sense that there had to be a common solution despite all these factional interests and concerns.",
        "And it's true that Misrata is in a very particular place because of the way in which it had to stand up to Gadhafi's forces.",
        "But nonetheless, there's still a sense that they're part of a wider whole.",
        "So I think in the end, these things will be overcome.",
        "The real question is how the institutions that exist, namely the National Transitional Council, can best help achieve that.",
        "And the problem for the council is that it doesn't yet really enjoy a sense of legitimacy amongst all the factions that exist.",
        "We're talking with George Joffe of Cambridge University's Center of International Studies and with Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, NPR foreign correspondent, about the death of Moammar Gadhafi, the way ahead in Libya.",

        "And this email from Kevin.",
        "Lourdes Garcia-Navarro mentioned Gadhafi had not made many friends in the region with good reason.",
        "However, one important point to cover is that Gadhafi made and perhaps one could say bought many friends on the African continent, among normal African people who benefited from money and support given by Gadhafi to their countries for projects and improved human welfare outside of Libya.",
        "If you ask an average citizen in Kenya or South Sudan, you may very well get the surprising response that they are sorry for Gadhafi's death, that he was a great leader.",
        "Their point of view is a very different one from that of a Libyan citizen as they did not suffer the consequences of the dictator's strong-armed tactics and repression of human rights and freedoms within Libya.",
        "And, George Joffe, I think that's probably correct.",
        "It's absolutely correct, and indeed amongst the smaller African states where Colonel Gadhafi often spread considerable largesse, there is undoubtedly still support for him and for his ideas and for the state that he created.",
        "But even amongst the larger states, South Africa, for example, was always grateful to Libya for the support that the Gadhafi regime had given to the ANC in its struggle against the white regime that had dominated there.",
        "And those things are not forgotten even now.",
        "You may remember that during the current civil war, there were attempts by South Africa, acting in the name of the African Union, to try to find some negotiated peace.",
        "And under the South African president, Jacob Zuma, several attempts were made to find a basis for negotiation.",
        "They were all pushed to one side, ignored, and African states actually feel very badly about it.",
        "We saw evidence of that at the United Nations when South Africa actually blocked for some time the unfreezing of funds held by United Nations states that was supposed to be redelivered to Libya simply because there was resentment about the way in which it should have been treated."

        "First of all, there's resentment because of all of that money that they believe was squandered on the African continent because, you know, pandering to Gadhafi's ego as they see it, and secondly, because of the way that countries like South Africa behaved after the revolution was well on its way.",
