        "Thanks for calling.",
        "I've always been a little suspicious as to the reasons why NATO got involved in the first place.",
        "This has been mostly a French and British endeavor, and I know that the two countries have a lot of historical background in Libya.",
        "Well, ostensibly, it was to protect the people from Gadhafi's violence or vengeance.",
        "We're seeing the exact same thing happening in Syria, another country which has very strong French and British historical ties.",
        "I was wondering if NATO could be looking at Syria right now, and I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "(Speaking Russian).",
        "(Soundbite of man speaking Russian through a bullhorn)",
        "Mike, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Libya, of course, was a former Italian colony.",
        "The British were involved after the second - during and after the Second World War.",
        "But, George Joffe, certainly, Britain and France were involved in Syria historically.",
        "It presents a very different situation, however.",
        "It certainly does.",
        "One needs to remember that in the case of Libya, the Libyan state wasn't in fact a major player in world events, so that intervention in it would not necessarily provoke some profound change in the situation inside the Middle East.",
        "Syria is a very different matter.",
        "Syria after all is crucial to the security of Israel.",
        "It's a crucial ally of Iran.",
        "It's a state that dominates the Levantine region.",
        "And, of course, it dominates Lebanon.",
        "If you remove the Gadhafi - the Assad regime from power, there's no guarantee that what then emerges is going to be a state that will be able to accommodate the extremely complex regional situation, and therefore nobody wants to disturb the situation there more than necessary.",
        "If the Syrian population is able to get rid of its leader, well and good.",
        "But the idea of an intervention from the outside is something that nobody is yet prepared to contemplate.",
        "Also as we saw this play out in Libya, French and British forces nearly exhausted themselves, ran out of smart bombs, had to buy some from U.S.",
        "inventory.",
        "NATO is breathing a sigh of relief that this is over, no?"

        "Oh, I'm sure that's true, and you're quite right.",
        "Very early on in the campaign to the great embarrassment of statesmen in London and in Paris, there was indeed a shortage of ammunition, and that had to be rectified very quickly.",
        "And that was partly a measure of the excessive overconfidence that was shown both in Paris and certainly in London.",
        "I remember the chancellor here in Britain saying that the cost of the intervention in Libya will be a matter of a few millions of pounds.",
        "It's actually cost Britain 1.8 billion pounds.",
        "And now that may not seem very much in the context of American expenses in Afghanistan and elsewhere, but for Britain, this going through a period of intense retrenchment is a considerable expenditure.",
        "So in a way, yes, NATO leaders are going to be delighted that it's now over.",
        "They're meeting tomorrow in fact to draw a veil over the campaign.",
        "But, again, one needs to bear in mind that the reason why they became involved wasn't just because they wanted to protect the Libyan population.",
        "In fact, as far as France was concerned, there was an enormous need to demonstrate that France was not, as it had appeared to be, simply the state that actually collaborated with dictators in the Middle East.",
        "It had done so in Tunisia.",
        "This was a chance for President Sarkozy to show that France was something very different.",
        "And for Britain, I'm afraid to say that Britain became involved largely because it wanted to show that it was a state engaged in a moral crusade in a wider world.",
        "That's now have been done.",
        "We have to hope that actually this has been a learning and sobering experience for the leaders concerned, and that they won't be quite so ready to do it again quite so quickly.",
        "One last question on this and then we'll get to East Africa.",
        "Scott is on the line from Jackson, Michigan.",
        "Hi.",
        "Well, I think there is a slight downside to this regarding foreign policy.",
        "Few of us would want to live under Gadhafi's autocratic regime, or would have, but we now have zero credibility with North Korea and Iran.",
        "So how are we going to go to Iran and negotiate and say, oh, if you play ball with us, you know, on nuclear disarmament or dismantling your nuclear program, we'll let you re-enter the sphere - the diplomatic sphere as an equal?",
        "Well, they're going to say, hey, Gadhafi did that.",
        "Look what happened to him.",
        "George Joffe, is that a downside here?",
        "I think it probably is.",
        "And I tend to agree - although I think in the case of Iran, the problems arose long, long ago.",
        "The fact that the United States has had no relations with Iran, no diplomatic relations, for the last 30 years, made, of course, any question of negotiating very difficult.",
        "And the way in which the nuclear negotiations have gone has certainly not helped that.",
        "So, in a way, Iran has been the beneficiary of the mistaken invasion of Iraq and, of course, it continues to benefit from that.",
        "So, in a sense, I think the problems there aren't really the consequence of what happened in Libya, but they do demonstrate the way in which, in effect, the United States has had a very bad decade in terms of its policies inside the Middle East.",
        "George, thanks very much.",
        "Scott, and thanks for the call.",
        "And George Joffe joined us from a studio of the BBC in Cambridge in the U.K., where he's at the Center for International Studies at Cambridge University.",
        "George, always good to talk to you.",
        "Thank you very much for your time.",
