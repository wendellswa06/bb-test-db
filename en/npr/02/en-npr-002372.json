        "And pure free market theory which posits some rational individualists who are responding to incentives has no room for social contagions.",

        "It was easier for some Republicans to vote for this because of a whole lot of tax cuts that were added to it, and also, I think it was actually important that they added this provision increasing the amount of ensured deposits from 100,000 to 250,000.",

        "Talk about shifting.",
        "I mean, do you think that all that's happening in Washington in this season and in the economy represents just a big hiccup in what remains a consensus policy about markets and regulation or do you feel some shifting, David, of the tectonic plates of ideology beneath us here?",
        "I think we're seeing a fundamental shift.",

        "The government is being called upon to do something about people's mortgages.",
