        "Also, when you're doing that, feel the kind of money you have available.",
        "Have you got any savings or anything like that?",
        "The first house - if you see a house that you fall in love with and you think you're going to be able to qualify for it, the seller will probably ask you for some good faith money.",
        "That might range from as little as a thousand or $2,000 to as much as 1 percent of the price - 1 or 2 percent of the price.",
        "So what do you have available?",
        "Because if you're going to ask someone to take their home off the market - in other words, removing it from other offers, you got to give them an incentive to do that.",
        "Well…",
        "Otherwise, you fall in love with this home.",
        "You run to the bank and say, I've found the - my dream house, you know, and it costs, you know, $350,000.",
        "When you get the 350 and go back, the house may be gone.",
        "I want to back up a little bit to the credit issues you were talking about.",
        "Say that you are someone who has sparkling credit, clear as crystal water, but your partner or spouse has that kind of mucky, gooey, uh-oh, lots of lates, possible defaults credit.",
        "What happens then if you're trying to buy a home?",
        "If you're trying to buy a home together, their credit will affect yours.",
        "So there are things you can do about that, including looking for the loan in your own name.",
        "Now the challenge with that is that if you need that person's income to qualify you, to make you look like a better prospect - in other words, you don't need their credit score, but you need their income.",
        "They'll say, you make 50 grand and your partner makes 50 grand, and partner has all kind snarly credit.",
        "But you can't qualify for the loan you want without the hundred thousand income - annual income - you may be in a little trouble.",
        "So you've got to figure out - and again, a good financial adviser sitting down with one of the housing counseling agencies, including some of those that are funded by HUD can help walk you through that.",
        "Most cities have programs - many cities - not most, but many cities - Washington, D.C.",
        "among them, San Francisco among them, and many of the other major cities have city-sponsored programs for first-time homer buyers that often include a counseling component and, in some cases, for people of a certain demographic - depending on their income or something else - may actually provide some assistance.",
        "They may say that you can come in with a zero down payment or something like that.",
        "So look for all the programs that are possibly available to help you, and that's a situation where you're prime for help.",
        "So what about the reality of this market in terms of what houses are available?",
        "There is a lot of folks right now who may be trying to get out of the market because they're just paying too much per month as their interest rates go up.",
        "Is this a good time to try to snatch up a deal?",
        "It's a good time to snatch up a deal if you can afford it.",
        "I mean, I wouldn't let the issue of deal drive of your housing decision, although, clearly, once you settle on a neighborhood or a series of neighborhoods, you know, and a number of other things, if you can get a steal, get one.",
        "And there are all kinds of steals you can get.",
        "You can buy if someone who's desperate because they're moving, and they've got to move by X day.",
        "They've got a job starting in Washington, D.C.",
        "right away - that someone who might actually finance the mortgage for you.",
        "So you've got snarly credit, one of the things you might think about is, is someone willing to finance that mortgage for you?",
        "That means the owner of the home would actually be the one who held your note.",
        "So the bank says, no, Farai, we can't give you loan.",
        "But the owner, who's desperate and has known you since you're 11, says, Farai is not going to default, so I'll carry her loan, which means you'll pay that person a certain amount of money every month as opposed to paying the bank."

        "There are all kinds of - there are lots of deals.",
        "I mean, if you really think it's time to buy, you have some desperate people, but you also have to hunt foreclosures and other kinds of foreclosures.",
        "You have some bank foreclosures that are out there, someone who's highly motivated - just got to get the shoe leather out, get their fingers to do the walking on the Internet and find out what's out there.",
        "Are foreclosures necessarily better deals than other houses?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "I mean, just because it says foreclosure doesn't mean it's a great deal.",
        "It's just like, you know, going to get something on sale at the mall.",
        "Just because it's a sale doesn't mean it's good.",
        "But foreclosures are a possibility because, especially if it's a bank foreclosure.",
        "Banks don't want to be in the real estate business.",
        "They're in the banking business.",
        "So if they're stuck with the house because the person before you defaulted, they're going to try to get rid of it.",
        "Sometimes they'll price it at fire-sale prices.",
        "Same thing with HUD, I mean, there are not always deals when you get auctions.",
        "Don't go to an auction and get slaphappy.",
        "And that means you go to an auction, you get up in the auction, you bid that price back up to market price.",
        "But look around, if you're interested in things, look at the neighborhood, make sure you have a real sense, especially with foreclosures, of what neighboring properties are valued at.",
        "Often, Farai, you have foreclosures in markets where the house was the most expensive house on the block.",
        "You might have a house that, you know, they're selling, you know, 500,000; but if everything else around it is valued at three; and you think, well, gee, this is a million-dollar house, all the square footage, it's got a pool.",
        "But if the pool is in the hood, there's a problem.",
        "Now what about rent-to-own?",
        "Some people who don't have a lot of cash on hand will sign rent-to-own agreements.",
        "How do those work?",
        "And is that a good prospect?",
        "It's a great prospect especially if you have a great relationship with the landlord or the person that you're working with.",
        "Generally, what happens is that you agree - you and the landlord agree that a certain percentage - and it can range from 25 percent to 50 or 60 percent - but a certain percentage of your monthly rent will be set aside, you know, as a mortgage payment.",
        "At a point in time when the person decides that your finances are more stable or that they can work with you, they basically will turn the property over for you, help you either carry them where it's for you or work with you to get a bank loan.",
        "So basically, you're - you have the opportunity to stabilize your credit by showing that you've paid this rent bill, which is a rent-to-own bill, every month for X number of months.",
        "Usually it's two years before - a year to two years before these things mature.",
        "And you've got to make sure that the contract is a good contract.",
        "Also, make sure that there are, you know, it' a contract, there are some standard contracts, you might have a lawyer draw it up, or there are some you can get on Nolo.",
        "But make sure that if you change your mind, you're protected and, or the landlord's protected.",
        "And protection may mean nothing.",
        "I mean, they may say, okay, you're going to have forfeit that mortgage portion or they may be willing to give you back a small percentage of it.",
        "Well, Julianne, thanks so much.",
        "Thank you."
