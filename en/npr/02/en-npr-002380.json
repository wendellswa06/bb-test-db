        "Sean, is this a case of good journalism, and what I mean by that is that reporters, including Jerry Mitchell of the Jackson, Mississippi, Clarion-Ledger, really started investigating these cases after decades had passed.",
        "Should journalists be applauded in this case?",
        "Well, I mean, I think so.",
        "I mean, you don't want to, you know, it's a little easy for us to pat our own backs over in the sense.",
        "But I do think it does underscore the importance of journalists being vigilant, which we could have used a lot more of in the run up to the war to Iraq.",
        "However, you know, there are some really good journalists out there who really care about the truth.",
        "And I think it's important regardless of, you know, there's many emphasis where sometimes people think, if you even bring up racial issues, that somehow you're being a bigot or a reverse racist.",

        "I'm going to move on, Mara, to the case of Michael Vick - just more and more and more discussion.",
        "Now the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP said on Wednesday that the Falcons quarterback should not be banned from playing in the NFL.",
        "Is this really a civil rights issue?",
        "I mean, the national headquarters spoke out against animal cruelty.",
        "Yeah, that's a great question.",
        "No, it's not a civil rights issue.",
        "Now, I respected the NAACP's national office when they came out a few weeks ago and said that we need to reserve judgment because Michael Vick had not been convicted of anything.",
        "And at that point, I felt that was the right thing to do because the presumption of innocence is not something that has always been extended to black men.",
        "But now he is saying that, in a few days, he is going to plead guilty to these awful, despicable crimes.",
        "And so I don't understand why anyone would stand up at this time before he's even served his punishment and say, you know, try to support his actions.",
        "And I have a quote here from the president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP that said, \"\"it's regrettable that Michael Vick had to settle for a plea bargain.",
        "All of us had hoped for a more favorable outcome.\"\" And I'm really wondering what outcome is that that they were hoping for?",
        "That because he's a great football player, he can commit crimes and not be held accountable for them?",
        "And, Kevin, you know, you did some reporting on dogfighting.",
        "What did you see - how does that influence how you look at the case?",
        "Well, there's an entire underground underworld of dogfighting that's very secretive.",
        "And in the level that Michael Vick is talking about that he's involved - allegedly involved in - and I guess he's going to plead guilty to that - is really a secretive world where you - they have dog conventions.",
        "I saw many - I've seen dogfights, I've been with the dogfighters doing some of my investigative reporting earlier in the career.",
        "And it's very brutal, it's - you know, in their culture, they think that it's something that is no different than cockfighting and they think it's no different than boxing.",
        "And those are the kind of explanations that you hear.",
        "But clearly, the kinds of offenses that are in the indictment - in the Vick indictment of electrocuting dogs who are no longer useful to them is really something that is pretty heinous.",
        "So, you know…",
        "No, jump in.",
        "No, I just think that, you know, going back to what was said earlier that, you know, he's admitted to this and it's kind of hard.",
        "I think there's a reflexive tendency to want to be protective sometimes of African-American public figures.",
        "We're seeing that in many other cases, and I think that's what's happening with Vick.",
        "But this is really a serious crime."

        "There was a case recently where two wealthy New Jersey residents had 23 decomposing cats and dogs in one home.",
        "Should this case be judged as animal cruelty the same way that Vick is?",
        "Well, I mean, clearly, because of who Vick is, it sort of has more cache in and it sort of attracts more attention.",
        "But I do think, you know, behind all of this and this is part of that reflexive action, is in this country, you know, as Stanley Crouch has noted before that when blacks commit crimes, it's usually considered to be a comment on race.",
        "But when you have white brothers and sisters involved, it's often considered, at best, to be a comment on society what usually is just for individuals.",
        "I mean, in cases in like this, people don't walk around and start talking about, you know, white thug culture, or what's wrong with suburban white America.",
        "But those are, often, the kind of discussions that happen when a case like Vick, although like the previous, you know, guests have mentioned, I think this is different, and I don't think this is a civil rights issue.",
        "But, you know, and I think it's bigger because it's Vick, but there is always that element that the conversation, the reaction is generally one where soon, we're talking about black mythology in one instance and in the other case, we're just talking about the, you know, oh, my God, this is so shocking.",
