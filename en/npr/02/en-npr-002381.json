        "Well, we are going to fight for them.",
        "And we think that we should pass the DREAM Act by itself.",
        "The other parts of the plan that the president talked about in particular - the border wall - don't enjoy the popular support that the DREAM Act does.",
        "Listen.",
        "We'll do our best to try to get a compromise here, but if the president thinks that he's going to get a border wall built that the American public doesn't support by using these kids as political pawns, I don't think that's the path forward.",
        "Is there - I mean, one of the most controversial elements of what the president proposed was what he calls chain migration, suggesting limiting the number of family members who immigrants could bring into the United States.",
        "Is there some room for compromise here?",
        "Are you open to some sort of change in that policy to get a compromise?",
        "You know, when I listened to the president talk about so-called chain migration, which is really just a way to talk about families reunifying in the United States - And I watched Republicans stand up and applaud with glee - I wonder if they remember how they got here, how their grandparents and great grandparents very likely followed cousins or aunts or uncles who came before them.",
        "America's strength in the past has been our ability to bring family members to join other family members in the United States and to look at skills but not have it be the only determination of how you get here.",
        "And that still remains the strength of this country.",
        "And, Senator, let me just finish with this.",
        "I mean, the response from your party tonight from Congressman Joe Kennedy - a lot of angry language accusing this President of, quote, \"\"callously appraising worthiness,\"\" saying that the Trump ministration is \"\"turning American life into a zero-sum game.\"\" Is that the proper tone for this moment from the Democratic Party?",
        "You know, I've never seen people as anxious or scared or angry as they are today back in Connecticut.",
        "And, you know, I think a lot of folks think that there's a real, you know, threat to democracy underfoot, which, you know, raises people's anxiety and also the heat and tenor of the debate.",

        "NPR's Chris Arnold reports.",
        "Given a string of recent scandals with financial firms - Wells Fargo, the big Equifax hack - Democrats had argued, shouldn't Americans when they feel cheated or harmed have the right to sue these companies?",

        "Well, it just seems to be going from stalemate to stalemate.",
        "It's been nearly three months now since the elections, and Iraqis are just waiting to see when their politicians are going to get their act together.",
        "There is such instability at that level, and it's being translated into more attacks and less security in Baghdad neighborhoods, you know, between different parties and sects and suburbs.",
        "Is it suspected that the pattern also goes the other way?",
        "That people commit acts of violence trying to influence the political process?",
        "There's definitely the idea that, for example, the Golden Mosque in Samara was bombed intentionally to derail the talks on the formation of a national unity government.",
        "You know, the retaliatory attacks that broke out afterwards between the Sunnis and the Shiites prompted the Sunni factions to boycott any talks, and now it's descended to the point where the Sunnis and the Kurds say that Ibrahim Jaafari, the prime minister, is doing such a bad job at maintaining calm, that they want him replaced.",
        "And Jamie, I have to ask, this killing of an Iraqi major general comes to our attention because he's of such high rank.",
        "But this is a man who was killed by a sniper out in the streets of Baghdad.",
        "Can you just describe what it is like driving around the streets of a major city, knowing that people like that are out there looking for targets at any time?",
        "It's a very tense experience, I can tell you that.",
        "When you're driving, you're always keeping an eye out for the car next to you, let alone what might be out there on the rooftops.",
        "People look out for lone drivers; they could be possible suicide bombers driving a, you know, a car full, loaded with explosives.",

        "You're worried about people driving by and opening fire.",
        "So, a sniper on the rooftop is definitely something that people have there at the forefront of their minds as a danger when they go out every day.",

        "Like for example, there's been a - there were killings of some Christian missionaries in Turkey about two weeks ago, where their throats were cut in the southeast of the country.",

        "They said that the armed forces chief is answerable to the prime minister and that this government is elected.",
        "So the government has criticized the army for interfering in the political process and for pressuring them to either change the candidate, i.e., not have Abdul Gul, who's the foreign minister, as a candidate anymore because he has an Islamist past, or to actually call early elections.",
        "Abdullah Gul was considered a compromised candidate.",
        "He is identified with the liberal wing of his party.",
        "How does he see the role of Islam in the state?",
        "Well, first of all, many people respect Gul because he's a great diplomat and he's very respected domestically and abroad, but he was always seen as having an Islamist past and being very conservative.",
        "On the other hand, he has repeatedly said that he will uphold the secular values of the state and many people believe him.",
        "So what are the secularists worried about?",
        "The secularists are worried that the principles of separating state and religion will disappear.",
        "In Turkey, after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, Ataturk took out religion from public life.",
        "He took away the turban and the headscarf.",
        "And he modernized the country.",
        "Now, the seculars - they're worried that the current government will seek to undermine the separation and that they will want to introduce, for example, lifting the ban on headscarves at universities and at public offices, and appointing, because you have to remember if you have an AKP president, they will be to approve key officials.",

        "Still, a new nomination gives the president a big opportunity to change the subject away from the leak investigation, but it also provides him with the task of whether he can find a person who can restore some of his stature in the public's eye and avoid another divisive fight within his own party, while not seeming to simply cave in to the demands of those emboldened by the battle over Miers.",
