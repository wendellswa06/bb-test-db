        "Great to join you.",
        "So you have extensive contacts in Afghanistan.",
        "And after President Trump announced that the talks with the Taliban were over, you contacted people in the country via your usual methods - social media, WhatsApp - to see how they were feeling about all that.",
        "What are some of the things that they told you?",
        "You really found this mix of relief and fear, you know, a sense of relief and the sense that - you know?",
        "So many activists I'd known since, you know, 2005 had been very worried about what was in the deal between the United States and the Taliban.",
        "There was the sense that there was this black box they hadn't yet seen that was going to decide their future, and they had been shut out of it.",
        "So you had this mix of relief that's - OK, at least now something we don't know and which could really, you know, harm our future isn't going to happen and, at the same, time huge fear about whether the Taliban would step up attacks even further now that they had taken the idea of talks off the table.",
        "A lot of focus of your reporting in recent years has been both economic development but also women and how, you know, women participate in economic development and how that in turn affects their lives.",
        "Is there a particular concern about how the rights of women will be addressed in these negotiations?",
        "I mean, the Afghan constitution does already enumerate certain rights for women.",
        "But is that a concern?",
        "This had been a huge concern, Michel, among women across the board, you know?",
        "Afghanistan is always seen as either a basket case or a beacon of hope.",
        "And the truth is it's neither.",
        "It's a place where you have people fighting every single day for their future against colossal obstacles.",
        "And they keep fighting, right?",
        "I mean, you know, 2001, you had very few girls in school given Taliban rule.",
        "Now you have around 3 million who are there, right?",
        "Could it be better?",
        "Yes.",
        "But is it much better than it was before?",
        "100%.",
        "So there's all these gains that women have made.",
        "And the truth is we've so often seen them as victims, and they have actually been raising their voices.",
        "Yes.",
        "We sell 90 million board feet, mostly into the U.S.",
        "market and it's been a great relief not be to be on the receiving end of a bad exchange rate.",
        "Meanwhile, there are these news reports that aides to President Trump orchestrated some kind of smear campaign to try to personally malign some of the original architects of the Iran nuclear deal.",
        "What can you tell us about that?",
        "Well, there's reports at two publications, The Observer in London and The New Yorker magazine.",
        "They both say an Israeli private intelligence firm was engaged in an effort to discredit some of these proponents of the nuclear agreement.",
        "The Observer's account links aides to Donald Trump to that effort.",
        "And they also report - The Guardian does in the U.K.",
        "- that British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw calls the allegations extraordinary and appalling and a sign of desperation on the part of critics of the deals.",
        "NPR hasn't independently confirmed the allegations.",
        "But they are certainly making their rounds today.",
        "Now, the entire deal wouldn't technically collapse if this deadline approaches, and the president reimposes sanctions on May 12.",
        "But, I mean, it could be used for Iran.",
        "I mean, Iran could use this to its own advantage and use it as a pretext to deny access to any inspectors, right?"

        "Well, that is one big problem.",
        "And you're right.",
        "The deal wouldn't necessarily fall apart just because Donald Trump announces that sanctions are coming back from America.",
        "Because it's Europe, Russia and China who would be doing most of the business with Iran anyway, you could argue that if they keep going, the deal keeps going.",
        "Right.",
        "But there is a risk that these sanctions will then be turned against European companies.",
        "And then European governments would have to go through many machinations to try and protect them from American secondary sanctions.",
        "And inside Iran, hardliners could use this to attack the pragmatist president, Hassan Rouhani.",
        "They could push, as you said, to back out of some of their commitments, including these intrusive nuclear inspections being carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
        "And so depending on this decision, it might not lure Iran back to the table for more talks.",
        "But it might raise tensions in the Middle East even further.",
        "NPR's Peter Kenyon for us this morning.",
        "Thanks so much, Peter.",
        "Thanks.",
        "In responding to the news that 12 Russian intelligence agents allegedly hacked the DNC and other Democratic groups during the 2016 election, President Trump repeated a familiar line.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Again, this was during the Obama administration.",
        "They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration.",
        "This is from an interview this morning with CBS News.",
        "And, on Twitter yesterday, Mr. Trump wrote, quote, \"\"the stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama administration, not the Trump administration.",
        "Why didn't they do something about it?\"\" - unquote.",
        "So we thought this would be a good moment to fact-check that claim, so we asked our national security editor Phil Ewing to break this down."

        "The assumption in what President Trump is saying is that President Obama took no action after learning that the Russians were interfering in the election.",
        "Is that the case?",
        "No, that's not quite correct.",
        "The Obama administration had a great deal of internal debate in real time in 2016 about how to respond - whether they should do so publicly or privately.",
        "Ultimately, President Obama did so privately with the Russian president Vladimir Putin.",
        "He took him aside at an international summit and said, please stop interfering in our election - to no effect.",
        "And the Obama administration also tried to ask leaders in Congress of both parties to sign a statement condemning these foreign efforts.",
        "The Democratic leaders agreed to do so.",
        "The Republican speaker, Paul Ryan, apparently thought that he could get there, but the majority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, did not agree to do that.",
        "And so, ultimately, there was no public statement until October of 2016, by which time, with the view of history, it may have been too late to do anything about it.",
        "Did the Obama administration take any steps other than jawboning?",
        "Ultimately, President Obama's administration did take some action against the Russians.",
        "So in December of 2016 and January of 2017, there were some punitive measures the United States imposed.",
        "The Russian \"\"diplomats,\"\" quote-unquote, were ejected from the United States.",
        "Their facilities in the United States were closed that they used to spy from New York and Maryland.",
        "And there were economic measures that the United States has taken, both under Obama and Trump, in retaliation for this election interference.",
        "The view from critics on the outside was that it might have done more.",
        "There might have been cyberattacks - for example, the United States could have launched against the Russians to give back the Russians a taste of their own medicine.",
        "Ultimately, the Obama administration decided not to do that because the United States itself is so vulnerable to cyberattacks.",
        "And if you get into a cycle of escalation with the Russians, in this view, the United States is going to be the loser there because of how many more vulnerabilities we have as compared with how many they have.",
        "In hindsight, is there regret on the part of Obama administration officials that they didn't take some of these steps?",
        "You know, you definitely get the impression from people like the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, who just wrote a book, that he regrets not acting more quickly or more forcefully.",
        "And I think this is something that, as the 2020 Democratic election storyline gets going, you may hear more from the former Vice President Joe Biden if he gets into the mix.",
        "And everyone in the world is going to be waiting for the former president, Mr. Obama, when his much-awaited book comes out.",
        "And I think a lot of people are going to be looking and seeing whether Obama has regrets or whether has decisions that he might have taken a different way once we find out what he was thinking in real time in 2016."
