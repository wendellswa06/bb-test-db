        "She says she will end the war, but she continues to say she'll keep combat troops in Iraq and continue combat missions in Iraq.",
        "To me, that's not ending the war, that's the continuation of the war.",
        "She voted for a war to authorize sending troops in Iraq, and then later said this was a war for diplomacy.",
        "I don't think that - now, that may be political savvy, but I don't think that it offers the clear contrast that we need.",
        "On every issue from health care for children to an energy policy that puts us on the right track to deal with climate change and make us more secure, I have been standing against the Republicans George Bush and Dick Cheney.",
        "And I will continue to do so, and I think Democrats know that.",
        "We want to look to a plan for effective action against the PKK.",
        "It will require not just the United States and Turkey but also the Iraqi government.",
        "And that is the discussion that I plan to have when I see Prime Minister Maliki.",

        "This airbag landing system was, like, pretty wacky.",
        "The thing came in at 30 miles an hour and bounced 50 feet in the air.",
        "Fifteen times it bouncy, bouncy, bouncy before it came to rest and opened itself up and then spread out its petals, which had solar panels in them.",
        "After it got to work, what were the most exciting things that we learned about Mars thanks to Pathfinder?",
        "Well, it landed in a place where water seemed to have once flowed.",
        "And the kinds of rocks it was seeing and some of the chemical composition that it detected seemed to suggest that Mars was once a warmer, wetter place, as opposed to the dry, cold place it is today.",

        "Now, under the new Democratic majority, that debate will hit the House floor again next week.",
        "Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said today that Congress will voice its disapproval of the way President Bush is executing the war.",
        "The resolution will clearly say we do not believe that the president's proposal of an escalation of 21,000 troops is the proper policy to be pursuing.",
        "The exact wording isn't out yet.",
        "It hasn't been written.",
        "Two committees working jointly in open sessions will draft the resolution this week.",
        "It'll be the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee.",

        "They would declare martial law throughout the country.",
