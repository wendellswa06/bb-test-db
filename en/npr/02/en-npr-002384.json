        "What happens in our brains to make us trust one person and not another?",
        "Is it an automatic response, does it change with years of experience as we go on in life, or is it a little bit of both?",

        "I could say just about the same things we just have heard.",
        "He was entirely trustworthy, but the interesting thing is the reasons why he was, and you just outlined a couple of them, but I think we could go into detail, and it's certainly not one reason only.",

        "Yes, I did.",
