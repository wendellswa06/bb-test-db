        "In other words, the question was, how much would you trust this person with a problem of yours?",
        "How would you go to this person, and would you approach this person if you felt you had a problem?",
        "And we got some very interesting results that, in a nutshell, were like this.",
        "People's faced divided in a bimodal distribution were largely the ones that were either extremely inspiring of trust or the ones that you really would not go to in case you were in need, and this was very interesting because it had to do just with normal behavior of normal people and faces that were quite normal, as well.",
        "So that was one of the things we did, and then we also did a study that is very relevant to this, and that is a study in which one particular part of the brain, specifically the amygdale - which is a collection of nuclei deep in the temporal lobe.",
        "When that particular group of nuclei is damaged, it turns out that people become much more trustworthy, and I will tell you how.",
        "The - yes, tell me how.",
        "Well, so what happens is that if you have people who have damage to the amygdale, and they look at exactly the same faces that entirely normal folk looked at, they will look at the ones that everyone trusts very much, and they will give ratings that are very, very similar.",
        "However, when they look at the faces that normal individuals do not trust, it turns out that they trust them, as well.",

        "We're talking this hour about trust, why we trust people, why some people are more trusting than others, with my guest, Antonio Damasio, the Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.",
        "He is also director of the Brain and Creativity Institute there.",
        "1-800-989-8255.",
        "We've heard a lot about trust in recent days with the passing of Walter Cronkite.",
        "Dr.",
        "Damasio, there were several oft-replayed clips over the last week or so showing some emotion at the moon landing and at the death of President Kennedy.",
        "Is that kind of emotion, although he didn't show it often, something that could help build that bond between him and his viewers?",
        "I'm - of course it would help build the bond.",
        "I don't think that's what would explain the trust that we had in him.",
        "I think that probably simply confirmed it because it was a reaction that, of course, so many other people had.",
        "So there was a greater degree of comfort that you could have.",
        "You simply confirmed what you already thought about the man.",
        "I think that the reasons behind the trust we had, an you alluded slightly to one of them, is to begin with, something that one could call a natural preference that human beings have for certain configurations of face and, for that matter, for certain kinds of voice print.",
        "So when we look at faces in general - and this is independent of what we know about the people - there are certain aspects of the configuration, for example, the symmetry, the overall balance of the composition, the relative sizes of the components of the face that will trigger some sort of automatic, extremely rapid response, which really is non-conscious and not deliberated and which will give you this reaction of, for example, likeability or not, in relation to the person.",
        "This is, by the way, the way we judge, automatically, faces as being beautiful or, for that matter, being ferocious, and I think trust falls in the same category.",
        "Of course, very rapidly after you find that automatically a face is beautiful and have a reaction of pleasure with it, or that you find that a face is ferocious and you feel apprehension or even fear, quite rapidly you come to realize that you are feeling those emotions and that you have that reaction.",
        "But to begin with, the reaction is fast, automatic and undeliberated.",
        "And of course, there is one thing that we have to take into account, that natural preference, and I would imagine that Cronkite's face calls in that category.",
        "But of course, that does not explain why, over the years, we continued to trust him.",
        "That could explain the beginning of it, and I think it's very important to realize that after a long exposure of many years, we come to realize that he did not betray that trust and that he used the trust we deposited in him in a very modest, reliable way.",
        "And I think that is another step, and that has to do with that particular face in relation to the viewing public.",
        "By the way, this is something that also happens with faces with actors.",
        "Somebody very bright must have decided early on that the face of James Stewart was one that you could trust, and that's probably why Alfred Hitchcock put him as the doctor in \"\"The Man Who Knew Too Much,\"\" you know, a perfectly reliable, very decent character, and why he did not cast Peter Lorre for that matter.",
        "Well, he did cast Peter Lorre, very early on, when he did the villain in the first \"\"Man Who Knew Too Much in 1935."

        "So those first choices that a casting director will do explain why certain roles were given to certain actors.",
        "And exactly in the same manner, certain actors will have been able to maintain the credibility of that role, the credibility of that trust over the years, provided they actually were given those particular roles to play.",
        "It's interesting you talk about actors, because Walter Cronkite, of course, was not an actor.",
        "On the other hand, he was a TV personality and although he gave the impression that he was just being himself on TV, there's certainly art and technique that go into creating that kind of impression.",
        "Is this quality of trust - yeah, go ahead.",
        "Yeah, but I was going to say that it's part of the job of a great actor to give the impression that it is he, himself, that is playing the role at that moment.",
        "That kind of natural and sincere way of assuming the role, that's of course what defines the great actor.",
        "So this artifice, if you would call it that, can affect our brains and out perception of trust, our sense of trust?",
        "Absolutely, and of course, it does - we know just a little bit about the possible detailed mechanisms behind this.",
        "For example, there's very good evidence that a very small neuro-peptide by the name of oxytocin - very small, nine amino acids only - this is a peptide that can be released in the brain or in the body.",
        "Inside the brain, it functions as a neuro-modulator.",
        "In the body, it functions really as a hormone, and the release of that peptide in the central nervous system in the brain will actually induce, first of all, a greater approachability.",
        "So the subject that is affected by the release of that substance, tends to approach others more easily and have less of the somewhat natural reaction of fear in relation to the other.",
        "And it will, in very specific experimental situations, increase the trust that the person who has that increased release has relative to someone else.",
        "So that's one of the first bits of evidence that, of course, besides having certain systems in the brain that are operating, to generate that feeling of trust, there are details of the neurochemistry that are beginning to be known, and that that neuro-modulator, oxytocin, will play that role.",
        "By the way, it's a very interesting molecule, because it has numerous other positive effects in human behavior.",
        "And you know, it appears everywhere from, for example, lactation and childbirth to behaviors that have to do with sexual behavior, for example.",
        "So it's very, very complex, many, many actions.",

        "Again, it's the issue that he maintained that trust by not betraying us, by not behaving in any way in which he would violate what we expected, the idea that we had formed of that man, and so that is something that he earned over the years, and I don't know.",
