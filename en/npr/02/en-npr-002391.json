        "Okay.",
        "I think - make it short because you're breaking up a bit.",
        "But go ahead.",
        "Well, I'm a sales rep and obviously trust is a very, very big issue.",
        "It seems as if the establishment of trust prior to even presenting the product is a bit of a challenge in its own right because of preconceived notions that people have about salespeople in general.",
        "Now, I tend to be a little bit different than a standard sales rep, where I'm not as aggressive.",
        "But I guess the question I have is, what can I do to help break that barrier a little bit better?",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks, John.",
        "I'm going to let you go because of the noise.",
        "But we'll go ahead with your question.",
        "Dr. Damasio, go ahead.",
        "Well, the only thing I can suggest is behave very well and convince people by whatever means you have available that you are sincere about what you're saying and that what your - the product you're selling has merit and that you're not lying and that you're not deceiving, and that we should, in that case, trust you.",
        "That's the only recommendation.",
        "So we didn't need neuroscience to tell us that, really.",
        "That's old fashioned advice.",
        "No.",
        "No, no. Exactly.",

        "And that's because they are exhibiting much better leadership, they're taking better care of soldiers.",
        "So the things are being done to give those soldiers - the Afghan soldiers - the confidence they need, in their chain of command, so that they're willing to serve especially in the difficult areas.",
        "I think the only thing that neuroscience has to do with here is the fact that we are beginning to understand some of the systems that can give you some idea of how it works.",
        "But I think that this is about general human behavior.",
        "And I don't really think - I think it's very interesting to know that a certain molecule will be important to - as the broker of this state.",
        "But I don't think that that alters the fundamentals of the situation, which is that you will be trusted if you are truthful and if you behave consistently in that manner.",
        "Our number here at SCIENCE FRIDAY is 1-800-989-8255 or 1-800-989-TALK.",
        "Now, the - there is a field of neural marketing or neuroscience being applied to marketing.",

        "Yes.",
        "I would - you know, I don't know exactly to what degree.",
        "I think we could be pretty much in the same situation of deciding what, you know, how can the salesman be more trusted.",
        "And I think it goes back to fundamentals of human behavior.",
        "And we do not need to interpose detailed knowledge of the brain for that.",
        "I think where the knowledge of the brain is very helpful is to give us the idea that some of these things are acquired, but some - and are acquired over the years with experience because we all go through life encountering people that are truthful to us and others that are not, and some that begin by being truthful but then betray our trust.",
        "So that acquisition part of the trust is very clear.",
        "What is very important is for people to factor in the fact that there's this other aspect of trust with which we begin the interview, which is natural, which is spontaneous, which is automatic and non-conscious.",
        "And that is the kind of process that will function as a bias.",
        "So one thing that neuroscience is telling you is that if you look at somebody that does not appear to inspire trust and that puts you on guard, that maybe you should wait and give the person a chance because you may be biased in your view by something that is not under your conscious control and that is not really based on the knowledge you have of that person.",
        "Now, I think that part is very important and that's very practical.",
        "Of course, again, ancient wisdom would tell you that you should not judge people by first encounter, but the fact that neuroscience can guarantee that that's indeed the case may help somebody pay more attention…",
        "Let me interrupt for just a moment to say that I'm Paul Raeburn and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "Now, one of the things - you talked about the voice a little bit being part of this, not that we have any particular interest in the voice at NPR.",
        "But can voice alone create this kind of trust that we're talking about?",
        "I believe so.",
        "I believe so.",
        "And of course, it has to do with numerous aspects of the voice.",
        "Probably the pitch is very important.",
        "I think that voices that are in middle range probably tend to be more trusted than others, especially if they are in very high range or voices that are very shrill, for example.",
        "And - but then there are all sorts of aspects that have to do with the music of the voice, what we call prosody.",
        "Of course, with accent…",
        "What is that word?",
        "Prosody?",
        "Prosody.",
        "It has to do with the kind of musical intonation that any person's speech will naturally show.",
        "So for example, your voice, as you speak, or mine, have a certain music that is fairly characteristic of each of us.",
        "And it is really - it has to do with tones and how they glide as you speak.",
        "It does not have to do with the phonemes specifically, it does not have to do at all with the content of the words.",
        "There are many ways of saying a word with different kinds of prosody and many kinds of inflection and cadence and whatsoever."

        "So all of those characteristics, which of course can be teased apart, but overall together when you and I area speaking are also part of how a person judges a voice, especially when you're listening to the voice, as we do in radio, without being able to look at the person.",
