        "It's because the midterms are coming up.",
        "And midterm elections are historically rough for a president, but they are historically brutal for presidents when their ratings are below 50 percent.",
        "In the past when a president's approval was below 50 percent, their party lost an average of 41 House seats in that first midterm.",
