        "Yeah.",
        "It's remarkable how geckos are able to walk up the wall and, you know, hang from a single foot.",
        "I think people for years thought that the gecko must have some type of glue on their surface and during the last seven or eight years, people have elucidated the mechanisms and it turns out there's absolutely no glue on the surface, but that they have this hierarchal structure ending in these nano-pillars.",
        "And the nano-pillars make these typically insignificant interaction between two surfaces significant such as Van der Waals interactions and capillary forces.",
        "Whoa.",
        "Van der Waals interactions.",
        "Now, remind us, for those of us whose physical chemistry was a few years further back.",

        "The easiest way to think about it is any molecule at a certain point in time may have a buildup of positive charge on one side and negative charge on the other.",

        "But I guess this is more on a molecular level?",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "It's almost, you know, completely different mechanism, whereas Velcro is a mechanical interlock mechanism that doesn't rely so much on these other types of forces, but the gecko has evolved to be able to use just millions of these nano-pillars to increase the surface area of contact and make the Van der Waals forces and capillary forces which are typically not significant, significant.",

        "So what was the challenge here to recapitulate this design in something that could be put into a living person or what was the big challenge?",
        "Well, I think, you know, initially, we weren't even thinking about the gecko.",
        "We recognized that there was really a big need for biomedical adhesives, for internal applications that were tape-based, so something like the equivalent of an internal band-aid.",
        "And you know, we surveyed the literature, we looked at what was available in the clinic and we quickly realized that many of the glues just don't have strong adhesion.",

        "Whether that translates into more protection, we still don't know.",
        "But it might and researchers are looking at that.",

        "Back in 1982, when Syria was on the brink of a civil war - the government then was challenged by the Muslim Brotherhood - there was a crack down there and that resulted in tens of thousands of deaths.",
        "Much of Hama was leveled, so the city has become a symbol of state violence in the Arab world.",
        "Now, this new generation of protesters, they are challenging the government again in Hama.",
        "Another reason for the large turnout today, for the first time since the protest began, opponents of the Syrian government, mostly exiled dissidents, met in Turkey.",
        "And they called for the ousting of the president and pledged to help coordinate the uprising."
