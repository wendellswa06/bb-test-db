        "And this album explores two of his great fascinations: American politics and the Kennedy legacy.",
        "The album's called \"\"Rose Kennedy.\"\" And it's funny 'cause he's writing it from the point of view of the Kennedy matriarch.",

        "And while Biolay's getting tired of being compared to him constantly, his albums are conjuring up a similar fan base, I think.",
        "Like Gainsbourg, Biolay's music owes more to American styles than French.",
        "His production is contemporary, yet it's got a timeless quality to it, and he frequently reels in these breathy, sensual female companions to flesh out his sound the way Gainsbourg did with Brigitte Bardot and Jane Birkin.",
        "And actually a few years ago, Biolay married Chiara Mastroianni, the daughter of Catherine Deneuve and Marcello Mastroianni, and together they recorded an album of duets called \"\"Home.\"\" And this album tells the story of an imaginary road trip across America.",

        "products to draw down the trade deficit, Bishop says it's in China's interest to delay the U.S.",
        "tariff hikes.",
        "He says it'll give the Chinese more time to bolster its economy in case both sides fail to reach a solution on trade, which Bishop says is just the tip of the iceberg.",
        "The trade is just one dimension of multi-dimensional relationship that's full of tensions and potential problems."

        "So people are being snared by investment scams.",
        "They are being told, oh, you can buy these foreclosed properties for, you know, pennies on a dollar, which of course is not true, or they are being conned into buying commercial property that doesn't exist, because everybody sort of thinks that real estate can only go up, up, up.",
        "Of course many of us know now, with the markets slowing down, that that is not true.",
        "Right.",
        "Also on the list, which seems to always be on the list, the oil and gas scam.",
        "Well, they're definitely on the list now because the prize of gas has gone up and so everyone's looking for alternative ways for fuel efficiency.",
        "And so they get them to invest in companies that have possibly technology.",
