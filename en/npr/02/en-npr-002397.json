        "OK, they're there, so let's go.",
        "We got a lot to cover today.",
        "Let's start off with the impeachment of former President Clinton as an historic event that most assumed would go down in history, and it has.",
        "Also it has in the textbooks of millions of students.",
        "Now here's the question that I have for the three of you.",
        "What would you want your kids to know about the impeachment?",
        "Would you want every lurid detail to be gone over?",
        "Michael, let's start with you.",
        "Well, I would say this: Who knew that a White House intern, Ms. Monica Lewinsky, would literally go down in history?",
        "The Clinton sex tales are just too lurid, too sordid for textbooks.",
        "It is a tale for oral history, so to speak.",
        "So low.",
        "I would want my children to know that...",
        "Yeah, Yvonne, what--go ahead.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "...that they had a president of the United States who was unfortunately a notorious liar.",
        "And who can ever forget `I did not have sexual relations with that woman,' pause, and then he had to say, `Ms.",
        "Lewinsky.",
        "Because we didn't believe him.",
        "We wanted to know who he was talking about.",
        "All right.",
        "But let's bring the others in.",
        "Yvonne, what do you say?",
        "You want your kids to know?",
        "I would have to say I would agree with Michael.",
        "I think certainly we need to discuss it within the context that he was impeached in that process.",
        "I don't think that we need to go through all the lurid and bawdy details of whether or not it was sex and all that parsing that went on.",
        "I guess where I kind of differ slightly, I think it has to have some context, too.",
        "And just from what I've read, I'm just not sure is it enough to say he had improper relations and just cut it off at that.",
        "I think it has to be put in the context of what was going on at that point in time politically and socially.",
        "Why was it relevant?",
        "Because if you come from somewhere else, and people who came from Europe, people come from other cultures, they just didn't get a grip on what we were so uptight about.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why was such a big deal, right?",
        "Yeah, why it was such a big deal.",
        "So I think you need to talk about him as the lying aspect, and also the social and political that we have, you know, fundamentalist Christians, we have other people with religious ideas about this whole thing.",
        "So just--and it was, in some cases, politically motivated.",
        "People who didn't like him from the door now had some actual ammunition to use against him."

        "And these issues are still being debated to this day.",
        "There are people who philosophically don't see anything wrong with what Clinton may or may not have done as long as he didn't involve taxpayers' money, as long as he didn't do anything in the presidential office that would have had a negative effect on the population.",
        "It was a personal problem.",
        "I personally believe that it's intellectually irresponsible to speak of the impeachment without dealing with the root cause, and that's the cause that many people still believe is somewhat nebulous.",

        "Timing is everything is the point that I was going to make.",

        "And you had judicial rulings and Supreme Court rulings on that.",
        "And that's what brought him down, the process itself, the judicial process and his lying in that context.",

        "So certainly by talking about the facts as we know them, I think it's certainly sufficient to do that.",
        "I think what we will need some time to gather is what is the final judgment on how significant this incident was in his overall presidency.",

        "A 15-year-old girl was killed, six others wounded.",
        "So do they have a point?",
        "I think they do have some validity there, but you got to be able to take the good with the bad.",
        "And that's in everything, in relationship, it's in the context of imitation and the society of imitation, and the bottom line is that the United States exports everything.",
        "And the world sets the clock of human history accordingly.",
        "We export styles, we export music, we even export pseudo democracy and tongue-in-cheek freedom.",
        "So it's only logical that the cultural violence is going to go out worldwide as well.",
        "And Canada's gun-related deaths have doubled in just a year and there's got to be some validity to the notion that proximity and availability and the whole cultural imitation kind of mind-set is real.",
        "There's some validity to that, yeah."

        "Apparently, she has become the most popular member of the Bush administration and a potential candidate, some say, to succeed her boss in the White House.",
        "So let me put this question to you--I'm going to start with you, Mike Meyers, and we're going to spread it around.",

        "Journalism and pundits in Washington, DC, like to talk to themselves and they are itching for what they call a cat fight.",
        "They want to see Condi Rice up against Hillary Clinton, and this is what it's all about.",
        "She has more likely of a chance of becoming president of a university before she has a chance of becoming president of the United States, notwithstanding her stellar qualifications.",
        "I mean, Colin Powell, let's not forget, was also popular when he wasn't running for president.",
        "Well, that's...",
        "And many people here are still torn on the issue of Condi's mentality, whether Rice is brown or white.",
        "So the White House will continue to tout her as a double minority--parade her to all sides as a symbol of accomplishment, but in the end, her personal philosophy still remains kind of cloudy, and I don't think she's established her own personality and philosophy to the extent that she could be a quality candidate for president."
