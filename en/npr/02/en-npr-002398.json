        "Well, Yvonne, do you think that her changing status--or let me put it another way.",
        "How do you think her changing status has affected someone like Bush?",
        "Is she a leadership threat in any way?",
        "Well, first of all, I don't know, frankly, that I agree with the whole notion that she's being touted out as anything.",

        "So this whole idea of double minority--that's just a fact of life, so I don't know that that's necessarily how she's being displayed in public.",
        "I just think that the woman is smart.",
        "Colin Powell did not like to travel; that was a given.",
        "Everyone knew that he certainly liked to use the phone, he certainly made the trips that were necessary.",
        "But in terms of his tact for diplomacy or rather his methods for diplomacy, he did not like travel.",
        "She, on the other hand, may like travel because it keeps her out of the Washington fray, or she might just have an idea that this is the best way to handle diplomacy.",
        "Either way you cut it, she's been out of the beltway fracas, and she's been able to establish herself.",
        "I think we have heard Condoleezza Rice.",
        "I think we've heard her opinions.",
        "I think that whether or not we like them--that's a totally different ballpark to deal in.",
        "But I think we've heard who she is, and I think that she is a bright woman and she has been able to moderate those same opinions to fit different audiences.",
        "But frankly, I haven't heard a whole lot different from her from the very beginning.",
        "So I think we know who she is.",
        "I think she's too smart to run for president, frankly.",
        "I think this is a media concoction.",
        "I think that she'd do far better to probably be the baseball commissioner, which is the real job that she wants...",
        "That she wants, yeah.",
        "...or go back to Stanford or some other high-end university and call it a day.",
        "Well, is she getting a pass?",
        "Is she getting a pass?",
        "Call it a decade.",
        "Seriously, is she getting a pass?",
        "Sure.",
        "I think that we're focusing--I think the media likes to focus on what she's wearing and all that kind of nonsense.",
        "So on that level perhaps she is getting a pass.",
        "But I think--again, it's easy for people to keep saying, `Oh, well, we don't know what she thinks.",
        "She's, you know, punting for Bush.",
        "I think we've already heard what she has to say and, again, either we like it or don't like it, but to keep saying we don't know where she stands--I think it's been on the record and continues to be on the record.",
        "What she's saying is where she stands."
