        "Many, if not most, don't have air conditioning.",
        "In fact it seems, many didn't even have electric fans and they quickly cleaned out the supply at local retailers.",

        "They stayed here for a while.",
        "When the heat hit - I mean they went.",
        "Ditto for several other hardware and house ware stores I tried, with no luck at the office supply place, either.",
        "But then I got a tip in my hunt for the elusive electric fan.",
        "Okay, we're in the parking lot of the Costco, which is a big - I guess they call it a big box retailer.",
        "There's a car alarm going off.",
        "And I have heard that perhaps there are fans for sale here, if you get here early enough to get one.",

        "Now Costco requires shoppers to buy a membership card and those who pay extra to register as business customers get to go in early.",
        "Everybody else has to wait until 10:00 a.m. At a little past nine, already, a lot of regular customers are lined up waiting.",
        "Other people get to get in first while we wait.",
        "And we watch and count the fans as they come out.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Yeah.",
        "There is a kind of a natural tendency for local police officers to look for help from experts when it comes to tackling difficult crimes and that's an appropriate role for the FBI.",
        "The harder question is -when those experts on the FBI step in, do they help or hurt, or are they in any way useful?",
        "And there is an extraordinary dearth of hard evidence to show that the profiles created by the FBI are actually useful in catching criminals.",
        "A dearth?",
        "They don't help?",
        "Well, we have - there was one - a large study done in England a couple of years ago commissioned by the British Home Office, which discovered that in 2.7 percent of cases, police officers said the profile actually led to the arrest of a suspect - 2.7 percent.",
        "A stopped clock is more useful than that.",
        "What's that?",
        "Were they analyzing American cases that involved the FBI or British cases that involved MI6?"

        "We have an FBI study which - I'm sure John Douglas will talk about when he comes on, which uses a much softer standard which said when does it help in the arrest of a suspect.",
        "And there the best number they could come up with was I think it was 16 percent.",
        "These are not impressive numbers and they're also highly subjective.",
        "You know, if you're asking police does something help, you're going to get a larger number than if you ask a very strict question like did it actually lead to the arrest of a suspect?",
        "And are you critical of the entire concept of profiling or would you suggest that there might be better ways to profile?",
        "No.",
        "I think that there is absolutely a role for forensic investigation and analysis in investigations of crimes.",
        "And there are no questions that there are people out there who can be of enormous value to law enforcement based on a kind of proper scientific evaluation of the evidence in a crime.",
        "All I'm saying is that the particular kind of profiling that the FBI fell in love with in the '80s and that is represented in the books written by people like John Douglas and in the television shows that have been inspired by them, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest that that kind of profiling is useful.",
        "Well, let's hear from Mr. Douglas.",
        "John Douglas is a former FBI agent, one of the pioneers in the field of criminal profiling.",
        "He's the author of \"\"Mind Hunter\"\" and most recently, \"\"Inside the Mind of the BTK Killer,\"\" which came out last month.",
