        "And John Douglas and then we'll get to the callers, I promise.",
        "Is it science if Malcolm Gladwell write about homology?",
        "We conducted interviews of 36 serial killers to begin with.",
        "But we interviewed, really, dozens, hundreds more and other types of violent offenders.",
        "I do not believe that we can have a statistical database that we could look at a case and say, okay, based on this case, you know, 90 percent of the time it's going to be, you know, someone with high school education.",
        "The same question was asked to me by former Attorney General Janet Reno after Waco, Texas.",
        "And she wanted us to look at every possible type of hostile situation, barricaded subject.",
        "And on the break, I went up to her and I said, you know, we are doing interviews and we are conducting the research.",
        "However, what if it was a situation where we had a barricaded subject and I told you that 90 percent of the time if we did X, Y and Z from previous cases, we had a favorable response.",
        "But in this particular case, I don't believe that we should go the 90 percent, it's the 10 percent - that we should go with the 10 percent, what would you do?",
        "Attorney General Reno told me, she says, well, I would weigh everything and I'll make my decision.",
        "But technically, I know what would happen.",
        "Politically, she would pick the 90 percent because if something went wrong, she can always say, well, I went with the statistics.",
        "Every case is analyzed individually.",
        "It's not an A, B, C, D, E type of checklist and some people try to make it that.",
        "I'm not hearing an answer to the question.",
        "You said it's not science and we've heard…",
        "Right.",
        "…your explanation to that.",
        "Does what Malcolm Gladwell describes as homology, can you go to a crime scene and you reliably extract something useful about who did it?",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "I did a case recently based on the analysis of the scene.",
        "The woman was taken from inside the house.",
        "She was strangled.",
        "She was placed under the crawl space of the house.",
        "After analyzing the case, there was a lot of different things going on with the case, I said that the person responsible here is - it's a domestic homicide.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, what would be the reasoning to remove the victim from upstairs in the second floor to hide it into the crawl space?",
        "And I said, the reason is, is that he killed his wife and he took his child out earlier - later that day and when he came back, he did not want his son to find his wife killed upstairs.",
        "So I said the crime scene has been staged.",
        "And it took that, and ran with that, and the husband was responsible.",

        "Anyway, I'm wondering if perhaps profiling could actually be a hindrance to investigations because it might narrow the investigation too much.",
        "It will be focusing so much on the profiles that they would miss things that otherwise might come out at them or maybe miss in a atypical situation.",
        "And I would love it also if you could really - I understand about the - on the interviews and I'm wondering if just maybe - part of the profiling has factor on it some kind of, you know, detail or factor analysis, but also describe what goes into - really goes into creating a profile.",
        "And I'm going to hang up and thank you so much.",
        "Okay.",
        "Why don't you answer that last part of the question, if you would, John Douglas?",
        "The factors that go into the…",
        "Yeah.",

        "The factors go into a profile is the details -victimology - regarding specifics of the victim.",

        "And hopefully, we'll be sending them in the right direction.",
        "But what has to be understood by listeners is that this is used - criminal profiling is used after all logical leads have been exhausted.",
        "They come to us with their hands up - we don't know, or we may have a suspect, but we don't know if this person is the person we believe who's responsible.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And Malcolm Gladwell, were you able to find evidence of instances where profiling actually got in the way of successfully solving a crime?",
        "Well, I think you could make a very strong argument that in the search for the Unabomber, the profiles, they were - I mean, Mr. Douglas knows his history well, they were warring profiles within the FBI, one of which said that the Unabomber was a kind of blue collar guy, one of which said that the Unabomber was an educated guy, you know, with ties to academia.",

        "And finally, the - for a critical period, the blue collar, the completely wrong profile, was the one that was gottrn in the investigation.",
        "Secondarily as well, the profiles in that case consistently said that the offender was younger than he actually was, which proved absolutely critical because many times, they came close to identifying Kaczynski as a suspect, but didn't because they were looking for someone who is younger.",
        "So I think the - this is absolutely a kind of occupational hazard of this kind of, you know, astrological exercise.",
        "And that is to the extent that you provide more specific details and try to be more useful to the investigation.",
        "You also run a very high false positive risk, the risk of giving information that completely throws the - that inappropriately narrows the focus of the investigation.",
        "And that, you know, to me, we have to think about not just those cases.",
        "I mean, profilers do wonderful jobs telling us about the cases when they were right, and very little time telling us about the times when they were wrong.",
        "And we need to sit down and figure out if the bad stuff outweigh the value of the good stuff.",
        "And I think it does.",

        "We thought he'd be single.",
        "Getting back to the Unabomber, I have to agree with him, there was a problem with the Unabomber case.",
        "I did the original profile in the early '80s and it evolved and evolved.",

        "I don't know what he's talking about here because the case went on for 20 years.",
        "It was an old individual we were looking for.",
        "But there were people in the other side of the FBI who, because of evidence found at the first bombing, the Unabomber, there was a material found, steel wool was only used by airplane mechanics.",
        "So they stayed with this red herring, this - that forensic evidence, even when we had the manifesto and you can tell this was a professor.",
        "This person was bright.",
        "And he turned out to be bright, he had a 155 I.Q.",
        "And so there were factions within the organization.",
        "And just like there are factions - not all of us will think the same, when we're analyzing a case.",
        "You know, we may have disagreements.",
        "I've gone against the bureau on several occasions.",
        "JonBenet Ramsey - I took a totally different side on that case than the FBI.",
        "Yet in this sort of situation, I think one the things Malcolm Gladwell writes about, he could speak for himself, but it's this idea that there is this sort of magical tool that can be, you know, unloaded off a plane when the FBI profilers come to town.",

        "When Mr. Douglas talks about how the media has this notion - a false notion of profilers.",
        "The reason the media has this false notion of profilers it's because Mr. Douglas wrote books like \"\"Mind Hunter\"\" and \"\"Obsession\"\" and his new one \"\"Inside the Mind of BTK.\"\" I mean, it's awfully rich for him to turn around and start blaming the media for having a false notion of what profilers do when he created that notion in those books.",
        "I mean, if he wrote his books, which I have read, in the same way that he's talking now, we wouldn't have this problem.",
