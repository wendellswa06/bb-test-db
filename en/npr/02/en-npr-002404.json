        "Sure, but it's an assessment of the existing scientific research, the existing literature.",
        "So we already have a pretty good idea of what science will ultimately constitute that report.",
        "It's the science that has been done in recent years, establishing the linkage between climate change and actual impacts that aren't just theoretical, they're not just something that we predicted, they're actually taking place.",
        "We are seeing climate change now play out in terms of the way the weather is changing, the changing characteristics of our weather towards more extreme events of various types.",
        "You know, and for the first time we're actually seeing or hearing scientists make that connection.",
        "They've been fearful about saying oh, you know, this is just the weather, it's not really the climate.",
        "But more and more we're hearing people saying this is what climate change looks like.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "You know, there's of course a certain randomness to weather.",
        "Weather you get on a given day is going to depend on the random vagaries of the atmosphere.",
        "But when you step back, and you look at the statistics of the weather, you can look to see if they're changing.",
        "It's sort of like rolling dice.",
        "You know, you roll a die, sixes are going to come up, on average, one every six times.",
        "What we are seeing now is sixes coming up twice as often as they should.",

        "over the past decade being broken at twice the rate we would expect from chance alone.",
        "Over this last year, it was about 10 to one.",
        "And so there's a larger context.",
        "It was the warmest year in the U.S., as you alluded to earlier, and within that warm year were a very large and record-breaking number of extreme warm days.",
        "So we are set on some kind of climate change course that is irreversible at this point?",
        "Well, we're committed to a certain amount of additional warming of the globe.",
        "We've already warmed a little under one degree Celsius.",
        "We're probably committed to at least another half a degree Celsius just because of the heating that we've already put in the pipeline.",
        "So that means that we don't have a whole lot of wiggle room if we're going to avoid two degree Celsius warming of the globe relative to pre-industrial time, that's three and a half degrees Fahrenheit.",
        "That's what most scientists who study climate change impacts say is sort of where we enter into the red zone, the danger zone, where we start to see some of the most severe impacts of climate change play out.",
        "And what time, what part of the century might that happen?"
