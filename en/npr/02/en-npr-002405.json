        "Paul, with about two minutes to go, talk to me about what Stanley has just brought up, the idea that there are so many imitators to the throne, as we talked about who wanted to be Richard Pryor but just didn't have the ability to do what he did.",
        "Well, there's only one Richard Pryor.",
        "There can't be two.",
        "It's a done deal.",
        "And what he's saying is true in a lot of areas.",
        "Richard was brilliant at what he did and he gave a lot of love and he was very creative.",
        "And it's--to me, it's like, you know, life is very strange.",
        "Richard--his speech, his talking ability, Richard ended up where he wasn't talking anymore.",
        "He talked with his eyes.",
        "Whenever I'd go see him, he'd talked with his eyes.",
        "He couldn't--it's like the same thing with Muhammad Ali.",
        "These two people used their words and now they can't.",

        "I mean, that's why I said that Richard can't speak but I can speak, you know, 'cause I was right there.",
        "Richard used to sleep on my living room floor when I first met him and drive my '52 Ford.",
        "That's a true story.",
        "He didn't even have a license.",
        "He drove it for about three weeks.",
        "And when--I told him to go to Berkeley.",
        "When he went to Berkeley, California, we'd go up together--this is how much I love this man.",
        "He was drinking all the way from Hennessy, drinking and driving, and we were singing all the way, all the old tunes.",
        "That's how crazy I was, you know.",
        "And that's a true story.",
        "And then later on, Richard had a Rolls-Royce, a Corniche they call them, the real expensive one.",
        "He came up to The Comedy Store in Hollywood, he drove it up.",
        "And I said, `Richard, let me drive it up, let me park it.",
        "He said, `I'm not letting you park my Rolls-Royce.",
        "I said, `Well, you drove my '52 Ford for three weeks.",
        "That was my Rolls-Royce.",
        "He said, `Yeah, you're right,' and he let me drive it.",
        "The world has truly lost some laughter and, as I said, often we use the word genius, but in this case, it is real.",
        "Richard Pryor, dead at 65, but luckily those of us who were here at the time and shared the space and world with Richard Pryor were made a little happier at the time in the laughter that he brought to us.",
        "Stanley Crouch, thank you very much for putting it in context socially for us.",
        "And, Paul Mooney, thank you so much for joining us and sharing remembrances of one of your good friends and, again, you're as much of making Richard Pryor who he ultimately became as anyone, so we thank you so much.",
        "Well, hey, it's the Lone Ranger and Tonto, it's Lucy and Ethel.",
        "There's no separating Richard and I.",
        "And we were there from the beginning and Richard did change a lot of things.",
        "He really did.",
        "He really did.",
        "All right.",
        "Paul Mooney, thank you very much.",
        "Yeah, we go across quite often and we do a lot of shopping in Canada, but you know, I guess that's where that part is our - that our dollar doesn't go as far as it used to up there."
