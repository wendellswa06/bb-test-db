        "The winners are business people - companies.",

        "And that business people…",

        "I don't see that happening, so the poor are still getting a little poorer.",

        "Now.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "Does that equate back to the American consumers?",
        "What my question is I don't see it coming back to the American consumer.",
        "The business?",
        "Yes, I understand that.",
        "But I still don't see that, I guess, it'd be Ronald Reagan -trickle down if you want to go that way, but I don't see that still coming back to me and my family.",
        "Well, the cost of living could go up a bit, right, Mark Zandi?",

        "Dayton, Ohio.",
        "In Dayton, Ohio, there's a lot of manufacturers, they sell their goods all over the world.",
        "If the manufacturers in your neighborhood is, in your part of the country, is now able to sell more to Europe and to Canada, they'll go out and hire more workers, it's more likely that they will hold on to the workers that they have, give them a bigger pay increase.",
        "And so they'll be able to go out and spend a little bit more, buy a bigger house, maybe take a vacation, and so it will benefit the folks that work for that company, you know, and that is a benefit.",
        "I should equate General Motors wanting to go overseas and all these other companies wanting to move overseas, move their whole company overseas-based with which a lot of them have done and shut down factories.",

        "In fact, I just picked up a news story today, a senior executive of Daimler was saying that if the Euro stays at 1.45 for very long - and that's where we are roughly now - that they will have to seriously consider producing more cars here in the United States, which obviously means more jobs and more income.",

        "Okay.",

        "This is the Santa Clara company is a startup, it doesn't have a lot of money to throw around and I guess when the contract came up for renewal, the software developers in India asked for a raise, essentially, just to compensate for the drop in the dollar.",
        "They went from $22 an hour to $25 an hour for their services.",
        "Now, anybody who buys software in the United States knows that's still a fraction of what it costs to produce software here.",
        "But still, for a small company in Silicon Valley just trying to get started, a little bump-up like that hurts.",
        "And as it continues to work away at the margins, there's a friction in this outsourcing, too.",
        "All of these difficulties start adding up.",
        "Well, this is, of course, the movement of technology jobs to places like India became one of the prime symbols for globalization at the - in the earlier part of the decade, and there was a lot of handwringing about American - high-end American jobs being lost that did happen.",
        "But as the situation develops, we find a much more complicated situation and one of the effects is that some of the larger Indian companies are actually stepping up their hiring of American software workers and developers.",
        "Who are suddenly a little bit less expensive?",
        "Who are suddenly - who are suddenly on sale.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So this is roiling that assumption that we made about, you know, shipping jobs offshore?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mark Zandi was talking about some of the complicated crosscutting effects, and the technology world certainly illustrates those.",
        "Indeed, that the Indian companies are now looking to outsource some of their work in cheaper labor markets like China."
