        "They have now just increased that to the equivalent of 10 large power stations.",
        "That's new capacity coming into China in that field of solar this year as part of a plan to build the equivalent of 35 large power stations worth of solar over the next three or four years, up to the end of, up to the end of 2015.",
        "So the solar story is very exciting.",
        "The wind energy story, which of course is a bigger, at the moment a much bigger part of their power generation capacity, is exciting.",
        "If you talk to the Chinese auto manufacturers, what they tell you is that they think the global future for cars is electric.",
        "And they're determined to win that race, and they're putting enormous amounts of investment into that.",
        "And I know that that's unsettling the European manufacturers.",
        "I don't know how it's going down in Detroit.",
        "And meanwhile, the people who are trying to build a modern power grid system in China are also determined to make it world's most advanced flexible grid system that can talk to your fridge and your electric car and all the other things that you have in your house, so that the whole thing operates more efficiently.",
        "That's, if you like, the new Chinese economy.",
        "Alongside it, you've got the old Chinese economy, which as you've said, is based on coal, and they're still building, they're now building about half as much new coal capacity a year as they were before the financial crisis hit.",
        "But it's still about one power station a week.",
        "So you've got the high-carbon economy and the low-carbon economy, both powering along alongside each other.",
        "And I think the question for all of us, rather than just kind of standing back and being bowled over by the numbers, is to say how can we engage with China, what can we say to China, what can we build with China that will, as it were, strengthen the forces of high ambition inside China in this transition.",
        "All right, let me take a break, we'll come back and hear some other views on this.",
        "And I know Eileen Claussen is chomping at the bit to answer this one.",

        "Eileen, what's your response to all of this?",
        "Well, I think John is much too pessimistic about the United States and much too optimistic about China.",
        "I mean if you look at Chinese emissions over let's say the period 2005 to 2010, U.S.",
        "emissions are down eight percent, the EU is down nine percent, and China was up 30 percent.",
        "Almost all the projections that I've looked at suggest that China will be about one-third of global emissions by 2035.",
        "So yes, they are the number one solar tech manufacturer in the world, but only about .2 percent of their electricity generation is solar.",
        "They have more wind than anyone else in the world, but we actually in the U.S.",
        "have more that is connected to the grid.",
        "So it is a question of how China moves forward.",
        "It's a question about how we all move forward.",
        "And I think the reality is, is that nobody is doing what the science tells us has to be done.",
        "Well, one thing that China has that the U.S.",
        "doesn't is an energy policy.",
        "They have a direction.",
        "They have a vision of where they're going.",
        "We have a little bit here and a little bit there.",
        "I mean we have 30 states and the District of Columbia with renewable portfolio standards.",
        "California is the ninth-largest economy in the world, and they have a very ambitious cap and trade program.",
        "We started to see some regulatory efforts by the Obama administration on cars and light trucks that have actually had an enormous impact.",
        "I think in the next four years we're going to see a lot more rules.",
        "So you have that on the one side, on the policy side, and then you've got something like the big boom in natural gas, where a lot of natural gas has replaced coal, and that's one of the reasons our emissions are actually going down.",
        "And that was market forces, not rules and policy.",
        "Michael, where do you - can you be a referee on this at all?",
        "Well, you know, you can certainly look at the glass as being either half-empty or half-full when you look at China because there is this - almost a schizophrenia.",
        "They are, as, you know, we heard earlier, building a coal-fired power plant every week, but they are investing more in solar and wind technology than we are."

        "And don't the other countries have the right to that same - to take advantage of that same energy source?",
        "Only if we show some leadership on this issue when it comes to getting our own carbon emissions under control do we have the moral authority to speak to these other countries who want to come online with their own global energy - their own energy economies.",

        "I can only offer my kind of observations as a frequent visitor there.",
        "One thing that you get very strongly if you go to Beijing nowadays is a sense that the growth model, the way of structuring the economy, which has been hugely successful in many ways for China over the last 30 years, is now at the end of its useful life - carbon intensive, energy intensive, resource intensive, generating enormous internal stresses, the air pollution in Beijing being one example, which is not just economically damaging, it's politically destabilizing.",
        "And so there is a very pragmatic, very open-minded approach to how can we build a new growth model.",
        "What does a low-carbon, ultra-energy-efficient, ultra-resource-efficient, more resilient growth model look like?",
        "And nothing - they have a saying in China; it doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long as it catches mice.",
        "You don't get the same kind of ideological constraints on the debate in China than you get certainly in my country and in parts of Europe, but frankly also, again, as a friend of America, you also get here, that you can't do this because this would be too much state and too much government intervention in the market.",
        "In China, by and large, they're just, they're much more interested in what's the outcome and what might deliver the outcome.",
        "My worry about China isn't so much that, it's that you have in some ways quite a chaotic situation.",
        "It's going through rapid change.",
        "The rise in Chinese emissions that Eileen mentioned, of course, is associated with the rapid expansion in the Chinese economy, which has happened over the last - much faster than any other major economy.",
        "But you know, Karl Marx wasn't the only person who noted that economic change has political consequences.",
        "And those political stresses now in China are quite acute, and there are very powerful interests who want to protect themselves in the change."

        "So you have a system which is much more in flux than in - and therefore much harder for outsiders to predict where it's going.",
        "But I do come back, you have to look at the structural forces that are - it doesn't tell you very much to look at, as it were, real-time changes in annual emissions.",
        "You have to try and identify what are the forces that are going to determine where jobs and growth and competitiveness are going to be coming from five, 10, 15 years in the future.",
        "And I think at that level the Chinese debate is further advanced than it is in Britain, in most other European countries, possibly with the exception of Germany, but also I fear, and I regret this, but I think also further advanced than here.",
        "Yeah, I think the projections suggest that India will be the number two coal-burner in the world in about five years.",
        "So yes, India is another country that we have to work with.",
        "I mean all the big economies, the 10 largest economies in the world, I think, account for about 70 percent of emissions, and that's really what's going to count when we think about Michael Mann's numbers about the climate and the number of degrees of warming that we're going to have.",
        "But John, are the Chinese doing this because they feel that it's global warming that's the problem?",
        "What is their - or is it an economic and a business question?",
        "I think it's a combination of factors.",
        "But I think that it's very striking how awareness of China's vulnerability to climate change, climate stresses, has grown rapidly over the last five years or so.",
        "Those stresses are much more tangible if you're Chinese.",
        "China is already under extreme water stress, for example.",
        "Droughts and floods really matter.",
        "They have very acute consequences in China.",
        "The most politically sensitive issue of all in China is food prices.",
        "So if water stress pushes up food prices, that gets attention.",
        "And so I think it is a reasonably strong signal.",
        "It could be stronger.",
        "I think there's an interesting paradoxical difference between the reality in China and the reality in India, which we've just been talking about, which is that India is equally, as it were, on the front line of those stresses.",
        "If the monsoon were to fail for a couple of years in a row in India, that would be a global catastrophe, not just an Indian catastrophe.",
        "And yet I think the degree of awareness among the elite in India, the people who have their hands on the levers, are pulling the levers, is a lot less.",
        "And so is the degree of pragmatism.",
        "I think there's much more of a tendency among the Indian elite to see the conversation about climate change as some kind of hidden Western agenda to do India down in some way.",
        "And so that, I think, is not a helpful, is not a helpful factor.",
        "But the other thing, of course, is that up until now, China is a lot bigger and still growing faster than India.",
        "It's a bigger piece of this jigsaw.",
        "It's actually quite misleading to compare the two because India at the moment is still an order of magnitude smaller, although as Eileen said, the coal part of the India picture is coming out(ph) very strongly.",
        "I mean I think one of the things that is really important to talk about here, at least for a minute or two, is not only how we need to reduce emissions but how we need to build resilience, because, as you mentioned, Ira, early on, I mean we've had Sandy, we've had the droughts."
