        "Yes.",
        "...sort of big point, Ira?",
        "I mean, again, as a sort of friend of America, if you like, for me, everything that has been wonderful about America in recent generations has come from the notion that we can use reason and science to understand the human condition and to improve it.",
        "In other words, America had, for a long time, a political system which, I suppose you could call reality-based system.",
        "Let's understand reality.",
        "Let's use science to understand reality and improve reality.",
        "And, indeed, that's the legacy of the Enlightenment.",
        "We have that in Europe as well, and it's something which, in some of the other emerging economies, is now coming into place.",
        "I - my impression is that that is coming under more strain in this country than it's come under for a very long time, because there are people who say, actually, you know, building upon reality is not the only way to make the choices that we face.",
        "And that fills me with alarm, because I think it means that the only way to come out in the right place on climate change in America is to win that deeper struggle, which, in the - is really not a political struggle.",
        "It's a cultural struggle.",
        "And that means that the forces of the Enlightenment have to rally around and defend the reality-based approach to making the choices that we face.",
        "That - if I can put in - I was asked to - by Arizona State University to say that there are still some tickets available for the great debate tomorrow night that was referred to at the beginning of the - and it'll be webcast.",
        "But as I understand it, that's kind of what ASU are trying to do by bringing this group of people together this weekend.",
        "But I think, you know, we have to understand, this isn't a policy debate about climate change.",
        "It's a political and cultural debate about the way in which we make the great choices that we're faced with.",
        "OK.",

        "And I want to also bring in Representative Henry Waxman, who's a Democrat from the 33rd Congressional District of California.",
        "He's ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and he joins us by phone.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, congressman.",

        "I think that the - those who are taking that position, primarily the Republicans, are boxing themselves into a state of denial, putting their heads in the sand and not even acknowledging the science.",
        "When the Republicans took over, I was chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, and the Republicans took over the committee because they won the election in 2010.",
        "They voted overwhelmingly, constantly, to deny the science.",
        "They said that there's no such thing as global warming, that climate change is just not true, or if it's happening, we're not contributing to it.",
        "We've called on them over and over again to at least hold hearings with the scientists.",
        "We do have to make policy based on evidence, and we're hopeful that they will relent and look at this issue more carefully.",
        "But in the meantime, Senator Whitehouse and I have joined together in organizing a bicameral task force to work on climate change, to bring public awareness to it, to develop ideas and to propose legislation, and we're inviting Democrats and Republicans to join with us.",
        "I don't think the Republicans want to be the party of flat Earth, but that's where some of their leaders are taking them at the moment.",
        "But the reality is we've seen Hurricane Sandy.",
        "We've seen the destruction of climate changes with the hurricanes and forest fires.",
        "It's undeniable, and it's costing our country, well, in 2011, over $60 billion.",
        "And the total damages we had in 2012 from weather and climate disasters are going to be even higher, and we're going to continue unless we start taking action.",

        "He's known as a climate skeptic.",
        "He said he'd be holding a hearing on, quote, \"\"the state of the environment.\"\" Does that hold out any hope that some - there might be some meetings or changes of mind up there?",
        "I would hope so.",
        "He's the head of the Science Committee.",
        "Right.",
        "And if they're going to hold a hearing on the state of the environment, they ought to bring in - they'll probably bring in the deniers, but they certainly ought to bring in the credible scientists who can speak with authority as to what we are seeing and what we're experiencing so that Congress can be informed and the public can be further informed.",
        "Well, he's issued a statement - we asked him to come on the program, and he denied that opportunity.",
        "And he said I believe climate change is due to a combination of factors, including natural cycles and human activity.",
        "But scientists still don't know for certain how much each of these factors contributes to the overall climate change that the Earth is experiencing.",
        "It is the role of the Science Committee to create a forum for discussion so Congress and the American people can hear from experts, draw reasoned conclusions.",
        "During this process, we should focus on the facts rather than on a partisan agenda.",
        "Well, that's fine.",
        "I think we ought to do that, and we ought to bring in people who can talk about the facts and base our policies on those facts.",
        "But I have to tell you, I'm still hopeful the Republicans are not going to continue to take this position that they have been taking.",
        "I know a lot of the Republican members are uncomfortable with it.",
        "But there's a - I have a sense of urgency about it, even if they don't buy the whole concerns that we're hearing.",
        "Isn't it prudent to reduce the greenhouse gases, in case they're wrong?",
        "We ought to take some actions.",

        "You know, here in New York, we are fighting having natural gas come.",
        "And with CO2 being a concern, methane gas is much more detrimental than CO2.",
        "And that is released when the natural gas is hydrofracked, and I'd really like that point to be considered.",
        "OK.",
        "Let's talk about it.",
        "Michael Mann.",
        "Sure.",
        "You know, I'm in a state myself, in Pennsylvania, where, you know, there's a development going on today, the Marcellus Shale - shale deposits, the natural gas contained within those deposits.",
        "And so there is, to some extent, an argument that can be made that, you know, unit of power - on a unit of power basis, natural gas produces - the use of natural gas for power produces less CO2 than, say, the burning of coal.",
        "On the other hand, as the caller alludes to, there is this issue - and it's somewhat uncertain - of the matter of fugitive emissions.",
        "We don't know how much of that natural gas - that methane, primarily - might be escaping into the atmosphere through fractures in the ground in the process of recovering that natural gas.",
        "And that's a real wild card, because methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than even CO2.",
        "That means that we are talking about making decisions in the face of substantial uncertainties.",
        "There's an uncertainty as to whether or not it's truly established, that natural gas is a less carbon-intensive energy source than coal, and it comes with different risks.",
        "Let's get a bit into some of the gray area that still remains in climate change.",
        "What aspects of climate science are a sealed deal, so to speak, and what parts are you and other scientists still debating?",
        "There must be some stuff that you're still not sure about."

        "But I think in terms of what the public want and what the rest of politics wants in the U.K., I think the wind is in the sails - of that proposition.",
        "So if you want to have shale gas, you've got to say, how are we going to do this in a way which doesn't distract us from this deeper transformation we have to make?",
        "And, you know, there are issues about whether you want to do shale gas while at the same time capturing and storing the carbon dioxide that burning the gas emits.",
        "Yeah, I'm glad you asked that question, because it's a matter that's already come up in this discussion, the issue of uncertainty.",
        "And sometimes the issue of uncertainty, as we've heard, is seized upon by those who articulate the case for inaction.",
        "They say, well, we shouldn't take any action, as long as we're uncertain about this.",
        "Well, you know, uncertainty doesn't necessarily work that way.",
        "It's a double-edged sword.",
        "And uncertainty can just as easily cut against us, as cut for us.",
        "What that means is that the changes that we may see could be far worse than what we are currently projecting with our climate models.",
        "And there are some reminders, even this last summer, of things that are unfolding faster than we projected them to happen.",
        "The Arctic - the decline in sea ice in the Arctic is taking place faster than climate models projected it to.",
        "The melting of the major ice sheets, the loss of ice from the major ice sheets which is contributing to global sea level rise is proceeding decades ahead of schedule.",
        "And so if we look at uncertainties in the science, yes, there are certain aspects where it's possible the projections overestimate them.",
        "But we're seeing that there's some very key areas of impact where we have actually underestimated - the scientific community has underestimated the changes as they're taking place, and the impacts that they're having.",
        "And anybody, you know, who looks at sort of cost-benefit analysis, economists who study these sorts of issue from a cost-benefit analysis point of view will tell you that you want to mitigate against those perhaps low probability, but catastrophic outcomes that might lie out there.",
        "We can't rule them out, because of the uncertainty.",
        "And so much the same way that we purchase fire insurance for our homes - not because we think our homes are going to burn down, but because we went a hedge against that catastrophic outcome in the rare event that might happen.",
        "We should think of mitigating climate change of getting our carbon emissions under control as a planetary insurance policy.",
        "Congressman Waxman, California just fired up its cap-and-trade program.",
        "Can you give us a little thumbnail sketch of how that works?",
        "The cap-and-trade program, or carbon tax, are ways to put a price on the consequences of putting these greenhouse gases into the air in order to give the incentive for the private markets, for businesses to try to develop technologies, to look for alternative sources of fuel, to be more efficient in their operations.",
        "It's not a government mandate as to how to do things, but it's a clear statement that there's an incentive, financially, to do the things that may improve the situation.",
        "And I think that's all to the good.",
        "When we give those strong incentives, our business community often responds better than we ever expect it.",
        "There's no magic bullet to deal with climate change, but if we give people the right incentives - there's such a thing as the costs.",
        "Let's say, you're at a power plant.",
        "You burn coal.",
        "Coal is very cheap, so you figure that's all - you pay for the coal, you burn it and you get electricity.",
        "But there's another cost, and that's the cost of damage to the environment and public health.",
        "And that to be attributed to the people who are burning coal so that we have a level playing field, and maybe those who want to use coal will try to figure out a way to reduce the carbon or eliminate the carbon or sequester it.",
        "Or the utilities will turn to renewable fuels because they'll be able to compete.",
        "Eileen Claussen, you deal a lot with fossil fuel companies and have in the past.",
        "Don't they want some sort of consistency here so they know about their own future?",
        "I think the answer is yes, but that doesn't mean that all of them would actually like to see a policy to deal with climate change.",
        "I mean, the ones that we deal with would.",
