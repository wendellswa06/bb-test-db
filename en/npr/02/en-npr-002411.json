        "Yes.",
        "Go ahead, John.",
        "I think that your caller, Margaret, was absolutely right to raise a concern about this.",
        "And I think that we've seen - there's a lot of excitement about shale gas in Britain and in parts of Europe as well.",
        "And as part of that, there's an effort going on to try to position gas, and particularly shale gas, as being at the heart of the answer to climate change.",
        "And I think there's been a disingenuous quality about that, because, as Eileen says, yes, your kind of real-time emissions are less than coal if you deal with the fugitive emissions.",
        "But at the same time, you're locking in a further piece of fossil-generated electricity into your electricity system.",
        "Once you've invested in the power stations where they're going to burn the gas, then that's locked you in.",
        "And so I think we need to have a more open and honest debate about - I'm not necessarily in favor of just trying to, kind of, close it all down, but I think we have to ask ourselves what role does this play in the transition that we really need to make, which is to an electricity system which is genuinely carbon-neutral.",
        "We're having an argument in Britain at the moment.",
        "It's absolutely raging argument, about whether we should have a carbon-neutral energy system by 2030, which is quite a rapid transition.",
        "And I think that we will probably get that commitment out of our political system in the next year or two.",
        "At the moment, the Conservative Party, which is heavily influenced by the Tea Party phenomenon here in the U.S., but with a, sort of, time lag of several years, is very hostile to the idea of putting hard limits of any kind on carbon dioxide emissions.",
        "That's technologically available as a choice.",
        "It cost money and, you know, you need a debate whether you want to do that rather than having more renewables or other common neutral forms of energy.",
        "But at the moment, I think there's a slightly distorted quality to the debate about gas, and we need to look at it in a slightly more sensible way.",
        "Well, it boils down, right now, the debate, to just dollars and cents, as being cheaper and...",
        "Yes.",
        "Right, Eileen?",
        "And...",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "I mean, with the price of natural gas, it could crowd everything out of the market.",
        "I think, in the end, that's not sensible energy policy.",
        "You actually need a portfolio.",
        "But John is right to say that, at some point, you'd have to capture - if you're going to move to gas-burning power plants, you'd have to capture and sequester the carbon.",
        "Otherwise, if it displaces coal, it will then become the major source of carbon emissions.",
        "Congressman Waxman, everybody looks to California as being a leader in all kinds of forward-looking things or, you know, from energy, the way food is grown, things like that.",
        "And you have experiments - I mean, statewide experiments.",
        "I'm thinking, for example, of creating electric cars and electric highways and thinking about high-speed trains.",
        "Do you think California can serve as something of an incubator for the rest of us?",
        "And what would that energy future look like for California?"

        "We are proud of the fact that California leads the country in advances that move from the West to East.",

        "And then even when we were pushing more efficient automobiles, it would use less gasoline.",
        "California championed the way, and now what California proposed is a national standard.",
        "There are lot of things that can be done.",
        "What - and I'm proud of California.",
        "But what I would want to impress upon everybody is that we - this - we're releasing carbon into the atmosphere and it stays there for hundreds of years.",
        "The long life of the pollution means that the warming we're causing us practically irreversible.",
        "And it's important we act before too much time, too much warming gets locked in.",
        "And there are things that we think we can do at the federal level and we need strong federal leadership.",
        "The president, on his own, has substantial authority to reduce carbon pollution from power plants, new and existing ones.",
        "Department of Energy can strengthen up plants energy standards, efficiency standards, to reduce emissions and save consumers money at the same time.",
        "And other agencies, besides EPA and DOE, have strong focus on climate.",
        "We have an international agreement in place, called the Montreal Protocol to deal with the chlorofluorocarbons that were causing destruction of the upper ozone layer.",
        "And if we strengthen that, we would do a lot to reduce our contributions to climate change.",
        "There's no silver bullet.",

        "Well, we - my point is, really, that we have little bits of effort in a lot of different countries.",
        "And I think if you look globally, Germany maybe among the best because of what they've done with their renewable sector.",
        "But no one is moving at the rate that we need to move, and no one is doing things, you know, of such a comprehensive way that we actually can deal with this problem.",
        "And so, I think the depressing story here is that we see little signs of progress, and we may see some more, and there maybe some structural changes.",
        "But we really are buying a lot of climate change and it's just going to be devastating.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "And I - and, you know, I think, you know, another reason for our sort of reduction in emissions is because we are seeing some improvements in energy efficiency, but these are really small when you look at the scope of the problem.",
        "And I think, also, it's dangerous to say, let's go after the low-hanging fruit and leave the others, leave the rest to later.",
        "That's the point about the urgency.",
        "You've got to do it all at the same time.",
        "I mean, I agree with everything Eileen's just said, except with one - maybe with one slight distinction.",
        "Which is that one of the changes, over the last few years, is that you can now see, in some places, the low-carbon economy.",

        "You can feel it.",
        "You can see that it's delivering jobs and growth.",

        "Its heyday was in the Victorian ear.",
        "It was strong on coal, and steel and ship building.",
        "And all of those industries collapsed and some of the towns around where I grew up had unemployment rates of 50 percent and above.",
        "It's amazing that they still had social stability there.",
        "That part of our country is now coming to life again.",
        "And it's coming to life on the back of low-carbon industries and low-carbon supply chains.",
        "They're building wind turbines on the banks of the Tyne.",
        "Nissan is building electric cars and exporting them around Europe from the banks of the Tyne.",
        "There are other renewable industries that are connecting to that.",
        "And if you go there, you get a sense of rejuvenation, revitalization, which is in the air, coming out of this transition to the low-carbon economy."
