        "As Vice President Dick Cheney has wielded the kind of power and influence, past holders of the office could only imagine.",
        "From the war in Iraq to the economy to environmental issues, Cheney has played a pivotal role in forming U.S.",
        "policy all the while remaining in the background, a place he prefers.",
        "Last month, The Washington Post ran a four-part series investigating the office of the vice presidency as shaped by Dick Cheney.",
        "One of the authors of that report will join us shortly.",
        "Later, it's our weekly dose of the Political Junkie.",
        "If you have questions about the attorney general's grilling yesterday, Monday's YouTube debates or the rest of the week's news, you can e-mail them now.",
        "The address is talk@npr.org.",
        "But first, the Cheney vice presidency.",
        "If you have questions about the roles of a vice president and the relationship between that office and the Office of the President, give us a call.",
        "Our number here in Washington, 800-989-8255, that's 800-989-TALK.",
        "And our e-mail address is talk@npr.org.",
        "You can also comment on our blog, it's at npr.org/blogofthenation.",
        "Barton Gellman co-wrote the series for The Washington Post.",
        "And he joins us now from our bureau in New York.",
        "Good to have you with us, Barton.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Now, you write it from the very start, Cheney made it clear that he intended to approach the job of vice president very differently from his predecessors.",
        "And - he had to have the cooperation of the president in order to do that, didn't he?",
        "I think he had not only the cooperation, he had an understanding with - the permission of the president to do what he did.",
        "He worked out terms of the job early on with President Bush or president-elect Bush in which he would be free to intercede, as he saw fit, around the federal government, that he would be welcome at every meeting the president was at, and that he would be welcome at any meeting the president wasn't at that he thought important.",
        "And so, he was given a very broad brief, not to execute policy, but to see what was going on and to advise the president.",
        "The way you put it is that he was at every table and every meeting.",
        "And, of course, that's unusual for a vice president.",
        "But what effect did that have that he was so present?",
        "Well, even if he doesn't say much and even if he's not issuing commands, people have a tendency to want to please the number two constitutional officer.",
        "He is, as one person said who went to a lot of Cabinet-level meetings that Cheney attended and Bush did not, that Cheney is the only person who - when he walked in the room, everybody else stood up."

        "And that indicates that they were ready to pay attention to what he had to say, or would they be watching all of his, sort of, body movements to get an idea of what he was thinking because he is very circumspect?",
        "He's very circumspect and - the sort of blankness of his face invites people to fill in what they think he wants and so you have sometimes with almost comic effect to people anticipating what they think he's trying to get at and then doing it.",
        "But the bottom line is there is an intimidating quality to his silence that has been observed over the years.",
        "Stephen Hadley, who's now national security adviser, used to work for him as an assistant secretary of defense back in the first Bush administration.",
        "And he told a friend coming out one day of a meeting with Cheney, he didn't know why exactly because Cheney hadn't said anything bad to him, but he always just felt intimidated when he was in there with Cheney.",
        "And I think that remains the case with many people today.",
        "Well, you say that his influence is widely presumed but hard to illustrate.",
        "Why is that?",
        "How did he work?",
        "Well, he, as you mentioned earlier on, he likes to work out of the spotlight.",
        "That's obvious about Dick Cheney right now.",
        "He often works through cutouts, meaning that he finds allies or makes allies around the government, and they do the job for him.",
        "For example, something that wasn't done until we wrote about it in our series was Cheney's role in the 2003 tax cuts.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "President Bush had decided he was going to seek an abolition of the tax on dividends and various other tax cuts, but he did not accept Cheney's advice that he seek a deep cut in the tax on capital gains.",
        "Cheney then went to a meeting of Republican leaders in Congress and pitched the idea that they should add a cut in the tax on capital gains, the one that Bush had rejected.",
        "When they put it into the bill it wasn't cast as being Cheney's initiative.",
        "It was cast as being Representative Thomas'.",
        "But, in fact, Cheney had urged him to put it in there, and Cheney was the one who then took it back to the president and said, well, Congress has done this, boss, I think you ought to sign it.",
        "And this was something you found time and time again that he had influenced certain legislation, he had influenced many decisions that it was hard to really trace it back to him.",
        "But he hadn't left a handprint on it.",
        "Although, if you talk to enough people, you realized the degree to which he had influenced those actions.",
        "Right.",
        "It does seem like almost every time you look really hard at a big subject, you're going to find some tracks from Cheney there that had been hidden until now.",
        "That's not actually true, because there are whole big areas of public policy he doesn't care that much about, or that you know the president has strong views that he doesn't necessarily share.",
        "But on the big ones that he cares about, and those are financial security issues, economic issues, environmental issues.",
        "And this is crucial for government personnel, major appointments."

        "That's right.",
        "This is something he thought about most of his adult life, certainly since the fourth administration when he was the youngest ever White House chief of staff.",
        "He believed, as a general principle, that Congress have encroached too much on the authorities of the commander in chief when it came to matters of war and peace.",
        "And he interprets those pretty broadly.",
        "He held those views consistently over the years whether Democrats or Republicans were in the White House.",
        "On 9/11, he saw both an occasion and an opportunity to revisit these questions, and he became the author or sort of the father of - and really edge-of-the-envelope interpretation of executive authority.",
        "And what's fascinating about that day is that, at a time when he's just been dragged down to an underground bunker in the White House and has just watched the south tower of the World Trade Center collapse, and almost everyone else was focused on either the consequences, the casualties, the immediate emergency response, whether the ground aircraft - he's doing some of that, but he's already, that morning, looking ahead to what new powers, what new legal interpretations, and what new executive orders will be required to expand the president's power in order to fight this war.",
        "And his general counsel was heading home on foot, as I recall, already trying to get back to his family and he was called back to start - to begin advising the vice president on these matters.",
        "And that - and he became very crucial in all these as well.",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "David Addington had his office, as almost all the vice president staffers do, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, just next door to the White House.",
        "There's a little alley that separates them.",
        "On 9/11, they evacuated the Eisenhower Building.",
        "Addington, being a good staffer, tried to get into the West Wing of the White House to join his boss, and was turned away by Secret Service and told everyone has evacuated, go home."

        "So he started walking, and he was approaching the 14th Street Bridge that would have crossed over to Virginia when his cell phone, which hadn't been working until then, suddenly rings, and it's a White House person saying turn around, the vice president needs you, come on back.",
        "And this time, he is let in and there's a little passageway between the West Wing and the East Wing, and an unmarked door that leads down into what's known as a PEOC, Presidential Emergency Operations Center.",
        "It's a deep bunker built originally by FDR under the White House.",
        "And he goes down and joins his boss there and they're having a question by lunchtime, they're having a conversation how are we going to extend the president's powers?",
        "Yeah, by lunchtime on 9/11.",
        "That's pretty amazing.",
        "That led to what?",
        "Let's talk to what did that lead to immediately?",
        "What was the first result of those early, early discussions between Vice President Cheney and his general counsel?",
        "Well, there were several that we now know of and I frankly can't whether they aren't more that we don't know yet.",
        "Mm hmm.",
