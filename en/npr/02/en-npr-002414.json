        "Right now, we're talking with Barton Gellman, a reporter with the Washington Post.",
        "He wrote the four-part series on the influence and power of Vice President Dick Cheney.",
        "If you have questions about the role of the vice president and the relationship between that office and the Office of the President, give us a call.",
        "The number's 800-989-TALK, send us an e-mail to talk@npr.org.",
        "And you can also read what other listeners have to say at our blog, npr.org/blogofthenation.",
        "And, Barton, just before the break, we were starting to talk about the influence not only of the president, but of the influence that his general counsel had on some of these early decisions right after 9/11 regarding issues dealing with suspected terrorists and, you know, that led eventually to Guantanamo Bay.",
        "Maybe you can continue with what you were starting to say.",
        "David Addington was well-informed, experienced, acerbic, intimidating, very powerful intellect, quick reader.",
        "Gonzales - Alberto Gonzales then, the White House counsel, was not those things.",
        "And he divert very strongly to Addington, on all these enormous questions that were suddenly put in his lap.",
        "Gonzales had a relationship with the president from back in Texas.",
        "But Addington had this whole arsenal of knowledge, very strong views, and dominated the decision-making over what would be the government's legal steps in the war on terror.",
        "Now, one thing that I was struck by in your series, and it may be that you were focusing so much on the vice president that, this - I had this impression, but I didn't get the sense of what the president's input was into all of this.",
        "It almost felt like it was all being done by a small group of people and then, I wasn't sure what the president's role was.",
        "Did you get a sense of that?",
        "It depends on the subject we're talking about.",
        "On the executive authority, legal powers thing we're talking about now, George W.",
        "Bush clearly agreed with and sympathized with the views that Cheney brought to him, and clearly, he's a guy who likes the idea of a strong executive.",
        "But he had not spent decades thinking about it.",
        "He did not have a clear grasp of the interaction between the coordinate branches of the federal government on these issues.",
        "He did not know the history of the executive orders or the National Security Act in 1947 and so on.",
        "Cheney had all those things and sort of changed staff.",
        "And so, Cheney brought him a well-developed set of views that Bush liked and approved.",
        "All right, we're talking with Barton Gellman about the series he wrote for The Washington Post on Vice President Dick Cheney.",
        "If you'd like to join the discussion, the number is 989-8255.",
        "We're going to take a call now from David(ph) and David's calling from Chicago.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi, David.",
        "Hi.",
        "I was wondering if you could address a thought I've had for a while.",
        "Is it possible that President Bush has never really been president, you know, but as rather been kind of a figurehead or a front man, as it were, while the vice president's actually been the person who's been creating policy all along?",
        "You know, there are times when I listen to President Bush at his press conferences and things, and he never really sounds to me like the person who's actually come up with those ideas, you know.",
        "He sounds like he's just repeating them somehow.",
        "I'm sort of wondering if you could address that.",
        "Thanks.",
        "All right, thanks for your call.",
        "Thanks, David.",
        "That is a question that has come up very often and, really, from before of the time that Bush took office when he chose Cheney as running mate.",
        "You had people advancing this figurehead theory.",
        "And I would respectfully disagree with it.",
        "Bush is very much his own man.",
        "He is the decider as he says he is, on the things he wants to do.",
        "He's a guy who looks at the big picture and he leaves the implementation to others.",
        "Cheney is a guy who understands that God is in the details, and implementation brings with it an enormous number of important operational choices where many of the hard questions are resolved, and in some ways that's equally important for policy-making."

        "You don't tend to hear about it, because Cheney shuts up.",
        "But where Bush cares enough to make a decision and to say yes or no, he's the boss.",
        "But I had the impression also that people around Cheney would say, well, he doesn't win all of these fights, you know.",
        "You have to understand he doesn't win all these fights almost to deflect some of the criticism of the ones that he has - had so much importance on.",
        "Well, there's some of that.",
        "Cheney is determined and his staff is determined along with him, not to upstage the president and not to seem to be a power behind the throne.",
        "He does that out of loyalty to Bush and because that's genuinely the way he sees his role.",
        "He's seeing himself as carrying out the president's agenda.",
        "He does it in some ways that the president doesn't care to bother with, because he does at a level - he commands a level of detail and he understands the highways and byways of the government bureaucracy in ways that Bush doesn't care to.",
        "Right.",
        "But he does genuinely lose.",
        "For - on affirmative action, he wanted Bush to take a position in the Michigan case a few years ago.",
        "That would have asked the Supreme Court to abolish affirmative action.",

        "Cheney is not a big fan of the No Child Left Behind Act.",
        "He was not a big fan of the Medicare Drug Entitlement that Bush created, and there are other areas like this where Bush comes caring about something, and especially if it's something early on in the administration that reflected an issue that came up for him as governor, like education, like medical care.",
        "He was the decider.",
        "Cheney has brought him a whole set of other issues and when he has the president's backing, he pushes it through in a way that no one else in government can do.",

        "How are you?",
        "Good.",
        "Mr. Gellman, I was trying to get an idea how the job of vice president evolve from the time of John Nance Garner, who says, if I'm not mistaken, that the vice president's position is no better than a warm bucket of spit, to the power that Cheney wields now in government apparently.",
        "And when the Constitution says that the vice president has very limited job of being a president of the Senate, how does he get all the rest of these positions legally?",
        "That's a fascinating question and, by the way, John Nance Garner is often quoted, as you quoted him.",
        "It's quite the way he said it.",
        "I tried to get permission to put the way he said it in our family newspaper and was not allowed to.",
        "So, I'm going to leave you look it up on the Internet.",
        "And John Adams, the very first vice president felt about the same way about office.",
        "And it's true that the Constitution gives you really two jobs as vice president.",
        "You preside over the Senate, which did not actually entitle you to speak on the Senate floor, but it does let you cast the tie-breaking vote.",
        "And you're an understudy, you're the first in the line of succession.",
        "How you get more power comes entirely, entirely, from delegation by the president."

        "The president has given him explicitly and implicitly operational powers.",
        "The powers to use it and delegate an authority to make certain decisions, sort of to make sure certain things happen.",
        "So, for example, every other recent president, or under every other recent president, you have a federal budget cycle in which the Office Of Management and Budget, you know, has a long process at the end of which it says, you, Mr. Cabinet Secretary, you, Madam Cabinet Secretary, you get this much for your department.",

        "That gives Cheney a lot of power.",
        "There's…",
        "Yeah.",
        "How did the cabinet secretaries feel about the fact that the vice president is judging their budget?",

        "And, of course, accountability goes hand in hand with availability of information.",
        "And between the secrecy that Cheney seems to prefer to operate under and the fact that it's the vice president's office, which doesn't have a lot of those built-in accountability structures, what are - how - what are the checks on Vice President Cheney's power?",
