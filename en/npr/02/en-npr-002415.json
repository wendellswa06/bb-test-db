        "What happened was President Bush--soon after there was a grand jury appointed to investigate this question, President Bush said all White House staffers had to sign these blanket waivers releasing reporters from any obligation to keep confidentiality.",
        "A lot of journalists took that to be sort of coerced.",
        "That is, people could lose their jobs if they didn't sign these waivers, so naturally everybody signed it.",
        "But if sources were to routinely be required to sign blanket waivers, then promises of confidentiality wouldn't mean a lot.",
        "Nonetheless, what Miller's lawyers appear to have done is to go back to the lawyers of Mr. Libby and to say, `Did you mean it when you signed this?",
        "And his lawyers said, `Yes, we did.'"

        "And when will this investigation come to a close?",
        "Well, the grand jury that Patrick Fitzgerald is working with is set to expire on October 28th.",
        "So he had said in court papers that the interview--the deposition involving Miller--was the very last thing he had to go on this case.",
        "One of the reasons it's believed that Miller may have come to this deal was that he had shown every sign of being willing to get a second grand jury impaneled if she had refused to testify, and he could have extended her time in jail for another 18 months for contempt of court.",
        "And so what does this mean for Lewis Libby?",

        "Back in 2006, there were more Hispanics registered as Republicans than any other group - 414,000 then.",
        "So when you look at the growth, most of the growth in Hispanic voter registration since '06 has come from the number registered as no party affiliation or the number registered as Democrats.",
        "And so, Renee, just within a decade we now see in Florida there are more registered Democrats than registered Republicans.",
        "And that's partly because of two big trends.",
        "There is a huge growing population of Puerto Ricans, and they tend to lean more to the left.",
        "And one thing that's interesting is because Puerto Rico is part of the United States, folks who are moving here from the island - they're not immigrants.",
        "They can register to vote as soon as they step foot on the U.S.",
        "mainland.",
        "The other big trend involves Cuban-Americans, which had been a very reliably Republican group.",
        "But the new Cuban immigrants, as well as younger Cuban-Americans who are second or third generation, seem to lean more towards the Democratic Party, and so all of this potentially sounds like it's a bad sign for Donald Trump.",
        "And that's partly because currently Trump is polling worse with Hispanics than how Mitt Romney, the GOP nominee, did in 2012.",
        "And so we'll have to see whether or not Latinos could be a potential Clinton firewall.",
        "I hear what you're saying there, but then you look at the polls, and they show Florida in general as a tight contest.",
        "So you would think with the power of the Hispanic vote wouldn't Clinton have a much bigger advantage?",
        "Renee, that's what you might think, right?",
        "But what we're seeing in Florida is a state that you could say is kind of simultaneously browning and graying at the same time.",
        "Florida's been this huge center for retirees for decades.",
        "And an older white population is helping offset some of the Democratic gains among a younger, browner population.",
        "To understand this better, I actually looked at census migration data for the last five years.",
        "And Florida's at the top of the list.",
        "So more people have moved to Florida in the last five years than any other state.",
        "And what's fascinating is about half of those new Floridians come from other states in the U.S., but about the other half come from other countries.",
        "And the 65 plus age group makes up about 17 percent of Florida's population.",
        "It's a demographic that's more likely to turn out to vote and more likely to vote Republican.",
        "So this is fascinating - two distinct demographic trends going on in Florida at the same time, slightly in opposite directions.",
        "Where are you seeing this play out?",
        "There's two counties that kind of illustrate this well.",
        "Take Sumter County.",
        "It's home to The Villages, one of the biggest retirement communities in the country.",
        "The average age is 66.6 years old.",

        "But drive a couple of hours away to Osceola County - there you've had a booming Puerto Rican population - and you've seen the number of registered Democrats go up.",
        "And so, Renee, which of these trends wins out depends on turnout, and that's what we'll be watching for on Election Day.",
        "Asma, thanks very much.",
