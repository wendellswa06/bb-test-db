        "You're talking April and May of 2010, that it was too late to do the collection for the '08 data, which would have been collected in the '09 school year.",
        "So we took the opportunity to transform the collection, pushed it back just one year, ensured we had the proper resources and support to school districts to get it done and released the data just last week.",
        "So, I mean, the question that all of this leaves hanging out there in terms of the discipline issue - especially when we say discipline - we're talking about suspensions and expulsions, which can have cataclysmic consequences on the kids to which this happens, is: why is it happening?",
        "And, you know, there are a lot of ways to think about why it's possibly happening.",
        "And one of them would be, you know, if we put this just simply in terms of boys, if it turns out that boys are expelled more than girls, it's easy to jump to the conclusion that boys are behaving in more expellable ways than girls.",
        "I don't know what the data is on that.",
        "I'm only using that as a sort of cultural reference point, that most of us would think that probably that's true.",
        "In terms of African-American students and more so boys than girls, having these really disproportionately high rates of expulsion, is there a perception either that they're misbehaving at a higher rate, or is a different thing, that they're misbehaving at the same rate as everybody else but that they're being punished at a different rate, that there's a double standard in operation?",
        "Unfortunately in too many circumstances, we have seen the double standard.",
        "We've seen instances across the country where students with the very same histories of conduct, who can - who for the very same offense received differing punishment, oftentimes with African-American students receiving a much harsher punishment.",
        "But that is not the only answer.",
        "These data, as you mention, portend a very disturbing picture.",
        "The reason for them vary.",
        "These data, though, raise a lot more questions than they answer, and step one is getting to the root cause of why these patterns exist.",
        "You mentioned, John, on boys versus girls.",
        "Yes, we're seeing in the sample, for example, that although boys and girls represent about half each of the sample size, boys - 74 percent of the expulsions are given to boys.",
        "It could be the perceived or very real behavioral struggles that happen too often in our schools, but when we unpack those data further and, for example, look at the rate of suspensions for those students suspended out of school, when we look at the rate for black boys and the rate for black girls, we realize that African-American students are suspended at significantly higher rates than their peers."
