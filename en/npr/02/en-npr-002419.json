        "I want to bring in Carla(ph) from Eckhart, Indiana.",
        "Hi, Carla, you're on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Yeah, I'm also a special ed teacher, and I see a ton more boys, but I also see a ton more minorities labeled and kicked out of classrooms and things like that.",
        "And I think a huge part is that teachers aren't culturally aware.",
        "They, like, you know, they expect kids to do what is culturally white things, but they don't make exceptions.",
        "For example, like, we want kids to look you in the eye, but in the Hispanic culture, looking an adult in the eye when you're getting in trouble is disrespectful, and yet we push that.",
        "And I get the same kind of things.",
        "Like, we need to learn about all cultures and have that training so that it's not just my way or my culture's way, and then we might not have, oh, well, let's kick him out of school, or let's suspend them for this, when maybe that's a part of their culture, and they're acting what would be normally OK.",
        "So it sounds, Russlynn, as though Carla is saying some of this has to do with teachers, what the teachers know.",
        "Well, sometimes these decisions are made in very - when they're trying to control a classroom, and as you've heard both Carla and Michelle say, they need supports on how to do this better and ensure they are catching their students before they slip, and they work on alternatives to expulsion or out-of-school suspension or school-related arrests.",
        "I mean, what we are seeing in these data across the board is that the school-to-prison pipeline is very real throughout our country.",
        "What we need to ensure is that we have a cradle-to-career pipeline with the right supports, with the right interventions, with the right tools.",
        "We know that there are schools and districts and classrooms everywhere defying these trends.",
        "One of the most exciting parts of the opportunity gap tool that we released last week is the ability to find just that, those seeing-is-believing schools, those places that are showing us ways that it can be done better.",
        "And when we come back from the break, we're going to be talking a little bit more about some of those tools.",
        "But I want to thank Russlynn Ali for joining us.",
        "She is assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S.",
        "Department of Education.",

        "You taught at middle school in New York.",
        "And we'd like to get a little bit of your take on what you observed from your days in the classroom.",
        "Were you - for example as a young teacher, were you - did you have discipline figured out?",
        "Is it an easy call to know what to do when a kid misbehaves?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "And I really appreciate the comments that Michelle and Carla offered earlier.",
        "As much training as you seek out and as much guidance as you seek out as a young teacher, the thing that you lack most, perhaps, is classroom management skills.",
        "And I was fortunate enough to be at a school where, at the beginning of the year, some master teachers sat me down and said: Unless you call each of your students' parents tonight, this week, and establish a rapport, begin the relationship and really harness those relationships to improve your classroom, you're not going to get them to behave for you, Mr. Cregor.",
        "So what are the consequences of these suspensions and these expulsions?",
        "And does suspension tend to lead to expulsion?",
        "And does expulsion tend to lead to separation completely from the school system?"

        "The research is unfortunately damning.",
        "Looking at work from the Council of State Governments, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, out-of-school youth are far more likely than their peers to drop out of school, to be retained a grade, to become involved in the juvenile and criminal systems.",
        "We know that when a student is arrested in school, they are twice as likely to drop out as their peers.",
        "Their first court appearance makes them four times as likely to drop out.",
        "There is an incredible correlation between how we're disciplining our students and what's happening to their futures, their educational futures.",
        "So what is your thinking on what's behind this?",
        "And I've read some of what you've written about it over the years.",
        "You've been looking at this for a long time.",
        "And one thing you focus on is kind of the sense that schools have an incentive for their own bureaucratic survival, to unload kids who are causing trouble because those kids will take with them potentially their low test scores, and the school that's left behind without them will score higher.",
        "Is there evidence that that's actually happening?",
        "I think as we've looked at the discipline trends since, for example, the enactment of No Child Left Behind, we've seen a pretty significant spike in both our out-of-school suspension and our expulsion rates.",
        "When we see that happen, and when we hear about studies of teaching to the bubble kids, the kids that are on the verge of scoring better on their test scores than their peers, we get a sense that some students will matter more to a school and matter more to a school's scores.",
        "Consequently, some students will matter less, and when that happens, there becomes a perverse incentive to push students out in order to, in quotation marks, achieve.",
        "But part of this also...",
        "Just so I understand, so they get a downgrade, basically, in their status.",
        "They get a - if we lose this kid, and if there's a way, in fact, to lose this kid, we may score better, we may get to keep our jobs.",
        "In the name of leaving no child behind, I'm afraid we've doubled the discipline rates that we had in the 1970s.",
        "But this doesn't happen simply because of No Child Left Behind or these broader macro reforms that we've seen.",
        "Another wave of this that we have to bring into the equation, into the discussion, is the reliance on zero-tolerance discipline.",
        "As a former teacher and as a parent, there is perhaps nothing more important to establish in a school building first than safety.",
        "We need that so that students feel that they can come in and learn, and teachers can come in and teach.",
        "Sadly, what we're doing in the name of safely, which is relying on out-of-school suspensions, expulsions and arrests to handle routine matters of discipline is not only proven to harm students' academic outcomes, but it's not even proven to make our schools safer.",

        "Hello there.",
        "I just wanted to kind of bring up a point that I teach in Michigan, and we have, in 2010 I believe, I read the statistics that Michigan is the most segregated state in the United States.",
        "I teach in a urban setting, one of the top three largest school districts in Michigan, and what I see is that routinely, children are suspended out of school, they don't come back, and then because they're considered dropouts, we get less money and less resources to be able to pull these students back in.",
        "Our numbers are cut, our funding is cut, and so in this big urban school district, the more students that drop out, the less money we make.",
        "The less money we make, the more difficult it is to retain these students.",
        "So it's a cycle.",
        "It is very much a cycle, and I also, I work in a detention center for a good portion of my day, and what I see is that students from the outlying urban or suburban districts, around the urban center, their students stay in detention for less time.",
        "Their students don't stay as long.",
        "The ones that come from the city proper, it's really, there's a disparity there.",
        "So Mike, what do you think that disparity is about?",
        "What's driving it?",
        "I'm not exactly sure.",
        "That's a great question, and I think that part of it boils down to funding, part of it boils down to culture, and part of boils down to the economy.",
        "And also, Craig was saying that the policy of zero tolerance is essentially giving school districts no choice.",
        "Are you in that sort of situation, where if there's a certain level of behavior reached, the kid is out, and that's the end of the story?",
        "You know, not so much.",
        "I mean, we harp zero tolerance, we pound zero tolerance, but I mean, we had students in Michigan get, you know, elementary school students get suspended out of school for bringing nail clippers to school, things that are just insane.",
        "And so we need to temper these kind of policies with a real-world - I mean, we live in, you know, the millennium.",
        "We live in the 2,000-and-whatevers.",
        "And we need to realize that all our students don't fit in this nice, neat little no-tolerance package.",

        "OK.",
        "...so if I did, if I did I apologize.",
        "You were talking about the need to keep schools safe, and yet the problem of the zero-tolerance policy really - I think you're saying it's kind of gone to extremes.",
        "But the zero-tolerance policy did come out, I believe, out of the 1990s after Columbine and such episodes as that, that any threat from a kid, any threat from a kid needs to be taken exceedingly seriously because in episodes where it wasn't taken seriously, when it was seen as boys will boys, or it was just talk, led to disastrous consequences.",
        "So what's the solution to what looks like a dilemma?",
        "On the one hand, there is pressure and concern and bad experience in not taking aggressive behavior, or language or threats seriously, and on the other hand what you point out is it can go so far that something that would have - ultimately would not have had disastrous consequences is nevertheless resulting in kicking a kid out of school for saying the wrong thing at the wrong time?",
        "This is an excellent question, and zero tolerance, sadly, right, the reliance on suspension, expulsion or arrest to handle these matters is not a response, is not a response to student discipline.",
        "It's - you know, research shows that if anything, out-of-school time is a reinforcer, not an inhibitor, of school misbehavior.",
        "And when we rely on these practices to address trivial matters of school discipline, routine things that when I was a teacher we were told to call home about, we create the wrong expectation.",
        "And in sending kids out of school for more time, relying on the criminal justice system to handle trivial acts of misbehavior, we do more to further alienate our students.",
        "And if we are concerned, as we all should be, about the threat of school shootings and the danger and violence that can ensure, what we need to do is think about the remedies that are proactive, preventative, positive and can save our schools from that situation.",
        "In Clayton County, Georgia, prior to implementing a best practice, a model school code for how schools relate to what's arrestable versus what is a disciplinary offense, you had juvenile probation officers and school resource officers ferrying students in and out of the building for wearing sagging pants or having a hat on backwards or what have you.",
        "This is not what we intended when we wanted to make our schools safer and protect our students and our teachers from shootings and violence.",
        "Let me share with you an email that we've just received from Nancy(ph) - excuse me - who is - describes herself as an urban high school teacher: As an urban high school teacher for 20-plus years, I have to protest the assumption that us white teachers are culturally insensitive.",
        "When I kick a student out of class, it's for behaviors like refusing to stop talking during the lesson, using bleepable language, refusing to sit in their assigned seat, et cetera.",
        "Their skin color has nothing to do with it.",
        "Their behaviors are the same ones that will get them fired from their job.",
        "Respect and self-control are not racial or ethnic attributes, nor are motivation and effort.",
        "These are the qualities that make a student successful.",
        "The lack of these qualities are what result in class and school dismissals.",
