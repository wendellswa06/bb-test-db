        "She was - and I may be wrong about this, but my sense is that she's saying not just class, but also school dismissals that - I think she's talking about situations in which this kind of behavior could lead to expulsion.",

        "Do these kinds of behaviors lead to expulsion?",

        "We have way too many stories, including that of Jaisha Scott in Florida who, basically a 5-year-old, who threw the equivalent of a temper tantrum and was arrested.",
        "The only reason we, as a community, found out about it was because the arrest video of Jaisha Scott was used for training protocol for schools.",
        "So that's - and these are the extreme examples.",
        "And I cite them because we need to have this in the back of our minds as we're dealing with these problems.",
        "When it comes to keeping order in our classroom, a master teacher, such as the person who wrote in, probably already has the tactics that a lot of us right now lack, especially as we see a tremendous shift and change in the age of our teaching force.",
        "We are watching, too often, teachers come to us, saying, you know, we have not been trained in how to de-escalate a situation, how to resolve conflict.",
        "I'm lacking basic classroom management skills in my classroom.",
        "And when we see that and it's coupled with numbers such as 44 percent of highly qualified teachers leaving the profession because of issues related to discipline, we have a problem that is harming not only our students, but our teachers and our schools.",
        "And when we think about the funds that we're putting into the juvenile justice system to educate out-of-school youth, we have a problem for our pocketbooks.",

        "I've worked as a school resource officer in the past for a few years.",
        "And I worked in a school setting where I represented all the feeder schools out of the elementary, middle schools and high schools and in a very diverse community of students.",
        "So I was directly involved in keeping the safety at the school, along with the administrators, and involved in many of these settings where expulsions or suspensions took place from perhaps criminal behavior or, you know, something as incidental as, you know, just misbehavior.",
        "But I wanted to - one of the points I wanted to make from my experience and perspective is that a lot of the times when you have a higher volume of students that were being expelled ultimately, it - there seemed to be a common denominator to me.",
        "And maybe this would be very obvious to many of your listeners, but a common denominator was a family support system that seemed to be lacking in the majority of these students, and we're having these ongoing problems with it.",
        "Of course there are exceptions, but the majority - the volume of these students that were being expelled ultimately for just repeated bad behavior, actual crimes, things like that, within the school, there was always, it seemed to me, the majority of the time, this lack of family support.",
        "And so I think the root of many of these problems is going deeper into the community outside of the school system.",
        "All right, Tony.",
        "Thank you for your call.",

        "He's - because of the bad behavior of some kids.",
        "And the teacher spends well over 50 percent of the time trying to get that kid to cooperate with the lesson.",
        "And what's happening is all the kids are watching, and they're - what lesson are we teaching if we just keep - I don't know what I'm trying to say.",
        "I mean, I went to the very end of it before I kicked the kid out of class.",
        "But it - but when the kid was gone, learning took place for that little quiet kid sitting back there who comes every day.",

        "First, in the Council of State Governments' study on Texas, they looked at schools with practically identical demographics and then compared their discipline rates and found shocking disparities therein.",
        "So in some schools serving the exact same population of students, you had minimal discipline rates.",
        "In other schools, you had wild discipline rates suspension-wise, expulsion-wise, what have you.",
        "This suggests that part of this is about how an administration approaches discipline and what an administration intentionally does to create the type of culture or climate in the building that's going to be conducive to learning for both students and teachers alike.",
        "When it comes to this broader question of what are we going to do to protect the education of that one student in the room, this is where we need as teachers, as parents, as students and as advocates of all stripes to pull together and identify those best practices that are working.",

        "In a lot of ways, yes.",

        "But he is saying to liberals, no, no, no, no. I'm really changing a lot of what Bush did.",
