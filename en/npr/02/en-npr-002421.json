        "I've paid taxes this long, that sort of thing.",
        "And yet, every other approach that has been kicked around here also ran against the accusation that it's just not feasible.",
        "You know, to begin with, the notion that many, many of the illegal immigrants would be sent back to their original country, sort of the House approach, the criticism there was, you know, that's really just not possible in this day and age.",
        "Nevertheless, there are people in the Senate talking as if they can get this done by the time their scheduled to leave town.",
        "Yes.",

        "The air was hot and heavy over the U.S.",
        "capital as the week ended, but it wasn't due to early summer heat and humidity; it was from the considerable friction over a number of political issues, among them immigration reforms, spending measures and the war in Iraq.",
        "There was also a flare-up between Congress and the Justice Department over Constitutional issues when files were seized in a raid of a House member's offices.",
        "That dispute nearly led to the resignations of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, FBI Director Robert Mueller, and other senior Justice officials.",

        "Well, first of all, the report that the Attorney General, the FBI Director, others at the Justice Department were prepared to quit, I mean this is pretty serious.",
        "Briefly, give us details about the seizure and the aftermath, and first, and how did it get to this level of bitterness?",
        "Well, Liane, this of course comes from the case of Congressman William Jefferson of Louisiana, who, shall we say, accepted $100,000 fee as part of a Nigerian business deal.",
        "And remember that $90,000 of that ended up in his freezer.",
        "Well, the FBI is investigating what looks like a garden variety bribery case.",
        "They went to a judge, they got a warrant, but they forgot to tell the White House one thing: they were going to do something that had never been done before in the entire history of the United States Constitution and that is bust into the offices of a member of Congress on Capitol Hill and walk away with two cartons of records and computer disks and all kinds of stuff.",
        "Well, Denny Hastert, the Speaker of the House, the conservative Republican Speaker of the House, went ballistic.",
        "Two reasons: one is, it hasn't been done before, and as the Speaker of the House, Denny Hastert is in charge of guarding the prerogatives of Congress against the executive branch.",
        "Second reason, perhaps as important, perhaps more important: Mr. Jefferson is far from the only member of Congress under investigation."

        "And a large number of those are against Republicans.",

        "My guess is that the administration will find a graceful way to climb down a bit, and they will subpoena the records, which is what the FBI and the Justice Department have done for decades and decades when chasing bad members of Congress.",
        "Interesting bipartisan cooperation to see House Speaker Dennis Hastert and minority leader Nancy Pelosi joining forces.",
        "Is this kind of cooperation going to continue?",
        "Oh, it would be nice to think so, but you know, it really was ironic that after so many years of really bitter fighting between the two parties, the one thing they could agree on was that the FBI shouldn't be raiding their offices.",
