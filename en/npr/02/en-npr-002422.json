        "Until this day, I mean, if you know any emcee that writes, they have a special way that they do it and they've been doing it that way for years.",
        "They put their hyphens in certain places and things of that nature and I still write the way that he taught me.",

        "Right.",

        "But it's also a little bit sad to me to think about women with this level of talent, who are not at the center of a genre that is desperately in need of talented emcees for goodness sake.",
        "I mean, it's not that I think rapping about sexuality is a problem, it's about the kind of sexuality and the oppressive limited way that women's expression is being contained.",
        "So that young women, who are the next generation of Monie Love and MC Lyte, are not likely to imagine themselves as people who can participate in these much more meaningful and serious ways as artists and as community members, because they think their avenues of participation are related to what's profitable.",
        "And once they believe that that's the track for them, then they pretty much have to figure out how to sell themselves physically.",
        "They're not interested in advancing their art because it doesn't really get them anywhere.",
        "And the women who don't fit this model, either for a variety of reasons, they don't see themselves in the culture as well.",
        "And this is a tragedy both for the communities, for young people who need creative ways to deal with their life, but also for women in general and for black women in particular who have distinctive stories to tell.",
