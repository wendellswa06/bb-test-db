        "It was street talk, and Bush was better known for being preppy and Ivy League.",
        "But it was effective partly for just that reason and also because it echoed another street phrase that had been used by President Reagan a few years earlier, quoting a line from a Clint Eastwood movie about a police detective named \"\"Dirty Harry.\"\" Reagan said if the Democrats tried to raise taxes, he would be more than glad to veto that.",

        "And people questioned - even with all his athleticism and his war heroes record, they questioned whether he was tough enough to be president.",
        "So this line - read my lips, no new taxes - this was an effort to hit back at that cover - the wimp factor, the image that he was battling.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think it's important to listen to the way he built up to those six words and the way the crowd is with him.",

        "Clinton liked to say that it was really a question of whether or not President Bush was trustworthy if he could make a pledge like that and then break it.",
        "But Clinton followed much the same sort of policy when he became president.",
        "And he did have a balanced package of spending cuts and tax increases in his first term.",
        "And that actually, in combination with Bush had done in his deal in 1990, captured a great deal of revenue when the economy boomed in that section of the decade and actually brought the federal budget deficit to the brink of balance by the end of the 1990s.",
        "Wow.",

        "Well, Audie, things are pretty deadlocked right now.",
        "You have this very strange situation up here where Democrats are arguing for extending a tax cut - something they haven't been doing for the past decade or so - and Republicans, who've been big defenders of tax cuts, are afraid that they'll be accused of raising taxes.",
        "And so, in the Senate they have spent the past two weeks arguing over competing proposals that both extend the tax rate but there are significant differences.",
        "The Democrats would like to increase the tax rate by 50 percent for employees; Republicans want to keep it at the same level.",
        "But Democrats say they would want to pay for this by taxing millionaires - about 2 percent on their income - Republicans say that would be terrible.",
        "That would hurt job creation.",
        "And so, in the end both proposals have been voted down now twice in the Senate.",
        "Things are not moving very much from where they were even a week ago in the Senate."

        "And, of course, Republicans don't want that.",

        "So, Speaker John Boehner has had to find some other ways to get them onboard.",
        "And the way that he's doing it is he's finding things that President Obama doesn't want, and the main thing is an oil pipeline from Canada to Texas that's been proposed.",
        "It's called the Keystone Excel pipeline.",
        "President Obama at the White House said he would reject any proposal that included this pipeline, and Speaker John Boehner the next day came out with this proposal explicitly including the pipeline.",
        "So, you've got this scenario of the House voting on Tuesday and probably approving an extension of the payroll tax cut but it will have the baggage of this pipeline on it also and they'll be sending it over to the Senate and daring Senate Democrats to vote against it and be accused of having stopped the payroll tax cut extension.",
        "So, you see, the politics of this is pretty complex and in the end there's going to have to be some other deal probably to get that payroll tax cut extended.",
        "So, David, we've also got the emergency unemployment insurance benefits that are set to expire at the end of the month as well.",
        "So, what's the prospect of Congress dealing with that?",
        "Well, you know, this is something that Congress has never failed to do, to extend those benefits.",
        "The one big difference now is that Republicans are demanding that there be some kind of an offset to pay for them.",
        "But if those benefits run out, millions of people who've lost their jobs could see their sole source of income end in January.",
        "And this could have an effect on the larger economy.",
        "So, I think there's a will in Congress to extend those benefits.",

        "On Friday, temporary spending bill will run out and if Congress does nothing, we will have a government shutdown.",
        "This time, I don't think that we are going to have a shutdown because it looks like there is going to be an agreement for something that will keep the government going at least into next year and possibly for the entire fiscal year.",
