        "As we discussed, the Justice Department is already under attack, it's very controversial as you know, for hiring attorneys who've represented detainees, which is of course the basic fight.",
        "Well, what's interesting about that controversy, about hiring attorneys who worked for detainees, is that when that came up in this ad that was created by conservatives Liz Cheney and Bill Crystal, you saw a lot of very high-profile, very conservative people immediately come to the defense of the Justice Department lawyers who represented detainees, saying that the ad was inappropriate, that it undermined the justice system, that it was shoddy.",
        "And there was an immediate blowback from conservatives to that conservative ad attacking Justice Department lawyers.",
        "How might this come to a head?",
        "Well, March 23rd, Attorney General Holder is scheduled to testify before Congress.",
