        "And so I think civilization is really threatened primarily by the religious fragmentation of the human community, by religious impediments to clear thinking and just by a willingness on the part of millions to sacrifice the real possibility of happiness in this world for what I consider to be a fantasy of a world to come.",
        "And so this - and yet it is taboo to criticize these competing certainties, and that's the dysfunction that I'm really talking about in both my books.",
        "Well, you - and just as a point of clarification for those who haven't had the opportunity to read it, it's called Letter to a Christian Nation and you specifically talk about Christian theology at great length and with a depth that I frankly say indicates that you certainly have studied the topic.",
        "You are very familiar with the scriptures and so forth, but you are addressing all religions.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You're not singling out Christianity per se.",
        "You really believe that religion itself is a negative force...",
        "And...",
        "...for the advancement of society, I would say.",
        "Yeah, and at a more general level than that I'm talking about dogmatism.",
        "I'm talking about high levels of certainty uncoupled to the world of evidence and argument and rationality.",
        "And it's just that religion has more than its fair share of dogma, but if - you can find dogma elsewhere and we criticize it elsewhere.",
        "When people claim to be certain about things they're clearly not certain about whether it's astrology is an exact science or Elvis is still alive or their neighbors are being abducted by space aliens.",
        "These are not ideas that have much currency in our culture because they're not coupled to good evidence and good argument.",
        "And yet you can have a president of the United States who talks as though he's in dialogue with the creator of the universe, and this is a double standard that I think we're all paying a terrible price for.",
        "You said you wanted to arm secular Americans, or secularists in general, I would say, with the ammunition to fight against fundamentalist religious thinking.",
        "So I know that you've written an entire book on this topic, but if you could summarize what your key points are I think that would be helpful.",
        "Well, there are a few points.",
        "One is that this idea that atheism is somehow irrational.",
        "I mean you hear this a lot from religious apologists, that atheism is itself a faith.",
        "It's the faith that God does not exist.",
        "The atheist cannot prove that God does not exist, and therefore we're kind of at a standstill."

        "I mean Christians are not lying awake at night worrying about whether to convert to Islam.",

        "The Muslims think that the Koran is the perfect work of the - the perfect word of the creator of the universe.",
        "They - why do they believe that?",
        "Because it says so in the book.",
        "I mean this is a bad argument, and Christians recognize it.",
        "They just don't recognize it with respect to their own book and their own miracles and their own fantasies of a world to come.",
        "And so what I'm arguing is that we all know what it's like to demand evidence and argument from our neighbors, and yet it has been rendered taboo to do this on the subject of religion.",
        "And now what we have quite literally are millions of people who can rationalize the violent deaths of their children by recourse to fairy tales.",
        "And this happens in the Muslim world and it happens here, where we have 44 percent of Americans apparently who think that Jesus is going to come back in the next 50 years and rapture them into the sky so that they can witness a sacred genocide.",
        "I mean this is astonishing that people think this...",

        "But then you see that there are Catholic ministers in countries like Sudan, where in Sub-Saharan Africa three to four million people die from AIDS every year, preaching the sinfulness of condom use in villages where the only information about condom use is coming from the ministry.",
