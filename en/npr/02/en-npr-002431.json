        "Yeah, I just wanted to ask the author - and first I want to compliment him.",
        "I think he's very, very brave and very knowledgeable on this, and I think it's great he's bringing up these topics.",
        "But I wanted to ask how would you define rationality or just rational thinking, because my personal view is just that nothing really seems rational.",
        "I mean what's the basis for the direction one takes or a nation takes when you say we just need to be rational?",
        "Well, it's a good question.",
        "It's actually a deep question when you talk about what rationality is at the level of the brain, because we now know from a variety of functional neuro-imagining experiments that rationality and emotions are not entirely separable.",
        "I mean there are kinds of reasoning that require certain emotional functionality, and without that functionality, without being able to feel the difference between something being right and wrong or true and false, you're unable to reason and you're unable to let your reason really inform your behavior.",
        "So it's actually quite a deep question, scientifically.",
        "But we all know what reason is at the level of common sense.",
        "We all know that when someone makes extravagant claims that that should be based on really extraordinarily compelling evidence.",
        "And when it's not, we immediately discount these claims in every other area of our lives.",
        "And just to take a specific example - because one thing I'm not discounting here is the fact that people have spiritual experiences.",
        "I think spiritual experience is one of the most interesting parts of the human experience, and it may be necessary.",
        "But what I'm arguing is that we can't make extravagant and divisive metaphysical claims on the basis of our spiritual experiences.",
        "If you go into a cave and pray to Jesus for 10 hours a day and feel more love than you've ever felt in your life and come out of that cave an extraordinarily good person, that's great.",
        "But what you have to observe is that there are Buddhist who do that and they never think about Jesus.",
        "There are Hindus who do that who never think about Jesus.",
        "So at the very least it is only rational to conclude that there is a deeper principle here, and the principle is not that Jesus is the son of God and that everyone who dies outside of his dispensation will spend eternity in hell.",
        "I mean that is not the reasonable thing to conclude from the evidence.",
        "And so I'm just arguing that in our spiritual life and in our ethical life we have to make intellectually honest conclusions and engage in intellectually honest dialogue.",

        "Okay, thank you.",

        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "I mean you're critical of fundamentalist Christians, but you're also critical of the so-called liberals or moderates in these other religions as well.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Yeah, well, there's a bit of a paradox here and it's - there's a tension between encouraging moderation, which I think we absolutely need to do, especially in the Muslim world.",
        "We need moderate Muslims and Christians in dialogue, so that is a good thing intrinsically.",
        "And yet the people who profess to be moderates, the people who do not take their books all that literally and in many cases don't even read the books in their entirety, are in some perverse way uniquely unable to appreciate just how seriously their co-religionists take their dogmas.",

        "And James, break it down for us.",
        "What is DRM?",
        "I mean it's the moderate in our culture and the religious liberal, the progressive, who, when he sees the jihadists look into the video camera saying things like we love death more than the infidel loves life and then blows himself up, it's the moderate who's thinking, well, that's not really faith.",
        "That's propaganda.",
        "He did it for other reasons.",
        "He was brainwashed.",
        "And the moderate loses touch with the fact that, to speak specifically of the Muslim world at this moment, there really are people willing to blow themselves up simply because they think they can get to paradise that way, that martyrdom and death in defense of the faith really is, for a subset of the Muslim world, a genuine metaphysical belief.",
        "And, you know, we have people, well-educated, well-off people willing to hit the wall at 400 miles an hour because of an expectation of eternal delights.",
        "And moderates almost systematically obscure that fact, and they talk about Islam really being a religion of peace or Christianity really being a commitment to helping the poor.",
        "And it would be great if that were true, and we have to somehow make it true, but we have to be honest about what is animating the lives of millions of religious extremists."

        "In effect you're criticism of religious progressives or liberals, if you will, is the same as the criticism that conservative Christians have of them, which is that they don't take religion seriously enough.",
        "Yeah, yeah, and the other thing is that they're just on very shaky ground theologically because they're not being honest about where there moderation is coming from.",
        "It's not coming from the books.",
        "It's not like if you read the Bible more and more closely in its entirety you find all these reasons to be a moderate Christian.",
        "You don't.",
        "God never says this is a metaphor, this is not to be taken literally.",
        "And certainly the God of the Koran never says that.",
        "Well, couldn't it be said, though, that God is in effect saying that by the very thing you criticize in the Bible, which is it counter testimonies, that there are contradictions in the Bible.",
        "I mean as you point out very ably in your book that the - many of the - the birth story of Jesus, for example, is not the same - identical in its details.",
        "The testimony about when the crucifixion occurred is not consistent in its details.",
        "Right.",
        "And could it not be said that the reason that all of these books are considered inspired is to offer those counter testimonies to give humility to folks who would interpret them.",
        "Well, that's a very artful move that religious apologists have made over the centuries, is that somehow the flaws of these books are really part of their virtues, and I just think that that would be laughable in any other context.",
        "The problem is the contradictions are not good enough.",
        "If you look at the Bible in its totality, it really does suggest that the creator of the universe hates homosexuals, at the very least homosexual men.",
        "I mean it's not an accident that our Christian conservatives are talking about gay marriage as though it were the greatest moral issue of our time, because they do get that from a plausible reading of the Bible.",
        "Likewise the Bible - a plausible reading of the Bible would support the practice of slavery, not condemn it.",
        "I mean nowhere does God or does Jesus condemn slavery, and yet you can cherry pick the Bible and work up a rationale for abolitionism, which obviously the abolitionists did and that was a good thing.",
        "But the truth of the matter is that the slaveholders of the South were on firmer ground.",
        "And we got rid of slavery not because we looked more closely at the Bible but because we looked more closely at our world.",
        "We looked more closely at the dogmas that were separating white from black and realized that they were indefensible and that it was indefensible to own other human beings and make them work for you.",
        "I want to ask...",
        "And that's part of a larger conversation that we need to have across the board."
