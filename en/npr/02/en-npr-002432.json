        "I do want to ask you more about this, though, in a minute, but after we take this call, about what the world according to Sam Harris should look like.",
        "But let's go to a caller.",
        "Let's go to Toledo, Ohio, and Bob.",
        "Yes, thank you very much for taking my call.",
        "To lay the groundwork, I am a progressive or liberal Christian.",
        "I attend two churches, a fairly liberal church and a fairly conservative evangelical church.",
        "There are a lot of Christians who believe that the Bible is literally true, notwithstanding what to me seems clear evidence that it's not.",
        "When I run across them, I always ask them who came first, the animals or Adam because Genesis gives us two answers to that question.",
        "I think one of the difficulties here, one of the things the speaker - and I'm sorry I didn't catch your name - is the extremes get the attention, the extremists make the noise, the extremists get heard.",
        "But there are a tremendous number of in fact moderate Christians who find our lives informed and enlightened by the Bible without taking every word literally.",
        "And as in many areas of life, the middle rarely gets heard even though it's a significant number of people.",
        "Well, I would agree with you, Bob, except the extremes unfortunately are not that extreme.",
        "Fifty-three percent of Americans think the universe is 6,000 years old and we have no genetic precursors in the natural world apart from Adam and Eve.",
        "I mean this is not extreme.",
        "This is a majority.",
        "I know and I'll tell you.",
        "This is a mystery to me.",
        "I grew up on the East coast.",
        "I'm in my late 50s.",
        "I don't think that I had ever met anyone who did not believe in evolution.",
        "I moved to northwest Ohio about nine years ago and I started running into people who didn't believe in evolution.",
        "And at first I thought to myself well, you're either dumb or you're uneducated.",
        "But after running into people who were clearly not dumb and they were clearly very well educated and yet they still had that, quote, \"belief\" - and it is a complete mystery to me as to how, you know, educated people can still hold that belief.",
        "And Laura Washington in our Chicago bureau.",
        "She's a columnist with the Chicago Sun-Times.",
        "Hey, Laura.",

        "Yeah, well, it's actually not that mysterious when you see how well protected these beliefs are in our discourse.",
        "How - I mean I can tell you - I'm getting a PhD in neuroscience - there is no point in the training to become a scientist where somebody sits you down and says, ok all of these dogmas you're holding onto that are religious need to be talked about and subjected to the same tests of credulity that we're going to subject all of your other scientific beliefs to.",
        "I mean it's just not a conversation that gets had.",
        "It's taboo.",
        "And so you quite literally - in the Muslim world you can be so well educated that you could build a nuclear bomb and still believe you're going to get 72 virgins in paradise.",
        "I mean that's really how partitionable the human mind is.",
        "And in the Christian West, you can get a PhD in Biochemistry and not believe in evolution.",
        "And that's a problem of discourse.",
        "It really is a massive problem of conversations not being had.",
        "Bob, can I just ask you - if you don't mind - what is your thought about the core question of our discussion today?",
        "I mean, Mr. Harris - his name is Sam Harris - is making the argument that religion is such a destructive force, it is so much the antithesis of the kind of rational discourse we need to move society forward that really we need to remove it as a major force in public life.",
        "What is your thought about that?",
        "Ok.",
        "My thought on that is that we should not allow religion to infest public policy, but that our public policy makers should use the core positive values that religion infuses in them to inform the decisions that they make.",
        "Unlike what's her name in Florida - Katherine Harris - not just Christians have good values.",
        "People, you know, atheists have good values.",
        "We all ultimately have experience with good values and those values should inform us in the decisions we make.",
        "But I firmly believe in the so called separation of church and state, that we should not use religion as a part of government.",
        "Yeah, well we definitely agree there.",
        "It's just that I don't think the establishment clause of the constitution is enough.",
        "It just turns out that beliefs are going to find their way into public policy if they're really believed.",
        "And if you really believe that the soul enters the zygote at the moment of conception and, therefore, that three-day-old embryos in a petri dish are fully ensouled and require all the care of little girls with spinal cord injury, you are going to block stem cell research or at the very least not fund it.",
        "And it's just going to find its way into policy.",
        "Ok Bob, I'm sorry we need to take a short break Bob.",
        "Thank you so much for calling.",
        "Ok.",
        "Well, thank you.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Mr.",
        "Harris, the question I was asking while we were talking to Bob, what would public discourse look like in the world as imagined by Sam Harris?",
        "Given as you discussed that so many people hold these beliefs, that these are deeply held beliefs, how would public discourse happen?",
        "I mean, would you suggest that people lie about the source of their beliefs and values?",
        "How would we proceed if people were to take you seriously and to follow your advice, other than to eliminate religion from their lives, which - or is that really the end goal?",
        "Well, I think we have to recognize that this world already exists to a significant degree in Western Europe and in countries like Canada and Australia and Japan, where you cannot be a public figure professing absolute certainty about the divine origin of the Bible and be taken seriously.",
        "I mean, these are embarrassing convictions in much of the world.",
        "And, in fact, we are virtually alone in the developed world as a society that still conducts its national discourse under the shadow of religious literalism.",
        "And we are alone - I mean if you look at - we have an institution like Patrick Henry College.",
        "You know, this college started six years ago, it's only 240 students.",
        "It promotes home-schooled Christian kids into government, essentially.",
        "And it places more interns in the White House now than any other university in the United States, more than Princeton, Harvard, Stanford, Yale.",
        "We've got Patrick Henry University placing White House interns.",
        "Now every student at Patrick Henry University signs a declaration of faith, which reads something like, all who die outside of Christ will be confined in conscious torment for eternity.",
        "I mean this is apparently what you need to have in your brain if you're going to run the U.S.",
        "government.",
        "Ok, but what about the civil rights movement?",
        "I mean, what about the fact that these activists were very much animated by their faith and belief in a new world that could be brought here on Earth, that they - and the abolitionists, as you pointed out, were animated by faith.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Well, I don't think they were.",
        "You know, it's as Bob pointed out, morality is deeper than religious dogmatism.",
        "If you don't already know that cruelty is wrong before you read the Bible, you're not going to discover it by reading the Bible.",
        "And when you read the Bible and you encounter something like the Golden Rule and you recognize it to be a brilliant distillation of your ethical intuitions, you are recognizing it on the authority of your intellectual intuitions, your ethical insights and a larger discourse about ethics.",
        "And when you read in the Bible that you're supposed to kill a girl for adultery, you reject that on the basis of a modern conversation about ethics.",
        "And so this idea that we get our morality out of religious dogma or religious faith, I think is an illusion.",
        "And it's readily seen as illusion if you just ask what would have to be true of the world if it were so."

        "NPR's Jon Hamilton brings us the story.",
        "Faces are so important to humans and other primates that our brains have six different areas that specialize in facial perception.",
        "Doris Tsao and a team at Caltech have spent nearly 15 years trying to solve the mystery of how these brain areas tell us whether we're looking at mom or a stranger.",
        "And the reason why this is such a big mystery is that, as we all know, it seems like there's an infinite number of possible faces.",
        "Tsao thought the brain must be using some sort of code to represent each face it encounters, so her team studied two monkeys as they looked at pictures of human faces.",
        "Tsao says the researchers focused on the electrical activity of just 200 brain cells from 2 of the 6 specialized areas.",
        "And what we discovered was that the cells were coding faces in a very simple way.",
        "Each cell was measuring just one aspect of a face.",
        "The process is a bit like assigning one cell to check the distance between a person's eyes while another looks at skin texture.",
        "And once the team thought they understood the system, they checked to see if they had it right by working backwards.",
        "Tsao says they took the signals coming from a monkey's brain and used a computer to decode them.",
        "With this model, we could actually reconstruct what face the monkey was seeing.",
        "Tsao says she and co-author Steven Le Chang were blown away when they compared the pictures the monkey actually saw to the pictures produced by electrical signals coming from the animal's brain.",
        "They look almost indistinguishable.",
        "In fact, when Steven first showed this figure to me, I asked him, are you sure you didn't make a mistake and just copy column one to column two 'cause they look so similar."
