        "The results, published in the journal Cell, could represent a big leap in our understanding of how the brain identifies faces.",

        "Matt Damon and Chris Pratt look very different to me, but I cannot tell you what it is that makes Matt Damon look like Matt Damon and Chris Pratt look like Chris Pratt.",
        "Connor says the results suggest that's because the process of differentiating faces is so highly developed in the brain, it's invisible to us.",
        "He says the research also offers a rare glimpse of how electrical signals in the brain create our perception of the world.",
        "Neuroscience really gets exciting when it shows you physically what is happening that gives rise to an experience.",
        "And Connor says in this case, there could be some mind-blowing applications.",
