        "No, the margin is so overwhelming that you cannot parse that, but you do have to look at some of that.",
        "But I think both of them, what they had in common is that they failed to maintain a connection with their constituency.",

        "Well, there seems to be indications - that poll I mentioned earlier - just seems to indicate that there's a similar mood in terms of dissatisfaction on both sides of the fence, Democrats and Republicans, to what you saw in 1994.",

        "They're the last to know when they're in trouble.",
        "When the trouble did come, then he said well, look, I'm going to run as an independent.",
        "What a stupid, terrible mistake.",
        "I think he's being punished for not being perceived as a loyal Democrat, not being perceived as somebody who is really plugging for his party.",
        "Iraq is a problem, but that's just part of it.",

        "But other than potentially hurting Connerly - if it even does that - what impact do you think this can really have on the large issue?",
        "Well, my thought is when I heard about and read about the $1 million salary or compensation, compared to my salary, I remember that song -I'm just your average, ordinary, everyday superhero trying to save the world but never really sure.",
        "Look, with a $1 million compensation salary package, I could indeed change the world.",
