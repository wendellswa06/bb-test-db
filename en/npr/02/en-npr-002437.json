        "Well, the Republican majority in the legislature and the Democratic Governor Mark Dayton remain roughly about a billion or $2 billion apart over how much they think the state should spend on government's operations over the next two years.",
        "Governor Dayton wants to raise income taxes on the wealthiest Minnesotans -those earning more than a million dollars a year - to balance the budget, but the Republicans refuse to consider any sort of tax increase.",
        "They passed a budget that deeply cut spending on social services and other programs.",
        "The governor refuses to sign that budget.",
        "So in negotiations yesterday, the governor made two compromise offers, one which would make his income tax increase on millionaires temporary for just two years, and he offered to increase taxes on tobacco.",
        "Here's Republican House Speaker Kurt Zellers' reaction to those offers.",
        "It was very disappointing and a step backwards.",
        "Again, we're back at income taxes.",
        "We now have, as another offer, increase by a dollar a pack on cigarettes.",
        "We've made it very clear that we do not believe we need a tax increase to balance our budget.",
        "And then Democratic Governor Mark Dayton fired right back.",
        "If this was a step backwards, as I was told someone said, then they took the step backward.",
        "I took a step forward to try to resolve this.",
        "I said if we can come to this agreement, I'll call a special session as early as tomorrow night.",
        "And so the standoff in the Minnesota state government shutdown continues.",
        "The shutdown, of course, affects people everywhere in Minnesota.",
        "But state workers are certainly feeling the impact because they're not getting paid.",
        "Tell us more about how they're responding.",
        "Well, many state workers, obviously, are very upset.",
        "Several hundred of them took their anger to the steps of the Minnesota State Capitol under a hot, late-afternoon sun yesterday.",
        "This was a rally organized by the two largest state government employee unions.",
        "They do back the governor's call for higher taxes on the wealthy.",
        "And many of the laid-off state workers that I talked to said they're willing to stay off their jobs a little bit longer if that's what it takes, because what they fear is that the budget cuts imposed by Republicans would lead to some permanent job cuts, or else it would critically hurt the state services that they work hard to provide.",
        "There are some, though, that I talked to that are noticeably anxious that this could go on and on while they have mouths to feed and bills to pay, and they're urgently seeking a compromise soon."

        "Although, David, the state does have to pay the unemployment benefits for thousands of laid-off government employees.",

        "Well, the people who actually would do that calculating for the state, they're considered nonessential workers, so they're not working right now.",
        "So we don't know completely the cost.",
        "But there's some pretty staggering estimates out there already.",
        "Certainly, yeah, no, totally.",
        "Brazil is already challenging the US on one of its main export crops, soybeans.",
        "It's only beginning to export cotton, but US cotton producers are concerned.",
        "David Cruz has two big cotton producers on his board, and Brazil Iowa Farms is looking to expand the 10,000 acres of cotton it currently has under cultivation.",
        "Cruz is sensitive to criticism, though, that he's asking US farmers essentially to invest in their competition.",
        "But he sees it another way; that by investing in Brazil, US farmers are capturing the profit there and bringing it back here.",
        "We're going down and buying out the competition and controlling it in that manner.",
        "And I believe that we're a very aggressive form of competition in world agriculture that way.",
        "Back on his hog farm, Dick Gilmore sees his Brazil investment as just one more way to hedge against risk.",
        "He says farmers routinely buy futures in crop insurance to protect themselves against weather and market fluctuations.",
        "He says it's globalization now that represents uncertainty for farmers.",
        "He argues that investing in Brazil is no different from what his ancestors did when immigrating to Iowa in the 1800s.",
        "We have jet airplanes flying over the frontier now of where my great-grandfather homesteaded here, and we still farm some of that land.",
        "Globalization, it's not really a new idea because my great-great-grandfather was thinking globalization when they moved to the United States.",
        "That same pioneer spirit took Brian Willott to Brazil.",
        "Willott is a former economist who grew up on a Missouri farm.",
        "A few years ago, when he turned 30, he says he decided Brazil represented his chance to get back to farming.",
        "He moved there, spent a year learning the language and last year planted his first crop of cotton and soybeans on 1,700 acres in western Bahia.",
        "Reached on his cell phone in Bahia, Willott said that farming in Brazil is not for everyone.",
        "On one hand, you leave everything that's familiar and all your family and friends and the people you love.",
        "But at the same time, you get to meet new people and new experiences, to break new ground, to be the first one to farm something.",
        "You have to enjoy that kind of experience to be willing to come down here.",
        "While Willott says he hasn't made as much money as expected, he still enjoys farming in Brazil.",
        "He says the most difficult challenge has been adapting to a new culture.",
        "Americans who go to Brazil for farming also find they have to learn to cope with a new language, an unfamiliar financial system and a different pace of conducting business.",
        "Willott says one thing is certain: You will learn patience.",
