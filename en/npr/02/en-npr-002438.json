        "Nearly half a million current owners will have to decide whether to fix or sell back.",
        "VW has promised to buy back or fix 85 percent of the 2-liter diesel engine cars.",
        "It will also have to decide what to do with the cars it repurchases because VW hasn't announced what the fix might be.",
        "It's impossible to know what it might cost.",
        "Giles says the EPA wants to minimize waste.",
        "We encourage the maximum amount of recycling for the vehicles that they repurchase for those that are not fixed.",

        "Alberto Ayala is deputy executive director of the California Air Resources Board which helped find the original cheating mechanism that led to the unmasking of VW.",
        "Ayala says the settlement was designed to be as clear as possible.",
        "Consumers will need to know exactly what the fix is, how it might affect the car's performance, driveability or gas mileage.",
        "But the settlement was designed, he says, so Volkswagen would still have a financial incentive to fix the bulk of the cars so they could still be used.",
        "You know the company was interested in coming up with a technical solution because they see a remaining value in those vehicles.",
        "Ayala says preliminary proposals would cut back the problem cars' emissions by up to 90 percent.",
        "If that's achieved, he says, he doesn't see why they can't avoid the junkyard.",

        "I think it was a very unusual moment for a country like France - a sense of every one, everybody coming together, a sense of unity.",
        "Still a lot of shock at what happened and anger, but there was a lot of dignity.",
        "It was very solemn.",
        "A lot of pain, I think, was physical on faces.",
        "I think it was probably a rare moment in French political life, as well , of just everyone coming together and sharing pain.",
        "Tell us why that sense of unity feels unusual to you.",
        "For many reasons.",
        "First of all, because political life in France is very much polarized.",
        "Not in the same way that it's polarized in the U.S.",
        "- polarized in its own way.",
        "But it's very rare to have a sense of an entire nation coming together behind a symbol, behind a national symbol, behind the flag, behind the national anthem, \"\"La Marseilles.\"\" Unlike in the U.S., these are not easy, common symbols for people to gather behind in this country.",
        "President Francois Hollande called on people to hang French flag, which, as you say, is not as common in France as it is in the U.S.",
        "Can you tell us a little bit more about why France has historically resisted the kind of a flag-waving patriotism that is so much more common in the U.S.?",
        "Oh, I think it's tied to France's history, first as a former colonial power and the way that it is now dealing with this past, and second, undoubtedly, to the Vichy regime, to the years of Nazi occupation during World War II.",
        "Before the attacks in Paris, the French flag was very popular as a symbol of the far-right political parties - more xenophobic, anti-immigrant groups.",
        "If I were to go today to one of the banlieues, the lower-income, mostly immigrant neighborhoods, do you think that sense of flag-waving patriotism would purvey there as well?",
        "No, it wouldn't.",
        "I actually heard stories, reports on French radio this morning that some reporters went out to the banlieue, to the suburbs and were looking around to see if there were flags, and there were none.",
        "What does that tell you about this sense of unity?",
        "That it's not felt by all, that France has what I think is a huge problem of integration, as it calls it, of minorities, some of them even second or third-generation immigrants, and that it's not going to go away just in one day because there's a sense of unity because of what happened.",
        "This is a very deep problem.",
        "It's been getting from bad to worse over the last few decades.",
        "And it will take a complete change, I think, of attitude and different public policies to tackle them.",
        "It's just not going to go away overnight.",

        "Kennedy's vote was so often decisive that, as one justice put it ruefully, there are times the rest of us might as well go home.",

        "For example, his 2010 decision written for a narrow 5 to 4 majority similarly remade the way political campaigns are conducted in the nation.",
        "The decision unleashed an ever-growing flood of cash and reversed a century-old legal understanding that had sought to prevent corruption by barring corporations and later labor unions from spending their general treasury funds on candidate elections.",
