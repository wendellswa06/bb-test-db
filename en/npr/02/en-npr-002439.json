        "The Trump administration has been openly hostile to climate science, pulling out of the Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gases, cutting funding for climate research, scrubbing the term climate change from federal websites.",
        "Well, now NPR science reporter Rebecca Hersher is finding that some scientists are avoiding the word climate, and she's here to tell us more.",
        "Hey there, Becky.",
        "Hey.",
        "So what are you finding?",
        "What's going on here?",
        "Well, scientists are avoiding the term climate change.",
        "Like, they're not using it in research papers or anywhere?",
        "Well, they're not using it in grant proposals and summaries.",
        "So the number of National Science Foundation grants with that phrase, climate change, is down 40 percent this year.",
        "Some people are using alternative terms that aren't so politicized.",
        "Some people may be avoiding the subject altogether.",
        "Like, you're a scientist, you study climate change in groundwater.",
        "Maybe a couple of years ago, you applied for federal money.",
        "You called that grant proposal \"\"Climate Change Effects On Aquifer Stability.\"\" Well, maybe now you call that \"\"Environmental Change And Groundwater Trends.",
        "So why are they doing this?",
        "Are they hoping they have a better chance of getting funding from the Trump administration if they don't use this term?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And in some cases, program managers may actually be encouraging scientists to do this.",
        "So these are the people at the National Science Foundation who interface with scientists.",
        "Those people may be trying to protect climate research the same way scientists are.",
        "So if an original proposal for funding may be still all about climate change, maybe the public summary that goes on the NSF website talks about extreme weather instead.",
        "And actually, not everyone thinks that that's a bad thing.",
        "Here's climate scientist Michael Dietze from Boston University.",
        "Everyone I've talked to at NSF is committed to making sure climate science keeps getting done, but at the same time not turning yourself into a target unnecessarily."
