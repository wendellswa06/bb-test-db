        "We know that stress is a problem for pregnancies.",
        "We know that increased stress can cause premature birth and low birth weight, so that a woman who is experiencing the stress of an uncontrolled depression may be putting her baby and her womb at significant risks.",
        "Bottom line, McCabe says, being on an antidepressant should not keep women from getting pregnant.",
        "They can be on a medication that's safe for their baby and also controls their depression.",
