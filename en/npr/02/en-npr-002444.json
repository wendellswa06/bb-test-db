        "That's Ellison, years later, in an interview for National Educational Television.",
        "He wrote that his protagonist - a Negro, as Ellison always said - was young, powerless and ambitious for the role of leadership, a role at which he was doomed to fail.",
        "Earnest, naive, the Invisible Man travels from his Southern hometown to Harlem and runs a gauntlet of discrimination by whites, betrayal by blacks, and confusion about who he is and who he must please.",

        "Look at this book.",
        "It's crazy, you know.",
        "It was regarded at the time as an experimental novel and it's not a piece that you would look at and say, oh, it's a play.",
        "But the question popped out of my head has anybody ever adapted this novel as a film or a play.",
        "And Ralph Ellison really didn't want that to happen while he was alive.",
        "He'd seen too many good books turn into bad movies.",
        "That's Oren Jacoby, who, along with theatre director Christopher McElroen, got the blessing of the Ellison estate to adapt the novel for the stage.",
        "Their play debuted in Chicago and is now running at the Studio Theatre in Washington, D.C.",
        "Jacoby says he decided to write the play while he was working on a project about Shakespeare.",
        "Ellison seemed to understand that kind of rhetoric.",
        "And that, like a great Shakespearean speech where a character is faced with a decision about what to do, there's constantly an argument: Do I do this or do I do that?",
        "To be or not to be.",
        "Do I go underground, or do I come out and be part of the world?",
        "And I felt that that dynamic made this a very theatrical text, and that it just spoke out to me.",
        "And I thought, well, I'd better go for it.",
        "The play, like the novel, opens in that lonely basement apartment filled with newspapers and magazines, a phonograph.",
        "The Invisible Man has wired his ceiling with light bulb - exactly 1,369 of them, he says.",
        "It's an act of sabotage against the power company but also an affirmation.",
        "The Invisible Man says, light confirms my reality.",
        "And it's interesting because he's married and he's having an affair and it's kind of a downbeat story.",
        "And on surface levels, it's so beautiful.",
        "The - you know, the guy's an architect.",
        "His home is all done in beiges and whites and grays and it's everything about the environments that Minghella has these people wandering in, is really compelling.",
        "But there is a chilliness to the emotions in it, and so it doesn't quite click, but it's a very interesting picture.",
        "Now neither of those films sounds to me like the big holiday feel-good kind of movie that we usually see coming out this time of year."
