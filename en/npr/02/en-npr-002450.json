        "Now, you took your concerns - you know, you wrote memos, let your supervisors know that there were some real legal problems with this evidence and with these cases.",
        "What happened?",
        "Well, there was one specific case where I raised all of these concerns.",
        "The detainee...",
        "Was this Mohamedou Slahi?",
        "This was Mohamedou Ould Slahi.",
        "He was subjected to the enhanced interrogation techniques that I subsequently found out had been approved up to the level of the secretary of defense.",
        "What I found out later of his interrogations, they included sensory deprivation.",
        "It was insinuated that he would be killed.",
        "There was one incident where a mock execution was being carried out.",
        "Knowing the information I did, I had an ethical obligation to provide the information that I knew to any defense attorney that would represent Slahi in the future, so that he could avail himself of the protections of the U.N.",
        "torture convention.",
        "Ultimately, for me, though, from a moral perspective as a Christian, I just felt like what had been done to this man was reprehensible.",

        "Lt.",
        "Col.",
        "Couch abandoned that case in May of 2004.",
        "Mohamedou Slahi still has not had his day in court.",
        "The Miami Herald's Carol Rosenberg feels that the Guantanamo prison represents a significant shift in American values.",
        "Before Sept. 11th, I never imagined that we would be talking about holding people forever who we couldn't charge; for whom there was either insufficient evidence to bring them to trial, or for whom the evidence was so tainted that we couldn't bring them to trial.",
        "So how do we balance justice with security?",
        "Alberto Gonzales was in President Bush's inner circle in the critical days after 9/11.",
        "I asked him if in a rush to extract secrets from the enemy, did we jeopardize our ability to convict these men for their crimes?",
        "I think that President Bush understood that some of the measures that we took in order to gather up information, in order to keep America safe, might make it more difficult to prosecute individuals in the future.",
        "But as far as he was concerned, that was the balance that we were going to strike in order to make sure that not another human life here, in America, would be at jeopardy.",
        "Gonzales served as White House counsel at the time of the 9/11 attacks.",
        "And he succeeded John Ashcroft as U.S.",
        "attorney general, in 2005.",
        "Gonzales still believes - as he did in 2001 - that the prisons in Guantanamo serve an essential purpose, and that there is no immediate need to shut them down.",
        "I fundamentally disagree with President Obama on this.",
        "I think that if you go visit the facility at Guantanamo - and I visited the facility three times, when I was White House counsel - I'd have to say that today, I suspect the facility, quite frankly, is much better in terms of the protections, the amenities given to the detainees there, than what you might find in some state and local facilities here in this country.",
        "When President Obama says that what we're doing there is inconsistent with our values, I don't understand what he's referring to when he says - makes that kind of statement."

        "You said that both President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld very much wanted to see the prison at Guantanamo closed.",
        "If it made sense as an institution and is consistent with our values, why the desire to get rid of it?",
        "Well - of course - because as has been widely reported, there were negative repercussions from Guantanamo.",
        "A lot of publicity - some of it accurate; much of it inaccurate, in terms of conditions and mistreatment at Guantanamo.",
        "We know that it was used as a recruiting tool for al-Qaida.",
        "We always envisioned that it would not be a long-term solution to the issue of detention.",
        "And we hoped that we could find a solution, at some point, so that we could close Guantanamo as quickly as possible.",

        "Col.",
        "Stuart Couch.",

        "Couch?",
        "I'm heterodox on this issue.",
        "I don't think fundraising matters in presidential races.",

        "They've got these big national debates.",
        "Does anybody not know who Barack Obama is?",
        "And so I think fundraising matters a great deal in determining who votes in House elections and local elections, but I think it's a myth that they have a huge affect on national elections.",
        "Obama vastly outraised McCain last time.",
        "Does anybody think McCain would have won if it had been even?",
        "I really don't think so.",

        "What I'd say to Col.",

        "It's totally consistent with our Constitution.",
        "It's totally consistent with our tradition and our practice, when you look back at the history of conflicts that the United States has been in.",
        "And so people still may not like it.",
        "It bothers them that we can detain someone indefinitely, without charges.",
        "They may not like it.",
        "That's one thing.",
        "We can have a debate about that.",
        "But if the question is whether or not what we're doing there is lawful or constitutional, then I don't think that that can be debated, quite frankly.",
        "It is lawful, and I hope this administration is more successful than the Bush administration was, in finding an alternative solution.",
        "And President Bush charged us with trying to find an alternative.",
        "We were not able to do so.",
        "I'm sure President Obama has charged his administration with finding a solution that would be acceptable not only to the Congress, but also to the will of the American people.",
        "Former U.S.",
        "Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.",
        "Even if President Obama succeeds in closing the Guantanamo prison, he's been less clear about addressing the root cause of the current crisis there - the hopelessness of the inmates' indefinite detention.",
        "The Miami Herald's Carol Rosenberg thinks that we'll have the prison in Guantanamo - or the same thing, under a different name - forever.",
        "I can't see how we're going to get out of this.",
        "I know they've been able to reduce it.",
        "I imagine that down the road, they'll find a way to get some more people home.",
        "But I don't see how they're going to be able to, if not empty the cells, then end the kind of detention that we think of as Guantanamo."
