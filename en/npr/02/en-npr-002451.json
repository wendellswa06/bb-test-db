        "Well, let's talk a bit about where both campaigns found themselves this week, very deliberately so.",
        "We had President Obama first in North Carolina, and then Mitt Romney going there; and then President Obama went to Lorain County, Ohio, on Wednesday; Mitt Romney followed him there on Thursday.",
        "Let's listen to a little bit of tape from those speeches.",
        "First, from President Obama in Ohio.",
        "Right now, we have two competing visions of our future, and the choice could not be clearer.",
        "And let me say, those folks on the other side, I am sure they are patriots; I'm sure they're sincere, in terms of what they say.",
        "But their theory, I believe, is wrong.",
        "And then the next day, we heard from Mitt Romney in that same county in Ohio.",
        "You know, the other day, the president - I guess it was just yesterday - he was in Ohio, and he said that this campaign is going to come down to his vision, his vision for America.",
        "If you want to know where his vision leads, open your eyes - because we've been living it for the last three years.",
        "It leads to lost jobs, lost homes, lost dreams.",
        "It's time to end that vision, and have a vision of growth and jobs and economic vitality.",
        "I like that Mitt Romney there is saying, I guess it was just yesterday - as if this weren't all very carefully orchestrated.",
        "David Brooks, when you think about the broad narrative that these campaigns are trying to - or starting to lay out, first, what are you hearing from the Obama campaign?",
        "Well, what they're trying to do is, trying to figure out whether we're going to have a serious campaign or not.",
        "There are these side issues; I think of the Buffett Rule as a side issue, or whatever some surrogate says.",
        "But at the core there, we could have a serious campaign.",
        "They have totally different versions of what just happened to America.",
        "The president says we had years of deregulation - finance got out of control; corporate power got out of control; and they're beginning to put that back into some sort of balance.",
        "Romney has an entirely different vision of what just happened - that we've had decades and decades of the slow agglomeration of power, the confluence of Wall Street and government; and that's had this stagnating, restricting effect on American dynamism.",
        "Those are entirely - two different historical theories.",
        "And they're pretty good at fleshing that out.",
        "What I think both campaigns are really bad at fleshing out is what the story is from here; what the story of - the next four years look like.",
        "Neither campaign has really gone there, in part because it involves some pretty tough choices.",
        "And E.J.",
        "- talked about those tough choices a lot, in terms of reforming Medicare, Social Security; all of the big questions.",
        "Interesting to me that Mitt Romney chose as his backdrop yesterday this gypsum factory in Lorain County that had been shuttered - actually, closed under President Bush.",
        "But his argument was look, this would've reopened by now, but it's still empty - blaming the president for the fact that those jobs had not come back.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, there are a couple of things.",
        "One is, Romney wants the election to be about the fact that things aren't good enough yet.",
        "And Obama wants the election to be about, things were a lot worse when I took over; they are getting better.",
        "And a lot will depend, of course, on what the economic numbers are between now and Election Day - as to which of those narratives is more powerful.",
        "Until recently, Obama, I think, has had the upper hand on that but, you know, slowing job growth would create a problem for him."

        "But there is this big, underlying argument - I think the Republicans, and the Ryan budget, symbolizes this - are for more cutbacks than they've ever been before.",
        "It's a really different view of government.",
        "And Obama, I think, has laid out in a series of rather philosophical speeches, a real defense of balance - that you can't have a successful private sector without a successful and reasonably strong public sector.",
        "That is a big argument for the voters.",
        "On the budget, you are seeing the outlines.",
        "Obama is saying, you cannot balance this budget without some substantial tax increases - and we'll start with the rich.",
        "Romney is saying, we can cut our way there, and I can cut taxes for the rich - and, he claims, other people; but it's mostly for the rich - even more.",
        "I mean, if people like big choices, whether they like the candidates or not, this is a big choice.",
        "I'd be curious if you have any thoughts on the scandals that have been the subject of some attention this week.",
        "First, the General Services Administration getting reamed out by Congress for lavish spending, and then the scandal of the members of the Secret Service in Colombia picking up escorts, getting into a brouhaha down there with some - now, some departures from the Secret Service.",
        "Both of these are part of the executive branch.",
        "Does this reflect in any way, do you think, on President Obama and his administration?",
        "David Brooks.",
        "I personally don't think so, in part because while I'm not a fan of government, I'm sort of a fan of government workers.",
        "I think they're actually - and Republicans will say this, who hold office - these people are actually, surprisingly effective.",
        "And they're in it for the right reasons.",
        "And I happen to think the Secret Service is a phenomenally good agency.",
        "They had this scandal.",
        "The GSA has this scandal.",
        "I generally don't think too many federal workers, frankly, are living high on the hog.",
        "And I don't think it's a Barack Obama problem because he, himself, is not the living-high-on-the-hog kind of guy.",
        "E.J.",
        "God help me, I agree with just about all of that.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "The problem here isn't the cat.",
        "I think it's your choice of hats that you need to work on.",
        "I think the challenge to Obama is, even if it's not his fault, these things happen when he's president, and you've got to take the blame.",
        "I think the big political question will be, was there a history of these problems that predated Obama?",
        "I am worried about the Secret Service scandal, to the extent that they compromise their ability to protect the president.",
        "And if that happened in any way, that is really troublesome."
