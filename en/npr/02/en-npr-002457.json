        "And, first, the arrests of three men, two of them in Norway, one, I gather, based in Norway but vacationing in Germany, what have they been charged with?",
        "Well, they've been charged with terrorism-related charges -plotting terrorism.",
        "And, you know, officials have said that it's linked to al-Qaida.",
        "Also, in Britain yesterday, a man named Abid Nasir(ph) was arrested and he was charged with being involved in some plot to blow up another shopping mall in England.",
        "These cases are supposed to be connected to the Zazi case from the U.S.?",
        "Correct.",
        "What we're seeing is the New York subway plot, the shopping center plot in England, and now this Oslo plot, they're three legs of the stool, if you will, you know, different plots that al-Qaida's operational chiefs have been running against the United States and Europe.",
        "A name that comes up in this story is that of Adnan al Subazuma(ph), Saudi-born, American-raised.",
        "He was charged in Brooklyn yesterday, for allegedly plotting both the planned subway bombings, the Zazi case, and also the planned British shopping center bombing.",
        "What do you know about Subazuma?",
        "Well, Subazuma has alluded the FBI for years.",
        "He's a most-wanted terrorist, there's a $5 million reward out for him.",
        "And he appears to have taken on the mantle as the lead al-Qaida figure, planning these attacks against the, you foreign targets such as the United States, U.K., and Norway.",
        "And one thing you've reported that at least the Norwegian case has in common with the American case is the kind of explosive.",
        "In all three cases, what we're seeing is the explosive that was intended to be used was a peroxide bomb.",
        "Peroxide bombs are very - they're small but they're powerful, they can be transported easily.",
        "And in the New York case, they were talking about just putting them in a backpack and walking onto a crowded subway during rush hour.",
        "In trying to sort through what is new or different or what's familiar about this case as it's now emerging, one thing that seems to be consistent with recent arrests in the U.S.",
        "is that the men from Norway and in Britain, like those in America, weren't infiltrated in like the 9/11 bombers.",
        "These are people who had long-established legal residence, if not citizenship, in these countries."

        "That's absolutely right.",

        "And certainly in the United States, we're seeing more U.S.",
        "citizens taking up arms against the United States.",
        "There's been a real rash of that.",
        "The other thing that's very interesting is that these plots seem to show al-Qaida has become a lot more nimble than it was a decade ago when it was coordinating these very complicated attacks like 9/11.",
        "These attacks we're seeing here, these plots don't require a whole lot of coordination.",
        "It's a bunch of guys trying to get a recipe for a bomb and they pick their target and just go set it off.",
        "More nimble might be the glass half full from al-Qaida's standpoint.",
        "Smaller is another way of describing it.",
        "Not colossal, you know, aircraft flying into skyscrapers.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But you know what, what we saw on Christmas was that you don't need to be - as far as al-Qaida's concerned, you don't need to be successful to scare a lot of people.",
        "But it's not just Clinton and her supporters fighting to get Florida delegates seated at the convention.",
        "John Alismon(ph) is a DNC member from Florida who endorsed the presidential candidacy of Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich.",
        "At Saturday's meeting he'll be presenting Florida's challenge to the DNC ruling that stripped the state of all its delegates.",
        "A close reading of party rules, he says, shows that the DNC went too far.",
        "Alismon says the rules allows the DNC to penalize a state by stripping just half of it delegates.",
        "If the DNC exercised that option, he says, Democrats would not be in the mess they're in today.",
        "On the Republican side, where they did do a 50 percent reduction for the Florida delegates, Florida knocked out Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, and John McCain became the clear frontrunner.",
        "Other states pick corn, but Florida picks presidents, and in this case Florida was denied that opportunity.",
        "Members of the rules and bylaws committee and DNC staff are leaning toward that solution, restoring half the state's delegates, and it's an approach the Obama campaign supports.",
        "But it raises another question.",
        "How would the delegates be divided?",
        "Depending upon the formula used, Clinton could pick up anywhere between six and 19 delegates; in any case still not enough to catch Obama.",
        "That could be one reason why Clinton has been calling for the DNC to seat not just half but all 211 of Florida's delegates.",
        "And she's not the only one.",
        "Florida's Senate Minority Leader Steve Geller agrees.",
        "Geller filed a lawsuit in federal court saying that for Floridians a half a loaf solution just won't work.",
        "There is incredible, incredible anger on the streets at the Democratic clubs, at the condos that I speak to, over the fact that our delegates haven't been fully seated.",
        "I think the only way that we will be competitive in November is if they seat our delegates."
