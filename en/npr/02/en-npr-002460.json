        "Well, thanks.",
        "Some exciting news out of NASA this week.",
        "The All Sky Map was unveiled.",
        "What is it?",
        "Well, the All Sky Map is the output of something called the Interstellar Boundary Explorer Mission.",
        "And this is an experiment that was designed to make a picture of the boundary between our galaxy and our Solar System.",
        "And the reason there is such a thing is, if you can imagine the circumstance, where we have a solar wind, and what that means is it's a wind off our star - and if you have wanted to try and visualize this, think about standing here on Earth and you had a wind that blew straight up off the planet - and the sun blows a great, big bubble around our solar system, and it's a protective bubble.",
        "It convects magnetic field out to the edge of this, and it produces a magnetic shield around our solar system.",
        "That shield is the heliosphere.",
        "That shield is the heliosphere.",
        "And it protects us from?",
        "From cosmic radiation from the galaxy.",
        "It absorbs about 68, 75 percent of all the galactic, cosmic radiation, and we're shielded from the rest of it by the Earth's magnetic field.",
        "So here on Earth, we're pretty safe from this stuff.",
        "So in 2008, NASA launched the IBEX, the Interstellar Boundary Explorer, the spacecraft that takes photographs way out.",
        "What did it capture?",
        "Well, it captures an image that looks like what it would be if you were inside of a bubble, if you can imagine such a thing, and you would have to look around.",
        "You'd have to turn your head every direction in order to see all the features.",
        "And so we have a way of plotting this on a single map, and it's kind of an oval map; it's a projection.",
        "And what it shows is that there is a stripe across the inside of this bubble.",
        "what is that stripe?",
        "It's completely unexpected.",
        "What I had anticipated, and I'm kind of a traditional physicist, what I'd expected would be that we'd see it bright on one side and dark on the other because material was piling up on the side that's plowing through the galaxy, and that is visualized to a certain extent, but this other feature is - has another characteristic which is very curious, which is aligned, and it's perpendicular to what we think is the direction of the magnetic field of the galaxy."

        "Well, what does it tell us about our place in the galaxy?",
        "Well, I think that what it tells us is that first of all, there's a little bit of come down to Earth and be a little bit humble because all of a sudden, expectation doesn't fit preconceived theory.",
        "But what was the expectation?",
        "The expectation was there would be a teardrop-shaped structure, sort of a bubble plowing into the galactic wind on one side and trailing off sort of like a teardrop on the other side.",
        "Is it the farthest out we've ever seen?",
        "Oh, no. We see much further out than this, but it's the first time we've seen this structure.",
        "There's been no way to visualize it previously.",
        "It isn't actually light.",
        "It's - we're detecting particles that come from that region.",
        "So it's as if you had a bank of cloud that was emitting some kind of particle, like a raindrop, only in this case, it's emitting neutral hydrogen.",
        "And so the neutral hydrogen detectors make this image for us.",
        "So we don't actually know what this stripe does?",
        "Where are they living?",
        "Well, we know it's made out of hydrogen, out of protons that recombine with electrons.",
        "We don't know the process by which it is draped over the heliosphere, and we also don't understand exactly why it has brighter spots in it.",
        "It's not just a uniform kind of stripe.",
        "It's got intensity and density in it.",
        "And what in the world makes that?",
        "That's - it's going to be fascinating to see.",
        "Where do you go from here?",
        "I mean, how can you continue or how will you continue to study this stripe in the heliosphere?"

        "if there are changes in it, we certainly know that the changes can come from either changes in the galactic wind blowing on us or changes in the solar wind that blows this bubble.",
        "And we can follow the solar wind pretty well, and we'll straighten out causality.",
        "What are these changes, and why are they there?",
        "I think the second thing is that it just says in previous models, we're not using the right physics, and the physicists are going to have to go back and consider what physical processes may be left out of these calculations.",
        "And my guess is that within a couple years, we'll have a pretty good explanation of this.",

        "This week, the gravitational forces kicked in.",
        "Mr. Obama's approval ratings have slipped for the first time in his short presidency, a five percent drop from 64 percent to 59, according to a new poll released today by the Pew Research Center.",

        "Well, it looks like President Obama's biggest problem is, and there's no surprise here, the economy.",
        "The majority still approve of how he's handling the economy.",
        "But if that's the case, where is the growing discord coming from?",
        "There are three factors.",
        "One, we found in this survey, people thinking Obama is listening too much to the liberals in his party and not to the moderates - by a 44 to 30 percent margin, that was the case.",
        "Two months ago, it was just the opposite.",
        "When he was President-elect Obama, most people thought he was listening to the moderates.",
        "Second factor is a bit of populist backlash that's operating here.",
        "There's still a divide about the Wall Street rescue, helping homeowners who took unaffordable mortgages, the public splits pretty evenly, 46 percent to 46 percent.",
        "And as many as 48 percent of the public said that they are angry about bailing out financial institutions that made bad decisions.",
        "Even many of the people who favor the Wall Street bailout say they're angry about it.",
        "There's some of that and he's getting some of the heat there.",
        "People are also very divided on how they view the deficit.",
        "Just a little over 30 percent say that they're very worried about this.",
        "Very worried about it.",
        "Close to 35 percent say they're angry about the rising deficit, Republicans in particular, conservative Republicans obviously most concerned about this.",
        "But this is a problem for the public at large.",
        "There's another factor in Obama's slippage here that has to be pointed out.",
        "And that is while there's a great deal of support for doing easy things, like more money for building roads and bridges and taxing wealthy people and cutting taxes for middle income people, when you get to some of these policy areas that make people nervous, you see some pushback.",
        "So as Obama begins to deal with some of the specific policy realms such as entitlements and healthcare, the going is going to get a lot rougher than it was in getting money for bridges.",
        "Now, Andy, we've been talking to you for years about public opinion polling as it pertains to Iraq.",
        "But in this case, you asked about the buildup in Afghanistan, and there was a real divide there, as well.",
        "Fifty-five percent of the public thinks this is a good idea, but it's mostly Independents and Republicans who think that it's a good idea.",
        "Democrats, 45 percent or so, say it's a good idea.",
        "There is more concern with Democrats about the buildup in Afghanistan."

        "Absolutely.",

        "Only 28 percent said they approved of the -the job the Republican congressional leaders are doing.",
        "That's the lowest rating that we've had for that group in 15 years of polls.",
        "And if people are thinking, if some of the people that you polled said that the president is listening too much to the liberal wing of his party, what do they think about Democrats on Capitol Hill?",
