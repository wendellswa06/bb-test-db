        "Was this just inside baseball bickering, or is this something bigger?",
        "Well, I think a little bit of both.",
        "When the White House asked for a time for the speech, they understandably chose an important night, the first night Congress will be back, and I think this was a secondary point, the night when there's going to be a major debate among the Republican presidential candidates out in California.",

        "And so the president will have to give the speech the next night when he will have to make sure he gets finished before the first game of the National Football League season.",
        "But one important thing about that speech, you know, all summer long, there has been this debate on the president's staff and among his supporters about whether he should go big in this speech and really ask for ambitious job creation proposals or go small, just restrict himself to things that he knows Congress might be willing to pass on a bipartisan basis.",
        "Well, you don't go up and ask for a joint session of Congress and speak for 45 minutes and tie up a full hour of national television time if you're going to go small.",
        "This is going to be a big speech.",

        "This is clearly going to upset his liberal base, but will he gain any ground with the conservatives?",
        "You know, it's hard to see any circumstances under which Barack Obama gains ground with conservatives this year.",
        "But that decision on air pollution was important because you're going to see other regulations delayed, I'm sure, because all of those regulations are easy to attack as slowing down job creation and slowing down business because it's true.",
        "That regulation, if enforced, probably would have blocked the building of some industrial facilities and the expansion of others that would have created more pollution.",
        "And it would have opened the EPA and the federal government to attack that they're not fully in the business of job creation.",
        "So I think what we're going to see all year long is a series of trade-offs between short-term measures and the long-term measures.",
        "And what the Obama administration said in this case, and they'll say it in others, is, you know, over the long term, we still want to get pollution down, but the economy is in such a fragile state, we have to take some short-term measures to shore it up.",
