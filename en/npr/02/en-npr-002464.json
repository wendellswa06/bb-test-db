        "And he's also gaffe-prone.",
        "I mean, he's a guy who said, you know, in his opinion the Iraq War was a failure, and has made controversial comments even about President Obama, being light-skinned, not having a Negro dialect, awkward comments.",
        "Part of the problem for him is that whereas he was previously seen as a moderate Democrat and an effective legislator who knows the rules of the Senate like the back of his hand, just terrific, now he's seen as stumbling and bumbling and unable to get legislation through the body, even though Democrats, of course, had until recently, that super-majority of 60 votes in the Senate.",
        "And on top of that, he seems to be - after four terms - in some kind of political trouble in his home state.",
        "Linda, this is really interesting, but if you look at the polls, despite his claims to be, you know, the most powerful Democrats in Washington able to bring home the bacon for Nevada, right now, he has a 52 percent unfavorable rating, according to a poll in the Las Vegas Review Journal - and general sense that when it comes to things like health care legislation, Harry Reid's been making deals, but he hasn't gotten anything done."

        "Harry Reid rejects it, and then comes out with a bill that's about $15 billion and focused only on tax cuts for employers to hire people in some highway construction.",
        "And everybody, from the White House to Democrats to Republicans, are saying: What happened?",
        "Well, what happened is Harry Reid decided, you know what?",
        "This is an opportunity to simply not force the vote down the throats of liberal Democrats who had some concerns about the bill, and instead to put the pressure on Republicans, to make it clear that Republicans were opposed to popular pieces of the bill.",
        "Well now the whole thing is in danger of falling apart, and people are saying: What kind of leadership is this from Harry Reid, who thought that he was being tactical?",

        "Correct.",

        "What I love about antipasti is that even in a restaurant, oftentimes they'll have sort of a big communal table in the center of the restaurant, and they'll allow you to come up with, you know, your plate and a big spoon and just kind of point to or pick through and serve yourself whatever you want from the antipasti spread.",
        "So that's kind of the most interactive moment of the meal, which is maybe also why it's one of my favorites.",
        "And you're using the term antipasti.",

        "No.",
        "They're actually so excited, and I'm so honored to be one of the first people to ever write down family recipes.",
        "Because, you know, for my family, and I think a lot of Italian families, or just families that have different backgrounds, in general, there's not really a written recipe.",
        "You know, you have to stand around the kitchen a lot to watch what happens, and that's how you learn.",
