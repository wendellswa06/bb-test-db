        "And it may not be just a communications problem.",
        "There are some in the White House who are beginning to think it may no longer be possible to pass any more stimulus bills unless they are very narrowly targeted and largely paid for.",

        "But constituents right now are very deficit-sensitive, whether it is short-term or long-term, and they're putting pressure on members of Congress to put on the brakes.",
        "It used to be hard to vote against extending unemployment benefits in a recession, but not any more, when you explain the way Republican leader Mitch McConnell did on the floor of the Senate last week.",
        "What we're not willing to do is to use worthwhile programs as an excuse to burden our children and our grandchildren with an even bigger national debt than we've already got.",
