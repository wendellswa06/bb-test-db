        "But they keep talking about our debt burden, and half of it's owned by foreigners.",

        "Of course.",
        "Well, a very good question.",
        "Actually - usually, economists think of us as trying to keep interest rates and government debt down.",
        "So the idea is that, you know, in general, they won't quarrel with this, but the idea is usually we want low interest and government debt.",
        "We'd rather see people make money by investing in private assets, the idea of being that if people put their money into Microsoft stock, a Verizon or startup companies, that that will create capital for the economy to grow.",

        "It's about two percent of GDP.",

        "Exactly.",
        "And I think that's really the point we have to keep in mind.",
        "We have the experience of the '90s, or we could look back to the early post-war years from the end of World War II until 1980, when the debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 110 percent of GDP and - just after World War II, to about 30 percent back in 1980.",

        "So the point is, if you get the economy growing, one, you'll get the deficits down.",
        "We actually got to surpluses at the end of the Clinton years.",
