        "Good afternoon, gentlemen.",
        "I have to disagree with Mr. Baker's analysis for this reason: I don't disagree that this maybe a lesser percentage of GDP than we've seen in the past, but there are two problems with this.",
        "Number one, there is no trend towards correcting the problem.",
        "We are simply getting deeper and deeper and deeper and deeper in debt.",
        "The Clinton balanced budget event that occurred for a year or two was an aberration based upon relatively recent history.",
        "Number two, when you start talking about a percentage of GDP, the only way you pay this debt off - and, in particular, what we're doing is only paying interest payments - is by raising taxes.",
        "And, yes, you expand the economy, that would generate tax revenues.",
        "But the bottom line is the cost is going up.",

        "OK.",

        "So President Bush had his tax cuts.",
        "We have the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, which is very large.",
        "There are huge increases in defense spending over the course of this decade, which often goes unmentioned, but that is a very big factor contributing to the deficits.",
        "But on top of that, if you just look further back, in fact, most of the post-war period, the ratio of the debt to GDP was coming down.",
        "So it really, from '40s - from '45 until 1980, the debt-to-GDP ratio was coming down.",
        "It starts to rise rapidly in the Reagan years.",
        "And then, when President Clinton came into office in '92 and '93, it again began to come down.",
        "So, actually, the history has been exactly as I'm saying.",
        "For the most part, the debt was becoming more manageable through time, not less manageable.",
        "So I'm really not worried.",
        "Remember, we don't ever have to pay it off.",
        "I mean, politically, someone may get out there and say, we're going to pay it off.",

        "And the way they loan the government is they do it - and we joke about this - the old fashion way: They print it.",
        "So the Federal Reserve essentially has the authority to print money, and they could simply buy up government bonds based on their own credit.",
        "So that's, in fact, what they do.",
        "And if we turn to the case in Japan, where I was talking about they have a debt of 160 percent of GDP, much of it is actually owned by their central bank.",
        "So they're, in effect, printing money and using that to buy debt from - bonds from the government, which, again, you might say, well, they're just making it up.",
