        "These were fun.",
        "I've been doing this for years.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "I want to hear more about that and how you get people to the table.",
        "Let me go to Sharon Leslie Morgan, though.",
        "You've been able to find the names of more than two dozen people in your family who were enslaved.",
        "And some of those stories and the stories of their descendants, both white and black, are truly painful.",
        "I mean, for example, you talk about your white grandmother, who was disowned by her family when one of her children was born with brown skin.",
        "I mean, that's just, you know, one story.",
        "And yet you've said that tracing your roots has helped you confront the trauma that slavery and racism imposed on your family.",
        "I mean, how?",
        "The first thing that you have to do is that you have to remember that, first, it hurts.",
        "And then, it heals.",
        "And one of the things we must do is go back and confront this history that is the legacy that we're living with today.",
        "The reason that we have racism and all of the acrimonious feelings between people of different races has a great deal to do with the history of this country and it having been born as a country that embraced slavery.",
        "So you have to go back into the past.",
        "You have to confront it.",
        "You have to experience the pain.",
        "And then, you have to use that in a productive way to move forward to the healing.",
        "So, Pastor, I want to go back to that.",
        "And, you know, Sharon just said you have to confront it.",
        "As you've just told us a lot of people would really prefer not to.",
        "How do you get people to the table?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, is it - do you find that it requires the deep commitment of religious commitment to get people to the table?",
        "And even then, when they have that, do they really want to engage?",
        "Like, what do you do to get people to the table who are not that interested?",
        "Well, both of my fellow guests have said something that I think is exactly right, which is the necessity of lament.",
        "Jesus said blessed are they who mourn, and a great deal of this has to do with those who are leading and speaking, making sure that people, especially majority culture people, understand that history alone doesn't take care of this.",
        "Sometimes, I will hear white Americans say, well, it's 2019 as though, simply because it's 2019, all of these issues are passed and behind us.",
        "And so that means standing up and saying how did this happen.",
        "How were people able to be so blinded to something as basic to both the Christian vision of reality and to the American founding documents of the dignity of all human beings?",
        "How was that missed?",
        "And what, then, are we missing?",
        "And how can we build something that is not just about getting along with one another but actually loving one another and behaving toward one another, justly?",
        "That's - what I find is that, usually, the people who are grappling with the question and asking the question - where do we go from here?",
        "- are usually in a pretty good place.",
        "They're moving in a good direction.",
        "It's the people who don't think that this issue is even one that should be talked about at all or that it's a distraction - that's what really worries me."

        "How do you get people to the table?",
        "I know that you've had some difficult community conversations in the past.",
        "I mean, for example, I know that you worked in helping the community figure out what to do about the site of the former Sandy Hook Elementary School.",
        "You were part of the facilitation process there.",
        "But those were people who were highly motivated to be part of the conversation, and one assumes that they at least approached it with some semblance of goodwill toward each other.",
        "I mean, what about when it isn't that, when - what about it when it's with what Pastor Moore said, that there are a lot of people who said, you know what?",

        "I think a better strategy is slow and steady.",
        "And what we want to do initially is start to bring people together in small groups who are willing to come together and let that ripple out over time and build our capability to do this.",
        "Look at - the heart of this is going to be our civic confidence, our belief that we can do this together and do something productive.",
        "I think that's going to have to start small.",
        "It can start to build from there and ripple out.",

        "I know that you've been involved with a group called Coming To The Table, an organization that acknowledges and seeks to heal from the racial wounds of the past.",
        "I'm reading from the, you know, statement...",
        "Right.",
        "And you contributed to this really interesting volume called \"\"Slavery's Descendants,\"\" which is coming out soon.",
        "It's published by Rutgers University Press, which actually has essays from people who were people who know that they are related to people who enslaved people and people, like yourself, who know that you are related to descendants - who are descendants of people who were enslaved.",
        "How has that worked for you in getting people to participate in these conversations or have these kinds of dialogues?",
        "It's worked very well for us.",
        "And I think, on one hand, I kind of agree with Rich when he says that these are things that happen.",
        "There has to be a change of heart by individual people.",
        "So those are things that happen on a very small platform, and that does ripple outward.",
        "So you need enough people to change their hearts and make a change in the society.",
        "So Coming To The Table has been one way of doing that because we now have thousands of people around the country who are interested in this model of being able to take the descendants of people who were enslaved and unite them with the people who are descendants of those who enslaved them.",
        "And it may sound counterintuitive to make that that connection, but it really does work because nobody has had a way to relieve themselves of this moral burden.",
        "I'm also agreeing with Reverend Moore.",
        "This is a moral imperative.",
        "If you believe in humanity, if you have love in your heart, if you believe in Christian principles, if you have a moral compass, it - you have to engage this conversation.",
        "And I am feeling very positive because as I go around the country and I speak and I see the people who are buying my books and the people who attend our sessions when I do talks, I am seeing a yearning in people that really do want it to change because we're tired of the acrimony, you know?",
        "We're ready to do re-embrace this moral principle and to start really caring about each other and getting over this past.",
        "I...",
        "But it's not over, and it's got to be over if we're ever going to make it, if we're ever going to heal.",

        "So the state house passed a bill that would create a majority minority judicial district.",
        "That would mean at least one African-American judge would likely get elected in a district that's only had white judges up to this point.",
        "So there's just one problem with the new subdistrict.",
        "It would be too small to be considered representative by constitutional standards.",
        "Looks like it's time to go back to the drawing board.",
        "Still, majority-minority subdistricts are nothing new to Louisiana.",

        "And in national news, the Pew Research Center just released a poll of American Muslims.",
        "Three quarters said the use of suicide bombings is never justified.",

        "Native-born blacks make up one-in-five American Muslims.",
        "They're also far more likely than immigrant Muslims to say they support al-Qaida.",
        "Only a third had a very unfavorable view of the group.",
        "Nearly twice as many immigrant Muslims felt that way.",
        "Every now and again, we like to check in on controversies playing out on social media - not because they represent some careful scholarly debate, but rather because these controversies seemed to tap into wells of sentiment that exist but don't find expression anywhere else.",
        "So we wanted to talk about a debate that started with this tweet.",
        "Quote, \"\"there is a white woman curating the hip-hop part of the NMAAHC Smithsonian\"\" - lots of exclamation marks - who let this expletive happen,\"\" unquote.",
        "Now, NMAAHC is the National Museum of African-American History and Culture, which opened with great fanfare in 2016 and has been wildly popular since.",
        "The hip-hop exhibit has been part of the museum since the outset.",
        "The reference is to curator Timothy Anne Burnside.",
        "And that tweet was met with many impassioned responses, both defending the curator's credentials and commitment but also those supporting the critique.",
        "And that sparked a much larger debate about who should have access to black spaces."

        "And they all immediately came to her defense, vouching for her credibility as a curator.",
        "But then the defenders got called out, and it became this really heated conversation that hinged on race and class and how these distinctions really kind of play into who creates culture versus who gets to curate it, especially in America's ivory towers.",

        "So, you know, that's time served cultivating the relationships that are really necessary to build the kind of archive that the museum can boast of now.",
        "The critics are really aiming their fire at the museum, it seems to me, that they seem to be saying that African-Americans don't have access to that many positions of this type, and therefore, this highly sought-after position should go to a - an African-American.",
        "That seems to be the gist of the argument, if I have that right.",

        "And the statement also talked about the museum being dedicated to telling the American story through an African-American lens but also recognizing that there is a serious lack of diversity in the museum field, which they are not only aware of, but, you know, attempting to work toward fixing as well.",
        "Let me ask you this.",
        "Is this something about hip-hop?",
        "For example, if she were curating a different exhibit, like blacks in classical music, for example, would this have evoked the same reaction?",
