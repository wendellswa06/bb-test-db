        "After September 11th, he made some speeches to some of his followers, to some of the people who looked up to him, particularly at a gathering on September 16th where he told people that the dark times were coming for Muslims in the United States, that they might want to move overseas.",
        "And the government said that he basically urged them to fight a holy war against the United States, to support Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban in Afghanistan.",

        "Some of them actually got over to Pakistan--they never got to Afghanistan--and underwent some terror training in preparation to do just what he told them to do.",

        "And in court this morning, Timimi continued to insist he was innocent.",
        "What was his defense?",
        "His defense, first of all, was that speech cannot be a crime, that the First Amendment allows him to say that he hates the West, for example, which he and his defense attorneys admitted that he did, that he basically objected to US foreign policy, that he believed that the way US policy in Israel and the Mideast was working was wrong, but that all of that was protected speech and that he could say those things.",
        "He also said that he was basically telling people that life in the United States was going to be very difficult for Muslims after September 11th, which is true, according to a lot of people, and so he was telling them that they should consider moving overseas and that this was an Islamic thing to do, that it was OK to do these things, but that he really wasn't urging anybody to engage in violence, that he never picked up a gun himself, and that he's not responsible for what other people do with his words.",
        "And he continued to insist on that.",
        "In fact, he made a motion to overturn his verdict after his conviction, saying that he was unfairly persecuted as a Muslim, that he was being smeared by somebody--by a prosecutor who didn't really understand Islam, who basically said that a scholar like Timimi would lie to the jury because he believed it was OK to lie to non-believers, but obviously neither the jury nor the judge bought that argument.",
        "Well, if Timimi appeals, can he make a free speech or a freedom of religion argument?",
        "Well, he's going to try, and again, as I said, his lawyer made an argument in court this morning that the whole case should be thrown out because he pointed to some statements that the prosecutor made indicating, as I said, that Timimi would lie, and he's saying, `Well, you can't smear somebody and say that his religious beliefs are going to cause him to lie in court.",
        "You have to focus on the facts.",
        "Other prosecutors say if somebody is religiously motivated, it's OK to bring up those motivations when you're trying to prove that the person engaged in a crime.",
        "Whether it's religion or greed that drives you, those motivations are still relevant to be brought up in court.",
