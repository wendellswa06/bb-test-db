        "The Federal Reserve is an independent federal agency, that is, the Federal Reserve Board is part of the government.",
        "The 12 reserve banks are technically private institutions and so they are outside of the government, so the Federal Reserve as a whole is inside and outside the government.",
        "Now with regard to the role of derivatives, a reason the Federal Reserve acted in supporting - facilitating the resolution of Bear Stearns was exactly concerns about derivatives.",
        "It's got a big balance sheet.",
        "It's got lots of obligations.",

        "The reserve banks technically are private but all major decisions in terms of employment are subject to a veto by the board of governors.",
        "So it is within the government.",
        "I think the key issue is the Federal Reserve is quasi-independent because politicians recognize a central bank should be somewhat independent.",
