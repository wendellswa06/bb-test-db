        "Nic Radford with the Johnson Space Center team says his group is working through \"\"network problems.\"\" By this afternoon, clearly one of the teams to watch was Schaft, a group from Japan that was leading all competitors.",

        "We don't have arms and legs; we have limbs.",
        "Each one of those limbs is capable of both mobility and manipulation.",
        "Each one of those limbs will ultimately have a hand at the end of it.",
        "Like the name implies, RoboSimian, is inspired by our primate cousins.",
        "It's another NASA robot, this one from the Jet Propulsion Lab.",
        "It has our limbs, which makes it more stable than by pedal robots.",
        "Computer scientists and engineers here say it's a rare opportunity, the chance to see the leaders in robotics bringing their work out into the field.",
        "Kennedy says while everyone would like to win, it's still pretty collegial.",
        "Most of us are much more concerned with pushing robotics forward than we are with beating the other guy.",
        "That's not really the point.",
        "I could tell by the tone in his voice what the answer was before he said anything.",
        "And he said so and so - I've even forgotten the legislator's name - is not with us.",
        "Looks like we're going to be one vote short.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And here's where it gets interesting.",
        "Three Christie loyalists, two of whom still work for him, testified they spoke to Christie about his office's involvement in the traffic jams after the closures but long before he publicly said he knew nothing.",
        "And a fourth witness, who's a close ally of Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, suggested Cuomo also worked with Christie early on to keep the closures quiet for his own political reasons.",
        "Wildstein, the star witness, backed up that account and there are corroborating emails.",
        "And, you know, you kind of have to wonder in this that there - you know, there's a big cast of characters.",
        "Is the prosecution worried that the jury will just get confused?",
        "Yes.",
        "And they said that in their closing arguments.",
        "They said do not be distracted by who is not on trial.",
        "Just look at these defendants and what they did and said in plain English.",
        "The problem for the prosecution is the defendants didn't personally benefit.",
        "Both the prosecution and the defense agree that the two were Christie loyalists trying to help their boss, although they didn't agree on how they tried to help him.",
        "The defense says Christie didn't return that loyalty but instead lied and threw them under the bus to protect his own White House ambitions.",
        "Well, Andrea, we just have a few seconds here.",
        "But, you know, there is irony, it would appear, that this case closes right when the presidential race comes to a close.",
        "And it was a race Christie had hoped to be in.",
        "Very much so.",
        "Whoever's found guilty, one thing is clear - Christie and his administration were hell-bent on getting him re-elected for governor by huge margins as a launching pad for the presidential race..."
