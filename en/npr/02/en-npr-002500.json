        "Are they reacting to that, too, do you think?",
        "Well, the polls after the French vote on Sunday showed that the French no had probably helped the Dutch no campaign to a certain extent, but I think there was already quite a lot of momentum behind the Dutch no. And when asked whether the French vote would influence them, most Dutch voters said no. And, in fact, only a very small percentage of Dutch voters said they didn't think it was any longer worth voting because France had already made the decision.",
        "They seemed pretty keen to want to have their own say.",

        "Just a few weeks before the vote today, word came out that the guilder, the old Dutch currency, had been undervalued against the German mark at the time of the introduction of the euro.",
