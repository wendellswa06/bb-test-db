        "The $500 million settlement includes 75 million for victims who have yet to be identified.",

        "Obviously, the size of the settlement is very big.",
        "But what struck me really is that there's still $75 million as part of that for victims who have yet to come forward.",

        "Military action is more pervasive than it was 2007, when we sat down.",
        "That says one of two things: Either we need many more troops so that we - this doesn't continue to happen, which I don't think there's any support for.",
        "Or we need to reevaluate what our approach has been for the past eight years.",
