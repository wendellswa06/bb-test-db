        "You know, our instinct as parents is to boss our kids around because it's easier and because we're usually right.",
        "But as any parent knows, if you tell the same kid to do the same thing over and over again, it doesn't work.",
        "And what, you know, what this system does is build in change, so you can react to what's going on in real time.",
        "So, the cornerstone of this idea, this idea of agile family movement - and there is such a thing now - the cornerstone is this idea of the family meeting.",

        "But she also, as she says, was so desperate for ideas, she was willing to try.",
        "And then what happened was our girls - we started when they are five - they're almost eight now, so we had been doing for three years weekly - they really embraced it.",
        "And what was interesting about it was, first of all, the most amazing things started coming out of their mouths, right.",
        "So, what worked well this week?",

        "You would think, you know, that feels kind of corporate.",
        "How does this work for a family?",
        "I would say this is one of the top two or three things that I most enjoyed and that our family most benefited from.",
        "And it comes out of, again, of a core problem.",
        "Every parent I know struggles with this idea of how do I teach my kids values, right?",
        "How do I say even in the 24/7 world some things are timeless?",
        "And then I realized, you know, have I really told my children?",
        "I mean, I could sit down and ask my kids, you know, what's really important to your parents?",
        "But have I really made the trouble to tell them?",
        "So, we did the family equivalent of a corporate retreat; we had a pajama party, and we had this chart and we had this conversation, like, what's really important to us?",
        "What sayings that mom and dad use all the time do you most remember?",
        "And what is it that we most want to stand for?",
        "And it can't be what you want to stand for; it has to be actually, you know, honesty.",
        "Yeah, I get honesty is important but, come on, is that really a core value for us?",
        "You know, you can't just wag your finger.",
        "And we ended up with this list.",
        "And, you know, there's a lot of research that shows that if you identify what is your best possible self, you know, if you identify what it is that you aspire to, you're going to do a better job of trying to achieve that.",
        "So, our family mission statement is may our first word be adventure and our last word love."
