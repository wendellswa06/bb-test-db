        "Over the course of his time in Iraq, Bredberg was hit by IEDs three other times and suffered another concussion.",
        "But again, he didn't notice any lasting effects.",
        "But then Bredberg returned to the U.S.",
        "and he began having nightmares, dreams of violence so intense he didn't want to sleep.",
        "Bredberg says he would startle at the slightest noise.",
        "There are flashbacks and wild mood swings.",
        "His relationships began to deteriorate.",
        "He found it difficult even to be near his infant son.",
        "I couldn't be around my son because of flashbacks when he cried.",
        "But perhaps the scariest moment came one weekend when Bredberg was out at a store.",
        "A man passed him and Bredberg remembers him saying something vaguely rude.",
        "The next thing I know I have people from this grocery store yelling at me and grabbing at me because I'm beating the hell out of this guy in the parking lot.",
        "And I didn't realize it.",
        "I didn't know I was doing it.",
        "Bredberg finally went to mental health on his base at Fort Drum.",
        "He says he was told by the doctors there that he had PTSD.",
        "Now a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests there may be a relationship between concussions and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "Army medical researcher Charles Hoge surveyed over 2,000 Army infantry soldiers who had returned from Iraq and found that three to four months after their return a high percentage of those who had experienced a concussion met the criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "Nearly half of soldiers who had a concussion with loss of consciousness met the criteria for PTSD, and that's a very high rate.",
        "Hoge says he was a little surprised by these results because in the civilian world concussions aren't generally associated with PTSD.",
        "For instance, on a football field, football players certainly don't develop post-traumatic stress disorder in the context of football injuries and concussions on the football field.",
        "Hoge says one possible explanation is that traumatic battles produce both concussions and PTSD.",
        "But another researcher, David Hovda, a professor of neurosurgery at UCLA, suggests another possibility.",
        "He points out that there are real chemical changes in the brain in the wake of a concussion."

        "And this change in chemistry causes other things to change, which have long-term consequences with regards to how the brain response to emotions.",
        "So, says Hovda, though concussions don't cause post-traumatic stress disorder, the chemical changes that are the product of concussion and the lethargy, anxiety and depression that often follow, may inhibit a person's ability to recover from a traumatic experience.",
        "Three and a half years after his return from Iraq, Tim Bredberg continues his fight with the disease, but says he is somewhat better able to cope with his child's cry.",
        "Well, maybe you can take us back to that day.",
        "You know, you'd gotten this worst news of your life, really, and your four-year-old is standing right there with you.",
        "How did you deal with that?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, the - you know, the person who led us to bin Laden was a Kuwaiti courier who was known, for many years, to the CIA only as Ahmed the Kuwaiti.",
        "His name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, and they eventually, you know, made the connection between the pseudonym Ahmed the Kuwaiti and the guy's real name.",
        "But the existence of this Ahmed the Kuwaiti emerged from some of the most notorious - publicly notorious - interrogation sessions early in the effort against al-Qaida.",
        "Yet it would be quite some time before that name emerged and he would lead us to bin Laden.",
        "Correct, and I think, you know, I think there's a political motive behind claiming that torture played no role in this, and perhaps even an admiral political motive, but the truth is that unless you discount all the years that the CIA was trying to figure out who Ahmed the Kuwaiti was and only begin the story when they made that connection with a real person, it's just not true to say that torture was not a factor.",
        "There is in fact a scene in the film, and this is, I guess, just before that pivot, after years of intelligence-gathering, which included those water boarding scenes.",
        "The film shows a moment in which a very angry CIA chief raises concerns about the information gathered after years."
