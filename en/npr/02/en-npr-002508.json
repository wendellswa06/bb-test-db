        "I mean, as approved, they were quite aggressive.",
        "So there's no gain saying that.",
        "On the other hand, the way the water board was depicted, with the water, you know, large amounts of water basically poured into the detainee's mouth with him gagging up huge amounts, the use of the dog collar on him; and with respect to the box the fact that he was jammed into, at least to me, looking at it, it looked like he was being shoe-horned into this very teeny, tiny box.",
        "Now those - in fact - that fact was not the way those techniques were authorized to be conducted and were not in fact carried out that - in that manner.",
        "So in that respect, the visual images, you know, I do believe struck me as over-the-top.",
        "And what do you say in response to people like Senator McCain, who say that, in fact, no useful information was the product of this torture and that the film is wrong in that respect?",
        "Well, I - you know, this is also the position apparently that's going to be taken in the report that the Senate Intelligence Committee has prepared, which has not been released.",
        "I mean, where I come out on this, having lived with this program from the beginning, I found, looking back, it's very dangerous to make, sort of, categorical statements one way or the other that we would never have caught bin Laden were it not for these techniques.",
        "On the other end of the spectrum, I don't - with due respect to those who take this position, seven - this program was carried out, was originally carried out, evolved over the years, was refined, produced thousands of intelligence reports and was conducted, mind you, all those years, by career CIA officers, non-political public servants.",
        "To say - to make a blanket statement that nothing of any value ever came out of these techniques, I just think beggars the imagination.",
        "I just don't buy that.",
        "Stay with us, we're going to have more with John Rizzo and Mark Bowden after a short break.",

        "John Riggo(ph), you were - Rizzo, excuse me, you were talking just before the break about these techniques did produce, it seemed to you, useful intelligence.",

        "Well, that's - you know, that's the ultimate question, isn't it?",
        "I can just tell you what my perspective was, my viewpoint was at the time these were conceived.",
        "I was, frankly, involved in this program heavily from the outset.",
        "When I first heard about these proposed techniques, I thought they were quite harsh, that they're very aggressive.",
        "I didn't know at that point whether they amounted to torture because, as you know, that's a legal term.",
        "More simply, never in my 25 years before at CIA had I the occasion to deal with the torture statute.",
        "So I didn't know - first of all, we were not going to ever do anything that was deemed to be illegal.",
        "But they were clearly, by any accounts, aggressive.",
        "But, you know, it's important to keep in mind the context of the times.",
        "These were conceived, this program was conceived just a few months after the 9/11 attacks.",
        "Everyone in the government and in large parts of the country were convinced that another attack was only a matter of time.",
        "In that context, in that environment, in that atmosphere, I mean, I don't presume to speak for everyone who was involved at the time, but I thought that if our experts thought that these sort of extraordinary measures were necessary and unavoidable to prevent perhaps another catastrophic attack, I myself concluded that they were not only worth pursuing, but it was our duty to pursue them, to at least confirm whether or not we could legally do them.",
        "You were among those who was involved in establishing the legal underpinning for this.",
        "Did you ever attend any of these interrogations?",
        "Did you ever watch any of the tapes?",
        "No, I never viewed the videotapes, which, as you know, were destroyed without my knowledge several years later.",
        "I had lawyers working under me who regularly visited the sites when the sessions were ongoing as part of the review effort.",
        "I should if I could note, parenthetically, getting back to the movie briefly, one of the other things about these scenes, the interrogation scenes in the movie that I thought was misleading was the seemingly ad hoc nature by which the interrogator would decide to use the waterboard or jam the detainee into the box.",
        "In fact the actual sessions were monitored by legal personnel, by medical personnel, and every technique had to be fully vetted with CIA headquarters and approved before they could be applied.",
        "So that was the other major, I think, misimpression left by the scenes, the interrogations as depicted in the movie.",
        "Mark Bowden, I wanted to bring you back in.",
        "Given what we've just heard from John Rizzo, does that still fall within the broad framework of based on a true story?",
        "Yeah, it does.",
        "I would think, Neal, that, you know, if the filmmakers had depicted the more clinical methods that John has described, it would have been a great deal more chilling than what we saw, at least, you know, in my way of looking at things.",
        "If I wanted to depict something really horrifying, I'd put a couple of doctors in the room and...",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "And have everything very antiseptic and clean.",
        "I mean, to me that smacks of, you know, SS tactics or, you know, medical experiments at a concentration camp.",
        "So in that sense maybe the filmmakers did the CIA a favor."

        "And do you fault the film for showing what actually did happen?",
        "We don't know that that isn't what happened, and that's why we need to see the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report because if, as Senators Feinstein and Senator McCain say, the report does not say that torture led to bin Laden, then we need to know that.",
        "And we actually - what this film did was to put us right back into the gray area of he-said-she-said with an ultimate sense on the American public that we can't possibly know, but this film has given us one narrative purported to be based on firsthand accounts of actual events.",
