        "And he's keeping tabs on NASA.",
        "Well, I think there's a couple of things I'd like to say in response.",
        "First is this is the first mention of the legality of it coming up, and I think it's an important point.",
        "Torture is illegal under American law, under military law and under international law.",
        "The definition of torture was changed in order to allow for this program President Obama, you know, outlawed torture again, restored the way it was in the past.",
        "But it's a very important point to make because it infuses this debate because those who participate in it are aware of the fact that before and after this it was illegal and it carries great penalties.",
        "Second thing I want to point out is something about professionalism.",
        "The Central Intelligence Agency is an agency that prides itself on its ability to penetrate into foreign networks, to get information, to analyze information, and that is the profession.",
        "To yield to torture is such a deep professionalism of what they are trained to do that it's interesting to me that they haven't been more offended by this movie, maybe they have been.",
        "And the third thing I just want to bring up because nobody has mentioned it yet is that perhaps the thing that I find most unsettling about this film is the lack of pushback or dissent or contesting the fact of torture in the movie.",
        "There is no character that says, gee, this isn't the way the CIA does things, or this is illegal, or maybe we should think about the morality of it.",
        "There's nothing.",
        "And as a result, it has a dehumanizing effect I believe on the nature of the story that is being told.",
        "And so I just want to make those comments in response to this caller and to John Rizzo's final comments.",
        "Karen Greenberg of Fordham Law School.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Mark Bowden, she's right on that last point, and it's a point that others within the film business have brought up as well in criticizing the film as not taking a stand against torture.",
        "No, it doesn't and nor do I feel, you know, filmmakers and artists are obliged to make a political argument or a statement.",
        "It's sufficient at least in my aesthetic if you're trying to tell a true story that you simply, you know, show what happened.",
        "And I also disagree with the interpretation of the film.",
        "The 40 minutes of coercive interrogation in the beginning of the film are depicted as an effort to try to head off a terrorist attack in Saudi Arabia, which goes ahead.",
        "They fail to prevent that attack.",
        "In fact, they make a point in the movie of noting that their efforts to interrogate this guy failed, and he's shown to be giving them, you know, misinformation as they're, you know, pushing him into this box.",
        "So the interpretation of the film which says that that long interrogation sequence in the beginning demonstrates the usefulness of torture methods I think just fails to read the movie correctly.",
        "So, you know, I don't agree with the interpretation of the film.",
        "I do agree, however, that it's right to ban these methods, and that the price that you pay for using them, except in very rare instances where you might forestall a tragedy is too great.",

        "I've got two points.",
        "The first one is the reason why Senator Feinstein and McCain have come out against it is because it opens up our troops to those same techniques.",
        "I was an intelligence analyst in a human intelligence unit for over six years in Korea and in Iraq.",
        "And I do believe that if a prisoner is unwilling to talk that it does make them eventually want to talk.",
        "And once you get into that position where they're talking, you can then find out the truth from the lies.",
        "But if they're not willing to talk at all from the beginning, you've got to encourage them.",
        "I hate to say it that way, but that's the facts.",
        "I'm hearing two things here, Dan.",
        "One, that it can be effective.",
        "Two, that even if so, it exposes our troops to that same brutal treatment.",
        "Yes.",
        "And that's why the Senate report probably won't be released is because it probably did encourage them to talk.",
        "And it therefore shows that it does work, and, therefore, our troops are going to be subject to it in a regular conflict.",
        "And the treatment that our troops receive from the terrorists, cutting off their heads is not going to change whether it works or we outlaw the techniques.",
