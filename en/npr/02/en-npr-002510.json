        "Ms. YOLANDA O'BANNON (Executive Assistant): I believe in being what I am instead of what sounds good to the rest of the world.",
        "Last year, I left a job I hated as a programmer for a job I love as an executive assistant, which is just a fancy word for secretary.",
        "I still feel a little embarrassed when people ask me about my new job.",
        "Not because of what I do, but because of what some people, including myself, have thought of secretaries.",
        "I had always thought that secretaries were nice and maybe competent, but not smart or strong or original.",
        "I have a Master's degree in English literature.",
        "I've interviewed the Dalai Lama and co-founded a nonprofit organization.",
        "People who know me wondered why I would go for what seemed to be such a dull and low status job.",
        "Even my new boss asked if I would be bored.",
        "Why would I want to be a secretary?",
        "Because it fits me like a glove.",
        "I get to do what I love best all day, which is organize things.",
        "I like the challenge of holding the focus on the top priorities in my boss's wildly busy schedule.",
        "I can function with a high degree of chaos.",
        "Untangling finances feels like playing detective to me.",
        "I find filing restful.",
        "The only hard part is dealing with my own and other people's stereotypes, and learning to focus on internal rewards rather than humble appearances.",
        "I admit that I feel vaguely embarrassed bringing the faculty lunch or serving coffee to my boss's visitors.",
        "But deep down I don't believe that serving food is humiliating.",
        "Really, I think of it as a practice in humility.",
        "My husband is Tibetan.",
        "In Tibetan communities, you serve each other tea as a form of respect.",
        "When I'm serving coffee at work, I imagine that I'm serving a monk.",
        "And I'm Robert Siegel.",
        "Yes, when they knocked on my door, I assumed they were just there to promote the military on Memorial Day morning.",
        "But as we soon came to find out, they were there for a different reason.",
        "Chloe was scared.",
        "She ran upstairs to her room.",
        "So I soon followed her and, you know, said that, you know, daddy had a big owie and the doctors weren't able to fix him.",
        "So now he's in heaven.",
        "And being four years old, she didn't quite understand that daddy wasn't coming back home.",
        "So that was something that we had to work on, those months to come, that we would bring back up.",
        "You know, she would say: Well, isn't daddy here yet?",
        "And I would have to say: No, remember, he had an owie, and he can't join us anymore, but we'll see him later.",
        "So that's something that a four-year-old can't quite process.",
        "But Chloe's now 10.",
        "Over the years we have rediscussed this."

        "In different terms, using different language and different - her understanding has become not terribly sophisticated at 10 but obviously more sophisticated than when she was a four-year-old.",
        "Exactly.",
        "She was probably five or six, then she would ask me: What happened to daddy?",
        "You know, how was he hurt?",
        "And so I could get into more details the older that she got.",
        "You know, I'm wondering how you had the instinct to deal with your daughter at that same moment that you were coping with your own terrible grief.",
        "How do you leave yourself behind for the moment and begin - and have the right instincts for helping a child cope with the loss?",
        "Well, I think as a mother, for one, you never want to intentionally harm your child, especially their emotional well-being.",
        "So for me I just knew what Chloe could handle at that moment, and being four, and not quite understanding what death was about - we had never lost anybody before Jeremy.",
        "So I just left it as very simple, just, you know, that it was just going to be the two of us now, and, you know, to work through that just on a daily basis with her.",
        "Jeremy was in Iraq for almost a year before he was killed.",
        "So we were kind of on our own already.",
        "But then just dealing with my own grief, I would let her see me cry.",
        "I was open about I was sad and I missed daddy and that she could be sad too and that it was OK to cry or to have a good day too, and to say you know what, I miss daddy, but I don't have to cry today, I can think of a happy moment that we remember.",
        "And I know she, as I understand it, you felt it was important that she go to the funeral as well, even though she was so young.",
        "Yes, she was my little companion.",
        "She went everywhere that I went, and I wanted her to see all the love and support that we had with all of our friends there, our family there.",
        "And even though it was a solemn day, and I don't think Chloe really understood what was going on, she knew that we were there because of daddy and that there was people there to support us.",
        "Now, it's been six years.",
        "You've remarried.",
        "Chloe's a little older.",
        "You know, it seems to me like the grief will - does the experience of grief change as the years go by?",
        "And how do you deal with whatever is going on with her developmentally at the same moment that she's perhaps experiencing her father's death in a different or new way as she gets older?",
        "Right, and as children grow up, they hit new milestones.",
        "And those milestones do reflect grief with Chloe.",
        "You know, as she's - actually was in her first rodeo last weekend.",
        "You know, she can think: Oh, I wish daddy would have seen me riding a horse because he knew how much I loved horses, you know.",
        "And I'm sure in the future when she graduates high school, when she gets married, when she has children of her own, she will, you know, think about the time that she was with Jeremy and remember those memories of having him.",
        "Does she talk about him?",
        "Does she remember him?"

        "She does talk about him.",
        "She has a hard time remembering because she was only four when he passed, but she remembers pictures that we have talked about and movies that she's seen of him.",
        "And just because he was such a vibrant part of our community, our small little town in Estacada, that people just, you know, talk about him, and she remembers things like that.",
        "So she just loves remembering things about him.",
        "Well, Melissa, thank you so much for sharing your story with us today.",
        "No problem.",
        "It was a pleasure.",

        "Donna, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "Now listening to Melissa's story, I'm really struck by the fact that an adult grieves - when an adult finds out that they've lost someone, they have a terrible sense of grief, but they're an adult, and they can process that information as an adult.",
        "But a child is going to find out that information and then go through so many different stages in life having to deal with that information.",
        "How do children different ages process grief?",
        "Well, I think one of the challenges is people use terminology like getting over it, putting this behind you, and those - that kind of terminology.",
        "And what they really need to do is continue to sort of make sense of what happened, the loss and how it impacts them, at different phases of their life.",
        "And as Melissa pointed out, Chloe will re-process and re-experience her father's loss from her life throughout her life at different times, at key times but sometimes just sitting around having ice cream."

        "And our society doesn't do a very good job of fostering remembering.",
        "So we tend to push people to move on, to forget, to put it behind you when really what they want to do is remember.",
        "They want to remember Jeremy and honor his memory, and that doesn't mean you can't still have other relationships and a productive life; it just means you don't have to forget in order to move forward constructively.",
        "How do you foster that kind of remembering, as opposed to maybe an unhealthy dwelling on the sadness - you know, remembering in a good, positive way, as opposed to something that can send you into a depression perhaps?",
        "Well, I think a lot of kids, one of the biggest needs they have is to know that they're not alone, they're not the only one this has happened to, it's, as Melissa said, again, it's OK to feel sad and it's OK to feel happy.",
        "So kids like to look at photo albums, to do things like oh let's go have a root beer float - remember, your dad loved root beer floats.",

        "And I don't find - you know, I think that most people are not dwelling in a negative way.",
        "I mean, I know when I die I want people to be sad, and I want them to remember me.",
        "I think most of us do.",
        "But we're in a society that's urging us to put it behind us, and I think that that actually is what complicates things for children and often makes it more difficult for them to grieve and mourn in healthy ways.",
        "Well, do you think there are sort of common misconceptions about how kids experience loss?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think one of the common misconceptions, and I hear this frequently: Oh, they'll get over it.",
        "Kids are resilient.",
        "And they're not resilient in a vacuum.",
        "We know with all of the studies that have been done on resilience that there are factors that contribute to resilience, like feeling understood, having opportunities for expression, being part of a community, having positive role models of adults, specifically parents or parent figures, but other adults as well who model healthy grieving.",
