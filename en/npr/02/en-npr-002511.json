        "It wasn't dumbed down for a child.",
        "It was pretty straightforward which helped me because I had a brother who was four years younger than me.",
        "So it kind of gave me a sense of strength that I could be strong, you know, because my brother was not going to be able to take it the same way.",
        "Right, and did that help you as you got older, the fact that you had been able to deal with it that honestly at the age of 12, that then as you got older, do you think it helped you come to terms what occurred?",
        "Yeah, I mean, being able to, you know, stand kind of strong for my brother, and it was - I came to understand it as I was 12 that, you know, as your guest said, you're not alone.",
        "This is going to happen to everybody.",
        "So it kind of put things in perspective early on, and I think that's helped me with a lot of different things in my life.",
        "You know, there's tragedy that happens every day to everybody, and it's kind of something you have to hold your head high and take.",
        "Well Garret, thanks so much for calling.",
        "Thank you, it's a great discussion.",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "I'd just like to underscore the importance of what Garret just shared, which really is that please don't dumb things down for kids.",
        "They constantly say we want the truth, we want it honestly even when it's difficult.",
        "In the 20-some years that I've been listening to kids talk about how adults have interacted with them after a death, I literally never have heard one say I'm really glad they lied to me, or I'm glad they withheld really important information.",
        "But we hear all the time from kids they didn't respect me enough to tell me the truth, and that makes it even more difficult.",
        "Yeah, and you've also said that often adults sort of may underestimate or not understand, not give kids credit for what they can fully understand in a difficult situation like that."

        "Exactly.",
        "They are trying to make meaning of it in their developmental age, but they want to have the details as they ask for them.",
        "You know, and they can handle it.",

        "And I think it's difficult, often because we don't want to see our children hurt.",
        "But again in this day and age, with Twitter and all of the social media, it's very hard, if not impossible, to keep secrets like it might have been possible 50 years ago.",
        "So the reality is they probably know more than we think they know anyway.",
        "Let me ask you this: There are so many different personalities in the world.",
        "There's as many people - personalities as there are people.",
        "And people may grieve differently.",

        "There are certainly healthier ways or unhealthier ways, but often the unhealthy ways happen because they're not receiving the kind of support they need.",
        "But everybody does grieve differently based on the kind of relationship they had, unresolved issues.",
        "You know, the last conversation I had with my dad wasn't a good one, and now I can never make it better.",
        "Was I somehow responsible?",
        "All kinds of issues that they wonder about.",
        "And what seems to be important is that they feel that they're not alone, someone understands what they're going through and that they have opportunities for expression.",
        "Every child will differ based on their own personality and a lot of other issues as to how they actually express that.",
        "Some kids are talkers; some aren't.",
        "Some kids express themselves better through music, through art.",
        "At the Dougy Center, we have a room called the Volcano Room, and it's just an active room where you can get energy out.",
        "It's a playroom where you can get all that tension expressed out of your body like you would on a playground.",
        "So we have kids at the Dougy Center who don't ever really talk all that much, but they might draw profoundly.",
        "And listening also is part of it.",
        "So there isn't a formula for this other than helping children know they're not alone, that they're supported and that they have opportunities for expression."

        "And I saw that it had a huge impact on him throughout his entire life to the extent that he didn't understand the complexities of an adult-child relationship with their parent.",
        "When things would get complicated, my brother might want to distance himself, or I might want to distance myself, or I wasn't calling, you know, as frequently as he would like.",
        "He couldn't understand that because, you know, as a 10-year-old idolizes and worships their father, and then he didn't have that, and so that's where he got stuck as far as a relationship between a parent and a child.",
        "And so as a parent, you know, he expected his children to be like a 10-year-old.",
        "Interesting.",
        "What do you make - what's your reaction to that, Donna?",
        "Well, I think it's an incredibly important piece of information, which we use terminology that I don't think really applies, like unresolved loss.",
        "I'm more interested in terminology that says unaddressed because I don't think there's a magic moment where it's all tied up and resolved.",
        "I don't think most of us would have to look very far in our family trees to find among our parents and other relatives, there was a baby that died in between my brother and I, and we never spoke about it, but my mother was always depressed; or my father, as you said, my father lost his father when he was a child.",

        "I think, again, one of the things that accomplish - is accomplished through those camps is kids actually get to have fun with each other even though they've all had a tragic loss or losses in their lives, and they get to be able to know they're not alone.",
        "There are also programs.",
        "There's a National Alliance for Grieving Children that has a listing on their website of hundreds of programs that reach out to children and their families throughout the country that are - some are independent.",
