        "The new law no longer allows taxpayers to write off more than $10,000 of state and local income and property taxes from their federal returns or, as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo put it in his annual State of the State address Wednesday...",

        "As Washington has shot an arrow aimed at New York state's economic heart, the best plan is to get out of the way before it hits.",
        "New York along with California, Massachusetts and other large blue states have some of the highest taxes in property prices, so they'll feel the brunt of the loss of state and local tax deductions, also called SALT deductions.",
        "Democrats like Cuomo and California Assembly Budget Chairman Phil Ting say Republicans in Washington targeted their states.",
        "They went out of their way to really penalize our taxpayers.",
        "So we're really looking at ways as how we can mitigate that for our tax base, and we're looking at a variety of proposals.",
        "Some that might sound pretty zany - Cuomo says New York is looking to shift from income taxes to a new payroll tax, which businesses could still deduct but would probably require employees to take lower pre-tax salaries.",
        "In California, state Senate leader Kevin de Leon has a proposal for taxpayers to give to a new state-run charitable fund in exchange for a refund on state income taxes.",

        "It's not the best way to go.",
        "Now, some of the rhetoric on this issue might have you thinking the loss of SALT deductions would hit every man, woman and child right in the tax return.",
        "But only about a third of filers claim SALT deductions.",
        "They're largely higher-income households, and the new tax law benefits them in other ways.",
        "Frank Sammartino of the non-partisan Tax Policy Center says most of those people will still pay less overall next year.",
        "It's just that relative to someone in a low-tax state, their tax cut might be smaller.",
        "And that's the real fear for leaders of high-cost states.",
        "With the loss of the SALT deduction, a state like California is now even more costly for higher-income taxpayers in comparison to a bordering state, like Nevada, which has no income tax.",
        "Some California Republicans are weighing whether they would support Democratic proposals to avoid the hit.",
        "State Senator John Moorlach doesn't rule it out."

        "Well, the idea is that, first of all, there is a similar technique in humans.",
        "It's called pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, at least the similar technique of taking a single cell from an embryo.",
        "And if that works in hu--I mean, if this could be shown to work in humans--and it has not; they can do the cell sampling but they haven't run the stem cells--but if it should be shown to work in humans, the idea is, well, you've got an intact embryo that's still capable of going on to produce a baby.",
        "And so if you're only taking one cell from the embryo, you're not harming the embryo.",
        "And so suddenly the whole notion that you can only get embryonic stem cells by destroying an embryo goes away, you can get them and still let the embryo go on and survive.",
        "Well, is that approach likely to satisfy people who have criticized and resisted this kind of research?",
        "Well, to some I think it would actually.",
        "But there's still some issues to consider.",
        "First of all, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is a procedure that's used for couples who have a known history of genetic disease.",
        "And there's still some risk.",
        "It's been used, but there's still possibly some risk of taking a single cell from a developing embryo.",
        "And it's not clear what kind of a risk that is.",
        "Plus, that single cell, while it has been removed and can generate stem cells, in some sense still has the potential to become an embryo itself and therefore a potential life.",
        "And so people who are opposed to taking potential lives of embryos might still be opposed to this.",
        "But, see, the whole thing here is people have been trying to come up with an interesting way around this problem of destroying an embryo, and there's another paper also in the current issue of Nature that talks about using a genetic manipulation, a combination of genetic manipulation and cloning to create embryos--this is again in mice--to create embryos that do not have the potential to grow into a mouse but still can be used to harvest embryonic stem cells."

        "So people would not be creating fresh life, which people would also object to...",
        "That's right.",
        "But the problem here is that we have the famous buzzword `cloning,' which immediately raises alarm bells.",
        "And if you think about it, it's a procedure that's OK for mice, and people haven't objected to cloned mice, but what about the notion that you're cloning a human embryo, but you're specially cloning it in a way that you know it will be defective?",
        "So cloning a defective embryo, defective in the sense that it can't turn into a baby, that has some people on edge.",
        "And yeah, at the same time--and this is why the debate is so tricky--some people have suggested this cloning defective embryos or cloning non-reproductively competent embryos as a way around the debate because they say, `Look, if we're making an embryo that can't turn into a baby, we're not destroying it if we take stem cells from it.'",
        "So two possible ways around this impasse...",
        "Right.",
        "...over embryonic stem cell research--can you just remind us very briefly of what the stakes are in finding some way around that?",
        "Well, I think the reason, first of all, it's become such a debate is that the scientific community has embraced embryonic stem cells, in a way, as a potential for treating diseases.",
        "Few things have generated this kind of interest.",
        "And so they're very keen, scientists are very keen to study these cells, see if they can develop the therapies that people think they can, and so they're trying to find ethical ways around the objections that some have raised to the research.",
