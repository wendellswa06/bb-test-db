        "I think he himself is still deliberating on this option, trying to weigh up what is the price of saying no to the American proposal, and what is the price of saying yes to it?",
        "At the end of his last meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Secretary Kerry said the leaders are not giving up.",
        "He said, despite criticism from their supporters, there's been enough progress in the negotiations to encourage the two leaders to keep talking.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Daniel Estrin in Jerusalem.",
        "Last week, President Bush signed a bill into law that gives Capitol architects two years to erect a statue of Rosa Parks.",
        "The statue will stand in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, where many of America's greatest heroes are honored.",
        "Commentator John McCann says while moralizing Parks in stone or bronze is a nice gesture, but he says the best way for African-Americans to pay tribute to civil rights leaders is by taking action.",
        "If I was smart, I'd have figured out a way to get naming rights for every boulevard, avenue, side street and cul-de-sac tacked to America's most famous civil rights leaders.",
        "I live right off of the Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway in Durham, North Carolina, and just recently, a quadruple homicide took place right off that road.",
        "Police believe it was drug related.",
        "Now that's not what you call honoring Dr. King.",
        "The only connection is what an assassin's bullet did to him, which means there's no inherent power in the symbolism evoked by asphalt arteries and tall monuments and granite markers erected to pay homage to our fallen heroes and sheroes.",
        "They're nice gestures and all, but they don't stop us from acting stupid, don't stop black people from killing each other and getting high and all that mess.",
        "So I can't say I'm all that thrilled about Rosa Parks getting honored in Washington, DC, with a statue of her likeness at the Capitol's Statuary Hall.",
        "I'm not hating on Rosa Parks, not doing like Cedric the Entertainer's character Eddie in the \"\"Barbershop\"\" movie who says something like, `Rosa Parks wasn't that special, just tired.",
        "We know better than that, don't we?",
        "Ms. Parks doing something as simple as remaining seated on a bus seat is why a whole bunch of black folks have since been able to sit their butts in chairs in some of the finest universities in America, sit inside boardrooms, the head of their business.",
        "You feel me?",
        "But our memories are short.",

        "I'm thinking about a situation near Atlanta in Clayton County, Georgia, and a street called Tara Boulevard, named after the plantation home in the movie \"\"Gone with the Wind.\"\" There's been a push to rename Tara Boulevard after Rosa Parks, and all it's done is create racial drama, as you can imagine.",
        "And it's unnecessary, because what good is changing the name of a road if the hearts of the people who live on the road have remained the same?",
        "To that end, if the government is as racist as many black people claim it is, what's the good in so-called handkerchief-headed politicians agreeing to put up statues of black pioneers?",

        "So how unusual is it to be the reverse, where the sperm donor actually wants to be a part of the child's life?",
        "It's very unusual.",
        "Because most sperm donors are anonymous sperm donors and they surrender their paternal rights when they become these anonymous sperm donors.",
        "And they generally don't want to know anything or have any involvement with their children later.",
        "Increasingly, we have these cases of what are called known sperm donors, as in this case with Mr. Hendricks, where he knows the women he's giving his sperm to.",
        "And in those cases, there are all kinds of weird complicated legal issues that arise.",
        "So, it's not really that surprising that we should get someone suing to have paternal rights.",
        "So in this case, if the court decides to overturn this law, then could it potentially affect anonymous sperm donors who perhaps have not - don't want the right and responsibilities?",
        "I don't think it will affect anonymous sperm donors.",
        "Because anonymous sperm donors write this very clear contract in which they give up their paternal rights.",
        "And I think the problem here is that it assumes that silence means you don't want to be a father.",
        "I don't think it has anything to do with what happens when you make this active affirmative effort, as anonymous sperm donors do, to say they don't want to be a father.",
        "So I don't think people who are going to be anonymous sperm donors need to worry about that they're now going to get sued for custody.",

        "So what is the law in most other states?",
        "In most other states, the law is, if you go to a sperm bank and you make a very formal statement of surrendering your paternal rights to become a sperm donor, you don't have paternal obligations to support the child.",
        "And if there is a husband who is the father of the woman who bears the child, he assumes the paternal rights automatically, even though he's not the biological father of the child.",
        "And then when there are these cases of private agreements where a woman would go to a man to get him to be her sperm donor, that sperm donor is assumed to be the father unless he writes a contract with a lawyer in which he surrenders the paternal rights.",
        "David, have you ever heard of - you know, when you were doing research for your book, did you ever come across women who were concerned that there would be sperm donors coming out of the woodwork, saying, hey, you know what, I do want to be a part of this child's life?",

        "All the time I come across women who are afraid that the sperm donor would enter their lives.",

        "It was very, very ugly.",
        "You know, this is a fraught new territory we're entering.",
        "So I think we have the problem of families where women don't want the sperm donor playing a role, and then we also have families of sperm donors who don't want to be bothered by their children.",
        "And I think what's happening is there's a huge push for children to have the right to know who their genetic father is and to get certain kinds of medical information and genetic information about him.",
        "And I think in both cases the adults had better face up to the fact that they're going to be connected to these children, to these families, whether they like it or not, that these genetic demands in the kind of new legal environment are making it possible for everyone to get connected, even when they didn't want to be connected to begin with.",
