        "And Europeans actually like most of those reforms when they think about them concretely.",
        "Yet in a debate about the constitution in France, it got a solid no vote.",
        "It did, because when people get into a referendum context, they don't very often vote on the picayune details of constitutional revision, but a lot of broader fears and ideals and interest get washed up in it.",
        "So the striking story of every referendum and very European election that's ever been held is that the voting behavior, the motivations of independent voters, individual voters, don't tend to have much to do with the concrete issues at stake.",
        "Or that maybe the issues at stake weren't explained properly or sold properly to them.",
        "Well, there's that, but it's rather difficult to explain something as detailed as this constitution.",
        "One has to remember that the European Union really doesn't deal very much with the issues that are of most interest to your average voter in an average European country--social welfare provision, health care, pensions, taxing and spending, education, even immigration that was an issue in these campaigns.",
        "These are not dealt with, for the most part, by the European Union; they're deal with by the member states.",
