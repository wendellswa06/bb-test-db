        "And, of course, we are all aware of what the opinion polls predict.",
        "But I would like to say that a negative vote would be another setback, but I don't think that that setback should be overdramatized.",
        "We had setbacks in the past and every time, after a setback, there was a kind of a period of reflection which followed, and then we started again going forward.",
        "It's a bit like a mighty river with water sometimes running high, sometimes running low through one channel or another, but it always flows.",
        "The previous treaties, which would have been superceded by the EU Constitution--but they called for an ever-closer union.",
        "Has the process toward an ever-closer union--is that one of the things that has to be reconsidered?",
        "No.",
        "I think that that the existing treaties say exactly that and the constitution was an expression of that.",
        "Now, of course, there are problems with ratification of that constitution, but that does not mean that we are not going for an ever-closer union.",
        "I don't think that you consider the votes which have taken place as votes against Europe.",
        "I think over and beyond whatever domestic reasons there may have been, basically there are segments in the public opinion who may think that maybe we have gone too far too fast, but that does not mean that they do not want to follow that direction, and other bodies of opinion who think that maybe we should build another type of Europe than the one we are having, and that's often related to the ...(unintelligible) of globalization and the way economic policies should be implemented."

        "And if you were to think for a moment about how a new document or where this reconsideration might lead, what do you think the future holds?",

        "And in between certainly, there will have been a lot of thinking on what we could and might do.",
        "Yet even on a practical level, a pro-EU politician like Britain's Tony Blair, who just won re-election much more narrowly than he had in the past--but is he likely to take the political risk to campaign for an EU Constitution that's already been defeated in France and perhaps the Netherlands?",

        "There are a lot of things on Europe's agenda, and for the foreseeable future it'll be better off to focus on pragmatic, quiet steps that make European policy-making more effective and not on the theatrical schemes like the constitution.",

        "And there is definitely a contradiction there, and there's obviously a very big split in Europe between a general sort of Anglo-Saxon desire to liberalize and a lot of French people, like your previous caller, who aren't enthusiastic.",
        "I would say, though, there is one sort of core element of agreement between all those bits, which is that most people in that consortium of the no tend to think that too much power was being sucked towards Brussels and not enough was being given to national determination, the balance which Andrew talked about is still key to Europe."
