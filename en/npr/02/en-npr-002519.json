        "I'm from Germany originally.",
        "I've been living in the United States for 25 years, but I go back frequently, and I can see economically, if they don't go together right now, it will be too late.",
        "Well, Andrew Moravcsik, let's ask about that.",
        "If this interrupts what had looked like sort of an inexorable process, does that mean it's going to be too late?",
        "I don't think it's healthy for Europe.",
        "There's going to be a lot of hand-ringing, a lot of name calling, a lot of blame shifting about this political catastrophe, and people are going to have to get over that.",
        "And the hope is--and I think it is a reasonable hope--that within a year or two, you're going to start moving toward more pragmatic policy-making, whether the EU's going to go back toward a modest agenda of economic liberalization, and the member states--and this is perhaps even more important, I'm sure Mr. Micklethwait would agree--will move toward reform of some of the issues that they maintain control over, like labor market regulations, like the fiscal spending on social policy--things like that.",
        "And Europe has not been doing as badly economically as it's made out to be, but still, there's a lot of reform to be done, and hopefully, this political car wreck will lead people to refocus on the really essential substantive issues facing Europe."

People really openly came out and said, you know, `I don't want the Turks in the union.",

        "And where things get ugly in history is when there's an overall consensus in the country that the immigration system is broken, which I think we have now.",
