        "And secondly, it's interesting that we're kind of looking at the deficit, you know, getting rid of those who are not capable, when I think the larger issue is how are we developing quality teachers?",
        "How are we committed to developing leadership within the school community?",

        "Should those teachers be retrained or should they just be let go?",
        "I would suggest, first of all, that we focus on the good teachers.",
        "Those teachers always get ignored when we bring up this discussion, which is very politically popular, but doesn't really treat the situation that's actually happening in the school.",
        "There are so many absolutely wonderful, excellent teachers who are doing their jobs, whose students are passing the tests, who need to be supported and encouraged and rewarded.",
        "And if we focus more on those teachers and give them more support and give them more of what they need, we could help those teachers that are struggling or who are a little bit crispy on the end.",
        "We could also take that cadre of very strong, very good teachers, and work with the new teachers as they are coming in to the profession.",
        "But politics ignores good teachers.",
        "Only the teachers that are not performing well--we focus on the negatives rather than on the positives.",
        "And I want to make sure that all those teachers that need to be supported and encouraged and rewarded, that happens for them.",
        "But, Sharon, when push comes to shove, shouldn't school systems be able to fire bad teachers the same way that people are fired in jobs of many different types?",

        "And I think one of the ways they're trying to do it is through transparency.",
        "They signed contracts, everybody who has a significant position in the government signs a contract with the president himself every year for what their plans are for that year.",
        "Are they going to, you know - another 10,000 pounds of potatoes or they're going to add another nurse to dispensary.",
        "And at the end of the year, it's a time of reckoning.",
        "It's a time of bragging, or it's a time of we got to restructure, or maybe it's a time you're going to be replaced.",
        "Talking about reconciliation though, I would - I understand that some of the perpetrators of the genocide are living side by side with the victims.",

        "It is just unbelievable that you could not only live side by side, but actually interact.",
        "And those who have been working through the process, Rwandans themselves are working with other Rwandans to just even sit in a room - there's a really good documentary called \"\"As We Forgive,\"\" that kind of give little insights into - into this personal efforts at reconciliation.",
        "A big change in Rwanda since the genocide has been the increased role of women.",
        "Oh yeah.",
        "Women account 70 percent, I understand, they account for the population, the post-genocide population.",
        "Talk about their impact.",
        "There is huge participation that is being facilitated by the government for women.",
        "And I stop and think often about many of the leaders and I don't know - the different prejudices, the different struggling we have with tolerance and things like that, I think they're really on the good road in terms of, you know, proactively bringing women into a more active role in Rwanda."
