        "I think the rest of us probably do, but he was a - you can - the glee just sort of shines through Ray's prose.",

        "No, he could write terror, but he did even that with a sort of a glad hand.",
        "Anyway, I'm - well, it's a heck of a way to learn that a pal of yours has passed on.",
