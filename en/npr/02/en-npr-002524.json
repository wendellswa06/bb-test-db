        "Is there going to be some process of bargaining in California to try to improve the education system, but are teachers willing to give on any of these points?",
        "Well, you know, that is such a political hot-button.",
        "I'm sure there's going to be some sort of agreements between the governor and the unions, but, you know, that's the problem, I think, is that we're centering all this in a political arena, making decisions based upon political expediency and support, rather than on what is best for our students.",
        "It seems to me that both the unions, both the--all the stakeholders--unions, boards of educations, the governor, all legislators--should be focusing on the student and what's best for them, not on the political leverage that they can gain by making a particular deal.",
        "That goes along with the suit that's going on with the union suing the governor over the funding.",
        "We need to break through those walls and pull education out of the political area and work for the benefit of our students.",
        "That is the most important aspect.",
        "And I don't understand why all our stakeholders can't come to the table and can't be focusing on that aspect of teaching.",

        "We're able to take our veteran teachers--we actually give them additional training and coaching techniques, working with adults, and link them with a new teacher, and that is paying great dividends for us and allowing us to grow some quality teachers and, at the same time, actually--in some cases, it actually pumps up the quality of our veteran teachers, because now they see some of the--maybe it's the little holes that they have in their own instruction.",

        "So I don't think it's the combination of age groups that we put together, but I think what's more important is the way that the school is done.",
        "If we have a middle school, where the kids are just warehoused and there's no support, there's no nurturing, there's nothing that can help them to grow as individuals as well as learn the academic materials, then that school is going to fail.",

        "That transition between elementary school to middle school is just harsh.",
        "Like dealing with--you know, sixth grade, you have a lot more freedom, more classes, more teachers, and I just think that the blow can be lessened if we went to a K-through-eighth school.",
        "It just seems like teachers, in those particular settings, are a lot more comfortable with the students and there's a better relationship.",
        "Just that jump, it's just too stark.",
        "It's just a little too hard to jump from fifth to sixth.",
        "And, Joseph, let me ask you, you're working with new teachers, trying to develop their skills.",
        "Yeah.",
        "One of the things that I've heard from many different teachers is that they are expected, particularly in middle school, to be social workers, not just to be teachers.",

        "All of these issues are really coming into play in the middle school years.",

        "Well, I think that, to be quite frank and after 10 years at the middle school as a teacher, I can tell you that the middle school student is quite--a little bit crazy, because of the hormones that course through their body.",
        "However, with our new teachers, we have to let them know that they're teaching the whole person, and if there are issues that get in the way of their learning, then we must deal with those issues.",
        "And, you know, just to say, `Well, the student is here in my class.",

        "There's a certain quality to an effective middle school teacher that recognizes the challenges of that student, who recognizes, as Jarell said, the transitional problems that exist, and are willing to work with that child.",
        "I think the middle school years are more about the social, more about attitudes, quite frankly, than it is the content.",
