        "It's a separate class not included in American history classes.",
        "First off, do you think California needs to institute mandatory classes in ethnic history, and should this type of history be included in the typical history classes or should it be a separate class?",
        "Well, I think there's no doubt that the African-American history, along with the Native American and the Hispanic cultures--all those cultures need to be included and our children need to understand the richness that exists in California and all over the United States.",
        "In California, we have specific standards by which the teachers must address in order to receive a final clear professional credential, and one of those is to look at the cultures of their students and to address their specific needs and to recognize and build upon the cultural backgrounds of the students so that they can be more successful.",

        "Well - I don't - it's - it might be a stretch to call it political satire, but certainly Evelyn Waugh's \"\"Scoop\"\" is the book that I kind of keep close by.",
        "And when I despair - which I do about every quarter-hour - I pick that up and sort of read a few pages.",
        "Yeah, I suppose you could think of it as a political satire, but...",

        "Well, the reason why I took my shirt off was because I was using my shirt as a mask for the tear gas out there.",

        "And I felt like - that we had to maintain our protest even in the midst of all that pain.",

        "So it was helping you?",

        "And a fellow city council member said, where's the evidence?",
        "If you don't have evidence of this, then bringing that up and questioning the police in such a way could be really counterproductive.",
        "I mean, do you have evidence?",
        "I am glad that we're going to have an open trial because, like I said - like it's been said, I believe in our Sixth and Seventh Amendment rights to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that somebody is guilty.",
        "I have not accused anybody or of anything.",
        "But you've left open the door that police might've killed this man.",
        "I think your fellow council member is saying that's - as a city council member, that's not - it's not productive to leave that idea that the police did something dangling if you don't - if you're not sure.",
        "And I wonder if you see where she's coming from.",
        "I don't think I'm - right.",
