        "So let's start with a very, very basic primer, a little bit more on the actual term containment, which means what?",
        "Well, containment was a term that was used to describe the American goal in dealing with communist Soviet Union, basically to prevent Soviet Russia from using its military forces to conquer directly or assume indirect control of the countries that bordered along it and integrate those countries into its power bloc.",
        "And so talk about containing a nuclear Iran is really to adapt the term, to adapt the historical usage of the term, but it has become sort of a lexicon for how one would deal with an Iran that has crossed a point of no return with respect to its nuclear weapons capabilities.",
        "So to take a minute longer - a moment longer on the Soviet model, as you describe it, it was to keep Soviet - communism from spreading.",
        "It was not to control the spread of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons, per se, and... Go ahead.",
        "It was to contain the spread of Soviet influence, really, Soviet influence and domination.",
        "And I think that is why you typically hear about containment with reference to Iran and Iran's presumed bid for regional hegemony - that an Iran with a nuclear weapon would be attempting to assert its influence across the region.",
        "And so our concerns about a nuclear Iran would not simply be, would such a government user or potentially transfer a nuclear weapon to one of its terrorist proxies, but how would it influence the behavior of the Iranian regime in - with respect to conflicts in Lebanon, with respect to the Arab-Israeli conflict and with respect to the oil markets and the export of petroleum from the Gulf.",
        "And now with Iran, it's being posited as an alternative, very much so, as an alternative to direct military action to stop their program.",
        "Although again, going back to the Soviet model, it didn't stop war.",
        "I mean, the - we fought wars but not - such as the Vietnam War and the Korean War to stop the spread of communist influence - but the idea was that containment was an alternative to all-out, head-on-head war with the Soviets.",
        "Is that correct?"

        "I think that's correct.",
        "I mean, the idea of containment can really vary depending on, you know, what the model is and what the context is.",
        "And so one can look at a soft containment that might be simply preventing Iran from invading its neighbors to a much more aggressive containment, which would involve efforts to fully isolate and cordon off any attempts by Iran to influence those other countries around it.",
        "But as we're using the term now, containment, as I said in the introduction, actually means containment of a nuclear Iran.",
        "It means that we accept - we now, ahead of time, accept that we're going to have to deal with a nuclear Iran.",
        "It's an alternative to trying to stop them from having nuclear weapons.",
        "Well, let me just clarify that I don't think containment is anyone's preferred option, and I think that what the administration has described about both the window of opportunity for diplomacy and the focus of this administration's - and frankly all prior U.S.",
        "administrations' - strategy on preventing Iran from achieving a weapons capability, a nuclear weapons capability, is absolutely the most appropriate one.",
        "But I do think that it is a considerable problem in our strategic thinking, in our strategic discourse, particularly for a country that has now experienced more than a decade of war in two separate arenas in the greater Middle East, to not be able to even contemplate or discuss publicly what a sort of containment strategy might look like and how we might approach that.",
        "How might we, and what might it look like?",
        "Well, I think there would be a number of different options.",
        "There would certainly be a military dimension, although one can argue that we already have the basic building blocks of a military containment strategy in place with respect to our tremendous relationships across all of the region, as well as prepositioning of materiel and American troops in the Gulf and as well as all - really ringing Iran.",
        "There is a strategic and an economic dimension of containment, and again, I think we have components of some of that policy already in place.",
        "And finally there would be a diplomatic dimension and an attempt to sort of create a really robust framework for U.S.",
        "policy and for maintaining an alliance of countries to deal with a nuclear Iran that would also, I think, have to extend to the provision of explicit security guarantees to some of those allies, most particularly Israel but potentially also some of the Gulf countries.",
        "So, you know, these are the sorts of elements of the containment strategy that one might think about, but once again, we need to keep the focus on preventing the program.",
        "Yeah, and I do understand you're saying what the president is saying as preventing them from getting it in the first place, although he doesn't seem at this point to be talking nearly as overtly as the Israelis about the need for military action, he's reserving that option.",
        "But I want to bring you back to the notion of trying to make containment work when I think the perception is that if containment was what was successful with the Soviets, it was partly based on the reality that the Soviets weren't suicidal.",
        "They didn't - they were - it was made clear to them that if they launched a nuclear attack, they would receive a nuclear attack, and we were banking on their rationality and their similarity to us."
