        "And the conversation seems to involve here the notion that the Iranians aren't like that, that containment wouldn't work because the Iranians wouldn't make those sorts of calculations.",
        "What about that thought?",
        "Well, there is a certain presumption that exists, that somehow the Iranian regime is not wholly rational, that its relationships with terrorist proxies and organizations that we have deemed terrorist would make it a much greater risk.",
        "Don't you see that your children, who is the future of Rwanda, when he goes back, he is going to be the slave of those who are there because he is illiterate.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Beaches and beam.",
        "But I would argue that there is no evidence that the Iranian regime, over the course of now 33 years, has engaged in suicidal behavior.",
        "In fact, basically at every point, the Iranian regime has hedged its bets, has sacrificed its ideological constraints in order to preserve the regime and to preserve its strategic capabilities.",
        "And so as a result, you know, even after eight years of war with Iraq, a war that the founder of the revolution said would not be over until the Islamic Republic had taken Saddam Hussein and taken Baghdad, the Iranians agreed to accept a ceasefire and live with a very unpromising outcome to that war, simply because it was a necessity for them.",
        "So this is a regime that can calculate costs and benefits and act in a rational manner.",
        "All right, I want to bring in Matthew Kroenig to the conversation.",
        "He is a Stanton Nuclear Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and assistant professor of government at Georgetown.",
        "He joins us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Matthew, thanks for joining us on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "What Suzanne is basically saying is that - and she makes it clear that, like the president, she thinks the best outcome at the present moment is prevention of the Iranians having success at gaining a nuclear weapon - but in making the case for containment being at least a reasonable way, a reasonable accommodation of potential reality, she says that it could work.",
        "I want to ask you, do you think that a strategy of containment could work with Iran?"

        "Well, containment has an aura of respectability because it is seen to have worked during the Cold War.",
        "But, you know, let's be very clear about what we're talking about here.",
        "We're talking about simply acquiescing to an Iranian nuclear capability, and a nuclear-armed Iran would pose a grave threat to international peace and security, it would likely lead to further proliferation in the Middle East, as other countries in the region try to get nuclear weapons in response.",
        "Iran itself would likely become a nuclear supplier, potentially transferring sensitive nuclear material to U.S.",
        "enemies, states, and possibly even terrorist groups.",
        "Iran would probably be more aggressive.",
        "Right now, we think Iran restrains its foreign policy because it fears a massive military retaliation.",
        "With nuclear weapons, it could feel free to push harder, stepping its support to terrorist groups and coercive diplomacy in the region.",
        "So this could an even more crisis-prone region.",
        "And if Iran and additional states in the region have nuclear weapons, any one of these crises could result in nuclear war.",
        "And experts estimate that Iran could have delivery vehicles capable of reaching the east coast of the United States within about five years.",
        "So in the future, one of these crises could result in a nuclear detonation on the American homeland.",
        "So a nuclear-armed Iran is very dangerous.",
        "If they got nuclear weapons, we could in place a deterrence and containment regime, as she suggests, but, you know, again, this is talking about a massive increase of U.S.",
        "political and military commitments in the region.",
        "So this would mean signing formal security guarantees with Saudi, other Gulf states and Israel, extending our nuclear umbrella over those countries as we did during the Cold War.",
        "And so again, let's call a spade a spade.",
        "What we're talking about doing here is fighting a nuclear war on behalf of Saudi Arabia, on behalf of Gulf states, on behalf of Israel.",
        "I'm not sure that that's something that the American public is willing to commit to.",
        "So it's a dangerous option.",
        "Matthew - we're talking about Iran with Matthew Kroenig and Suzanne Maloney, and we also want to bring you into the conversation.",
        "The question is: Do you think that containment could work with Iran at a time when the president has ruled that off the table?",

        "We're talking about Iran and the possibility of containment as a policy.",
        "President Obama today stressed that diplomacy, he believes, can still resolve the crisis over Iran's nuclear ambitions, but if that does not work, and if Iran does some day, and against international efforts, develop nuclear weapons, do you think that containment would work with Iran?",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",
        "Our email address is talk@npr.org.",
        "And you can also join the conversation at our website.",

        "State Department and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution; and Matthew Kroenig, Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and an assistant professor of government at Georgetown University.",
        "And Matthew Kroenig, before the break, you were talking about the great threat that a nuclear Iran could pose in its ability to actually push back now in a way that it can't without nuclear weapons and even its possibility, potentially, to reach the North American continent with ballistic missiles."

        "And what I want to put to you is the example of North Korea, where potentially - again, these things are true with North Korea, and with North Korea, we didn't quite have the debate and the discussion and perhaps the option to do something about it militarily ahead of time in the same way that's being discussed now.",
        "But in what way are we able to tolerate a nuclear North Korea in a way that would be different from a nuclear Iran?",
        "Well, I think if nuclear North Korea as a model for a what a nuclear Iran would look like we should be very concerned.",
        "Since acquiring nuclear weapons, North Korea has transferred sensitive nuclear technology to Syria and possibly to Burma and other states.",
        "They've arguably been more aggressive vis-a-vis South Korea, attacking a South Korean warship recently.",
        "And North Korea has only had nuclear weapons for a couple of years.",
        "It conducted its first test in 2006.",
        "And so we haven't seen the full range of consequences from a nuclear-armed North Korea.",
        "North Korea could have nuclear weapons for decades.",
        "In fact, there's only been one country historically to voluntarily give up nuclear weapons, so when you're talking about proliferation to Iran or North Korea, you're talking about a threat that the United States is going to have to live with potentially for decades or longer.",
        "So we could still have a nuclear exchange with North Korea.",
        "So I think looking at the North Korea model gives me reason to be very concerned about proliferation in Iran.",

        "We've received some emails from listeners, and I just want to share a few of those.",

        "When it comes to projecting power, we are not innocent.",

        "The difference between Iran and the containment countries today is that they are not filled with religious groups hell-bent on destroying America.",
        "There should be no way that Iran or any other nation, equally unstable, should ever have nuclear weapons.",
        "And there actually is a name on this one.",
        "That's from David(ph) in New York.",
        "And Matthew, Suzanne had made the point that - against the argument that essentially - I mean, to put it bluntly and rudely but in a way I think everybody will understand, that the Iranian leadership is insane, is not sane.",
        "She actually pushes back and says that they show a great deal of rationality, reasoned self-interest, commitment to life, their own lives, and their perpetuation, and they are not suicidal.",
        "Can you take on that perspective, that they're as reasonable as the Soviets had been?",
        "I think this is actually a point that we basically agree on.",
        "For all the inflammatory rhetoric, Iran has been fairly pragmatic in terms of its foreign policy since 1979.",
        "So I don't think that they would get nuclear weapons and immediately launch a suicidal nuclear war.",
        "But that said, I still think that there is a lot to worry about with a nuclear-armed Iran, even if they're not suicidal.",
        "After all, the United States wasn't suicidal during the Cold War, but we were willing to risk nuclear war a number of times in crises with the Soviet Union, and we came very close to a nuclear exchange."

        "The history of the Middle East is quite different, and I think there is a considerable risk of a kind of cascadive proliferation, but that risk exists today simply because of the, you know, advances that the Iranians have made over the course of the past decade, since the initial discovery of the covert enrichment program back in 2002.",
        "They have continued to enrich.",
        "They have continued to expand their capabilities, and, you know, the difficulty is that at this stage, none of the U.S.",
        "allies in the region trust American or Israeli promises that the program will - can be forestalled.",
        "They are quite convinced throughout the Gulf that the Iranians will achieve some sort of a nuclear capability, and so arguably, we are already seeing the very early stages of that kind of cascadive proliferation, and I don't think that it's possible to set back the clock in that respect.",

        "You know, the question and the validity and the utility of containment needs to be assessed against the other alternatives if and when Iran crosses the nuclear weapons threshold, which is: Do you prefer another war in the Middle East and the implications of another war in the Middle East to the possibility of containment?",
