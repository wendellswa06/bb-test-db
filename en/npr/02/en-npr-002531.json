        "I think the implications of another war in the Middle East and a military strike on Iran are quite problematic.",
        "First of all, we recognize - and I think this is shared across the board, including by former senior Israeli officials - that any strike, best-case scenario an American strike, worst-case scenario an Israeli strike, which would be more limited in its capacity, would only set back the program for some limited period of time.",
        "If it were an Israeli strike, it might set back the Iranian nuclear program by as little as a year or as much as a handful of years.",
        "So you're saying we'd be back here at this discussion again, then, in a few years?",
        "We would, and we would almost certainly persuade the Iranians to leave the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which is at least an opportunity for us to have some insight into the program, the inspectors that are present on the ground to this day as a result of the Iranian involvement in the NNPT is an important check.",
        "Let's let Matthew respond to the point that you just made, that even if there were a military strike at this point, if that has to be the solution - and again, Matthew, I think you're also - you're agreeing that a negotiated solution would be better.",
        "But if there had to be a military solution, Suzanne is saying that it would be very temporary, that the Iranians would be able to rebuild and get us back in this position again.",
        "What about that?",
        "I think Suzanne is asking the right question.",
        "There are a lot of people in Washington who are putting all their eggs in the diplomacy basket.",
        "We all hope that that works out.",
        "But at some point very soon, we could face this very difficult decision between a strike or a containment.",
        "So I think she's asking the right question.",
        "I think she comes to the wrong conclusion.",
        "I think that these are bad options, but that a strike would be the least bad option.",
        "So it's almost certain the United States would completely destroy Iran's key nuclear facilities.",
        "This would, at a minimum, set Iran's nuclear program back.",
        "But, of course, the hope would be that something happens to where Iran ends up permanently without nuclear weapons.",
        "And there are examples in the past, for example, Syria bombed - I'm sorry - Israel bombed a nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007, and there are no indications that Syria has rebuilt its nuclear facility since then.",
        "So it's possible that Iran could simply give up in the aftermath of a strike.",
        "But there's a lot that could happen with that additional time to where we end up in a situation where Iran is permanently without nuclear weapons.",

        "Well, I make the distinction because, I guess, what I wanted to point out is I don't think Iran has lost the idea that, you know, we do have nuclear submarines, nuclear missile submarines out there.",

        "And I think that the real issue, as your guests had pointed out and I completely agree with what Suzanne has been saying - proliferation that Matthew brings up, that is a legitimate concern, but the real issue is the balance of power in the Gulf.",
        "And - but the nuclear weapons issue in and of itself is not really as relevant as I think we're - we make it out.",
        "Why not?",

        "And secondly, I think that we have not take into the consequence of the cost of what this is going to take.",
        "The Iraq War cost us a trillion dollars, and they were a fraction of the strength of Iran.",
        "I think just to round up a war, even if an attack takes a few weeks or months, it would be in the tens of billions of dollars.",
        "Well, we're running trillions of dollars of deficits.",
        "Brent Scowcroft said that United States couldn't fight a war for three days without borrowing the money from China.",

        "All right, Jay.",
        "Thanks for your call.",
        "You're listening TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Suzanne Maloney, Jay's point about just the cost of war, just the dollar cost of war being something we can't handle right now, does that figure into your description of why a military option would be less preferable to living with a nuclear Iran?",
        "It certainly does, and I think it's not simply the cost of the armaments and the military commitments of actually waging the war, but the impact that a strike on Iran and the expected Iranian retaliation, which would hit Israel as well as American interests throughout the Middle East, and then, particularly, the Persian Gulf would have in the broader global economy and the very fragile recovery that we're seeing now at home and around the world.",
        "I think you'd be looking at a spike in oil prices that would last for weeks, if not months, above $200 a barrel.",
        "And that would have catastrophic implications for growth and jobs.",
        "These and remote communities.",
        "There are only eight police stations in those 40 communities.",
        "So what we have is a situation in Australia, which is a white man country, of a whole group of people that have been left behind.",

        "Thank you, Ira.",
        "Let's see.",
        "Peaches and cream?",
        "I mean, the reason we're talking about this and this sense of urgency comes now is because the Israelis are concerned that the clock is ticking and a window is closing for them to do something about this because the Iranians are apparently beginning to put stuff underground, and it will soon be out of reach of Israeli bombs, some of it will be.",
        "And the Israelis missed their opportunity to do something once - what they would think of as once and for all, taking still the point you make, Suzanne, that they might be able to rebuild.",
        "But given that ticking clock situation, I want to ask you, Matthew, is there any indication at all - since both of you say you would prefer a negotiated solution to this, is there any indication at all that the Iranians are ready to listen to a deal and to call this off on their own in exchange for something?",
        "Well, there are signs that they're starting to feel the pressure of sanctions, and there'd been some indications recently that they're ready to come back to the negotiating table.",
        "The point, though, of the sanctions is not only to get them to the negotiating table, but to get them to say something meaningful and to put meaningful curbs on their nuclear program.",
        "At this point, unfortunately, I'm skeptical that we can get a negotiated settlement.",
        "It's just very hard for me to see any overlap between...",
        "I mean, if you were them, Matthew, would you negotiate at this point?",
        "Is there - would you see an argument to be made internally that we should stop all of this?"

        "Well, Iran's primary strategic goals are to continue to exist as a state and to become the most dominant state in the region, and nuclear weapons gives them both of those things.",

        "That's not what he's looking for.",
        "And, Suzanne, the same question to you: do you see indication that the Iranians are perceiving an incentive to back down?",
        "The Iranians had said they're going to come back to the table, and there is now the expectation that there are going to be a set of discussions between the multilateral coalition, the P5-plus-1 as it's known, and Tehran.",
        "They're showing some new flexibility on - particularly on inspections of military sites and other issues that have been sticking points.",
        "But I, like Matthew, remained very skeptical in part because I think much of what we've done, both the discourse about war, as well as sanctions that were explicitly intended and stated on Capitol Hill, is designed to collapse the Iranian economy have only played into Iran's paranoia.",
        "This is a leadership that is convinced that Washington is not prepared to allow the Islamic republic to continue to exist.",
