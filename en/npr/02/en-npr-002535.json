        "It turns out that it's actually very difficult to try to miniaturize that so that it can fit compactly onto a chip.",
        "And one of the reasons for that is because there's so many optical elements on it that is very difficult to miniaturize in an inexpensive fashion."

        "So, after we took a look at the problem, we decided that, you know, if want to actually miniaturize the microscope, we've got to do it another way.",
        "And that's why we drew inspiration from floaters in our eyes, which tells us that you really don't need all those fancy lenses to do imaging.",
        "All you really need is to take the object of interest and put it very close to the sensor chip.",
        "And as long as the density of the sensor chip is high enough in terms of its pixel density, you should be able to do imaging that way.",
        "Hm.",
        "Sort of like - because the floaters are behind your lens.",
        "They're not being focused on your retina.",
        "They're basically just being - bumping up against your retina.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And in fact, this is actually a very interesting experiment to try, which is the next time you see floaters, try removing or putting on your eyeglasses, and you'll see that the floaters remain equally clear.",
        "Hm.",
        "And so now, that means that the - if your retina, which is sensitive enough, and the floaters are on top of it, you try to recreate sort of putting a sample that's like the floaters on top of a chip like your retina.",
        "That's right.",
        "The only problem with that is that what is commercially available, that - the chips are commercially available, they just don't have the pixel density that is high enough to actually be able to do this well.",
        "Right.",
        "So, we came up with a way to effectively increase the pixel density by using very small holes that are punched onto a layer of mantle that we have coated onto the chip itself.",
        "Hm.",
        "And in that case, the holes itself sets the resolution.",
        "So, the actual device is very simple.",
        "All we do is put in a micro-fluidic channel on top of this array of holes, and then we take the object of interest and flow it through this micro-fluidic channel.",
        "And as it passes across the holes, each individual hole effectively acquire a light scan of the object.",
        "And all we do at the end of the day is simple stack up all these light scans and create the high-resolution image.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Talking with Dr. Yang here, talking about this new kinds of microscope.",
        "So, would it be fair to say that the more little holes you have in there, the higher the resolution, or the greater the pixel density, or what we call, like in a camera, you have high resolution?"

        "The resolution, in this case, is set by the size of the holes.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "So, as the holes get smaller and smaller, we can actually get finer and finer resolution.",
        "The number of holes actually gives us the effective field of view that we are looking at.",
        "So, let's say, if we're looking at a relatively big cell that's 50 or 60 microns, you might need more holes than compared to if you're looking at a cell that is 10 microns in diameter.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "And so what kind of magnification are we talking about here?",
        "OK.",
        "So, effectively, what we are - comparable to a 10x or 20x microscope at this moment in time.",
        "And what would you do with such a small magnification?",
        "Actually, you can see yourselves quite well using this approach, and we actually have been working with biologist who wants to do automated imaging of microorganisms, and this fits very nicely in that context because the imaging that we're doing is done in an automated fashion.",
        "So, they can effectively simply drop in the solutions containing the objects they want to look at and then come back in a couple of hours or a few minutes and simply collect the images that way.",
        "Interesting.",
        "So, whatever you're looking at, it has to be in a fluid.",
        "That's right.",
        "But then again, if you look at what is commonly found in bioscience experiments and the samples that clinicians analyze, a lot of it is already in fluid form.",
        "And right now you actually have to plate it on to a glass plate before you can examine under the microscope.",
        "So, could you look at blood cells?"
