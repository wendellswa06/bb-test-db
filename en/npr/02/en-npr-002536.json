        "Oh yeah, absolutely.",
        "And in fact that's actually one of the things that we're particularly interested in doing right now, which is to actually use this to look at malaria parasites in blood samples that we collect.",
        "And so, you could then make this cheaply enough that you could produce this on mass and then take this out to poor countries where people are having trouble with parasites?",
        "That's right.",
        "That's one of the things we are hoping in terms of being able to view a rugged iPod sized device that contains one of this microscope.",
        "It's actually interesting to note that the microscope is about the size of Washington's nose on a quarter and we need a relatively large iPod size device simply because you need a screen to be able to display the images that we acquire.",
        "So, the microscope is really a very tiny part of the (unintelligible) that we're talking about here.",
        "So, you could take one of these tiny little chips and maybe take a USB plug and plug it into your iPod or something and look at it?",
        "Osman Ashai is taking a college class with a professor who initially seemed frightening.",
        "So we expect that at the end of the day when we start manufacturing these on a semi-conductive fabrication line, that the cost would be about 10 dollars.",
        "And the way we came up to that estimation is because the off the chip - off-the-shelf chips that we're using right now cost about 20 dollars when we buy it on a retail level and that's probably a huge mark up on that price as it is.",
        "And what about using water quality, not just blood but stuff that might be in the water?",
        "Oh yeah, absolutely.",
        "And which is another reason why we think this is useful for double applications because you can start to think about building a device that is multifunctional.",
        "You can use it to look at blood samples, you can use it to look at urine, look at water quality to check for harmful bacterias.",
        "Can you make one that doesn't need the fluid?",
        "That's possible.",
        "In that case you would want to be scanning your sensors across the object.",
        "The reason why we haven't pursued that much is because typically the samples that we're working with is already in fluid form and it's just easier to scan the object fluidically than to try to scan the sensor."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And actually it has potentially a good - it's actually a potentially very good way to protect against bio-terrorism.",
        "Because if you think about this, the cost of actually us putting something like this on a cell phone might cost about a dollar since it already contains a camera which is typically underutilized anyway.",
        "You don't use it 24 hours a day anyway.",
        "So, you can potentially have one of those - one of our device implanted on to your camera on the cell phone, and simply have it passively check for harmful things that might be floating in the air.",
        "And if anything is picked up that way it would actually alert you to the fact that, you know, something might be going wrong.",
        "Well you see, you're thinking like a military application, because I'm thinking of the stuff for kids for me.",

        "So, if you've got a regular, you know, when I was in fourth grade looking at a microscope that you put the little sample on the glass plate and there's a light underneath or a reflective sunlight of some sort.",
        "So, if you have this little microchip, do you actually put it on the thing that you're looking at?",
        "Like can you put it right on your skin and see an image or do you have to have light behind it?",
        "So, that's a good question.",
        "So, the way we typically operate our system right now is we take a solution containing the object of interest and inject that onto this chip itself and then the chip actually contains a electrodes - set of electrodes that would electrically drive this fluid across the sensor.",
        "And then the light intensity that we use is actually comparable to sunlight so we could actually go out during the day and simply operate the device as it is without the use of any external light sources.",
        "Wow.",

        "So, could you automate it in that kind of a way?",
        "Yeah.",

        "So, it's typically outputted so that we can actually take a look at it and analyze it the way that you would actually look under a conventional microscope at what is going on.",

        "And it's certainly something that we would like to pursue.",
        "Actually, coming to this point, I also would like to point out the fact that because the actual device is very tiny, we can even start to think about putting not just one microscope on the chip, we can start to put tens or even hundreds of this on the chip.",
        "And that really actually allows us to do parallel processing and process a lot of samples at the same time.",
