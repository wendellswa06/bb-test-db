        "So, we're very excited to start working with one of my clinician collaborators who is very interested in looking at circulating tumor cells.",
        "So those are cells that have broken up from a primary tumor and that's the thing that actually goes around and spread the tumor to other locations in the body.",
        "So, being able to actually track and measure that is very important to him.",
        "And we think that within, you know, maybe not within the next 10 years, but 15 or 20 years from now, we can start to actually have a device that do the analysis and look for all these rogue cells in the bloodstream itself that we would - the device would be implanted into a person.",
        "And this will be very useful for them because they can then track continuously for the presence of these rogue cells.",
        "What about just in laboratory situations where you need - you have lots of blood cell samples to look through?",
        "Yes.",
        "Would something like that, would work with your microscope work here?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "Definitely.",
        "And there's actually two reasons for doing this.",
        "One is the fact that we can then start to provide point-of-care analysis.",
        "So, you withdraw the blood from the patient and not have to go to a lab and simply do the analysis right there and then.",
        "Very useful for, you know, cases where you really need a fast analysis done right there and then.",
        "The other aspect of this is that it really allows you to do very efficient, very high through put analysis of large numbers of samples.",
        "So it's not just useful for clinicians in that case, but also bio-scientists who are doing, let's say, a drug discovery where they need to look at a lot of cells at the same time.",
        "Is there something you would like to do with it that you can't do yet?",
        "You need to wait to another breakthrough you have to make out something.",
        "Well, certainly I think one of the things we will be particularly interested in is to really drive down the resolution of the system even further.",
        "Because the resolution is actually given by the size of the holes that we use, we can actually punch the holes even smaller to the point that we can actually exceed the resolution of a conventional microscope.",
        "And that's actually gives you ability to see things that you may not otherwise see easily with a conventional microscope.",
        "So if you're 10 or 20 times power now, what power would you like to go to?",
        "Effectively, we want to go a resolution of maybe about 100 nanometers or 50 nanometers.",
        "So, that's really not equivalent in a conventional microscope for that.",
        "Wow, well, good luck to you."
