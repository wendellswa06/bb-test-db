        "Well, actually, the - it's true, it was to discover water.",
        "But we're here to discover liquid water, and what we've found now is water ice.",
        "So, the question that is posed for us is, does that ice ever melt?",
        "And we have a couple ways to try and determine that.",
        "Mostly, we're looking at the minerals and chemicals in the soil in association to the ice to see if they have been affected by liquid water.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "And you found that interesting mineral that has raised a bit of a controversy.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, this sent us - sent me, anyway, back to the textbooks to try and figure out what a perchlorate is, and our chemistry experiment determined there's a fair amount of perchlorate in the soil.",
        "And so, what we've learned about it, it's a very stable chemical.",
        "It's used actually for rocket fuel and stable at room temperature, I should say, because if you heat it up hot enough, it really...",
        "Kaboom.",
        "Ignites.",
        "Yes.",
        "But in a rocket, you see, when you leave the atmosphere, there's no oxygen to work with the fuel.",
        "I mean, if you put a match to lighter fluid, you have to have oxygen in association, and usually it's in the atmosphere.",
        "But this material provides oxygen to the fuels.",
        "And so, when you heat it up, it'll break into an oxygen-rich environment.",
        "But at room temperature colder where we are in Mars, it's extremely stable, and it's also very soluble in water.",
        "And so, we can use it to trace where liquid water has carried it in the Martian surface.",
        "So, you don't think it's - being part of a rocket-fuel system, you don't think it's a contaminant you brought with you?",
        "We have been researching this very thoroughly, because it's an obvious first question, and we cannot find a source for this much perchlorate under the surface.",
        "We actually burned the perchlorate, so there shouldn't be any left when we get there.",
        "And there's just a tiny amounts, just grams of perchlorate, that's brought with us.",
        "It couldn't be spread evenly over the surface to see the signatures we see.",
        "Does the fact that it is a perchlorate and usually toxic to life forms on Earth, would that mean it could be toxic to any life forms you might want to discover?",
        "Well, toxic is an interesting word.",
        "My father used to say the difference between and poison and medicine is the dosage, and they actually, some years ago, used to use perchlorate as a medicine for hyperthyroidism.",
        "And so, you don't think that that's the problem here on Mars?"

        "I don't see it - I don't see toxicity as being a big problem.",
        "I really don't.",
        "It's - I mean, you have to be careful with it, of course.",
        "But I don't think it's going to be a problem for most - for future astronauts.",
        "Tell us why you were so surprised to find it.",
        "You know, I know that you test out Martian vehicles as close to the conditions on Earth as you can, either in Antarctica, Greenland, places like that, very cold places where things would stay frozen.",
        "Do we not find perchlorate there also?",
        "We tend to find perchlorate most commonly in hyper-arid environments, and the kind of the classic place is the Atacama Desert in Chile, where it rains a few millimeters every 10 years, and so the perchlorates are formed in the atmosphere.",
        "The UV takes the chlorine that comes off the ocean.",
        "As you know, we have a salty ocean and little bits of sodium chloride go up into the atmosphere.",
        "They react with the ultraviolet from the sun, and then they're allowed to bound with hydro - I'm sorry - with oxygen, and they form a perchlorate and rains down on the surface, and it's only kept in place when you have a very dry environment.",
        "Otherwise, it goes into a solution where the water immediately goes into the groundwater and comes back to the ocean.",
        "I see.",
        "Hyper-arid environments, and of course, Mars is - it fits that well, very, very well.",
        "And how can you tell?",
        "You said you could use this to figure out the history of liquid water.",
        "How would you do that?",
        "Yes.",
        "If the ice were to melt, even every million years or so, the things don't change rapidly on Mars.",
        "So, if the ice were to melt and wet the soil over time, you would change the basaltic soils that we expect to find into clays, perhaps, carbonates, sulfates.",
        "These are all minerals that are formed through the action of liquid water.",
        "And so, we're looking for those what are called altered minerals, altered from their primary volcanic state into other minerals that we commonly see on the Earth.",
        "And our instruments are very sensitive to those types of products.",
        "We also look for salts.",
        "Obviously, if you have something wet, it can leave salts out of the soils, and when it evaporates, it leaves the salts behind.",
        "So, a salt-rich clay, carbonated-sulfate environment would say, gee, that was probably wet at one point.",
        "There were some wacky rumors going around this week, whether or not the fact that you had discovered life and kept it secret and told the White House about it and no one else.",
        "Yes.",
        "Somehow, the story went out that we've been talking to the White House about some big discovery, but that was news to me, I'll tell you.",

        "Yes, we did.",
        "We have now been extended to the end of September, and this is good news because we haven't had time yet to use all the cells we've brought with us.",
        "We're very close to a mission success, which would have been three of our ovens and three of our wet chemistry cells.",
        "But we still have others we haven't used, and so it's really important to us to, you know, make as much scientific progress as possible in the short amount of time we have.",
        "Once those resources, those cells, get used and used up, does that mean basically you're done?",
        "Well, we're done as a soil-analysis station and we become a weather station.",
        "And then we really are interested in polar climate, you know.",
        "It's - you can't study the surface in isolation.",
        "It really works as a system with the atmosphere.",
        "So, we're studying the water vapor in the atmosphere, how it diffuses to the soils to form the ice layer, and we'd really like to see how the season progresses.",
        "So, I'm thinking of the Mars Rovers that have been going on for years, you know, designed for a few months...",
        "Yeah, but they're not inside the Arctic Circle.",
        "When the sun sets, it's 24-hour darkness, and that's going to be a problem for our lander.",
        "We do not suspect it will survive.",
        "Considering the failures of the old Polar Explorer Enterprise, you must be - feel very vindicated now, I would imagine.",
        "Oh, I'm just overjoyed.",
        "Our project has been blessed, and we feel like we're really making some big strides forward in Martian science, and we certainly haven't completed that process.",
        "I'd say we're about halfway through, you know, really getting all the depth of science that we intend to get, and doing the analysis we need to do to understand what we've got, and my gosh, these are complicated instruments.",
        "So, you know, we're really at the harvest period right now for our project.",
