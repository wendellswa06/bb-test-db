        "Joining us from his office in Salt Lake City is Howard Berkes, NPR's rural affairs correspondent.",
        "And Howard, always nice to have you on the program.",
        "Thanks for having me back.",
        "And, tell us a little bit about the role of the Mormon president?",
        "Well, the Mormon president is both a chief executive officer, chief operating officer of what is not only a faith but an institution that owns large businesses and corporations and manages a large staff of thousands of people and oversees the meeting of the needs of the faithful, in this case now close to 13 million people all over the world, and the president of the Mormon Church is also believed by the faithful to be a prophet of God.",
        "He has a very strong religious role.",
        "And Mormons revere their president as someone who does receive divine intervention and is guided by that.",
        "So the prophet of God in other words, here is the word of God, literally?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "This is not something that is invoked frequently, it's relatively rare, but there will be times in a church a Mormon president's history perhaps when what he speaks will be presented as the word of God.",
        "These statements usually come with the words, thus sayeth the Lord.",
        "You have to note that Gordon B.",
        "Hinckley didn't do that during his term in office but even when he doesn't say that particular phrase Mormons believed that the president of the church is divinely guided.",
        "And how is a successor chosen?",
        "There's a process in which after the funeral of the late president, the top 14 leaders of the church meet privately, they pray and they vote.",
        "Now, there's a tradition here that the most senior member of that group who has served in that high leadership group the longest is traditionally the person who would become the next president, that's Thomas Monson, and that's an unbroken tradition and that's the expectation.",
        "After the vote is taken, an announcement is made and if tradition - recent tradition holds, they'll be a news conference with the new president.",
        "But I want to emphasize one thing, Mormons believe that Thomas Monson would not have achieved the position he achieved and would not have been in line to become the next president if God didn't direct process.",
        "And so there is this belief that that person who survived the longest and who've served the longest will become the next president of the church."

        "And that suggest that the next leader of the church, indeed, the leadership of the church is an elderly?",
        "Yes.",
        "Some half jokingly referred to it as a gerontocracy because survival is one way that you ascend in the faith and Thomas Monson is 80 years old, Gordon B.",
        "Hinckley was 97 when he died yesterday.",
        "Although I have to say that in Gordon B.",
        "Hinckley's case, he had all of his faculties up until very recently, at least when we saw him he'd had a - he maintained a robust travel schedule that would tire people 50 years younger than him.",
        "He was a very active president even late in age and that's been generally the case.",
        "There are times when a person ascends to the presidency and he doesn't have all of his mental faculties and there's a procedure by which the church has still managed in that case.",
        "But generally speaking, these are people who rise to the occasion despite advanced age.",
        "Our guest is Howard Berkes, NPR's rural affairs correspondent who've is with us from his office in Salt Lake City.",

        "I myself am a member.",
        "I just wanted to clarify real quick this idea of how president Hinckley changed the church.",
        "I think it's important to understand that the doctrines and beliefs and standards of the church would never change.",
        "What I feel that the way the outside world kind of perceive the church he really did an amazing job at presenting the church in its true light and putting himself out there, you know, up against Mike Wallace and Larry King.",
        "He held his own and I think that was pretty impressive and, you know, he's going to be long remembered and definitely well loved.",
        "And Howard, previous leaders of the church might not have felt so comfortable drawing up against Mike Wallace or Larry King.",
        "Previous leaders of the church weren't comfortable talking to any reporters.",
        "It was very rare for previous church presidents to speak with reporters; certainly, none held a news conference in which they took questions openly like a Gordon B.",
        "Hinckley did.",
        "And Kyle's absolutely right.",
        "That's - the way I think about it is that Gordon B.",
        "Hinckley both aggressively presented a new phase, perhaps a more benign phase of the Mormon faith to the rest of the world by being not only aggressive in doing interviews and in taking questions from reporters, but doing do with his personality that he has that has made him to loved by Mormons - very grandfatherly, joking with reporters really disarming them.",
        "And he made, you know, tough-guy Mike Wallace one of his biggest fans.",
        "You know, overall there are over five million Americans - citizens who have lost their right to vote due to their sentencing status.",
        "As you well know, election laws generally are left up to the states and when it comes to felons or ex-felons and their right to vote, we have different bizarre laws all throughout the country.",
        "(Laughter) I think Rachel has this one.",
        "When we learned last month that NASA astronauts wear diapers usually during flight, or flights of fancy, that got us wondering, what else do astronauts wear?",
        "Any other garments they're not telling us about?"
