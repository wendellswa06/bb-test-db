        "Great to be with you.",
        "Now, why couldn't they make a $100 laptop?",
        "Well, I think under their plan, they would have to sell millions of them in order to be able to drive the prices down from their suppliers for the machine.",
        "And the original plan that Professor Negroponte proposed was to sell a million to six different countries, a minimum order of one million.",
        "And then if he got these six million by now, he'd be able to bring the price down.",
        "Of course, technology prices come down generally anyway, so that was his target.",
        "But, unfortunately, he hasn't been able to sell anywhere near six million.",
        "Right now, the current orders just for this year are 300,000, so I think that's hurt in terms of bringing the price down to its target.",
        "So what does it cost now, this laptop?",
        "Right now, it costs about $188.",
        "And the problem is that that's not that far away from what more traditional laptops that, say, run Windows cost now.",
        "They are approaching $200.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And they're made by big companies that can offer some things that Mr. Negroponte's nonprofit I don't think really can match in terms of things like after-sales support and things like that.",
        "Now, I think he deserves great credit for putting pressure on big companies to, you know, reconsider the developing world and to look at it and consider selling laptops there at a price people can afford.",

        "Now, we see laptops, you know, $230 et cetera.",
        "Problem is it's competing with the machine that he created from scratch, which by almost to all accounts is a really unique, innovative machine.",
        "But, you know, they are facing tremendous competition now, I think, from companies like Intel, which don't even normally sell computers.",
        "Right.",

        "Well, I think you can ask him, but, you know, I don't think he saw - I mean, there seem to be an assumption that this was a great noble idea, which I think it actually is and very, very philanthropic.",
        "But to think that giant companies like Microsoft - whose operating system, Windows, is an honest machine - would sit back and just watch a machine potentially become a standard in countries throughout the world with potentially a billion new customers and they'd sit back and watch and do nothing.",
        "I think maybe a little naive, same with Intel.",
        "The chips in the Mr. Negroponte's laptop are made by AMD, which is their chief competitor.",
        "They clearly saw this as a threat.",
        "And, you know, again, they don't normally even sell machines, but last year, they introduced a machine called The Classmate, which is currently selling for as low as $230.",
        "They're marketing it very aggressively in many of the same countries that Mr. Negroponte had targeted such as Libya and Nigeria, for example.",
        "And they're doing extremely well.",
        "And this machine is quite different from the one he's designed, but they seem to be winning a lot of contracts lately.",
        "Well, can a nonprofit venture like One Laptop per Child really ever win against Intel and Microsoft?",
        "Well, it's won in Uruguay, so I guess it's potentially possible.",
        "But I think one of the mistakes he's made, which I think he's readily acknowledges is he tried a top-down approach, where he negotiated with the top leaders of these countries, and, you know, some of them are no longer in power.",
        "Some of them, you know, agreed, like, in principle, to buy large quantities of these.",
        "But then when they heard from the bureaucrats below in the ministries of education who were much more familiar with say, Windows, and buying Windows-type machines, you know, they had second thoughts.",
        "So as a result, he's had a change of strategy and he's now accepting much smaller orders.",
        "And he's now offering the machine under a kind of a hybrid charitable arrangement to American and Canadian consumers who are allowed to now to purchase a machine and buy a second one and donate that to a country like, say, Haiti or Rwanda.",

        "I would assume that you're not particularly happy about that at this point.",
        "I think it's actually a very big mistake to think that the plans have been derailed.",
        "What's happened is slightly different.",
        "First of all, to just give us a very specific example, I've known Bill Gates his entire adult life.",

        "It's - the issue isn't do we or can we run Windows?",
        "It's how does that relate to open source?",

        "So what we find ourselves doing ironically - and it has slowed us down, but not very much - is competing on laptops, and that's what is a shame because the number 300,000, which Steve just mentioned is absolutely correct.",
        "But that's what we're building by the end of this year, and we just started building last week.",

        "Well, if he considers it a success if Intel comes in and sells 150 million classmate laptops, then his idea hasn't been derailed at all.",
        "But to say that he's not, you know - he may feel he's not competing against the likes of Intel, but I can tell you that Intel certainly seems to view his machine as direct competition because as he well knows there's marketing material they've distributed in countries like Mongolia just last month, and Nigeria, where they do head-to-head comparisons of the two machines, and they declared a victor of being their machine.",
        "So they, they certainly don't see this as, you know, some great charitable mission for them.",
        "I mean, I'll tell you it's part of their kind of charitable mission, but they definitely seem to see it as a threat.",
        "And also, you know, he has pointed out that earlier this year, Bill Gates, who had attacked the One Laptop per Child machine directly, you know, introduced a version of Windows for developing countries for $3.",
