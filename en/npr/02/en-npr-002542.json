        "If I were the World Food Programme and I were in a remote village serving food to the children at school, and McDonald's sets up something into that village, McDonald's might view the World Food Programme as competitor, but the, you know, the World Food Programme does not view McDonald's as a competitor.",

        "As Philip, your caller, just pointed out, we do indeed have a crank contrary to the Wall Street Journal story.",
        "And we can crank the laptops.",
        "We distribute the crank with the laptops, and you can run it on human power.",
        "You don't need to plug it in; a solar panel smaller than a normal piece of paper can also drive it.",
        "So there are things like that - the sunlight-readable display of this laptop is very important because kids use it outdoors, and you can use it in that mode for 23 hours on one battery charge.",
        "Those are very important features.",
        "The so-called mesh network that allow them all to communicate to each other, and then at very low cost you connect one child to the Internet and a thousand are connected.",
        "So there are features we can - we don't do side-by-side comparisons at One Laptop per Child.",
        "But if you did them, the other machines don't even come close, not even close.",
        "So we still have to keep doing what we're doing.",
        "And whether it is to get people to copy it - and we help people copy it, everything we do as open source, everything we do is made available to others to copy it."

        "In some cases, could be just education, and in no case whatsoever can it be without an element of education.",
        "And if we continue having a world without primary education, and you have to realize that as much - it depends how you count, I admit - but as much as 30 percent of the children of this world don't have what you and I would call primary education.",

        "And what our suggestion is is to leverage the children themselves, to get children to be more active in their own learning, to collaborate with other children, and to do the kind of learning that we know they can do, not instead of teachers or instead of schools, but outside a school.",
