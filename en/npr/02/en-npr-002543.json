        "It's an issue of fairness, as the governor has stated in Florida, and I'm hoping that these citizens will come forward now to get processed and to have their voting rights fully restored.",

        "So these felony disenfranchisement laws are a holdover from slavery, like the poll tax, and like other kinds of selective voter qualifications, they are intended to make blacks less than full citizens.",
        "So I think it's so interesting when you look at what was stored and what there's never been an issue with.",
        "So, for example, ex-felons have always been allowed to join the military, it's just that they can't vote and they can't be on jury.",
        "So we really do have to question where this opposition is coming from.",
        "What strategy might the opposition take?",
        "Well, they all have a whole lot of legal strategies because it's so clear that a state can, once somebody has served their time, restore people to full citizenship.",
        "And really, in addition to being good politics and the morally correct thing to do, it's also good for public safety.",
        "If you treat people like criminals, they act like criminals.",
        "If you treat people who've already paid their debt to society like other citizens, then you will actually lower the rate of recidivism.",
        "Let me follow up on his point, Donna, with you, about the disenfranchisement of felons, particularly as it relates to African-Americans.",
        "This disenfranchisement was added to the constitution in 1968 during the Civil Rights Movement, and about 38 percent of Florida's felons are black as of the year 2005.",
        "African-Americans make up only 15 percent of the state's population, according to the census.",
        "How much will this shift give power to blacks at the poll?",
        "Well, there's no question that if you restore these citizens' voting rights, you will allow them to participate in the process and have a voice and a seat at the table.",
        "One-third of all black men, especially one-third of black men in the South, have lost their voting rights.",
        "One-fourth of the black men across the country are now ineligible to vote, and states like Alabama, the number is much higher.",
        "So nationally, according to the sentencing project, 13 percent of all black males have lost their voting rights.",
        "So this is a huge issue.",
        "And if we are successful in getting states to overturn this draconian laws, as Mr. Butler's just stated, these laws go back to, in some cases, the - you know, the slavery period and then, of course, Jim Crow.",
        "When African-Americans received voting rights, some states put draconian laws on the books to ensure that a very healthy minority of them would be permanently disenfranchised.",
        "So we have a lot of work to do, especially in the deep South.",
        "And I hope that by Florida taking its action, we can get other states like Alabama and hopefully, you know, Georgia and some other states to follow suit."

        "You know, there may not be a way of actually knowing - there's a quantifying it, Donna - but are these felons' voters?",
        "Once they do get their rights restored, have they traditionally gone to the polls again?",
        "Well, of course, there's a public service campaign that's being launched in states like Rhode Island and Maryland and Virginia where, you know, partial voting rights have been restored.",
        "There will be another campaign, I'm sure, in Florida - the League of Women Voters and others have indicated that they intend to notify these individuals to let them know that they have a right now to participate in the political process, and to give them an opportunity to go out there and to express themselves.",
        "Nine hundred thousand people are eligible.",
        "That's enough to, as you well know, to make a difference in the next election.",

        "You know, Tony, there's nothing like having your civil rights taken away to make you appreciate them.",
        "So we saw the famous prisons in South Africa after so many years of not being allowed to vote, Africans were finally allowed to exercise that privilege.",
        "There, you know, there were extraordinary lines to the polls.",
        "And in some countries, people actually vote while they're in prison.",
        "That's part of their rehabilitation.",
        "That's true in Western Europe, in Japan, even in Zimbabwe and in Kenya.",
        "So I think this is a very crucial step, and I think it will make everybody appreciate this precious right to vote more.",
        "To follow up that point with you, some civil rights groups are saying, Paul, that the new rule is still unfair because it requires felons to pay restitution before they can regain those rights.",
        "Since it's harder for ex-felons to get work, we all know they may not have the money - so goes the argument.",
        "Do you think that that is a legitimate gripe about even this change in the law?",
        "No.",
        "We should be clear that this is a half step, but it doesn't go as far as it could to fully restore the rights, again, of people who already paid their debt.",
        "So you get this kind of catch-22, where you can't vote because you don't have enough money to pay back restitution, but you can't get a job because you can't get a license.",
        "So, again, it's this - you can't - it's this weird, like, catch-22.",
        "Well, Donna, let's turn the conversation towards you in a different way, if I may.",
        "As a political strategist, what is your view?",
        "Is this the kind of controversial move that you would recommend a candidate make only after they are in office like Crist, and not make it during a campaign?",
        "Well, I have pushed for years for the Democratic Party to embrace this movement.",
        "Last year, Jimmy Carter and a number of other - James Baker -and a number of others, civil rights activists - Spencer Overton, a law professor at George Washington, I believe - pushed to get the National Center for Election Reform to embrace this call to restore voting rights.",
        "And they did.",
        "The American Bar Association has taken a position.",
        "I will be introducing a resolution on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, Black Caucus and others to push Democratic governors.",
        "I mean, we know in Maryland that Governor O'Malley - at least he has signaled that he intends to push this.",
        "In Virginia, former governor Mark Warner pushed it.",
        "Former Governor of Iowa Tom Vilsack pushed it.",
        "So we're going to call on Democratic governors to take the lead and help and to reverse these draconian laws, and I'm hopeful and optimistic that in a presidential season when you have candidates out there eager to get the support of others, I hope that they will embrace this movement as well."
