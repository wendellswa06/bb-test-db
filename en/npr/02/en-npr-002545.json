        "It's really striking how influential just a simple question of the doctor or nurse asking a patient if they smoke, advising them to quit and helping them to find treatment can have in terms of promoting somebody to try to quit smoking.",
        "So I think doctors and nurses can ask every person who comes in if they smoke.",
        "And if so, help them get into treatment.",
        "If they're overweight, they can ask about their diet and exercise patterns.",
        "You know, the doctor is going to not only know about the state of the science about these things, but they also know the patient's medical history and are, I think, a very important component here of helping to give clear, simple messages about what people can do about it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And one of the things that I found interesting was the last survey that examined these beliefs about cancer was back in 1986.",
        "This seems pretty significant.",
        "Why wait so long between surveys?",
        "Well, there have been surveys in sort of smaller geographic locations, so people have done surveys in California, and among simply specific populations - women only in rural areas, for instance.",
        "But I think there's a renewed interest - particularly with the explosion of information that's available on the Internet and, you know, a number of channels that are available to people in the media - to really understand where people are getting this information and how they're making sense of it.",
        "So the National Cancer Institute has been focusing on this a lot in the last few years, and I think we'll see a lot more attention to this issue moving forward.",

        "What are your views - what kind of thoughts have you got?",
        "I guess this comes out of the category of confusing different kinds of studies.",

        "Five or more servings a day will help reduce your risk of cancer in the long term.",

        "Isn't that right, Jeff?",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "Certainly, family history and genes can put people at an increased risk of cancer.",
        "And I think in that circumstance, it's all the more important to really focus on the things that we know that we can do.",
        "So scientists estimate that about 30 percent of all cancer deaths are attributable to smoking.",
        "And from about 15 to 20 percent of cancer deaths are attributable to obesity.",
        "So the number that I've heard thrown around is about 50 percent - not 85, but there's certainly some uncertainty about what that specific number is.",
        "But we don't know everything, but I think we can focus on the things that we do know about not smoking, about eating fruits and vegetables and about exercising regularly.",
        "And, you know, you can't guarantee you're not going to get cancer, but you can put the odds in your favor.",

        "Maybe that they're, one, being overwhelmed by a lot of information that's conflicting, and also that they're maybe not getting the right messages from the sources that should be communicating this information.",
