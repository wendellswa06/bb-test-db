        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, well, since the study found that people with college degrees were less likely to be fatalistic, might that reflect the fact that they're probably a little wealthier and probably have better access to health care?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think we know that education is probably one of the strongest indicators of socio-economic status in the United States, so definitely, I think that it's probably picking up a lot of that.",
        "I wonder, in your practice, Dr. Hayes, what do you find?",
        "Well, I think there's also data that, in fact, those people have a right to be more optimistic, because we know that higher levels of education - actually, they have better outcomes with diagnoses of cancer or a diagnoses of heart disease.",

        "If you are struggling to make ends meet, then the last thing that you're really going to be thinking about is going out for a 30-minute walk.",
        "Or perhaps you're going to be buying very calorie-dense foods that may not be healthy for you because that's what is available in the local bodega.",

        "I can chime in just briefly, this is a very complex issue - and I appreciate the comments you made, my colleague at Mayo Clinic made - that there's a lot of issues as regards as regards to the - having the knowledge and skills to be able to engage in the self-care activities that you have to do for day-to-day health tasks and to know - and also manage those things that may be having to conflict with stressful environmental cues that you have to deal with.",

        "But part of the problem is people do save kitchen chemicals and lab chemicals to use as weapons, some punky people who haven't been civilized properly or socialized properly is part of the problem as well.",
