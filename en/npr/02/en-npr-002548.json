        "I'm Jenny Pool Radway, and I'm the program coordinator for the Original Aurora Community Integration Collaborative.",
        "To help build community, Pool Radway picked what might seem like an odd tool: She's organizing immigrants and refugees into neighborhood watch groups.",
        "If people feel safe in their community, if they get to know their neighbors - even if they don't speak the same language - they're going to want to better their community, and stay here.",
        "And staying here means that as these newcomers move up economically, they'll hopefully bring the neighborhood up with them.",

        "And, you know, people say well, you know, in high school, the tests are very expensive and are just a burden to do.",
        "But, you know, you ask the parents of these kids and they wish that there would have been some type of screening.",
        "And again it was - unfortunately, Tony, when something like this happens, we realize that even in the National Football League there's still not an adequate screening device to test athletes, and particularly black athletes, for these heart problems and I think more people that we know have.",
        "Well, obviously, we're going to have to keep our eyes on that topic, but let's move on to something else.",
        "Men's basketball, March 1st is Thursday, so college basketball madness cannot be far behind.",
        "It seems to me, Bill Rhoden, that five schools are the elite right now - Ohio State, who beat Wisconsin on Sunday by a point, Wisconsin, of course, Florida who lost again, UCLA, my alma mater, and North Carolina.",

        "But I got to tell you, Tony, you know, we always talk about big time sports, and people are always asking well why these coaches climbed all over each other to recruit these kids.",
        "And all you got to do is watch Ohio State beat Wisconsin and you saw a Greg Oden's performance, and you realize why everybody was climbing over themselves to recruit this kid.",
        "Because one kid could mean the difference between a Final Four championship and a coach making a tremendous reputation and getting a lot of money, you know.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Well, just one more thing I want to talk to you about before we get out of here.",
        "That's the NFL combine giving us a glimpse into the draft coming up in April.",
        "But something else apparently took place there in Indianapolis over the weekend that was, well, kind of unusual, wasn't it?",
        "And it didn't involve newcomers but some NFL veterans and the commissioner.",
        "Tell us just what did happen.",
        "This is very interesting because there has been this issue of athletes being out of control, of being involved as much in the crime blotter than in a basketball court.",
        "And what these NFL players do, these veteran players approached the NFL and the commissioner and said listen, this is our league, too, and we really are concerned with our image problem.",
        "And what they are talking about is sort of a three-strike rule, where if you are a player and you get busted three strikes for anything, you are going to face some pretty serious penalties that could range from getting thrown out the league to being suspended.",
        "And I think that - Tony, this is a great move because the players are the ones who are saying this isn't just the league, this is all of us (unintelligible).",
        "Taking time to do something about it.",
        "What of the commissioner's - what was his reaction to it?",
        "He probably loved it, I guess.",
        "I think the commissioner was overjoyed.",
        "I mean, it's the same thing as when you have a coach and in the locker room it's the players who are taking care of discipline, you know.",
        "And that's as it should be.",
        "Hey buddy, the buzzer has just sounded on our sports segment for this week.",
        "William C.",

        "And Sam, does this mean we all get an iPhone-like device without paying what - 500, $600 for it?",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This could happen.",
        "It centers around what this concept - is called open access.",
        "And what that is, is basically everything the existing network isn't.",
        "The way it works now is the big wireless carriers - like AT&T, which has the iPhone, and Verizon - buy up these huge chunks of airwaves and then have nearly full control over how they use those airwaves.",
        "That means an AT&T phone, for example, will only work through AT&T's network.",
        "And any options on that phone, like Internet access, are also decided by AT&T, and of course billed accordingly.",
        "Google and consumer advocacy groups have been pressuring the FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, to essentially open up these airwaves.",
        "That would come in the form of the open access rules we are mentioning.",
        "What that would do is allow consumers to choose whichever phone they want, like the iPhone, load it with their favorite software and then determine which company they want to use for their service.",
        "So basically if you buy that iPhone, nothing would require you to go through AT&T.",
        "Oh, yeah, which people have been complaining about because of dropped calls and all that.",
        "So why would a company like Google be pushing so hard for those changes?",
        "Well, they want a piece of the pie.",
        "This is very lucrative business.",
        "And the upcoming auction of new wireless airwaves is that opportunity.",
        "These airwaves are being freed up as TV stations go digital.",
        "That requires less bandwidth.",
        "And they're coveted because unlike the current wireless networks, the bandwidth has the ability to penetrate walls.",
        "It's faster as well.",
        "Google could potentially get a piece of these airwaves, either by providing free software to cell phone user on the new bandwidth or by buying up a chunk of the spectrum itself.",
        "I talked to technology analyst Rob Enderle and he says either way the end result would be a new wave of innovation for the mobile phone market.",
        "We often joke about the fact that here in the United States we are the cobbler's children with regard to cell phones.",
        "We are so far behind Europe and Asia in terms of the technology we provide our citizens that it's really not even funny anymore.",
        "And opening this up could help close that gap."
