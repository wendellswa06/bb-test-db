        "But he says they bring complementary skills.",

        "We're talk about - inevitably, an organic process of immigrants arriving, communities taking shape, businesses developing.",
        "Can a community actually say, hey, let's gamble on the immigration that we've received here, and let's promote it as a virtue of Aurora, Colorado?",
        "Well, I think so.",
        "I think that what we know is that places that have had large and diverse waves - maybe not homogeneous waves of all low-skill immigrants, from one part of the country; or a border town that's flooded with low-skill, low-wage immigrants, who might not have work.",
        "But when you look at the kind of immigration that was just talked about - a hundred variants of languages - that kind of diversity tends to come with a lot of energy.",
        "It may not be a lot of college degrees - it may be some; it may be some - but it comes with a lot of energy, and a lot of ambition.",
        "And communities that have more of this ethnic diversity - controlling for other factors - tend to do better.",
        "And certainly, you mentioned that I'm an American who teaches at the University of Toronto.",
        "I mean, your average Torontonian would tell you, 30 years ago, Toronto was kind of a boring place.",
        "But Toronto went out, looking at what happened in the United States; and really went out, to attract immigrants.",
        "It's now a minority majority community.",
        "And I think most people report, even though there are problems and struggles and crime - and certainly, not all immigrants are doing high-skill work; some of them feel trapped in low-wage jobs - but on balance, it has created an enormous economic pathway for the community, and led to waves of entrepreneurship and business formation and a more thriving, diverse climate.",
        "And I'm just happy to see it happening in smaller suburban towns, like Aurora.",
        "Richard Florida, let's return now, to Megan Verlee's story; to hear about the challenge in Aurora, Colorado, of involving minorities in the civic and commercial life of that city.",
        "Nearly a third of Aurora's businesses are minority owned.",
        "That's a potential economic powerhouse, some in the city are trying to tap.",
        "At La Cueva Mexican Restaurant, enchiladas sizzle on the griddle for a midafternoon diner.",
        "In the front of the house, owner Alfonso Nunez stands ready to greet patrons.",
        "When he's not at his post, Nunez spends a lot of time trying to organize Aurora's immigrant and minority businesses.",
        "His pitch to them, is simple.",
        "You know, this way, at least you'll have a voice.",
        "And if 60 members of a business association show up at a city council meeting, then it becomes a concern."
