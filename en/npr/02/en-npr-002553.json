        "It just seems like there's this roadblock out there.",
        "Why are we not, even after maybe a generation, getting a little bit more involvement?",

        "One possible payoff?",
        "It could help sell the city as a cultural destination, for people seeking international experiences in the Denver area.",
        "Despite its intense ethnic diversity, in the eyes of the rest of the state, Aurora suffers under the stigma of being a vast, bland suburb.",

        "The tourism office here recently commissioned a guide; to try to lure people who live around Aurora, into exploring the city's ethnic and independent eateries.",
        "This place specializes in southern Indian fare from Kerala, in Tamilnadu.",
        "And the guide's author, Rebecca Caro, is at the table with us.",
        "Caro is white, and she says getting white diners into restaurants like this can be tough.",
        "Like, oh, if I come in and I'm the only white person, am I going to be welcomed?",
        "And am I going to feel comfortable?",
        "And - or are they going to, like, feel angry that we're invading their space?",

        "On the official level, the big money in Aurora is still focused on big development projects - like a medical research campus, and a possible convention center.",
        "It's down at the ground level where a lot of people are hoping their individual efforts will eventually change Aurora's image from Denver's sprawling suburb, to a vibrant and worldly community in its own right; and find the key to making ethnic diversity an economic driver.",

        "Hmm, that's a great question.",

        "The last thing my own Italian grandparents wanted to be, was involved in the municipal life of Newark.",
        "They wanted to make a living; and, you know, in Robert Putnam's studies of social capital, he finds that immigrant communities tend to be low, in terms of social and civic involvement.",
        "That's because they're busy.",
        "They're trying to harness the American dream.",
        "But what I liked about that is the fellow saying, we're trying.",
        "And in my book \"\"Rise of the Creative Class,\"\" I say we have to proactively try to include people - especially from immigrant communities who might not be inclined.",
        "The second point that I really quite enjoyed, was the point about using food.",
        "Food is a way of not only feeding oneself, but of starting a restaurant and making money.",
        "And in his book on food, the economist at George Mason, Tyler Cohen, points out that if you want to find interesting food in Washington, D.C.",
        "- interesting ethnic food - you have to head to the suburbs, where the really interesting Vietnamese and Ecuadorian dining is.",
        "So I think there is a little bit of a possibility.",
        "But I think it's certainly a long stretch for Aurora to be a globally, cosmopolitan destination.",
        "But can it be a better Aurora?",
        "Can it use food to lure in people from the center city?",
        "Of course, it can.",
        "And it probably is a lot better payoff for the dollar - as Megan said - to do those small, locally grown, organic, up-from-the bottom exercises; than to try to build these giant, top-down - whether they're factory-attracting or convention-center building, or medical-center-complex creating.",
        "It's the small stuff that tends to pay off a lot more.",
        "And I think Aurora has that right.",

        "The most important thing that has ever happened to me, the Nobel winner declares on the very first page, I learned to read at the age of five in Brother Justiniano's class at the De la Salle Academy in Cochabomba.",

        "So there's all these connections and hints that, you know, that these complex patterns that he was painting were linked to nature.",
        "And so I felt perhaps the answer is that they have these natural fractals embedded in the canvas and that's the secret of Jackson Pollock.",

        "Yes.",
        "You - you know, we proposed this idea that there's actually two sets of patterns in a Jackson Pollock painting.",
        "The ones on the larger scales, which are created by his motions as he walked around the canvas, and then there's the others at finer scales, which were actually cause by the splatters of paint.",
        "And so there's actually two distinct types of patterns, and we proposed that, you know, that these are fractal patterns.",
        "And you can scan an image of the painting into a computer and do some number crunching where the computer looks at patterns at different magnifications, and that those results are consistent with Pollock painting fractals.",
        "And you pretty much say that there are fractals all over nature just like there are in the paintings.",
        "That's right.",
        "So, you know, the word fractal appears a little mysterious and frightening to people, but it's something that we actually, you know, experience everyday.",

        "And, you know, further than do we like them, does it have a positive impact on us?",
        "And so our sort of research is actually chasing this basic area idea of can you use fractals patterns to actually reduce people's stress levels.",
        "And, you know, then can you work with artists and architects - if you can work out the type of fractals that really have this good impact on you, can you talk to architects and artists and work about ways that they can then take that information and take those patterns and put them to their artwork so that people get exposed to them.",

        "I certainly agree with you.",
