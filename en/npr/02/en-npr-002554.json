        "There's a big group in Holland that is looking at the European modern master's, painters like Monet.",
        "And then there's people in the States who are looking at early Chinese drawings and so - and they've all published these papers showing that you can in fact use fractal analysis to distinguish between different artists.",
        "And so that's going to be a very useful tool in the future, you know, the idea of scientific pattern analysis being used to distinguish between different paintings.",
        "And then you take that information and you combine it with all the other information, such as historical evidence, the visual inspection by, you know, what they call the connoisseurs' materials analysis.",
        "And so if you throw all of that information together, hopefully, then, that will help you to distinguish between paintings by different artists.",
        "And in fact you were instrumental in identifying some newly found Jackson Pollock paintings and trying to identify whether there were real Pollock's or someone else's design.",
        "There are number of - there are two groups that are actually worked on Pollock paintings and have shown that they can distinguish between those paintings.",
        "And like I say, you know, the important thing is for, you know, a group of people to actually get together and reach a consensus and - you know, that really is a fascinating insight between scientists and artists.",

        "That's right.",

        "Can you actually pick up the technique using fractals?",
        "Can you identify not just from what's on the painting but by the technique that was used?",
        "You know, so a lot of it has to be combined with visual inspection, but let's take another example.",
        "There's a scientist called Richard Voss who studies Chinese paintings, and he actually looks at the brush strokes created by the artist and sees a change through the years of going from very sort of expressive to very simplistic brush strokes.",
        "So, you know, you can definitely learn not just about the patterns but, you know, start to step back and try learn new information about the way that the artist actually created the painting.",
        "And that's as much, you know, a big part of studying art is actually studying the artworks, it's the artistic process that led to the artwork itself.",
        "So yeah, you can definitely work backwards, and that's the interesting thing from a scientist.",
        "Because, you know, we're not just looking at these things as sort of abstract patterns, the patterns are a signature of the process that created them.",
        "What we're interested in, you know, for example with Jackson Pollock, as to whether he had a particular type of human physiology which allowed him to create those patterns.",
        "Talking with Richard Taylor on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News about fractals and in this case Jackson Pollock.",
        "Are you saying, that if I understood you correctly, that he had a certain kind of physiology, the makeup of his body allowed him to stand in a certain way to drop - use gravity to drop these drippings that he did all on the canvas.",
        "That's right.",
        "So throughout the ‘90s, you know, we talked about fractals appearing in nature, but throughout the ‘90s, there was a huge explosion of study of fractals inside many of our structures inside us, for example, the lungs are fractal; but also processes this inside us, particularly ones that are automatic, that we're not consciously controlling, are being shown to have fractal characteristics to them.",
        "And one of them is the human balance, you know, when you move yourself off balance and you're swaying backwards and forwards, those sways have big sways and smaller sways and smaller sways inside them.",
        "And scientists have studied those - not me, but other scientists - and shown that the way that we balance ourselves is actually a fractal motion.",
        "So one interesting preposition, you know, given that Pollock was so dynamic is perhaps, no, not just Pollock, but perhaps, you know, increasingly we can explain different artists to deal with the way that they moved their, you know, hands even with conventional brush strokes, maybe you can learn quite a lot about, you know, the artist's physiology and if they had any sort of pathological conditions by looking at the patterns that they actually created.",
