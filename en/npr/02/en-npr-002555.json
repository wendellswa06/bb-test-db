        "And that, I think, is - that's there anyway, but the opportunities aren't available like they need to be.",
        "There is a silver lining.",
        "I think some people are realizing that one of the most important elements of recovery is that opportunity.",
        "We have in Congress now, a bill going up for appropriations as summer with the veteran's corps, which is I think a major effort to expand this model of giving veteran service opportunities instead of just seeing them as permanent charity cases.",
        "And I wonder, Ken Harbaugh, was there a moment in your life, at a party, when you're talking to somebody, or out in the street, wherever, when you said, wait a minute, that person assumes, because I was in Iraq that I'm this way or that way or that I'm - there's something about me that they just assume about me?",
        "I've been very fortunate most of my encounters with those who see me in that way have been charitable.",
        "And I imagine most veterans have the same experience.",
        "You know, I've had the hand on my shoulder at the party and, you know, the long face, and what you must have gone through, Ken.",
        "And I think the reason to be hopeful about that is that it really does come from a place of concern.",
        "And we can tap into that by convincing our countrymen that, yeah, you know, we might have seen things that you haven't and done things that we wish no one would have to, but we're not permanently broken.",
        "There are still a lot left that we can do.",

        "Pretty good.",

        "I think that Americans do feel like they're supporting veterans.",
        "But in my experience, it's kind of a culture of victimhood in America.",
        "And that's how most people see veterans through that prism of us being victims.",
        "And victimization is not - it's almost the opposite of everything the military stands for.",
        "So, even if you're wounded, even if you've got, you know, even if you were blown up, you still don't see yourself in that way.",
        "But yet that's the only way that I feel like most Americans see and understand us.",
        "All right.",
        "Give me an example of how that works?",
        "Well, you know, this isn't something that I've experienced personally, because I live in Fayetteville.",

        "Army town, I'm going to say, yeah.",
        "Yeah, the typical Army town, so everybody kind of knows what we're all about down here.",
        "But I see, like, you know, just when I turned on the news and when I watch, you know, \"\"Oprah\"\" and stuff like that and the way that - the way that through trying to do the right thing, but the way that Americans see veterans, you know, whether it's PTSD, the scandals at Walter Reed like veterans not - you know, wounded veterans not being properly cared for, all these things were we're victims and something needs to be set right to fix us.",
        "And I just don't - I think that some of those things are valid but at the same time, that's not the way we see ourselves.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Thanks for the call, Mike.",
        "If there's anything that bothers me even more than the stereotype in general -Mike talked about PTSD, and it's the stereotype of those with PTSD, and the conflation of PTSD with sociopath - the idea that because you have a brain injury or psychological trauma, you're somehow unable to not only adjust to civilian life, but you're a danger to those around you.",
        "And again, I think that most of the time, this is born out of a place of genuine concern but it can do lasting damage and, God forbid, we let the same narrative established itself about my generation of veterans as we see having been established about the Vietnam generation of veterans.",
        "I'm also a professor at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.",

        "…have seen it, listeners have viewed it on Youtube, but it's been seen a couple million times.",
        "But the veteran in the classroom is, you know, of course, belligerent, a danger to himself, to others and his teacher.",
        "Even if that video is produced with the intent to help reintegrate veterans, the attitude does more harm than good.",
        "Just the other night, I was watching a major show on network TV in which the bank robbers were all veterans, were all suffering from PTSD, and my favorite part, recruited at the local VA.",

        "Are they seen or treated different than male vets?",
        "One of my favorite stories of a - one of our fellows, a woman staff sergeant truck driver in Iraq.",
        "I'm sure you know that, at least legally, women aren't supposed to be in front line of combat, but there is no front line in Iraq.",
        "It happens whether we admit or not.",
        "She suffered 100 percent hearing loss in both ears and eventually Meniere's disease.",
        "And she spent the first month after coming home, wondering if she'd ever be useful again, because in her case she was very well taken care of physically but she was never given that challenge.",
        "And when you think about veterans and what motivates them, what motivates guys like Mike from Fayetteville, it's challenge.",
        "I mean that's why they joined in the first place.",
        "And to think that they'll simply accept help for the rest of their lives because of an injury sustained on duty is a denial of everything that veterans are."

        "But the point I wanted to bring up on this particular subject is having returned, having - being fortunate to return to go to college to graduate with honors and to be instructed how to do a resume, I will never forget myself and the corpsman who were brought up to the front of the room after we filled out the requisite form and followed to the instructions we'd had military service, wrote down what we had done and what we had received for what we have done and was immediately told to remove our references.",

        "And I continued on to discover why these images existed and did a complete study at the time, this is late 70s, of where those images came from and if there's anything to substantiate those images, including doing microfiche of 10 years at the New York Times to see if any of the images in Hollywood.",
