        "Whenever there is a doctor-patient relationship, there is non-verbal communication going on.",
        "And sometimes that can be very difficult and can be confused, so clinicians can call something psychopathological that might be more related to the person's culture.",
        "And sometimes there can be the other mistake of calling something cultural that might in fact be psychopathological.",
        "To avert mistakes like that, the staff of San Francisco General's ethic focus units reflects the cultures of the patients they're treating.",

        "That is a part of every human being.",
        "The debate over cultural competency in the medical field, and especially the idea of mandatory cultural training, has occupied the headlines of major American medical publications.",

        "You know, it got people talking.",
        "And Patricia Arquette actually did get involved.",
        "And she went out there, and she talked.",
        "And, of course, she can use Twitter, and she can use social media, and she can reach people.",

        "Robert Kelner has a client base that tends toward the conservative.",
        "These joint fundraising committees have been popular for years, but not like they're going to be.",
        "Kelner predicts that party leaders and lawmakers will rush to start their own joint fundraising committees, and that will tip the scales of power.",
        "I think it'll be another way that the leadership and committee chairs assert themselves over their colleagues.",
        "Which, in turn, might be bad news for the national parties.",
        "There's already been a tremendous shift of power away from the national parties to outside groups like 501(c)(4) organizations and SuperPACs.",
        "This could be another development that redirects power away from the parties, to candidates."
