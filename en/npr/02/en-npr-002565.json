        "How is this going to affect things, do you think, in Indiana and North Carolina?",
        "Well, obviously, he had to have gotten to a point where he felt he had no choice, because Jeremiah Wright had been the topic of conversation of the campaign for days.",
        "He had done - Reverend Wright had done a \"\"trifecta,\"\" appearing with Bill Moyers at the NAACP in Detroit, and of course, at the National Press Club where his performance - I don't know how else to describe it - really became distraction for the Obama campaign.",
        "So obviously it was tough for him to see - you know, when he spoke that eloquent speech in Philadelphia last month about race and racial healing, he went out of his way not to break from Reverend Wright.",
        "This time he felt he had no choice.",
        "We're going to be talking more about this with Representatives Watt and Sheila Jackson-Lee.",
        "But six days to go, this is obviously bad news.",
        "Well, it is.",
        "And obviously there's a perception, at least in Washington, that Hillary Clinton is on the ascendancy, even though Barack Obama, since his nine-, ten-point loss in Pennsylvania, has been picking up more superdelegates than she has.",
        "He's picked up nine, including several today and yesterday.",
        "And she has about five or six since then.",
        "So it's interesting, for all the amount of attention and good headlines she got out of Pennsylvania, he's still picking up more and more delegates.",
        "But obviously, there's nervousness about the numbers.",
        "There's a sign that he may be declining somewhat in North Carolina, where he's had a double-digit lead for the longest time.",
        "And of course, the last poll I saw was a week ago in Indiana where he was up by five.",
        "That may have narrowed in the wake of the Wright controversy.",
        "And one of the superdelegates that Senator Clinton did pick up is the governor of North Carolina.",
        "Not a shabby endorsement six days ahead of the primary."

        "She met with Richard Scaife, the publisher of the Pittsburgh Tribune, who has been a long-time Clinton critic.",
        "He was the one who was funding all the Watergate and Monica Lewinsky stuff against the Clintons back in the early '90s.",

        "Edward Brooke was a Republican.",

        "Ed Brooke, of course, didn't run, but he was a Republican.",

        "I was on his campaign bus.",
        "Although he had trouble addressing that question to Roger Mudd in that famous question in 1979.",

        "But I'm just wondering if this ad may be outdated now, given the fact that before Barack Obama would not break from Reverend Wright.",

        "Has the Democratic Party figured out what they're going to do with those delegates?",

        "Barack Obama says, no, it should be split evenly because it didn't count.",
        "There's a new solution, a new suggestion, out there that will give her about ten more delegates than he, in Michigan.",
        "I thought it was going to be the 48-state flag with the solution.",
