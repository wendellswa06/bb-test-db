        "And the feeling, the understanding, was that had Barack Obama done better than he did in Pennsylvania, or even won Pennsylvania on April 22, a lot of these would have come out and endorsed Barack Obama.",
        "Obviously, it's tough for them to come out now that she seems to be on roll, having won Pennsylvania.",
        "But even today, Baron Hill, the congressman from Indiana, has endorsed Barack Obama.",
        "Yesterday, Congressman Ben Chandler from Kentucky, which votes pretty soon, David Wu, a congressman from Oregon, which votes soon, also endorsed Obama.",

        "Then on Monday, Reverend Wright broke his silence and defended his earlier remarks in an appearance at the National Press Club, and characterized Senator Obama's reaction as mere politics.",
