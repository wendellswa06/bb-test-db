        "All right.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Amy.",
        "And well, I'm certain that Senator Obama would like to switch the conversation to issues that he thinks are important for the country today.",
        "I think we all would like to switch the issues back to the real kitchen-table issues of the economy and the war and education and healthcare.",
        "This is a major distraction.",
        "And I'm not saying that race shouldn't be discussed.",
        "Obviously, we need to have an open discussion about race in this country and be honest about it, but we shouldn't do it in the context of some outrageous statement that any minister or any individual makes.",
        "It needs to be in a more reasonable setting and without the kind of glare that the media and others have cast upon this issue.",
        "It's Wednesday.",
        "We're with the political junkie, Ken Rudin, here at the Newseum.",
        "Our guest is Congressman Mel Watt, a Democrat from North Carolina and a supporter of Senator Barack Obama.",
        "We also invited Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee to be with us.",
        "She is a Democrat from Texas and supports Hillary Clinton.",
        "Evidently she could not make it to the broadcast.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "Ken?",
        "One quick comment regarding what Congressman Watt just said.",
        "Yes, Barack Obama is held to a higher standard.",
        "I think he should be, because he's the first - he's making history, just as John Kennedy was held to a higher standard regarding the Catholic religion.",
        "Now we don't even think about what Catholics are running for president.",
        "And Mitt Romney was as a Mormon.",
        "And Mitt Romney, too.",
        "But I'm saying, so when you're first in that, you are, fortunately or unfortunately, held to this higher standard.",
        "Do you think that's fair, Congressman?",
        "Well, hold the person to a higher standard, but remember, Reverend Wright is not a candidate in this presidential election.",
        "And I don't know what else Barack could do at this point to further distance himself, sever the relationship, disavow, you know, in this - whatever perception people have that Reverend Wright has this super control over him."

        "I think it's appropriate to hold Barack to a higher standard, and I think he meets that higher standard.",
        "But it seems to me that what we're doing now is saddling him with burdens of people who - that create a different standard here.",
        "We've never saddled other political candidates with those kinds of burdens.",
        "Suppose President Kennedy had disagreed with the Pope on some issues.",
        "And it's particularly, you know, interesting and amusing to sort of see your professor mentioned in the news several times a week.",
        "Would we be asking him to withdraw himself from the Catholic Church, back in the middle of that campaign?",
        "I mean, it's just - I agree that all presidential candidates have to be held to a high standard, perhaps a higher standard than anybody.",
        "But this isn't about Barack Obama anymore.",
        "It's about Reverend Wright, somebody that's not a candidate here.",
        "Congressman, thanks very much for your time today.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Mel Watt, a Democrat from North Carolina.",
        "He represents the 12th district there.",
        "A supporter, as you heard, of Senator Barack Obama.",
        "And again, we invited a supporter of Senator Clinton, Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, to be with us, and she obviously couldn't make it.",
        "But Ken Rudin, before you go, this presents both an opportunity and a quandary for Senator Clinton.",
        "Does she exploit this controversy?",
        "Well, there are some people who say that she has been.",
        "There were comments made by her husband during the South Carolina primary.",
        "There was a comment by Bill Clinton, just the other day, who said that the Obama campaign and the media are playing the race card on him.",
        "You know, that they're using it on him.",
        "And you know, that's Bill Clinton being Bill Clinton.",
        "But look, I think it's beyond Bill Clinton.",
        "But I think Hillary Clinton does have a comment to say.",
        "She could - look, at the last debate, if you remember, out of nowhere she raised the name of Minister Farrakhan.",
        "Now, some people thought that that was playing the race card as well.",
        "So Hillary Clinton does have a responsibility, as does Barack Obama, as does the media, into how to frame this issue.",
        "But certainly, we have not heard from her, and it would be very - that's why I would have loved to have heard Sheila Jackson-Lee today talk about what the Clinton campaign has in mind for this.",
        "The question might come up when Senator Clinton appears tonight with Bill O'Reilly."

        "That's certainly true.",
        "When you look at what has already happened in places like Ohio and Pennsylvania, this is particularly important because some of the racially-sensitive groups there have said that, well, when they vote, they take race into consideration.",
        "And when you look at the exit polls in Ohio, for example, it was about 20 percent.",
        "It's probably about 30 percent, because social scientists know that people tend to understate their views having to do with race.",
