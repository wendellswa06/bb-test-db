        "I'm a student at American University.",
        "And I'm just wondering, obviously, most people would consider it to be a smart political move on Obama's part to cut ties with Reverend Wright at this point, but can you pinpoint any specific groups of people who will probably cut ties with Obama at this point as a result, and not support him anymore after this controversy?",
        "Well, thanks for that question.",
        "It's from my alma mater.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I think that, you know, the black community right now is conflicted, because on the one hand, Reverend Wright has a lot of support in the black community.",
        "He's been around 30 years.",
        "He's nationally recognized.",
        "His church is a model for the kind of, sort of, ministries - he's got 70 ministries in that church, and so...",
        "And for the last month, Senator Obama has asked people to rally around him.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And yesterday there were 400 ministers at Shiloh Baptist Church here in Washington, D.C., supporting him.",
        "So he's got a lot of support.",
        "So for those people who think, well, you know, this is about the black church, not a presidential candidate, some of those people feel very conflicted about this issue.",
        "On the other hand, I've got a - I've been on a lot of shows and I've heard a lot of comments from people who say, well, you know, he's messing up the chance for a black to be president of the United States for the first time, and we don't like it.",
        "The black community right now is split, and some of the people who think that the black church should be privileged may not vote for Barack Obama.",
        "But I think that that is probably going to be a relatively small population.",
        "Let's get Greg on the line, and Greg's calling us from Raleigh in North Carolina.",
        "Hello?",
        "Hi, you're on the air, Greg."

        "Yes, I just want to make a comment about the Reverend Wright's view.",
        "My question is - and it's kind of a vague question, but I don't understand how, if someone like Reverend Wright speaks out a lot like this about the problems of America that he feels are problems in America, why doesn't he just move out of America?",
        "Perhaps because he was born here and lived his whole life here.",
        "Well, I understand that, but he's obviously very unhappy here.",
        "So why doesn't he move to somewhere else where he will be happy?",
        "Well, maybe he's just trying to make this country a better place, like a lot of us.",

        "And I know your listeners will find it humorous, I was rushing to the wrong studio.",
        "But you're so important that I've rushed back.",
        "And I thank you for your courtesy of extending the courtesy to me.",

        "So we may even come up and talk about that another time.",
        "But we wanted to ask you today about the controversy, obviously, that's facing Senator Obama with the Congress, his back and forth with Reverend Wright.",
        "And the - well, both the opportunity and the conundrum this presents to Senator Clinton.",
        "What does she do now?",
        "Well, you know, first of all, this is a sad day, I'm sure, as it relates to Senator Obama.",
        "He made that known as we heard him speak on yesterday.",
        "And Senator Clinton stays the course, and I applaud her for the tone and the demeanor and the actions that she's taken, frankly.",
        "She has stayed on message and on focus to North Carolina and Indiana.",
        "And I do believe that the question will be, who is best prepared to lead this government and this nation amongst the many, as I said, trials and tribulations of now?",
        "And that is, of course, high gasoline prices.",
        "She's come out with a solution on a moratorium.",
        "It's not a permanent solution but a moratorium for the summer on gas taxes.",
        "The whole idea, which is so very important to many of us in our congressional districts, real universal access to healthcare, bringing the troops home and jobs, jobs, jobs.",
        "I've seen her in Pennsylvania.",
        "I think there is a connection going on now with Senator Clinton, as evidenced by the 50 to 34, that she's winning the Independent vote, the nine points that she leads Senator McCain.",
        "Bays and beans.",
        "You don't - it was mentioned earlier in this broadcast that during the last debate - she will not get another one before the North Carolina and Indiana primaries.",
        "But in the last debate, she did raise the name of Reverend Farrakhan, Minister Farrakhan.",
        "And would you expect that that might come up, again, tonight in her conversation with, for example, Bill O'Reilly?",
        "Well, I think anything that comes up with candidates is pursuant to a question, and certainly you would want anyone to answer their questions.",
        "All of the people that support Senator Clinton probably have different views on a lot of things that she says, but her answers come pursuant to questions.",
        "She answers from the heart.",
        "She answers truthfully."

        "But at the same time, there's no doubt that Senator Clinton embraces the rich diversity of this nation, the diversity of thought.",
        "She recognizes people have their opinions.",
        "She is clearly someone who doesn't run away from diversity, as evidenced by her participating in the \"\"State of the Black Union\"\" with Tavis Smiley, a very well-thought-out message as she went to Memphis for the 40th anniversary.",
        "Senator Clinton will answer questions but her message is to stay on course and to talk about the issues.",

        "I saw the connectedness as individuals from all economic backgrounds and demographics were there in that state, reaching out, not on divisive issues.",

        "Yes.",
        "And that's very interesting because when you look at the fact that Hillary Clinton has not, sort of, commented on this.",
        "She is following that rule.",
        "On the other hand, of course, John McCain has.",
        "He has taken advantage of it.",
        "That gives you a hint as to what might happen this fall.",
        "Except that I think, by this fall, given the fact that this is such a hot issue right now, it may be old news.",

        "I'm sorry.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Ron Walters, the other day in the National Press Club, Reverend Wright didn't say my remarks were taken out of context.",
        "He said let me expand on some of those remarks.",
        "Right.",
        "And he made it even worse.",

        "I know.",
        "But you yourself are - someone on the panel said that, you know, the reverend is a very important reverend in the black church, and I'm sure that there's a kind of talk or something that's well-known not just to parishioners but among the leaders themselves of some of the churches.",
        "You know, I heard that Oprah Winfrey wanted to be a member of the church and she said, no way, I'm out of here.",
