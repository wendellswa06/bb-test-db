        "He had a lot of things that I'm sure kept him from attending church every Sunday, so I would take him at his word for that.",

        "I'm not sure that that washes.",
        "And I think that what we have done is that we've put a lot of focus on Reverend Wright and on Barack Obama.",
        "We ought to put a little focus and we ought to do what Barack Obama said about challenging American people.",
        "That tremendous speech on race was designed to do that.",
        "To ask people that they lay down racism at their feet and not carry it into the voting booth, and not make it, sort of, the evaluation that they use.",
        "And so I think that we've - and it's very difficult to find, you know, how many people and so forth.",

        "Now the question seems to be, at least in the white community, is he too black?",
        "Is he, again, a Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, the black candidate?",
