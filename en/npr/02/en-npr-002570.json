        "So the idea is to take cells, grow them in culture, and allow them to grow enough that you recreate the meat?",

        "Basically, it is the field what is moving already, last 20 years, called tissue engineering.",
        "But tissue engineering focusing on creating tissue and organs for repair and replacement in human body, and the novelty of our approach is that we want to think about another aspect of tissue engineering to create basically food.",

        "What are some of the challenges that await you?",
        "I can say that basically there is five main challenges.",
        "Number one, you must of course find appropriate cell source.",
        "And there is two groups of the people - two point of views.",
        "One belief that you must start from embryonic cells because they are multipotent, and they have high proliferation potential.",
        "But because they are not differentiated, you know, you must spend a lot of effort to force them to go to skeletal muscle lineage and it needs special grow factors or transcription factors, therefore it is challenging.",
        "But the good sense of it, embryonic cells that they can - embryonic stem cells that they can proliferate and they have very low conflict(ph) effect.",
        "So, the second group of the people believe that it is better to start from so-called myoblast.",
        "It's a progenitor cell - it is a cell which has a periphery of skeletal fibers, which is already committed to be a skeletal muscle.",
        "But from another side, their proliferation potential, so-called traffic number, is a little bit limited.",
        "So what will be the decision?",
        "What will be solution?",
        "It will show the time.",
        "And what do you grow the cells in?",
        "Oh, that's very good question.",
        "That's the second question because in standard cell culture, people use, of course, some kind of fluid which imitate blood, without erythrocytes of course, and the main component of cell culture media is serum which has animal origin.",
        "So there's not any point to create animal-free tissue-engineered meat if you still use animal-derived serum.",
        "So the challenge is to design so-called defined cell culture media which contain all necessary and sufficient elements to allow cells to grow and don't contain any unknown element like black box, like serum, and also which is relatively economically reasonable, because I can say that serum and cell culture is very expensive now."

        "How close to texture feel taste would the synthetic meat, so to speak, the test-tube meat come to normal real meat from an animal?",
        "This is again an interesting point, but I don't believe - and I don't believe it's necessary that tissue-engineered meat must have taste and texture of real chicken meat.",
        "There's two reasons for this.",
        "Number one, if you go to grocery store, there's a lot of product which doesn't have any taste of real meat or real skeletal muscle like nuggets or sausage, you know.",
        "So the point is to create a protein which - healthy animal protein.",
        "That's one aspect.",
        "The second aspect is technological.",
        "If you really want to create meat with the taste and texture, that's became much more challenging because then you must produce not only skeletal fibers from myoblast, you must also produce fat tissue which is not a big deal and also produce blood vessels because if the tissue became very thick then you must have blood culture and then you must have connective tissue which create this texture, and that became very, very complicated.",
        "And most important it's not scalable, and if it's not scalable then it's not industrial-friendly.",
        "If it's not industrial-friendly, then you'll never produce this in a large scale.",

        "I'm Guy Raz.",
        "Yeah, there's some people who believe - actually there's a discussion Web site in Europe, and they don't like the idea of tissue-engineered meat.",
        "They call this American cultural imperialism, McDonald's again, but one name for this technology.",
        "They call this hydroponic meat, and I think this reflects the point.",
        "We don't use any genetical engineering.",
        "We don't modify the cells.",
        "We use natural cells and try to put them in natural or, we call this bio-mimicking environment, and we want to create tissue which look like natural tissue.",
        "So, there's no any genetical modification here.",
        "And concerning the mushrooms, I hear of two type of discussion.",
        "One people say that you can use this for cell culture media which I don't understand completely.",
        "And another interesting idea that if you look at mushrooms, they have so-called chitosan and chitosan is very interesting polymer because, number one, it's eatable and number two, it absorbs fat.",
        "So, basically, you can create - if you combine - use chitosan as a scaffold or temporal support for these cells, and cells need support because they are attachment-dependent.",
        "If you grow them all in suspension, they will not grow.",
        "They must attach to something.",
        "If you attach them to the bottom, then you have only limit scaffold(ph).",
        "So, fills(ph) or sponges that will increase surface area for cells and to make technology more effective.",
        "So, chitosan, which is eatable and which also absorbs fat, can create tissue-engineering meat which will be not only useful, but also can be sold as a functional food because it can reduce fat consumption.",
        "So, you could have a big giant portabello mushroom that already looks and tastes almost like beef, but actually have real beef in it?",
        "Look, I'm an animal specialist, OK?",
        "And you ask me questions about mushrooms.",
        "OK, we'll move on to it.",
        "We'll move on to stuff that's right here a little more - our listeners are very eager to talk about this.",
        "But you could make the meat, as you say, to specification.",
        "You could make it less fatty, or for example, or more nutritious as you'd like to produce it?",
        "I think if you - the taste of the meat depends on percent of fat.",
        "Therefore, we can take again stem cells and force them to be fat cells.",
        "And then we can make mixture of skeletal fibers with the fat cells.",
        "Therefore, in this context it's not a big challenge.",
        "The second aspect is how to make texture.",
        "I think that's the challenging stuff.",
