        "And then he jerry-rigs this screen to these goggles so that he has a computer literally sitting in front of his eye.",
        "And then he has a keyboard for one hand, and then he programs it so that, you know, he's constantly taking notes on everything around him.",

        "He wears it all the time.",

        "So the question is, like, is a computer a tool like any other, or is its power to change us so much greater that it is in its own category?",
