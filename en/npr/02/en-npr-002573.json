        "One thing that I have talked to the class about is - however well-conceived your strategy might be, if you've done a really bad job of explaining it and confused people about it, and undermined public confidence in what you're doing - if you haven't done as good a job as you need to do to explain the policy to the public, you can wind up taking an operation that is really important and is worth the effort and losing it because the public stops supporting it.",

        "Well, it's a risk.",
        "It's clearly a risk.",
        "I mean, you see that with the congressional debates.",

        "Soon, the jurors were listening to Libby's disembodied voice, swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth at his first grand jury appearance in 2004.",
        "Almost immediately there is the voice of prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald telling Libby that he does not have to answer questions, that he can stop at any point and evoke his constitutional right not to incriminate himself, but that if he answers questions and gives false testimony, it would be extremely serious, and he would be subject to prosecution for perjury.",

        "Asked about a similar conversation with the CIA's Grenier, Libby said, I recall talking to him about something, but not about this.",
