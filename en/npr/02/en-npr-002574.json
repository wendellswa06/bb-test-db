        "Oh, what the heck his name is, that knucklehead.",
        "Being the case, once we do that, Pakistan will be stabilized as well, and because of the fact that they're nuclear power, we need make sure that they are stable country as well.",
        "We have a lot invested in that area.",
        "I'd like to see that we actually get some return from this and these people get to live a better life.",
        "Mike Davidson, there was little doubt in what President-elect Obama said today that he thinks Afghanistan ought to be among if not, at the top of the priority list.",
        "Major Gen.",
        "DAVIDSON: I think he believes that, and I think he is absolutely correct, but he also knows that that reordering that David is talking about will be more effective in Afghanistan than more tanks, more planes, more bombs, more cruise missiles.",
        "We need to take a more nuanced, subtle approach other than just killing everybody in sight.",
        "And I think this team is well structured to do that.",
        "David Sanger, let me follow up also on Dennis' point about Pakistan under Secretary of Defense Gates, the United States has been dropping an awful lot of bombs on al-Qaeda and Taliban targets inside Pakistan in the Alzeeristan(ph) and the tribal areas in Pakistan itself.",
        "It's unclear to me whether a President Obama would continue that policy though he said, again, during the campaign, if given actionable intelligence and if Pakistan declined to go after important targets, he would.",
        "Major Gen.",
        "DAVIDSON: It's going to be tough.",
        "I think there are two bright issues, hopeful issues coming up on the Africa situation.",
        "One is, I think the Obama campaign transition team has rehabilitated Samantha Powers, if I've got that name right.",
        "The one that wrote the book, \"\"The Issue from Hell.",
        "You know, Neal, I heard something in the press conference today that I had not heard him say before and it was in the very last line, the last question of the press conference.",
        "In the past, the Obama team had always said that President-elect Obama would go into Pakistan to get al-Qaeda, and they sort of stopped it right there.",
        "What President Bush and Secretary Gates have done starting in the summer with a series of secret orders that the president signed is go after a much wider group of targets, other militants who are seeking to destabilize the Pakistani government as well as Afghanistan.",
        "And for the first time today, I heard President-elect Obama say he also would go after a wider group of targets, and I thought that was interesting.",
        "And maybe he didn't - the Bush team has gone after targets in other countries too, including Syria, and it's unclear as to whether a President-elect Obama would continue that."

        "And General Mike, let me ask you, one of the things that President-elect Obama also talked about was continuing plans to enlarge the United States ground forces, more divisions for the Army, another division or so for the Marine Corps as well.",
        "This is going to cost an awful lot of money yet the Army and the Marine Corps, especially taking the brunt of the overstretch that we continue to talk about in terms of Iraq.",

        "Seventy-five percent of the Army's budget goes to our total personnel costs.",

        "It's gone up to 25 to 85 percent over the last eight years depending on who is doing accounting.",

        "Much of it's being given or will be given to the Iraqi forces as we turn over more and more responsibility to them.",
        "And so, there is going to be another hidden bill out here which is just rebuilding the ordinary rolling stock that the Army needs.",
        "You've seen President-elect Obama say that he wants to spend vastly more on this humanitarian side and civilian side of the program.",
        "He had said $25 billion in the first four years through 2012.",
        "And then as Mike as pointed out, you've got this big military bill coming, and it's not as if we are in a time when there is excess cash washing around.",

        "Afghanistan is simply a product of this war.",

        "ISI, a virtually independent part of the Pakistani government in the military leadership recently now said to being brought under control of the new civilian leadership in Pakistan, David Sanger, but nevertheless, this is a problem not just on the Afghan side of Pakistan but in the Indian side of Pakistan too and Kashmir.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Your caller is exactly right.",
        "One of the Army's top generals said to me a couple of weeks ago, you know, David, we can't solve Afghanistan without solving the Pakistan problem but just solving the Pakistan problem will not solve Afghanistan.",
        "The subset of that is, you can't solve the Pakistan problem without solving the ISI problem.",
        "There have been various efforts at various times of putting the intelligence service under the civilian control in Pakistan.",
        "Almost all of those efforts have failed.",
        "It usually been under the control of the military in fact, the current head of the Pakistan military, General Kiani is a former head of the ISI.",
        "In the Bush administration, many people did not want to see the ISI brought under civilian control because their concern was the civilians get turned over pretty quickly, and the military is actually the one stable institution.",
        "And I think this is going to be a big problem that President Obama is going to have to face.",
        "Mike Davidson, the president-elect was asked a couple of times today if the United States claims the right to go after terrorists in other countries, doesn't India claim that same right, shouldn't it be able to go after terrorist bases, it might be able to identify inside Pakistan?",
        "Of course, those are both nuclear armed countries that have fought any number of wars in the past, could be an extremely dangerous situation.",
        "Major Gen.",
        "DAVIDSON: It could be but there is a reason they call them transnational threats because they're transnational.",
        "So we have the right to go in and other folks do if there is an imminent threat, and let me follow up on something David was talking about.",
        "Our last clear success in Afghanistan, I think, came when we supported the Northern alliance and displaced the Taliban regime.",
        "That was a total about 250 special operations forces, troops, and maybe a 150-200 intelligence operatives from the CIA.",
        "The key part was, as David said, the Russians fought there for 10 years and lost.",
        "We fought for about six weeks and made a lot of progress.",
        "The key part was we were supporting a legitimate, indigenous movement.",
        "This is an issue the Afghan folks are going to have to figure out for themselves and win for themselves.",
        "Americans can't go in there and win it for them."

        "Sure.",
        "All right.",

        "That's right.",
        "I think that it won't be surprising to me if President-elect Obama gets advice that goes something like this, show interest early on in the Middle East peace process but don't try to strike a deal now with this set of governments because as you say, Israelis are in fair a bit of chaos, which has worked to President-elect Obama's advantage in that they are not threatening immediate action on Iran under these circumstances.",
        "The Palestinians are wildly divided, and I suspect you may see him concentrate first on trying to support the Israeli-Syrian peace process and try to peel the Syrians away first from Iran.",
        "And then turn after that to the peace process.",
        "It's a very tough balancing act because many believe that President Bush came far too late to the peace process and by the time he did, the Palestinians were so divided that there was really no one to negotiate with.",
