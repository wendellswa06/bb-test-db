        "DAVIDSON: And I think it's a good sign that there is sensitivity to African issues.",
        "More importantly, there is a new combatant commander called Africa Command.",
        "And the deputy is a civilian, most of the folks in the headquarters - almost half will be civilian.",
        "It was a close call whether that should have been a State Department activity or a Pentagon activity.",
        "Pentagon one - President Obama may go back and revisit that issue.",
        "It'd be a good message to send.",
        "We're talking with Retired General Mike Davidson who's with us from WFPL, our member station in Louisville, Kentucky.",

        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "I wonder and worry about Joe Biden's role within the security team just announced.",
        "He's perhaps the most knowledgeable of them all when it comes to world affairs, of course, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
        "Will he be shoved aside, disgruntled and so be a loss to the Obama team?",
        "He was among those who spoke today at the news conference.",
        "I guess, David Sanger, the first time we've heard from the vice president-elect since Election Day.",
        "We have and I think that was quite deliberate.",
        "I think they brought him out there in part to say he too will be part of the team, and in part to remind us that he too was elected.",
        "And that he spoke at some length.",
        "He may serve a very critical role that Senator Clinton can also serve which is you don't get much of this agenda done and particularly you don't get this shift of resources to civilian capability done if you don't get Congress to fund it.",
        "And in fact the past efforts that they have had to get civilian reserve corps going have usually run into funding problems.",
        "And so I think that you'll end up seeing him work both sides of that.",
        "Now, let's get to Chuck on the line.",
        "Chuck with us from Ann Arbor in Michigan.",
        "Yes, thank you for taking my call.",
        "I believe the biggest threat right now for President-elect Obama is the new pact Russia has made with Venezuela and the maneuvers they're having.",
        "Russia's naval maneuvers off the coast to Venezuela at this present time and...",
        "President Medvedev also touring that part of the world, I think, last week.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Well, I heard on the radio last night on this station that Russia became an ally and committed its troops too and their full, you know, ally and ships to Venezuela.",
        "Well, the degree of their mutual cooperation remains to be seen, Chuck.",
        "But nevertheless, General Davidson, Russia and the direction of foreign policy in the near abroad is what they describe it in Russia to clear their activities against Georgia and intimidation of Ukraine and they are of course Europe's major energy supplier at the moment and the influence they have there.",
        "Is that what President-elect Obama was talking about with trying to reestablish old alliances in a lot of our European partners?",
        "Major Gen.",
        "DAVIDSON: I hope so.",
        "I'm not sure of it.",
        "I certainly hope it was.",
        "What in the world did anyone think we could do in Georgia?",
        "During the Cold War, we could have 10 divisions fighting in 10 days, four divisions were prominently stationed in Europe, six division sets of equipment were permanently stationed in Europe.",
        "But right now, we've gone from 10 divisions in 10 days to six divisions in six months anywhere around the world.",
        "That was our schedule for Desert Storm.",
        "That was the schedule for Iraq, for a much smaller force.",
        "So, Russia is going to have its way and its region, and I'm not sure what military solution anyone thought we would have."
