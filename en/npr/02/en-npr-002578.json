        "Are there serious differences in the way to take the countries between these two groups, or is it mainly a question of whose party's leaders are in control?",

        "They see the southern Shiite region of the country as one of these states, and it's got the vast majority of the oil resources there.",
        "So, I think they see the Shiites as benefiting if the country were to break up into these states.",
        "On the other hand, Muqtada al-Sadr wants a strong unified central government, partly because of the religious belief of the Sadr movement.",
        "They really believe that a strong central government is in keeping with Islamist beliefs.",
        "They believe in the prophecy of a mythical Imam that will come forward and unite all the countries of the world into Islamic faith.",
        "Is there any danger the differences between these two armed groups could lead to a civil war just as easily as differences between Shias and Sunnis could?",
        "Well, a lot of analysts do say that.",
        "If a civil war were to emerge here Iraq, or full scale civil war, then intra-Shiite civil war would be just as likely as the Shiite versus Sunni civil war, that not only would Sunnis and Shiites be fighting each other, but factions within the Shiite community would be fighting each other.",
        "At the same time, Muqtada al-Sadr has tried to work within the political system many times in the last year, so he might tell his militia to calm down and try to work within politics to resolve the matter."
