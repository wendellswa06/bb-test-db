        "But complying with air pollution standards doesn't mean emissions are benign.",
        "The cement kiln at Chanute was putting out about 500 pounds of mercury a year.",
        "In boom years, when the plant is operating full-blast, says Craig Volland, an environmental consultant who advises the Kansas Sierra Club on air pollution issues.",
        "That would compare to maybe about 170 pounds a year at a major coal-fired power plant.",
        "So in the year 2004, for example, the Chanute facility was the second-largest emitter of mercury in Kansas.",
        "And it and 15 other cement kilns in eight states get paid to burn hazardous waste, turning fuel costs into income.",
        "The Chanute plant was the first in the nation to get a permit for that 15 years ago.",
        "The permits allow more pollution of some toxins, compared to hazardous waste incinerators.",
        "Jim Pew is with the environmental group Earth Justice.",
        "The problem with cement plants that burn hazardous waste is that they're not designed to burn hazardous waste.",
        "In my view, it's a loophole for the cement industry.",
        "Compared to actual hazardous waste incinerators, older cement kilns, like the one in Chanute, can pump out four times the amount of certain toxic pollutants.",
        "New cement kilns can pump out 18 times the lead and cadmium and 15 times the mercury.",
        "But emissions are measured in such miniscule amounts that the differences between kilns and incinerators are insignificant, says Mike Benoit, an industry spokesman.",
        "We're talking about nanograms.",
        "We're talking about micrograms, you know, millionths of a gram, billionths of a gram.",
        "But given the mercury emissions permitted at Ash Grove, the miniscule amounts can add up, which worries Jeff Galemore's father, John."

        "That's really the focus that both EPA and the Kansas department have, is to make sure that that permit is doing what it's designed to do, and that is provide an adequate margin of health and safety.",
        "EPA is actually trying to severely cut mercury emissions nationwide, especially at cement kilns, which are targeted for a 92 percent reduction.",
        "Kilns that burn hazardous waste would be exempt, given the special category of regulation Congress carved out for them alone.",
        "And EPA's Brooks seems completely unconcerned about the mercury emissions at Ash Grove.",
        "Every test that's been done, every inspection that's been done, verifies that there is full compliance with every relevant part of that permit, including the mercury part.",
        "Compliance is based on a complicated formula, beginning with what's reasonably achieved with the technology available when standards were written.",
        "Also considered are the actual waste burned, operating conditions of the kiln, results of occasional test burns, and exposure estimates for people downwind.",
        "Stick to the formula, the regulators say, and everyone's safe.",
        "Not to Jeff Galemore.",
        "The reason I don't trust it is they battled us so hard to do the testing.",
        "And with him in his pickup is his sister Selene Hummer.",
        "The government has to have someplace to dispose of this, so they're not going to really hammer away at somebody, because they got to have some place to put it.",
        "Regulators insist they're applying the standards as Congress directed, but the Galemores and others worry regulators are too cozy with industry.",
        "Ash Grove vice president Curtis Lesslie is a former Kansas regulator himself who drafted the company's first hazardous waste permit.",
        "And last year, Lesslie wrote to William Bider, the state's hazardous waste chief, about those new mercury standards for cement kilns.",
        "In an email obtained by NPR, Bider told colleagues the proposed rules would, quote, \"\"help put our cement plants out of business.\"\" EPA is out of control, he wrote.",
        "John Mitchell is Bider's boss at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment."
