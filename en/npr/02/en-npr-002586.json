        "You know, it baffles me in a way.",
        "Can we ever have an effective army in Iraq when there is so much sectarian anger in that country?",
        "I believe any government that's tainted by the influence of this government is going to be suspect.",
        "And there's one other thing I'd like to say.",
        "I'm soon going to Europe, and I've always loved going to Europe, and this program transmits to Europe.",
        "I'd like to say to those European listeners, America's highly divided on this issue of Iraq.",
        "Many of us came out against this war long before it started, so do not judge all Americans by the actions of this administration and their followers.",
        "Okay Roger.",
        "You know, I still want to thank you for this opportunity.",
        "Okay Roger, thanks for the call.",
        "And sectarian divisions within the Iraqi army and much more of the Iraqi police a major element of the report, Michael, and certainly a continuing problem.",
        "Absolutely, and the report is chockfull of details and one of those details which I'd like to bring out is that it's not enough to train the Iraqi army if they don't have the equipment and the logistics to get from place to place, but if we take a broader perspective the main problem in Iraq - I think people from across the political spectrum can agree - is security and rule of law, and so it raises the issue - how do we improve that?",
        "But the second thing is, in the end, you say it's military and security.",
        "Obviously, security is central - no question.",
        "But security is tied to politics.",
        "The question is there needs to be some political compromise particularly between the Shia and Sunni Arabs.",
        "I'm not sure whether creating a vacuum is the way to go.",
        "I'd much rather see very specific discussion about how to improve especially the police, which have become a haven for militias and death squads.",
        "When it comes to the Iraqi army itself, while it isn't as trained as we'd like it to be, at the same time it hasn't peeled apart and turned in on of itself like some definitions of civil war would have.",
        "May I say something on this?",
        "If you look at the report itself there is actually a very interesting little fact that is stated in the report, which says that the entire aid to the Iraqi army is less than the two-week budget of the U.S.",
        "military in Iraq, just to give you a sense of the priority of the spending, the equipment and the training that is going into the Iraqi army as opposed to just a - you know, less then two weeks worth of budget for the U.S.",
        "military in Iraq.",
        "So, obviously, there has not been a - it hasn't been the major focus of this strategy, it just gives you a sense of it."

        "But I do agree with the general point, though, that when you bring down state institutions under the most difficult circumstances where you have sectarianism it's very hard to build an army, even with all the resources that you put in.",
        "I think, you know, there are many decisions that were made that people will, you know, criticize like dismantling the Iraqi army to begin with, but a state was dismantled - an entire state.",
        "To build a state is very difficult and it's much more difficult when there's sectarianism, and I think the army equipment is only a small part of the problem.",
        "I think the loyalty issue - you know, when the Iraqi army goes into a neighborhood in Anbar people don't say here comes the liberating army, here comes our police, here comes our army.",
        "They say here comes the enemy.",
        "That is really the problem, and I think it's much more political and institutional at the core than it is effectiveness of the performance of the military.",
        "Let's get another voice into the conversation.",
        "Joining us now is Qubad Talabani.",
        "He represents the Iraqi Kurdistan regional government here in the United States.",
        "He's also the son of Iraq's president, Jalal Talabani, and he joins us from his office in Washington.",
        "Nice to have you on the program.",
        "Thank you Neal.",
        "It's a pleasure to be on.",
        "And obviously in descriptions of grave and dyer circumstances in Iraq, one of the places they were not talking about was Kurdistan.",
        "Right.",
        "They haven't really - they briefly mentioned that the security situation in the north and in parts of the south are secure and calm but unfortunately they haven't really taken into consideration when preparing this report some of the realities that exist on the ground and some of the insecurities that exist on the ground, particularly as it pertains to the thoughts and the concerns of the various communities in Iraq.",
        "And by that I assume you begin with yours.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "What this report seems to recommend is a return to some sort of centralized authority in Iraq.",
        "It seems to circumvent some of the progress and some of the political compromise that was made in Iraq's constitution, and I'm a little disappointed at the fact that how much this issue has been blown up on this report that we're seeming to forget the real important document in Iraq, and that is Iraq's democratically ratified constitution.",
        "And that, of course, provides for autonomy in regions like Kurdistan and that's what's been going on there, I guess, since 1991,long before the Iraqi constitution, of course.",
        "But as I look at the report, there are a lot of things that are asked of the Iraqi government, including figuring out how to get rid of the militias.",
        "This is going to be very difficult."

        "The militia issue is going to be very difficult because not all militias are alike.",
        "Some militias are contributing to security of the country while others are adding to the security.",
        "And again by that you mean your - the Kurdish militia, the Peshmerga, you say is supporting the state and some others are not.",
        "Well we define the Peshmerga as a regional defense force because it's a valid force that has a clear chain of command.",
        "It's visible and reports to active duty, and it is one of the reasons why the Kurdistan region is stable and secure right now.",
        "And before dismantling something is stable, that is working sounds absurd for us that are dealing with this issue.",
        "Was anybody from the commission, the study group, did they contact people in Kurdistan?",
        "Were they spoken with?",
        "Unfortunately, they didn't visit the Kurdistan region.",
        "They spoke with Kurds in Baghdad but they didn't meet with officials of the Kurdistan regional government, and I don't think they adequately gained the wishes and the desires and the requests of the Kurdistan people.",
        "Let me ask you, one of the fundamental aspects of the report is to try to convince the Iraqi government that it needs to take greater responsibility, a much greater role for its defense.",
        "Effectively, that the United States as least as a combat force is on the way out.",
        "Do you think that message has been received in Baghdad?",
        "I think the message has been received in Baghdad and I do hope that ultimately it's going to be Iraqis that are going to make the situation better or worse, and these reports are good.",
        "They can help us with guidelines.",
        "They can help inject new ideas into the debate, but it's not going to resolve the problem on the ground.",
        "It's going to be ultimately the leadership in Iraq that has to do some soul-searching, that has to reach within their constituencies and show leadership and express the desire to overcome the difficulties that we face and talk to international conferences and bringing in our neighbors and all of these things will be moot, if Iraq's leaders don't hold leadership and express a willingness to resolve the problems that we see today.",
        "And one final question, and that is two words that we heard an awful lot over the past couple of days as people were talking about this report.",
        "One of them is urgency and the other one is last chance.",
        "Was he your friend?"

        "Clearly, Iraq's presence has polarized and Iraq has polarized as a country.",
        "The fact that we haven't had a government in Baghdad that has been effective, that has delivered the basics to the citizens, that hasn't brought security to the people of the country have made the communities feel insecure about their future, which is why they have polarized into ethnic and sectarian groups.",
        "And I think what we're seeing today is the new reality in Iraq where Iraq's identity could be waning and people are feeling more secure in their ethnic or sectarian guise than in being part of this thing called Iraq.",
        "And that's what I think one of the major omissions of this report is that it fails to take note of the changing dynamics on the ground in Iraq.",
        "And if they're not managed carefully and if they're not dealt with could lead to very different circumstances.",

        "And how do you examine this report?",
        "Well, in the first instance it strikes me that it is a commission established by Congress to report to Congress and to the president of the United States, and so in a sense it's really an internal document to inform the debate going on within the United States government."

        "How do you react to the report's description of the situation in Iraq - grave and deteriorating?",

        "I mean, one of the things that we insisted on in terms of the continued presence of the multinational forces in Iraq, which we absolutely need, and continue to need to try to engender stabilities, security stability.",
        "But is absolutely necessary for us - and something that we insisted on as well - is that we have to have, as an Iraqi government and as a greater share of decision-making, and to have to have a clear, clear sort of goals as to a increased visibility, an increased control over the command structure within our country.",
        "And I think that will help as well.",
        "Clearly, that is a kind of thing that the Iraq Study Group appears to be hinting at or talking about, and it was also something that my own government is insisting upon.",
