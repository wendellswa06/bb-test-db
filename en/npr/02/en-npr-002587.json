        "That's the reality of it.",
        "But on this particular issue, in terms of what could the Iraqi government do, Mr. Talabani said a few minutes ago that it's ultimately up to the Iraqi people.",
        "I mean, one thing that the report is saying, saying yes, it's ultimately your decision and make it so, urgently, because if you're depending on us to save you or save the day, that's not going to happen.",
        "So in essence, yes.",
        "Part of this is to say, look, it's urgent; it's your responsibility.",

        "We're having to work out the political compromises and fight terrorism and an insurgency and death squads at the same time.",
        "Yet, death squads, at least in part - well, you've heard this before, but they are in the uniforms of Iraqi government officials.",

        "What they're doing, these militias, are targeting the other side's civilians.",
        "It's a pernicious problem, and you're right, there are some - as the government fully recognizes - there are some people that have sort of one foot here and one foot there, and that is something that has to be dealt with.",
        "The government is committed to the disarming of militias.",
        "That is a matter of clear policy.",
        "Of course, the difficulty is in actually undertaking the disarming of these militias.",
