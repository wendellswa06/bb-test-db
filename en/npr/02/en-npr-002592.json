        "You have bacteria staying in the mouth - more of a problem with causing cavities.",
        "So the fluoride varnish will help that too, OK?",

        "In the U.S., one of the biggest proponents of this approach is a man named John Featherstone.",
        "He's the dean of the University of California at San Francisco's Dental School.",
        "Featherstone came up with a way of measuring risk.",
        "It includes testing the level of bacteria in the mouth, looking at dietary habits, medical conditions, medications, saliva flow and history of tooth decay.",
        "Then he put his patients on personal treatment plans.",
        "The strategy worked.",
        "It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease.",
        "Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn't deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth.",
        "Traditionally, dentists were taught the only way to deal with decay was to drill it out.",
        "That's still important in some cases, but Featherstone figured that without fixing the underlying problem, bad bacteria, patients would just keep coming back for more fillings.",
        "He saw another way.",
        "It's a little bit like your car starting to rust.",
        "If you can stop the rust before the rust goes right through the body of the car, then you're in good shape.",
        "Like rust, tooth decay is a slow process.",
        "A full-on cavity is a hole that needs to be fixed.",
        "But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using treatments like varnish and concentrated fluoride toothpaste.",
        "A recent study found these techniques reduced the need for fillings in adults by 30 to 50 percent.",
        "Now it's a matter of getting insurance companies to pay.",
        "It's something they've been willing to do for kids, not always for adults.",
