        "That's jumping us ahead some centuries, to 1066 and the Norman invasion, and which you describe as not nearly one of the many invasions, but what, the...",
        "It's the mother of all invasions.",
        "The mother of all invasions.",
        "Why was that such an important moment for England, but also for English?",
        "And so English became uniquely, for that time, the language of the common people.",
        "It wasn't obliterated, although it vanishes from the written record.",
        "It survives underground on the lips of ordinary people, and so it becomes democratized at a very early stage in its development.",
        "But by the same token, the French-speaking Normans, who now rule the land, their language, French, was the language of the court and literature.",
        "But when it comes to the actual words, some of the examples really are quite vivid that you give - that English, for instance, was fire, work, strong, heart, and that French that was being used at the time are glory, cordial, fortune, guile, and sacred.",
        "Much more sophisticated.",
        "The French, they were forced to settle because they couldn't go back.",
        "Having won the conquest, it was a final step for them and they Frenchified, as it were, the English society.",
        "By the same token, they were also Anglicized, and so there was this trade between these two sides.",
        "What was it that you could say about English that gave it staying power?",
        "Now, I'm not saying for a minute that the British Empire was a benign or a culturally beneficial thing for many parts of the world.",
        "Clearly the British Empire has much to answer for.",
        "But at the level of language, the way in which it operated was very effective from the point of view of spreading English."

        "So this is a relatively new phenomenon.",
        "A few years ago, a bunch of these sites started popping up.",
        "And what they do is, they offer consumers the ability to purchase any range of goods - clothing, art, jewelry - for a limited time.",
        "You can go on a website and basically try to buy a product, you know, over a day or two days or three days.",
        "And the reason that these sites have taken off initially is because they typically offer heavily discounted prices on luxury items, in particular.",
        "And how are the sites getting the products that they're selling?",
        "Right.",
        "So, you know, just remember a few years ago - and even today, we're still in a very soft economy - but we were in a recession in the U.S., you know, in 2007, 2008, 2009.",
        "And so that provided an opening and an opportunity for these sites to emerge.",
        "And basically, what they did was, they purchased a lot of the excess inventory from the luxury, you know, apparel makers and other luxury goods makers.",
        "So they bought them all up, and then they basically resold them on the Internet for a decent margin.",
        "And is that when this business really took off, flash sales?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, it's no surprise that it took off during that time.",
        "But, you know, now that we're coming out of a recession, you know, the question for a lot of these sites is: Can they make this transition from an economy where they benefited from this excess inventory, to an economy where a lot of those product makers are curtailing the amount of excess inventory they put on the market, which is obviously going to drive up prices.",
        "I wonder, though, if shoppers are used to getting free shipping and free returns, which it doesn't look like these sites offer - at least, not the ones I've been looking at - maybe the prices aren't such a great deal anyway.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a good point, Melissa.",
        "You know, I think we're seeing the strains of this transition.",
        "And what you've seen, as you noted, is that, you know, if you're a pretty diligent shopper that, in some cases, you can actually find prices on these goods that are offered on flash sale sites on other websites for sometimes cheaper - you know, just on the flat price of it.",
        "And then other times when the prices are equivalent or near equivalent, if you factor in the shipping charges or their return charges, then you can actually sometimes find a better bargaining not going on a flash sale site.",
        "Well, a few things.",
        "The first thing is, of course, check with your supervisor - that it's great that your store has a clear policy in place, and that's the first thing you should do, is check there.",
        "And if they - the idea of these policies is to avoid any kind of conflict of interest, and the conflict being between your desire to have a plasma TV, like all decent human beings who crave that - I think it's genetic, I'm not a scientist - and your store's desire to have you make wise choices about what kind of merchandise they would stock.",
        "It's to avoid the whole graft thing."

        "What's interesting - you can call it buzz marketing - but by me that's just hipster talk for free samples.",
        "When buzz marketing gets tricky to me is when you don't know the person who's touting the thing is a paid shill, or what we ethicist call a hired liar.",
