        "Did you determine that from your study?",

        "One of the things that we know about voter turn out is that turn out comes with cost for someone who can easily take off from work and go to the polls if they have their own sources of transportation.",
        "All of these sorts of circumstances make it easier for some higher social-economic status voters to go to the polls, and those voters have a tendency to vote Republican.",
        "Now, for some voters, you know, if you're working a job or maybe even two jobs, and your boss won't let you off to go and vote, well, you might decide that, you know, it's not worth the effort.",

        "We then matched that data with weather reports from over 20,000 weather stations located in the U.S., and then we tested our model against standard variables that we would put in a normal turnout model, such a socio-economic variables and legal variables, such as what the electoral registration laws are.",

        "Wow.",

        "So, our results give the Democrats another reason to complain about Florida in 2000.",
