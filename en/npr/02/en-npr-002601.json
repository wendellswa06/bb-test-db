        "You know, they've actually scheduled performances beyond the South by Southwest performance that they're supposed to play, that they have the letter saying they should be let into the country from - they're just not allowed to do that.",
        "And many bands don't know that.",
        "Many bands probably do know and are trying to sort of sneak in and do a little bit of extra work while they're here.",
        "But there are a bunch as well who think that they have and are saying that they have been turned away for reasons that have more to do with increased scrutiny on who comes into the country at this moment under this administration.",

        "Well, this matters because Pandora has a big head start in that they have 250 million registered users.",
        "Those are people who have logged in, who have listened to a radio station that they've set up.",
        "The question for Pandora really is can they convert those people into paying subscribers?",
        "Can they take those people and convince them that what they really want to do is use Pandora, use this system that they've had maybe for a decade or so to do the thing that Spotify and Apple have been doing for a couple of years already.",
        "And maybe they would have chosen to go and do that, if that's what they really wanted.",
        "Pandora does have one thing sort of in its pocket, the Genome Project, which is their algorithm for recommending songs.",

        "They've used that to power the radio, the playlists that they generate.",
        "But if they can turn that into something that allows people to use on demand and discover new things, they might have a leg up in converting all of these users into paying subscribers.",

        "Fifteen hundred listens to a single song equals one album sale.",
        "That basically means that an artist knows that if they put out an album with ten songs on it and people press play and listen to it, they'll get a certain number of sales, you know, in air quotes.",
        "If they put an album with 25 songs on it and people press play and listen all the way through, they'll get two and a half times as many album sales.",
