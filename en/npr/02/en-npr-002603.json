        "That's correct.",

        "He was close friends and traveling partners and co-Scout leaders with another deputy, David Hahn.",
        "We now know that David Hahn was a serial abuser.",
        "He killed himself in 1981--shot himself.",
        "And in investigating the sex abuse scandal in the Sheriff's Department back in the '80s, our reporters, Bill Morlin and Karen Dorn-Steele, made the connection between Hahn and Mayor West.",
        "And after publishing a series of stories on Hahn in 2003, they began to try to develop the links that might have connected Mayor West with David Hahn and his abuse.",
        "Then there's this more recent chapter, which has to do with the mayor's activity on the Internet.",
        "Why did your paper start looking into that story?",
        "Well, our reporters were looking for the individuals who might be potential victims of abuse in the '80s.",
        "We needed names.",
        "We had no specific names, no locations, no corroborative evidence.",
        "Last fall, fall of 2004, Bill Morlin, in seeking out names of potential victims, was told by one of his sources, `I just talked with an 18-year-old boy who says he's just had sex with the mayor.",
        "And he gave us the name of that individual, and we talked with him and discovered, in that set of interviews, that in current time, as mayor of the city of Spokane, the mayor was going onto a Web site and seeking out partners.",
