        "They had a robotic lander that was able to make a soft landing on the moon, and only two other countries have done this before.",
        "So it's not a first, but it's a pretty big third.",

        "Yeah, that's right.",

        "But, I mean, what does the scene look like, and what does this thing look like?",
        "Well, I mean, the first thing to say is this lander is a really big piece of hardware.",

        "It's covered in foil.",
        "It's got landing legs.",

        "It's sort of a small, little rover with solar panels and three little wheels.",
        "And so, yeah, it's basically this lander and this rover.",
        "OK.",
        "Geoff, why did China decide to do this?",
        "I think there were three reasons, and the first one was the PR side of this.",

        "They certainly did.",
        "And they put out a lot of really great images, and it's just been really great for the country.",
        "The second reason they did it is that they've wanted to test out a lot of technologies I think they're hoping to use on future missions, like a nuclear-powered generator to keep the rover and the lander warm during the two-week long lunar nights.",

        "Well, actually, that's not entirely true.",
        "The Chinese lander was automated.",
        "It had a radar system, and it was supposed to find its own sort of nice place to land.",
        "And it was given a box to look in.",
        "It ended up outside that box.",
        "I'm not quite sure whether this was on accident, or by design.",

        "Their manned program is also making great strides.",
        "They hope to have a space station in orbit above the Earth by 2018.",
        "And, I mean, really, from there on out, there's a whole Christmas list of things they want to do: space telescopes and maybe a mission to Mars.",
        "So I think we'll be seeing a lot more of China in space in the coming years."
