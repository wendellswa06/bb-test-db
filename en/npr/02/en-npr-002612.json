        "It was Girl Scout cookie season.",
        "And we checked the ingredients, and palm oil was an ingredient in the Girl Scout cookies.",
        "And I remember just being so shocked and upset.",
        "Palm oil became ubiquitous in U.S.",
        "supermarkets a few years ago.",
        "Companies put it in baked goods, margarine and candy as an alternative to hydrogenated oils that contain trans fat.",
        "That's not to say palm oil is health food.",
        "It's full of saturated fat, but it's cheap.",
        "In many places in the world, it has become the staple cooking oil.",
        "The girls worked with environmental groups, gathered signatures and talked to lots of reporters.",
        "Finally, a few weeks ago, they got a sit-down meeting with Girl Scout leaders.",
        "Madison says they made an impassioned plea to take palm oil out of Girl Scout cookies.",
        "I kind of teared up during the meeting, because I care about this so much.",
        "We showed them pictures of orangutans killed for the palm oil industry.",
        "And I think those pictures, you know, really resonated with me as a young kid, but also today.",

        "OK, I'm going to be a little long-winded here.",
        "You sort of have to go back to 1965, when the Voting Rights Act was enacted.",
        "It has been the single most successful, most effective piece of civil rights legislation in the nation's history and has provided for an exponential growth in minority voting throughout the country or those - especially those covered jurisdictions.",
        "These were areas of the country, by and large, I think it's nine states, mainly in the South, a few others, and parts of I think another seven states.",
        "And - but in the South, which is really where the focus of the law was, there were enormous bars to voting by African-Americans, everything from literacy tests, to tricks, to changing the polling place at the last minute, to violence.",
        "And in order to stop all that, they set up Section Five, which is basically half o the law.",
        "The other half says if you can prove there's intentional discrimination, go to court.",
        "And that applies to the whole country, and there are a whole bunch of standards to that.",
        "But Congress said look, there has been - there have been too many tricks going on here, too much awfulness going on.",
        "We're going to make it so these places that have a history of preventing minority voting have to come to us in the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before they change the law.",
        "It's just that simple.",
        "And we will let you change the law if we think it doesn't have an adverse effect on minority voting.",
        "And as I said, the law has been enormously successful.",
        "Today I think the Justice Department only vetoes about one percent of the changes that various jurisdictions ask for."

        "And it's been reauthorized numerous times.",
        "Four times, and in the latest time, in 2006, it was unanimous in the Senate, and I think there were only 30 no votes in the House, and it was the Republicans who led the charge.",
        "They were in control then, and they led the charge.",
        "And - but conservatives, some conservatives, have felt that the law unfairly discriminates against the South now, that the South is no longer the place it once was and that it should be treated like the rest of the country.",
        "And so what is the basis for this challenge that will now be heard this week?",
        "The basis for this challenge is that there is no longer any reason to have pre-clearance for any part of the country, that it is no longer justified, that Congress didn't change the formula for which areas were covered, that - basically not since '65, slightly updated in '72, that there have been huge demographic changes since then, and Congress didn't change any of that and that nobody really deserves to be singled out this way anymore.",
        "So the case, though, comes from a county in Alabama.",
        "But they're arguing that it should - Section Five of the Voting Rights Act should be done away with for all - everyone.",
        "For everybody.",
        "It's the microcosm.",
        "And they base this on what?",

        "We have a countywide member of the school board who's black who's been elected.",
        "Minorities in the county don't quite see it that way.",
        "They say they've tried to - some sort of bait-and-switch things on them that have been stopped by the Justice Department, and in fact the county does not have a clean record for 10 years.",
        "If it did have a clean record for 10 years, it could bail out of the provisions.",

        "Yes, you have to have a clean record for 10 years, and if it did, it could say please don't - let us out of pre-clearance because we've been clean for 10 years.",
        "It doesn't have...",
        "But have counties done that, or is it...?",
        "Oh yeah, there are a lot of counties that have done that, especially in places like Virginia, where it seems to mushroom.",
        "So if one county does it, see that it's pretty easy, another county does it, another county does it.",
        "But it has - the numbers of places that have bailed out has grown quite a bit, especially since the last time the Supreme Court heard this case, which was four years ago.",
        "It focused on the bailout provision and said let's see how that works.",
        "So the last time this came up before the Supreme Court, 2009, the court did not rule directly on the constitutionality of this Section Five that we're talking about.",
        "It dodged the bullet, essentially.",
        "So what can we glean, if anything, about what may happen this time?",
        "Well, it was an eight-to-one decision in which Chief Justice Roberts, writing for the court, said we are loath to overturn a judgment of Congress too easily, especially when there's an easy way for us to deal with this because this jurisdiction should've been allowed to bail out, and it never applied for a bailout because it thought it wasn't permitted to, it was too small to do that.",
        "And any jurisdiction should be allowed to bail out and seek to do that.",
        "Let's put that to the side for a moment.",
        "Then the chief justice went on and all but held his nose in saying we're not going to deal with the rest of this now.",
        "And he said the South has changed.",
        "He said those words.",
        "The entire tone of the opinion was extremely hostile to the Voting Rights Act while at the same time acknowledging that it had done an enormous job since its original enactment but seeming to suggest that the court is, or at least a majority of the justices of the court are, quite ready or on the precipice of being ready to throw it out, or at least the pre-clearance section of the law."

        "But then it says that, quote, the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section Five and this court to uphold no longer remains.",
        "On what basis do you argue that?",

        "But our perspective is one that's informed more by history and our own current understandings of what it's like to be on the ground in terms of being someone who works for a state or local government in one of these covered jurisdictions today.",
        "For example, I'm the Alabama state government's lead appellate attorney, and I am 38 years old.",
        "That means I was born in 1974, a decade after the tragic events that made Section Five completely constitutional and appropriate during the civil rights struggle.",
        "And most people who live in Alabama and work for their various governments in Alabama are like me.",
        "We just don't have a connection with the events of 1965.",
        "Now look, to be sure, the things that happened on the same Birmingham streets where we now live in the same Montgomery government buildings where we're now privileged to work and in the same university buildings in Tuscaloosa where we hope to send our kids one day, were the things that gave rise to the civil rights struggle.",
        "And we all recognize that no matter what we do, our state's name will always be associated with the civil rights struggle, both the terrible things that happened, but also the great things that happened in terms of progress.",
        "That's how it should be.",
        "No one is running away from that history.",
        "But the question in this case is not whether it was rational and reasonable for Congress to decide back in 1965 that it was necessary to take these extraordinary measures to keep people like Governor George Wallace in line and to ensure that places like Alabama remained part of the country that we could truly call the United States of America.",
        "The question now before the court, is whether it was reasonable for Congress to declare in 2006 that it would continue to divide the country in precisely the same way, using precisely the same coverage formula it used back in 1965, and the question is really on a personal level whether it's appropriate for Congress to presume, in light of the conditions that are now present in states like Alabama, that this new generation of leaders and citizens is as untrustworthy as people like Governor Wallace were back in 1965.",
        "Sure, but I read a Washington Post article this weekend that noted that every statewide elected official in Alabama is white today.",
        "So how is that supposed to inspire this trust among the state's many black voters?",
        "Well, a few responses.",
        "One is that as I think someone said at the outset of your program, the big problem in Alabama in 1965 was - there were really two big problems.",
        "One was that registration and turnout among minority voters was abysmally low.",
        "And that was so for a related reason, one that Nina mentioned during her opening remarks: The conduct of governmental officials in Alabama during that time was immoral and awful.",
        "Violence and the like were keeping people from registering to vote and from turning out to the polls.",
        "That's simply not the case anymore.",
        "Minority voter turnout and participation is extremely strong.",
        "Now how that has translated to statewide office, I think it's fair to ask, well, why doesn't Alabama have a statewide official who is African-American, that's something that needs to happen.",
        "It's been the case in the past; hopefully it will be the case in the near future.",
        "But if you look at local representatives and members of the legislature and the like, minority representation among members of the legislature is very, very close to the overall percentage of African-Americans, for example, in the state.",
        "All right, and we're going to continue the conversation in a moment with Alabama Solicitor General John Neiman.",
        "What do you need to see to trust your state and local government on issues of discrimination?",
