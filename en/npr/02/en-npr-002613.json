        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Jennifer Ludden in Washington.",
        "In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law, nearly 100 years after ratification of the 15th Amendment, which granted African-American men the right to vote.",
        "But in the South in the 1960s it was still incredibly hard for black Americans to vote.",
        "They faced intimidation and violence but also bureaucratic measures like poll taxes and literacy tests.",
        "Now the Voting Rights Act is under review.",
        "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday, and we've asked two players to join us to parse out the arguments for why the act should be upheld or why states should be able to pass election laws without federal approval.",
        "We'd also like to hear from you.",
        "This is a story that at its center is about whether governments can be relied on to deal with their citizens equitably.",
        "So tell us: What do you need to see to trust your state and local government on issues of discrimination?",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Or send us an email, talk@npr.org, and you can share your story at our website.",
        "Go to npr.org, and click on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "And let's get a caller into the conversation.",
        "David is in Fayetteville, Arkansas.",
        "Welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Well, thank you.",
        "I'm calling because Arkansas is the only state in the former Confederacy that has never elected to statewide office or to Congress an African-American.",
        "I'm a white male, age 55.",
        "I grew up just as Jim Crow was ending.",
        "I abhor what my parents' generation and the generations of white people before them did, and I think that the Voting Rights Act played - has played an excellent and absolutely needed role.",
        "But what's happened here just since November, was for the very first time since Reconstruction, the Republican Party has taken over both the - both houses of our state legislature, and for the very first time they are proposing a voter ID law.",
        "It probably will pass.",
        "And what we see here, I think, is a repetition of a theme that's being promoted by Republican legislatures in other states.",
        "So what would you want to see, though, David, to feel comfortable that everyone had a fair vote?",
        "What would you - what changes would you need to see?",
        "Well, first off, I think that the Democratic Party at least needs to get its act together and make sure that African-American leaders in our state are getting the support they need to get elected to statewide office or to Congress.",
        "But that hasn't happened because our Democrats are mostly conservative here.",
        "So we have - I don't see any quick solution to what's ongoing discrimination.",
        "In fact up until November we had a self-proclaimed white supremacist in our state legislature who was a Republican but, you know, he got voted out of office because he talked too much about what his beliefs were."

        "Well, so the process did work there, I guess you could say, after a while.",
        "David, thank you so much for your call.",
        "You're welcome, thank you.",
        "And John Neiman, state solicitor general for Alabama, still on the line with us, what's your response to someone like that, who obviously is not in your state but just isn't convinced that we're past the Voting Rights Act yet?",
        "Well, look, no one's contending that we're past the Voting Rights Act, and I think that's an important misconception that's worth clearing up at the outset.",
        "As Nina said during her initial remarks, there is a provision of the Voting Rights Act, Section Two, that prohibits discriminatory practices in voting so that if, for example, a state were to enact a law that were discriminatory for any reason that a particular plaintiff or group of plaintiffs believed was unlawful, that group of plaintiffs could go into court and challenge that provision.",
        "They could get a temporary restraining order against it to preclude it from being used in the next election, and they could eventually get it struck down.",
        "The question here is whether Section Five, which is a separate provision that was designed to be only temporary in nature, was designed to only have a five-year lifespan back in 1965, ought to still apply to a limited subset of states.",
        "And the answer to that question, I think, is no. Congress simply didn't show that these states in particular need to be singled out in 2006 and now 2013 as worse than the rest of the United States.",
        "I think that the entire United States ought to be covered by Section Two, and that ought to be able to protect voting rights throughout the country, equally in a place like Alabama and in a place like Arkansas and in a place like Illinois.",
        "So there would still be room for redress even without Section Five is what you're saying.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, the question here is whether you're still going to have this provision that requires state and local governments to go to the federal government for advance permission to change the law, no matter how innocuous the change in law might be.",
        "And that - it made sense to have that provision back in 1965 to stem off the crisis that was occurring, I'm sad to say, in my home state, although I wasn't around at that point in time, but it certainly doesn't make sense to have that emergency time-out provision in place still in 2006 to redress the very different issues that we see in front of us today.",
        "All right, Alabama Solicitor General John Neiman joined us from member station WBHM in Birmingham.",
        "Thank you so much for your time."

        "He joins us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Thanks so much for coming in.",
        "Thanks for having me, Jennifer.",
        "So the state of Alabama notes that, you know, it has been 16 years since the Justice Department objected to changes that it wanted in election law, that everything it's requested has been approved.",
        "That's a long time.",
        "Is it not convincing enough for you?",
        "Well, it's not only not convincing, it's actually factually inaccurate.",
        "The very jurisdiction that has mounted this particular constitutional challenge, Shelby County, had within it a jurisdiction that recently, in 2008, drew an objection based on a discriminatory redistricting plan that it sought to have approved.",
        "And it's important to unpack for your listeners precisely what this law has meant for people on the ground in the places covered by Section Five.",
        "Alabama has a long and unbroken line of discrimination in voting that goes back to slavery, extending through the Civil War and Reconstruction, up through the Bloody Sunday March, over the Edmund Pettis Bridge from Selma to Montgomery, up through an important line of cases called the Dillard line of cases, which I'll talk about briefly, and up through a recent discriminatory attempt by the city of Calera, in Shelby County, to pass a discriminatory redistricting plan.",
        "And that plan actually, am I correct, led to the town's only black councilman being - or councilperson not being re-elected.",
        "That's right, Jennifer, and so in the Dillard line of cases, the state of Alabama was found to have used intentional discrimination and at-large methods of elections in better than 170 jurisdictions.",
        "To settle this line of cases, these very jurisdictions, better than 170, adopted non-discriminatory, district-based voting schemes.",
        "One of these schemes was elected in the city of Calera, which allowed for the election of an African-American for 20 years in a particular seat; that was a majority black seat.",
        "In 2008, the city of Calera sought to adopt a discriminatory redistricting plan which eliminated the sole African-American seat by reducing the black population there from 70 percent to 29 percent, leading to your point, Jennifer, to the loss of the sole African-American on the city council.",
        "Now, the Department of Justice rejected this redistricting plan and the election that was held under it, required the city of Calera to redraw its electoral boundaries in a non-discriminatory way, and to hold another election in which African-Americans in this district elected their preferred candidate of choice, who happened to be African-American."

        "It's simply not true - and I think for many of your listeners it strikes them as odd - that Alabama, the state that gave birth to the Voting Rights Act, which itself is recognized as the greatest piece of civil rights legislation, indeed the greatest piece of legislation ever passed, would be mounting this constitutional challenge given that it has not demonstrated, even recently, its willingness to operate its electoral processes fairly and in a way that doesn't discriminate against its people of color.",
        "Right.",
        "Let's get a caller here on the line.",
        "Curtis is in Salem, Oregon.",
        "Hi, Curtis, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Yeah, I'd like to see the attorney generals of the states get together and come up with a common-sense, common approach to elections and gerrymandering and all that stuff.",
        "I don't want to give up the states' rights to control it, but I don't like it being in the control of parties.",
        "So kind of a nonpartisan approach is what you're suggesting, and a uniform approach.",
        "Yeah, and I also want it to be - we're moving like crazy in this country.",
        "I grew up in New York.",
        "I'm now in Oregon.",
        "My first experience with voting was having someone pay my mother $5 to vote for their party.",
        "So - and I've lived in Albany, New York, which had the same Democratic machine for over 30 years.",
        "So I've experienced the other side of negative party politics.",
        "All right, thank you for the call, Curtis.",
        "And let's hear from someone else.",
        "Casey in Jacksonville, North Carolina.",
        "Hi, Casey.",
        "Hi, there.",
        "I just wanted to say that I find it odd, and not really shocking, but it is somewhat sad, to hear any elected or state official from the South deny - I mean I understand that what he's saying is we're not the same as the people who required this kind of law.",
        "But in reality, the only thing that's changed is that this kind of discrimination has become less overt.",
        "In other words, we've moved to a more covert form of discrimination.",
        "And sometimes it's harder to see.",
        "And it kind of lulls people into this false sense of security, like oh, we live in a colorblind nation, or everything's OK.",
        "I think at the last election, when we just see the redistricting and the tricks and all the ways that different kinds of places in the South - and not a few states in the North - used to try to eliminate the minority vote or try to manipulate it, I think it is clear that the effects of what happened in the '60s still are with us today.",
        "Maybe it's not as blatant or overt as it was then, but if it is still covert, even if it weren't, the effects of what happened in the '60s aren't going to be gone in 40 or 50 years.",
        "It's going to take a long time to overturn the attitudes that accompanied those kind of behaviors.",
        "All right.",
        "Casey, thanks so much.",

        "Ryan Haywood, go ahead.",
        "The caller makes a very important point about what it means to ferret out racial discrimination in voting.",
        "The Voting Rights Act at its core is about ushering in progress, so there's nothing about the gains have been made since 1965 in Alabama and other places in the country covered by Section 5 and recognizing that we need to make more progress.",
        "And that's precisely what Congress did in 2006 when it considered whether to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years.",
        "Congress looked at those places covered by the Voting Rights Act and found that in those places, discrimination against voters of color was more intense.",
        "It was more persistent.",
        "It was more adaptive.",
        "In the past reauthorization period, Section 5 served to block more than 1,000 discriminatory proposed voting changes but for Section 5 would have harmed minority voters from exercising their franchise.",
        "Although to maybe the call - the recent caller's point, we have an email from Blaine in Pennsylvania: Not only should the Voting Right Act be continued, it should be expanded to include all states.",
        "The gerrymandering that is still done affects all minorities.",
        "And he's in Pennsylvania.",
        "You know, and on that point, Jennifer, Congress considered whether to add additional jurisdictions in 2006 when it looked fresh at the Voting Rights Act and Section 5 in particular.",
        "And what it found is that, though, there's discrimination that happens outside of the covered states - and we saw this in the last election in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in Wisconsin - what Congress found in 2006 is that the type of discrimination is of a different character in the covered jurisdictions such they require stronger medicine.",
        "It requires Section 5 in those places because the type of discrimination is often one where a court order is followed by a serial attempt to block voters of color from exercising their political strength.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "But, Ryan Haywood of the NAACP, what about, you know, the proportion of blacks - in 1965, the proportion of blacks that were voting was a big issue in passing this right.",
        "And Alabama is the state bringing this challenge this week, points out that in 2004 and 2008, black voter turnout in that state was greater than white voter turnout.",
        "I think that's an important point, and I think that reflects the Voting Rights Act doing important work.",
        "The fact of increased voter registration and participation on the part of black voters and other voters of color is a reflection of Section 5 doing important work in empowering voters of color.",
        "But that's only one indicia of understanding how voting discrimination happens.",
        "Alabama, for example, though the black population in Alabama is 25 percent, Alabama has no statewide black elected officials.",
        "In a very recent federal district court opinion in 2011, a federal district court found that racially-polarized voting is so pronounced in the state and that intentional discrimination runs to the highest levels of the state legislature that black voters in particular are discriminated against in meaningful ways.",
        "It's not surprising for many who understand the way that racially-polarized voting plays out in Alabama.",
        "In the 2008 presidential election, though African-Americans supported President Obama at the tune of 90 percent, only 10 percent of white voters (unintelligible) for him, that was his worst showing at all the 50 states.",
        "And he didn't fare much better in 2012 when he received 13 percent of the white vote.",
        "So the fact is that in Alabama and in many of the covered jurisdictions across the country, racially-polarized voting persists in a way that undermines minority voting strength so too do serial efforts to block their votes as they seek to exercise them."
