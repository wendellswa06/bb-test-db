        "That's it.",

        "So your carry-on, not the check bag, your carry-on bag, 100 bucks.",
        "Boy, that's a tough one.",
        "I wonder if that one will stick.",
        "The - Frontier says it's going to add that fee for this summer, and we'll see if they can keep up their business.",
        "But they want you to come only through their own website, not using third party transactions.",
        "That way...",
        "Not Expedia or one of those.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, the one at Orbitz or any of those.",
        "They want to steer you to their website.",
        "And also, they just basically want to discourage you from bringing carry-ons because there has been a real surge, as you can imagine.",
        "With all these fees over the years, people have learned to kind of stuff everything into that overhead and then jam it up there and a lot of tussles on flights.",
        "It's tough for the flight attendants because there are always people jockeying to get those bags up there.",
        "And if they could discourage that, they would.",
        "It's funny, I've seen on websites, there are these wearable luggage companies now where you can get a coat that has really, really big pockets, and you can just sort of try to stick all your luggage onto your body and then walk on to the plane wearing your luggage.",

        "And I, you know, I wonder, you know, if that's different or if that's an increase.",
        "Is that something new?",
        "These fees have been just continually going up, and some of them are new because every time they think of something new that they could charge you a fee for, it shows up.",
        "As I said, this trend really began in 2008 as the recession was deepening, and we've seen it growing all the time.",

        "So that's also another huge source of revenues for the airlines, and all of these things add up.",
        "And, of course, governments are looking for new revenue streams, so there are an awful lot of taxes that get added to flights.",
        "But, you know, Neal, if you think about it, when you go to a restaurant, there's a sort of a list price on meal.",
        "But then when you find out what the taxes are and the, you know, and then $2 for a cup of coffee or $5, whatever they want to charge, by the time you're all done with it, it's a great deal more than what you were thinking of originally.",

        "Yes.",
        "They've seen some, at least, a better trend line.",
        "Remember at the beginning of the year, we are all very concerned about gas - gasoline prices.",

        "I mean, from the airlines point of view, they certainly wish jet fuel were cheaper, but it sort of stabilized at a level that they feel they can work around as long as they can keep up enough people traveling this summer.",
        "And, of course, one of the things they've been concerned about is the government - if Congress would make life a little bit easier for them.",
        "But one of the things they're worried about this spring was the sequestration.",

        "That situation went on for about six days in mid-April.",
        "And what happened was lots of air traffic controllers were at home instead of in the towers.",
        "And as a result, there was really - there were lots of flight delays.",
        "The industry says there were 7,200 flight delays that affected about 600,000 people.",
        "So the big concern there was that, if that continued, if they were going to have both higher jet fuel prices and flight delays, boy, that look kind of scary.",
        "And now, both of those situations seem to have been resolved.",
        "Congress took some action, along with White House, they all agreed to ease up on those air traffic controller furloughs.",
