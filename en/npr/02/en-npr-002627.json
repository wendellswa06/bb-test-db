        "I think that's the alternative that is open to him now, because again given the determination of the Republicans to apply the filibuster to essentially anything the president puts forward, he knows it's not going to get through in the foreseeable future.",
        "So the best thing that's opened to him is to say, this is what I'm trying to do and is building momentum for next year's election.",
        "Jim, lets move to Iraq.",
        "The president announced a full U.S.",
        "withdrawal by the end of this year.",
        "His take is that this is a fulfillment of a campaign promise, but there's a bit of spin there, isn't it?",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "It's not at all the way he expected to fulfill the promise.",
        "The reason there's going to be this complete or near-complete withdrawal of U.S.",
        "troops by the end of this year is not so much the commitment by the U.S.",
        "government to wind them down as the view on the Iraqi side that they are not willing to keep U.S.",
        "forces in their country any longer than the end of this year.",
        "And the reason for that, of course, is the disagreement about whether U.S.",
        "- uniformed troops and also contractors would be subject to Iraqi law for things that went wrong while they were serving that country.",
        "Jim, in Libya, of course, Moammar Gadhafi is dead.",
        "He's been killed.",
        "NATO's military campaign there will end at the end of this month.",
        "President Obama inherited two wars, Libya was his own for sure.",
        "But, of course, it was a war that America kind of held at arms length.",
        "Does the success in Libya, in a way, establish an Obama doctrine now?",
        "The president can claim that it establishes his competence in increasing areas of foreign policy because very few things have gone dramatically wrong on his watch and many things have gone better on his watch than many people expected in the international realm.",
        "But when he was proposing or announcing this U.S.",
        "support for the NATO effort in Libya, he made very clear that this was a almost unique situation.",
        "He was saying this is not some larger proposal of going in to intervene even for humanitarian purposes around the world.",
        "He said, this is a particular circumstance where the risks and the consequences of not going in are so severe and the possibility of doing something positive is large enough that it's worth this effort.",
        "So I will be surprised if we see him extending this to other countries.",
        "But he can say this is something I decided to do, and so far it has worked.",
        "And, Jim, this past week, Vice President Biden talked about this saying, you know, we spent just $2 billion in Libya to help remove a dictator.",
        "Of course, it was a veiled reference to Iraq, where we spent many hundreds of billions of dollars.",
        "Biden saying essentially this approach is more successful.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And certainly, if every war could be fought this way with apparently no U.S.",
        "lives lost - certainly many people in Libya have died from action on all sides - and a minimal expenditure of money compared to what had been laid in Iraq and Afghanistan over the years, certainly this will be the way for all combat to happen if we had that choice.",
        "But it may again be, as the president said, this was an almost unique situation.",
        "That's James Fallows.",
        "He's national correspondent for The Atlantic.",
        "You can read his blog at jamesfallows.theatlantic.com.",

        "In the case of Liberia, Liberia's - the warlord Charles Taylor used revenues from diamonds to prop up his regime, his very brutal regime.",

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "The Kimberley Process was launched in 2003 in response to these brutal civil wars in Liberia and other places.",
        "The idea was to try and have a more proactive approach through this diamond certification scheme to try and prevent diamonds from fueling conflict.",
        "Now Liberia wasn't part of that process because Liberia is just now coming out of conflict and has been in the process of putting into place a set of government controls to try and make sure the diamonds can't ever fill conflict again.",
        "So now that we have this Kimberley Process in place, which has about over 70 countries participating - all the major diamonds trading and producing countries.",
        "But, I think, that there's important caveat to this, is that there's a lot more work to be done.",
        "Liberia, the Liberian government, did come up with a system of controls but has yet to enforce them, obviously, because the sanctions have just been lifted.",
        "So there's going to be a real challenge of making sure that the government controls are enforced effectively to combat smuggling and to control all the diamond-mining areas in Liberia, particularly the artisanal diamond mining areas.",
        "These are the mining areas that are very, very difficult to control.",

        "Let's go pull out to the consumer.",
        "So you have diamonds that can be found in riverbeds and some of them have been used in order to fuel civil wars; some of them could be used to support families and to grow the economy; but what about people who buy diamonds - I would gather, mainly off of the continent of Africa.",

        "So I think that any kind of consumer pressure on the diamond industry, particularly on retailers, is very, very effective in making this industry change because this is not just about the Liberian government getting their controls right, it's about diamond traders and diamond manufacturers asking questions and making sure they only buy diamonds from responsible traders and responsible miners.",
