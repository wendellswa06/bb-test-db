        "That fossil fuel in California is natural gas.",

        "But here's the problem.",
        "Running solar and natural gas together - some days, that's more power than California needs, and you can't flood the grid with too much power.",
        "It overloads it and causes blackouts.",
        "So she has to tell solar farms to shut off.",
        "And so far this year, California has foregone enough solar electricity to power San Francisco for 20 days.",
        "All of this has created a strange marriage between solar and natural gas."
