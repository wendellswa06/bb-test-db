        "Tell us what led to this move to brand the Brotherhood terrorists?",
        "Well, the government officially said that it was responding to terror attacks by the Brotherhood.",
        "It blamed the Brotherhood for a bombing last week that killed 16 people north of Cairo, though they didn't provide any evidence that the Brotherhood was responsible.",
        "But the government has been moving this way for some time.",
        "Since ousting President Morsi in July, we've seen repeated crackdowns on the movements, the arrests of thousands of members, virtually all the senior leadership, killings of Brotherhood protesters several times.",
        "You know, what seems to have changed is the penalties being imposed are harsher now.",
        "Members are subject to up to five years in prison for simply belonging.",
        "So, in that way, it's a very sharp escalation.",
        "Now, back in July, there were millions of Egyptians that really welcomed the ouster of Mohamed Morsi, and you heard a lot of assurances that, well, you know, we will get back to a democracy.",
        "What is their reaction now?",
        "I think the first thing that needs to be said is that there's been no real public outcry during the sort of escalating steps against the Brotherhood.",
        "There's no sense that the public is turning against the government.",
        "We've seen opposition to the government's policies spread amongst a small group of people who we've considered sort of anti-government activists over the last three years.",
        "And we've seen a lot of non-Islamist activists imprisoned in the last couple of weeks.",
        "And so that's new.",
        "You do hear a lot of private expressions of concern about the direction of country.",
        "The continued struggles of the economy, you know, the fact that for most people things do not seem to be getting better.",
        "And you also hear a concern about the idea that we're entering a new military era.",
        "People seem to realize that that might represent a real step backwards for the country after all this turmoil.",
        "Is there worry also that the Muslim Brotherhood supporters might now be more likely to turn to extremism?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The parallel developments during the last couple of weeks is a very sharp up-tick the number of attacks, mostly on police and security targets but also there was a bombing that struck a public bus.",
        "We don't know whether it was accidental that that happened or not.",
        "And there is a lot of concern about people who follow the movement, about what will happen, especially to its young supporters, and concern that they could be radicalized over time.",
        "Kareem Fahim of the New York Times speaking to us from Cairo.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Thank you.",

        "It took more than 16 hours of deliberations but last night, a jury in Sanford, Fla., pronounced George Zimmerman not guilty.",
        "Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin last year, faced two charges - second-degree murder and manslaughter.",
        "The jury's verdict came nearly 17 months after that February night when Zimmerman and Martin had a confrontation that ended with the teenager dead from a single, fatal gunshot.",
        "The jury's verdict came nearly 17 months after that February night when Zimmerman and Martin had a confrontation that ended with the teenager dead from a single, fatal gunshot.",

        "That sparked a series of marches and protests in Sanford and around the nation.",
        "More than a year later, some of those same supporters of the Martin family gathered outside the courthouse last night while the jury deliberated.",
        "After a long day that stretched into the evening, the six-person jury - all women - notified the judge they'd reached a verdict.",

        "In the Wake of the Storm: Environment and Disaster and Race After Katrina; found that more then 42,000 tons of hazard waste remains on the ground, in mainly black neighborhoods.",
        "The report suggests that the federal government has not made cleaning up these areas a priority.",
        "I spoke with two authors of the report.",

        "Wright, let me start with you.",
        "No understatement there.",
        "And your study really echoes that, does it not?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I would have to, just, first of all, say, that I am a resident of the city of New Orleans, in exile right now in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.",
        "And I have to agree that this certainly is the case, and this being the first time that we've ever seen anything at this magnitude.",
        "We have come to conclusion that the only way that change is going to occur, is with a grassroots effort.",
        "And I really believe that very little attention is being paid to the kinds of organizations and people who are making a difference, in spite of the government's lack of attention, or lack of coordination to getting people back home."

        "Robert Bullard, here's what many people are missing out, that the sewer systems across Louisiana suffered a billion dollars worth of damage.",
        "When we're talking about school systems reopening, we're forgetting that in classrooms and playgrounds across that area, there is concern about toxic wastes being on the grounds.",
        "When you talk about the sewer system being that badly damaged, of course, we're talking about problematic water running into homes, and schools, and the like.",
        "These are things that have not fully been discussed in the media, and I don't know that the public is really grappling with what New Orleans and that region is facing?",
        "I think this is really the crux of the matter: the extent to which people can come home; and the extent to which it's safe, in terms of the residuals of the flooding, and the sediments that's left; and the extent to which there has been a little government action in terms of cleanup.",
        "There is a lot of contamination in many African American communities, in terms of lead in housing, and lead in the soil, before Katrina.",
        "There are many government agencies, including the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and the Federal EPA's, are saying that because some neighborhoods were contaminated before, and therefore they should not somehow be cleaned up.",

        "Well, I would say that in the study, the one thing that we tried to point out, is that the race of people most affected by this storm are in fact African American.",
        "Eighty percent of African Americans in the city of New Orleans lost everything, and the majority of African Americans are still displaced.",
        "They have not returned.",
        "The majority of the people who have been able to return, are Caucasian.",

        "And the argument here, is that the federal government has not made this kind of cleanup a priority in these areas.",

        "And the fact that neighborhood associations around the city are organizing and meeting on a weekly basis; in local churches that are partially still standing, and in trailers, trying to find a way to come back home; and using monies from their own pockets, finding a way to clean up other contaminations; and also they're looking for ways to really determine to what extent they are at risk.",
        "Even getting the kind of information that you would need to make a determination, of what it is you have to do to be able to move back to your home safely, is very difficult; because EPA and LDQ have not chosen to share the information in a friendly way, that would allow your average person to go to a website, or to distribute information telling them the extent of the contamination in the sediment around their homes; or what to prepare for inside of their homes.",

        "Can you talk more about that?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, typically, the tone is set at the top, and when chief executives engage in this kind of disgusting, despicable behavior, they often feel that this behavior is the prerogative of the position that they hold, and they surround themselves with people who not only tolerate and enable the behavior and often facilitate it but often emulate the behavior and engage in the same behavior themselves.",
        "So you have no checks, and the single thing that drives sexual harassment in the workplace is leadership.",

        "Is there something about that culture, though, that still allowed that to continue?",
        "Well, it's true that Weinstein is a very small company, but the tone is always set at the top.",
        "And if you have an organization that is led by someone who engages in egregious sexual harassment, the - that behavior bleeds down throughout the organization.",
        "There's just no urgency within the organization to create a culture that is respectful and that is harassment-free.",
        "And other people see that this kind of behavior is engaged in at the top levels, and it becomes somewhat normative.",
