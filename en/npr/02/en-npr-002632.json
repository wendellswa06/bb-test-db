        "Whatever the opinion, the debate seems to be shifting from the inaptitude of losing the drive in the first place to the fact that so many names are included, to - and most contentious now - why it took three weeks for the VA to say anything to those affected.",
        "Department of Veteran Affairs spokesman Matt Burns says investigators wanted to know exactly what happened before going public.",
