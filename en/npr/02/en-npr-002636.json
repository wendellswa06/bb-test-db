        "Well, thank you.",

        "Well, you know, we had a meeting in Chicago shortly after Senator Obama secured the nomination.",
        "And my message at that round table discussion was, we would very much like a second stimulus package to be basically a grant with, of course, accountability attached to it, but allow the governors, in working with their local communities, to come up with ready-to-go-projects that could put people in our respective states back to work and build our infrastructure.",
        "You sit on the infrastructure taskforce at the National Governors Association.",
        "Can you explain to me how exactly this federal money for bridges and roads really helps the state's economy?",

        "Today, they fund less than five percent.",
        "Let me give you an example.",
        "We have a bridge now that connects Oregon and Washington.",
        "Two lanes of it were built in the early 1900s.",
        "Obviously, it needs to be replaced because across that bridge flows truck traffic that literally comes from California north and Canada south.",
        "So you can see how important that structure is to our economy.",
        "Yet, we don't really have any federal partnership to make it happen.",
        "A kind of a governmental theory question for you, finally.",
        "How much is it fair to expect the federal government to pay for when it comes to stimulus, and how much should be done at the state's level?",
        "I think this is a real partnership, and I think we've lost the partnership.",
        "We have absorbed federal cuts to things like mental health and law enforcement and even Homeland Security over the last several years.",
        "And we've had to fill in those cuts.",
        "We can't afford to do that any longer.",
        "Chris Gregoire is the governor of Washington state.",
        "Thank you very much for your time, governor.",

        "Well, to be honest, it's by far the most common way for these kinds of situations to be resolved.",
        "In the well over 30 instances of successful hijackings this year, all but 3 of those has been resolved through the payment of ransom, so it's not at all uncommon.",

        "The argument is you need steel; you need aluminum to build fighter planes and warships.",
        "The counterargument is, unless you think we're going to go to war against Canada, there's no real harm to the U.S.",
        "in relying on our neighbor to the north for some of that essential material.",
        "So exempting Canada and other allies could significantly soften the blow of these tariffs.",
        "But we still don't know just how that might work.",
        "Right.",
        "Because the president has argued in the past for a blanket tariff on all foreign suppliers, right?"
