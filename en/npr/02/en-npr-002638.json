        "So I think this lame duck president vetoed the bill in his own drive to be remembered as a fiscal conservative, but his fellow Republicans overrode that veto, thinking more about next year's elections.",
        "So now that this veto override taboo for Republicans has been broken, how likely do you think is it that more presidential vetoes will be overturned?",
        "Here's the Senate's number two Democrat Dick Durbin.",
        "And the president, who is arguing that we can't afford 20 or 25 billion for America, has asked us for $196 billion for Iraq - $196 billion for Iraq, but we can't afford $20 billion for America?",
        "I don't follow it.",
        "David Welna, that sounds awfully like a guns or butter argument with the president willing to allow deficit spending on the war and the Democrats wiling to go in the hole to fund programs at home."

        "That's right.",
        "Democrats would like the debate to be about a war that's been very costly, politically for Republicans.",
        "But, in fact, Republicans, with the help of General David Petraeus, who came here in September and defended the troop surge in Iraq quite effectively, have actually managed to all but shut down the war debate.",

        "Well, I think the report suggests that the Fed may be trying to calm the jitters over whether Fannie and Freddie might fail by allowing them to get these low-interest loans from the Fed's discount window.",
        "It's the same thing that the Fed did for Wall Street investment banks to calm the credit markets after the collapse of Bear Stearns.",
        "And getting loans from the discount window, is that the same thing as a bailout?",
        "Well, this year, the average seems to be around about a million dollars, ranging from perhaps 600,000 up to 1.5, and in one or two cases, close to two or perhaps over two.",
        "Obviously, it's sensitive information, so it's not something that people advertise on their websites.",
        "But that seems to be about the range at the moment.",
        "And is it paid, in fact, in dollars, as you say, in cash currency?",
        "Yup, literally, it's paid in 100-dollar bills and 50-dollar bills, which are delivered by a private security company, handed over to the pirates in bags full of cash.",
        "The pirates then have that money and divide it amongst themselves.",
        "So, this private security company takes the cash to the hijacked ship, the pirates divvy it up, and then how do they get away?",
        "Some of them will get off the ship at that point and go back to the coast along there.",
        "And in a number of instances where I have heard about, the pirates will ask the captain of the ship as they're sailing off to drop them off at different points along the coast.",
        "So, maybe one 50 miles, one 200 miles up the coast, like that, just to spread their chances of hanging onto the money because, obviously, once they get back onto land, they're well aware they have a lot of money which people may want to steal."
