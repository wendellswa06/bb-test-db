        "I mean, yes, absolutely.",
        "And that's the big problem.",
        "It's clearly the reason why we've seen so much piracy in the last year or so is because of this big increase in ransom payments.",
        "However, you need to put yourself, I suppose, in the shoes of the ship owners and say, really, do you want to be the first person not to pay the ransom and to run the risk of, you know, risk the lives of your crew and the safety of your vessel?",
        "And that's - it's an almost impossible decision for ship owners to take.",
        "The Sirius Star, the Saudi oil tanker, is still out there, in fact, and we're hearing reports now that a faction of Islamic militants in Somalia is angry that a vessel from an Islamic nation has been seized.",
        "Is there a threat of a backlash against the pirates within Somalia?",
        "From some quarters, there is certainly a perception that the pirates are not a good thing for Somalia, but you have to bear in mind that, certainly in the communities where they're based, they bring in a huge amount of money.",
        "And many people regard them as heroes, protecting Somalia's seas, especially - let's consider now that Somalia's oceans, which are very rich in terms of fish, are heavily, heavily illegally fished by shipping fleets from Europe and from Asia and from the rest of Africa.",
        "And Somalis can't really compete with them, so many people see these pirates as heroes.",
        "And certainly, there are many people who benefit economically from their activities.",

        "Is he hallucinating?",
        "It's the blind ancient Greek seer and soothsayer, Tiresias.",
        "The visitor, invisible to all but the great ailing doctor, seems to have come seeking treatment.",
        "He tells the story of his own troubled childhood, and he engages Freud in a dialog about the story of Oedipus, the king of ancient Thebes.",
        "Freud has made this myth, the story of murder, incest and recognition, the foundation of all his analytical work.",
        "Incident by incident, scene by scene, the enlightened dialoguers parse out the Oedipus tale, which as Freud points out, weighs on Western civilization like a great psychic anger.",

        "As Freud's own demise draws near, the back and forth between him and his mythical visitor seems to elevate itself to a new high degree, to a meeting of roads we all approach at some point in our lives.",
        "The power of the last few sections of this not-overly-long saga of repression and recognition, took me over as the fascinating story of this imaginary encounter soared toward the sublime.",
