        "Well, I think she makes an excellent point there, and I think President Obama understands this and is already starting to implement a good part of what she says.",
        "He was the first president to use the word Muslim in his inaugural address, making a point to reach out to the Muslim world, extend the hand of friendship.",
        "No criticism for that.",
        "He also, then, a few days later, gave his first interview after being sworn in as president to a Middle East station, Al Arabia.",
        "Again, no criticism for that.",
        "So he is already bridging the gap, and just in case anybody missed his signal, he specifically said that his reference about the hand of friendship was to Iran.",
        "I think, in part, he's trying to not just appeal to the Iranian leadership, but to reach over their heads to appeal directly to the Iranian public, to start a little Obama movement inside Iran.",
        "Obama's name, as transliterated into Persian, is U-bama(ph), which is the colloquial expression, he's with us.",
        "And that play is picked up a lot by the youth in Iran.",
        "Very much so, very much.",
        "And that exacerbates a real problem that the U.S.",
        "government has with the Iran supreme leader, who's the guy who really calls the shot in Iran, not the president.",
        "The difficulty that we have is the supreme leader worries much more about Hollywood than Washington.",
        "He worries about culture invasion, not military invasion.",
        "This is a guy who is firmly persuaded that the attractiveness of the West is what could undermine his revolution.",
        "And so, he's worried about the kind of people-to-people contact,and the kind of rock star appeal, that an U-bama may have to his people.",
        "So we have to figure out how to take advantage of that, and it's frankly going to be really tough for our diplomats because it's precisely the popularity of American cultural and the popularity of our president which is going to be a seen as such a big threat by Iran's supreme leader.",
        "Patrick Clawson, by the way, is deputy director for research at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.",
        "Kevin Hermening in Wisconsin.",
        "Well, first thing I would say is that I think one of the challenges of the Bush administration was the idea of using military force.",
        "Of course, a lot of the conservatives were in support of that, and it would have unified the Iranian people behind their unpopular government because it's one thing that I learned while I was there, and certainly in my study and reading since then and relationships with Iranian-Americans, is that like Americans, they are extremely nationalistic.",
        "It's not a criticism, it's just an awareness factor, and you know, you've got the challenge right now of - is it regime change that we want, or is it a behavioral change of the current regime that we would really like to change?",
        "And that is the challenge that our government has failed up to this point to articulate - not just to the American people but even to the Iranian people.",
        "Forget the leaders of Iran but the Iranian people who really, as all of us, I think - most of us feel is our real audience.",
        "Joe?",
        "I'd say to President Obama that Iran is probably the most difficult diplomatic issue we face right now.",
        "It has to be handled with care, and it has to be handled urgently, but that doesn't mean we should engage directly with Iran's leaders right now.",
        "I would caution the new president, I would encourage him to wait a bit to see how the domestic situation sorts out in the presidential elections in June, but to begin with quiet talks behind the scenes between U.S.",
        "diplomats.",
        "I believe that the only way we're going to stop Iran's nuclear program is by convincing Iran to stop it.",
        "There is no way to pressure Iran into ending that program, and certainly not bombing the program.",
        "That would probably accelerate their efforts, not defeat them.",
        "Joseph Cirincione, Kevin Hermening, Patrick Clawson and Rudi Bakhtiar, thanks so much for joining us On The Couch.",
        "You can see video memos from some of our guests offering this new administration advice and how to deal with Iran at npr.org.",
        "You're listening to Weekend Edition from NPR News."

        "He stalks major leaguers at spring training.",
        "By the end of his rookie season, he's blown $46,000, which is why I prefer to manage my team in bed, with a pile of books that cost 50 bucks total.",
