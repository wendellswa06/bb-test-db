        "You're welcome, Liane.",

        "Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "It's great to be with you.",
        "Now, as we heard, during today's hearing, you question the former homeland security secretary about whether the public had a compelling need to know about Russia's attempted interference.",
        "Were you satisfied with his answer?",
        "Well, I think his answers were accurate, but I disagree with the conclusion that the administration reached last year.",
        "At the time in the late summer, Senator Feinstein were deeply concerned about the Russian hacking of our institutions.",
        "We urged the administration then to speak out.",
        "And in fact in September when they still hadn't, we issued our own statement of attribution.",
        "But I think the administration should have spoken out much earlier, much more forcefully.",
        "They waited until October to issue only a written statement.",
        "I think the president should have talked about a foreign power attempting to interfere in our political affairs, in our election.",
        "It was of that level of seriousness.",
        "So there were a number of reasons I think the secretary gave that were quite accurate - a reluctance to be seen as putting their hand on the scales, reluctance to play into the narrative that one of the campaigns was saying that the process was rigged.",
        "But I think that was all outweighed or should have been outweighed by the public's need to know.",
        "We also heard from the former DHS secretary that the Democratic National Committee didn't want help addressing the issue.",
        "What do you make of that?",
        "We're still looking at that.",
        "The DHS and the FBI were both involved in interacting apparently with the DNC, although it may have been more the FBI than DHS.",
        "We're trying to find out how seriously did the FBI take this.",
        "Did they make a persistent effort to get information from the DNC?",
        "There are some public reports that we've seen - and we need to get to the bottom of it - that they went to tech people who were contractors of the DNC and that it took quite a long time for it to rise to the level of the chair of the party that a foreign power was within their computers.",
        "So there's a lot of work I think we have to do as a committee to find out what was the DNC's reaction but also what was the FBI's response.",
        "What was DHS response in the sense...",
        "But Jeh Johnson was saying today that the DNC didn't want our help, and we couldn't just swoop in."

        "Well, we're going to be bringing in officials in fact in the very near future from the DNC - some of their tech people - to find out what was the situation.",
        "And was there an unwillingness or a reluctance to share their server with the FBI or the DHS?",
        "And if so, why?",
        "Was it impressed upon them by the government just this - you know, how serious an intrusion this was?",
        "So this is I think one of the core parts of our investigation to get to the bottom of just how this was so successful in terms of the hacking of information and also to develop best practices.",
        "How do we defeat this in the future, how from both an institutional point of the DNC or the RNC, which was also the subject of a Russian effort, but also from the government point of view?",
        "Finally, Jeh Johnson in his prepared remarks wrote that cyberattacks are going to get worse before they get better.",
        "And he ended by actually putting a question to you all asking what the president and Congress are going to do to protect the American people and their democracy from future cyberattacks.",
        "What is your answer to that?",
        "My answer is - and I alluded to this at the hearing today, too - we have to educate ourselves and inoculate ourselves against foreign interference in the future.",
        "There isn't going to be a cyber fix to this.",
        "There's no software patch that's going to protect the DNC or the RNC.",
        "The Russians are capable enough actors.",
        "If they want to get into our political institutions, they are likely to get in.",
        "The only real protection is to develop a consensus in the United States that no matter who it helps and who it hurts, if a foreign power tries to interfere again, we will all reject it.",
        "That's the only real defense.",
        "Congressman Adam Schiff, the California Democrats' ranking member of the House intelligence committee, thank you for speaking with us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The Supreme Court wrapped up its term yesterday with a blockbuster decision on abortion rights, plus the important decisions limiting public corruption, prosecutions and gun rights.",
        "It has been an extraordinary term marked prominently by the death of conservative icon Antonin Scalia.",
        "Joining us to talk about the term are Tom Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog and NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg.",
        "Hi to both of you.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hello.",
        "Tom, you've been crunching the numbers about this term looking for trends.",
        "What kind of patterns have you seen?",
        "So this term we saw many fewer of those cases that turn on just one vote, the super close cases.",
        "We saw the justices in the center, not just Justice Kennedy, but also Justices Kagan and Breyer really being the justices who voted closest together, not a bloc of liberals or a bloc of conservatives."

        "And we saw the chief justice, the leader of the Supreme Court not getting involved in very divisive cases writing those opinions, but instead sticking to things that seem to be 9 to 0 or 8 to 0.",
        "There are plenty of cases this term - the biggest cases - affirmative action, abortion - where Justice Kennedy, once again, is sort of the king swing vote.",
        "But there are other cases that got less attention where this cluster of centrists - one at least of them makes the difference.",
        "Under President Obama, the rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse.",
        "And there are more people in poverty in America than ever before.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "It is true that the top 1 percent are doing great under Barack Obama.",
        "Well, I think this stuff could be called less than a bailout.",
        "Even though it puts some taxpayer money at risk, and despite all the panic in the financial markets over this, some analysts and government officials are still saying a bailout is unlikely.",
        "They say there's still time for Fannie and Freddie to get additional capital in the private markets.",
        "In fact, yesterday the agency that regulates Fannie and Freddie said they still have adequate capital to operate, and Secretary of the Treasury Paulson agreed.",
        "Today he said they should remain in their current form as shareholder-owned companies, but I think it's safe to say in a situation like this things can change pretty rapidly.",
        "Back us up a bit, John, to the long and complicated history of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
        "For those not in this world, it's really hard to figure out what these guys do.",
        "Well, they were created by the government to help make more money available for home loans.",
        "Fannie Mae was created back in the Depression in 1938, and then it was turned into a shareholder company in 1968.",
        "A couple years later Freddie Mac was created to provide some competition.",
        "And what they do is buy mortgage loans from banks and mortgage companies.",
        "They package them into investments called mortgage-backed securities, and then they sell them to investors, and that injects a lot of investment money into the mortgage pool.",
        "But here's the big thing.",
        "Freddie and Fannie guarantee all the loans they sell to investors.",
        "So if a homeowner defaults on their mortgage, Fannie and Freddie will step in and make good on the loan, and as you said, they're guaranteeing trillions of dollars worth of loans, so if they failed it would be a huge mess."

        "And since we know what's been going on with the mortgage markets and the housing markets, we can extrapolate why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are in such trouble right now.",
        "Exactly.",
        "They're in trouble because homeowners are defaulting and being foreclosed on at alarming rates.",
        "So Fannie and Freddie are being forced to make good on those guarantees.",
        "Already they've posted $11 billion in losses, and investors are just worried more is to come.",
        "And is that why investors are selling off the shares, why Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been tumbling so low?",
        "Well, that's one reason.",
        "Another is that earlier this week a former Federal Reserve governor said Fannie and Freddie were already insolvent, and he urged the government to take them over.",
        "Of course, if the government takes them over, shareholders are likely get little or nothing, so investors have been scrambling to sell their shares, and the share price is now 80 percent below where it was a year ago.",
        "Right now these companies are really fighting a psychological battle, trying to convince investors that things aren't really that bad when investors seem to be convinced things are only going to get worse, and of course that can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",
        "For financial firms, it's very hard to win back confidence once the market turns against you.",
        "How many stakeholders, shareholders, are we talking about here?",
        "Well, there are a lot of stakeholders.",
        "These are very widely held stocks, and millions and millions of shareholders are obviously losing money, and that includes a lot of people with 401Ks and mutual funds who don't know they own these stocks.",
        "But there's an even bigger issue.",
        "If investors lose faith in Fannie and Freddie guarantees and refuse to buy the mortgage-backed securities they package, it could freeze up the mortgage market and make it very difficult to buy or sell a house.",
        "That's one reason people have been urging the government to step in quickly."

        "And briefly, John, is it the case that the government backs these loans from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?",

        "We heard from many government officials what appears to be obviously - obvious, that they're too big and important to go under, and that strongly suggests the government guarantees them.",

        "Questions would come from an audience selected by an independent polling firm, and the moderator would play a very limited role.",
        "The Obama campaign at first expressed enthusiasm for the idea but has since suggested something more like the Lincoln-Douglas debates - the candidates debating head to head.",
        "Either idea would stand in stark contrast to the presidential debates as we have come to know them, debates in which journalists have been the main questioners.",
        "Given that both men promise change, would changing the forum for debate be a good thing and would it benefit one candidate more than the other?",
        "Well, here to talk about these questions and others is presidential historian Richard Norton Smith, who is scholar-in-residence at George Mason University.",
        "And Richard Norton Smith, this idea of Senator McCain's springs from an idea that he says President Kennedy and Senator Barry Goldwater had back in 1963.",
        "That is absolutely true.",
        "It's interesting - two men who were certainly ideological opposites and were genuinely fond of each other.",
        "Kennedy could afford to be because he was very confident that he would decisively defeat Barry Goldwater.",
        "But there actually had been some informal conversations.",
        "Goldwater thought that they could have these informal, in effect, town meetings.",
        "And then of course came the events of November 1963.",
        "But it is a format that McCain believes plays to his strengths.",
        "Now, on the other hand, Senator Obama, in recalling the Lincoln-Douglas debates...",
        "Yes, we should recall here what the Lincoln-Douglas debates were in terms of format."
