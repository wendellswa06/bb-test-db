        "Not so long ago, leading Republicans called any discussion of income inequality class warfare.",
        "Mitt Romney famously said the income gap was so divisive, it should be discussed only in, quote, \"\"quiet rooms.\"\" But Republican rhetoric is changing at a head-spinning pace.",

        "The fact of the matter is, thousands of people turned to such events for their entertainment in the mid-19th century, and they would go on for hours at a time.",
        "No one really believes that people would sit through that sort of a format.",
        "But what is unique about that format, aside from its length, was the fact that it was just the two principals on stage.",
        "And there is something terribly attractive about the idea of these two candidates alone questioning each other."

        "There's not a lot of spontaneity, and it feels very theatrical.",
        "It's like Kabuki theater.",
        "And I think the idea of either the town hall format and/or some version of a modern Lincoln-Douglas debate would be an improvement.",
        "On the other hand, we've had a series of debates that are usually organized either by the debate commission or in some years by the League of Women Voters.",
