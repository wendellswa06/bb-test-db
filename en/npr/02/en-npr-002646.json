        "I think it's very concerning.",
        "This outbreak has had a higher proportion of healthcare workers that have been infected than what we're used to dealing with.",
        "I really don't think we know the answer of why yet, quite honestly.",
        "How have past Ebola outbreaks ended, and what do you think needs to be done to end this particular outbreak?",
        "Outbreaks usually end when the public health agencies are able to come in and quarantine the affected individuals, and, you know, eventually the outbreak runs its course, and it's over.",
        "You know, in central Africa these outbreaks have tended to occur in a very defined geographic area - for example, a village.",
        "And the public health agencies, like the World Health Organization and humanitarian aid organizations like Medecins Sans Frontieres, have come in, quarantined that area, and the outbreak has been contained.",
        "I think what's been difficult with West Africa is that it's so widespread, and it's occurring simultaneously in so many different areas, that you really stretch that experienced resource thin, and so that's a huge problem.",
        "As we've mentioned, most of the cases have been in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, but Nigeria has also reported its first case - a man who flew into Nigeria from Liberia and died several days later.",
        "How worrying is it to hear that someone was traveling by plane while apparently ill?",
        "I mean, I think it's concerning.",
        "I think it's something that you have to take seriously and look at.",
        "I don't want to, you know, instill panic or fear.",
        "The virus is not transmitted like influenza.",
        "It's not airborne, at least we don't have any evidence to this point that suggests that.",
        "It's mainly transmitted by close contact - so contact with body fluids, things like that.",
        "So I don't want to say that the risk is zero because there's always a risk, and certainly, the people on that plane would need to be monitored and followed.",

        "So it's possible that some of these treatments could be used for compassionate use.",

        "A lot of the treatments that we work on - in fact all of them - none of them are approved for use on humans at this time, so you have safety concerns - things like that.",

        "But how far away is a vaccine that could be?",

        "I think one of the main obstacles is really a financial obstacle.",
        "Most of the companies that would develop these vaccines are small biotech companies, and there's a very small global market for an Ebola vaccine.",
        "It's not like something like malaria that's prevalent.",
        "So the companies really - it comes down to money.",

        "He was known for his long-handled bar mustache and for his distinctive paintings of sports figures.",
        "You know the paintings when you see them: impressionistic images with bright splashes of color.",
        "His style captured the motion of athletes leaping toward a basketball goal or Jack Nicklaus following through on a golf swing.",
        "He sketched Olympic events live on television, and also captured less-kinetic scenes.",
