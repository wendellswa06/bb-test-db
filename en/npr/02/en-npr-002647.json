        "Mary, he is working every angle, isn't he?",

        "We hope it will.",
        "And at the same time, it does have things in it that are considered flaws that are attacked by the Republicans.",
        "He's got enough Democratic votes, even though some Democrats are a little worried about it, to get it passed.",
        "But in fact, he wants to get as much of a consensus as possible so that everybody in the country is on board, so it becomes everybody's stimulus and not just his, in terms of how it turns out.",

        "You're exactly right, Tony.",
        "Look, the president recognizes that failure is not an option.",
        "This economy is way too complex and the problem is way too severe for anyone to fail.",
        "And what's he's trying to do - and I would make the argument from a political standpoint, he's doing it brilliantly - is he's trying to make sure that everyone's fingerprints are on this stimulus package so that A, he can say to the American people that we're all in this together, but also B, that if, in fact, it does fail, he can say, at least we tried, but everyone is to blame, not just him.",
        "Remember, Tony, this man is up for re-election in four years in 2012, and the White House is already thinking about how to position him in 2012, regardless of who the Republican nominee is going to be.",
        "The American people have always voted by their pocketbooks.",

        "It seems to me that there is a gap in ideology between House Republicans and Senate Republicans.",
        "Now, if you agree, to what do you attribute that?",
        "Because, are GOP senators more willing to go along with the plan than their House counterparts?",
        "Well, there is disunity on the Republican side between the House and the Senate because senators, of course, represent whole states, that's one thing.",
        "And depending on what's going on across the state economically, they would be more inclined to be in favor of something than House members who represent districts.",

        "Whereas on the Senate side, the senators in charge of the committee seem to have been talking to the Republicans, crafting legislation together.",
        "But the Senate has different traditions and different approaches.",
        "Also, the margin in the House is much larger than in it is in the Senate for the Democrats.",
        "They can win it without them.",
