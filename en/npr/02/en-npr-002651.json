        "The ease with which this multi-linear story ranges back and forth in both time and place, from 17th century European courts to contemporary Brazilian cities, towns, forests, rivers and the dark ocean, suggests a writer with a grand scheme and the muscle to make it work.",

        "How much influence does one individual writer, though, have over this entire character which, as you say, is absolutely archetypal?",
        "Well, it depends.",
        "Basically, what happens in terms of the character is that a writer comes along, picks up the character, plays with it a while, then puts it back in the toy box.",
        "So Orson Scott Card is going to come along, do whatever he does, go away; the character will endure.",
        "Is there more diversity amongst superhero comic book characters than there would've been when you were a kid?",
