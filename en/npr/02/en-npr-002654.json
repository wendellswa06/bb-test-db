        "And the - and the Democrats have been sensitive to this poll business.",

        "They also dropped the item going to fix up the Mall, when the Republicans...",
        "The National Mall.",
        "The National Mall, when the Republicans seized on that.",
        "So everybody is sensitive to how these things are playing out with the public.",
        "Let's move on to this topic.",
        "The Senate Judiciary Committee voting to approve attorney general nominee Eric Holder.",
        "Now, today's vote comes after Senate Republicans had forced a one-week delay.",
        "At issue was whether Holder would attempt to prosecute intelligence agents who authorized controversial interrogation tactics like waterboarding, something Holder has testified that he believes is torture.",
        "So there were a couple of holdouts, Mary, on the committee who voted against Holder over the issue of these possible future prosecutions.",
        "But the committee support overall seems to signal that this won't be an issue of major consequence for Holder against the whole Senate.",
        "Is that right?",
        "No, he will likely get confirmed in a matter of days, Eric Holder will.",
        "He's superbly qualified, and Senator Specter has been trying to touch him up around the ears a little bit.",
        "The strategy with Eric Holder was to have the Republicans beat up on him in sort of revenge for what happened to Gonzales and - Alberto Gonzales, and then to go ahead and confirm him.",
        "No one has in mind not confirming him.",
        "And then there were a couple of senators who were concerned about whether they're going to prosecute anybody for using these interrogation techniques, and wanted to get some kind of firm commitment on that.",
        "But it's a delay, but Obama has already started naming the people who will be the assistant attorney generals and jobs below Eric Holder, and he will be confirmed in a matter of days.",
        "Let's talk about this potential prosecution issue a little bit more, Robert.",
        "Do you think that Obama would pursue prosecutions against former Bush administration officials if it could be proven that they committed serious violations of the law, even if Obama's Justice Department doesn't go looking for anybody on their own?",
        "I don't think so.",
        "I think intuitively, the president wants just to move the ball forward and not look back.",
        "I think his supporters, though, particularly, Moveon.org, maybe Nancy Pelosi and the more left wing of the Democratic Party, wants the president to do that.",
        "But, you know, this president is a little bit different.",
        "He's showing us through his Cabinet appointments, Tony, through his public statements and his overall disposition that he want to govern as a moderate, and the last thing that you want to do is go to the extreme left and alienate the people out there that voted for you, IEDs, Obama Republicans and these moderate Democrats and these Reagan Democrats, whatever, you want to call them.",
        "So, no, to answer your question, I don't think that's going to happen, although, I do think there's going to be a lot of chatter.",
        "I think this is going to probably stir up in the blogs and then particularly with Obama's hard-left supporters, but I don't think its' going to go anywhere.",
        "Well, there are people who are not even hard left, I mean, who think that there ought to be some prosecutions.",
        "In fact, you can argue that if government officials spend eight years in office and do things that are in violation of the law and no one does anything about it ever, that just means that the next administration can do whatever they want, and no one will ever say anything about it.",
        "Once it's over, it's over, and it stays.",
        "So there are arguments, on the other hand, for pursuing some of these things, but I agree with Robert that Obama has already made clear that he's not interested in pursuing them.",
        "Well, you know, this thought came to me, Mary, and I thought of you actually.",
        "Is this situation with Bush and Guantanamo at all similar to 30 years ago?",
        "Let's go back you and I, when then President Gerald Ford pardoned Richard Nixon because, as he said it at the time, the nation needed to heal from the wounds of Watergate and move forward."

        "It's the same thing.",
