        "The indications are, though, that these will be difficult conditions for the Arab League to accept, and what happens next in terms of lifting the sanctions, that seems rather unlikely.",
        "Well, what happens next will seem to have Turkey as a focal point, as we mentioned a former ally of the Bashar al-Assad government and now seemingly among the most determined opponents.",
        "No question about it.",
        "I mean, you were absolutely right.",
        "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the prime minister here, made a concerted and prolonged effort to rebuild relations with Syria that had grown very bad back in the '90s - this was over the Kurdish rebellion issue - but in any event, once the new AKP government here came in in 2002, there were years and years of rebuilding going on.",
        "The prime minister and the president of Syria would take vacations together.",
        "They would visit each other.",
        "A personal relationship began to develop.",
        "The free trade agreement between the two countries signed in 2007 showed a booming growth, in relative terms compared to what it had been, between southeastern Turkey, the Gaziantep area and Aleppo in the north of Syria.",
        "And now all of that is just reversed immediately, at least for now.",
        "The - I was just in Gaziantep, and the Syrian consulate there is closed.",
        "There's a sign on the door, closed for further notice.",
        "The taxis that you used to take into Aleppo, crossing this border without any paperwork to speak of, those are all gone.",
        "The businessmen say yes, it's all dried up, and they're really hoping that it can come back because it has been very beneficial for these Turkish businessmen.",
        "But to keep it clearly in perspective, these trade ties are much more important to Syria than they are to Turkey, and combined with all of the other sanctions, Arab League, European, Canadian, American, this could really start to hurt them.",
        "And last week we saw the Syrian - excuse me, the Turkish foreign minister talking about the establishment of areas of protection for Syrians across the Syrian border in Syria, protected by Turkish armed force.",
        "Well, yeah, and we have to take that with a bit of caution.",
        "If you read very carefully what he said there, it was this may become necessary if we see hundreds of thousands of people fleeing, a huge flight of civilians.",
        "And the need to protect civilian life is the tag that this would be hung on if it were to happen.",
        "Turkey has also made it very clear that they have no desire to be out front on this effort.",
        "They are on the border.",
        "They do have the Hatay Province, very mountainous border area, and a much longer border than that even, with Syria.",
        "And as a practical matter, that would be a place where this safe zone or humanitarian corridor, whatever you want to call it, could be implemented.",
        "But there is really very little, if any, desire in the foreign policy circles in Ankara to be out front on this.",
        "They would much rather see the Arab League and the U.N.",
        "and preferably other folks as well involved before anything like that happens."

        "Well, this is a really valid point, I mean, that you could be inflicting enormous costs on ordinary Syrians and that you could only really harden the regime's resolve, and they could dig in and last for quite a long time.",
        "And it has to be remembered that unlike the situation involving Libya, there is no agreement at the Security Council to issue a Chapter Seven usage, use of force to protect civilian life.",
        "It's unlikely that there will be, but Russia and China oppose it.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, for now, the main effort appears to be this Arab League proposal, and I think quite rightly the United States is putting its weight behind this effort, along with sanctions.",
        "I think it's important to remember that however flawed these options may be, they are the best ones given the potential consequences of further intervention.",
        "The potential consequences of further intervention, well, clearly many more people killed in Syria than had been killed in Libya when NATO forces intervened there.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The - you know, Syria is not Libya for a number of reasons.",
        "I mean, it's an ethnic and sectarian mosaic, and the consequences, I think, of increased militarization of the conflict, of greater civil war, would be disastrous for the surrounding region.",

        "It's connected to Jordan and Lebanon.",

        "Maybe.",
        "Well, even there, I mean, there's tremendous risks associated with that, and I think the caller rightly noted that from a domestic, you know, resource standpoint, we just don't have that capability.",
        "And, you know, the real issue is the effectiveness of those kinds of measures.",
        "I mean, in many respects, safe zones are already being created by the Syrians themselves in a number of provinces, and I think it's important to remember the symbolic effects of any type of U.S.",

        "There have been some groups in Syria, opposition groups that say we need a no-fly zone as there was in Libya to protect us, a no-drive zone, too, to keep those Syrian armored groups from moving around and hitting us in our cities.",
        "Is there much appetite for that in Turkey?",
        "There is not; most especially there is not if a Turkish military involvement is going to be heavy or prominent.",
        "As Fred said, the risks and the perception that you are not just dealing with Syria, you're dealing with what is sometimes known as the resistance axis, which includes Iran, includes Hezbollah, just creates an entire new dynamic of risk that was not present in Libya.",
        "In Libya, you had half the country essentially, in very rough calculations, suddenly breaking away, and you had safe areas almost immediately, within days.",
        "Here, these rebels in Syria, they don't have that.",
        "They do not have, at this point, an army that is willing to turn on its leader.",
        "It is still essentially loyal, especially at the higher officer corps level, and we are seeing anecdotal notes of defections.",
        "We are seeing more violence, too, with some of these defecting soldiers start to turn against their colleagues, but that is a long, slow, incremental process, it seems at this point.",
        "And I think the earlier point that Fred made is also very true, that with the U.S.",
        "now going into an election year, the kinds of comments we heard from the caller, which I believe are fairly widespread, are going to be getting a much greater megaphone to the extent that foreign policy comes up in the campaign, which I think in the general cycle it may well, once we get through the primaries.",

        "If they're feeling the economic pain, they may shift over to the opposition.",
