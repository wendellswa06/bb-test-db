        "And I'm very concerned about the isolation of the people.",
        "And I think that the Arab League sanctions didn't go far enough, and they need to impose commercial air flights because I think that sanctions can be imposed in a way that to not hurt the people who are rebelling, the poorer people, the people Hama and Homs and the outskirts of Damascus.",
        "And something really needs to be done to put pressure on the upper classes, the Damascus Souk and Aleppo and the university professors and the upper classes, the Assad regime supporters.",
        "And I think it's not going to hurt the poorer people because they are isolated anyway by economics, but it will put pressure on dual-nationals, expatriates.",
        "If they can't fly out, if they know that they're isolated, that will keep them off the fence, and maybe they can really, you know, get off the sidelines because there really is a reality distortion zone between the elite classes, the business classes, and the rest of Syria.",
        "So thank you for taking my comment.",
        "Oh, thank you very much for the call, Susan.",
        "And Fred Wehrey, as she suggests, there are a few more turns to the sanctions ratchet, if you will.",
        "That's certainly an option.",
        "I mean, it was actually applied in Libya after the Lockerbie incident.",
        "I mean, the objective there is, as you said, to really ratchet up the pain on the wealthy supporters of the regime.",
        "You know, but there again, just curtailing their travel, their connections to the world, their lifestyle, is that really enough to influence the men with guns?",
        "And that's what we just, you know, don't know.",
        "I think another important point about the Arab League sanctions that needs to be made is the symbolic effect of ostracizing Syria as a country from the Arab community, from the Arab world and the signal that that sends to some of Assad's supporters who see Syria as the beating heart of the Arab world.",
        "I mean, I think this is going to send them a powerful message about whether they should continue to support this president.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller in on the conversation.",

        "Yeah, hi, thanks for taking this call.",
        "As a Libyan, you know, I know how much the no-fly zone did, and what the thing is about Libya is that you could divide it in two.",
        "And the problem is with Syria, geographically, it's not helping the Free Syrian Army, the defectors.",
        "And there's, I don't know, reports there may be over 20,000 that have defected from the army, but they can't conglomerate in a place."

        "Turkey does not want to go into Syria and take territory.",
        "There was a moment back in the spring where the two armies were lined up side-by-side, and it was a bit tense.",
        "Neither side really wants to get into that kind of a confrontation, and if there's any way to avoid doing that, Turkey will avoid it.",
        "And Fred Wehrey, there's another point that has to be kept in the back of everyone's mind: If Syria and Turkey somehow get involved militarily, Turkey's a member of NATO.",
        "That's right.",
        "It could, you know, entangle NATO in this conflict, and I think also the Iran factor needs to be weighed here, as well, and just the larger issue of regionalization, you know, of the conflict if Turkey intervenes and the signal that that will send to Iran.",

        "Using Libya as a model for success is, I think, is flawed, and we don't know where all those surface-to-air missiles are.",
        "And to think that introducing more chaos into the region is going to enhance stability is just folly, and I'll leave it at that.",

        "There were people focused much more on the goal, results-oriented thinking, and in this case, that would mean, well, if we can change the regime in Syria, they may not be so close to Iran anymore, which would be a huge - practically a sea change in Middle East foreign policy affairs.",
        "But the risks in that would entail, I think, are very heavily - need to be heavily weighed at this point.",

        "At a minimum, it's an opportunity to run up the price of their investment in the New York Times Company.",
        "And on the other end of the spectrum, it's calling attention to the fact that somebody, perhaps a Sam Zell or a Rupert Murdoch, will offer a share price for the New York Times Company that they'll have to take very seriously.",
        "Now, Brown says if Harbinger can gain enough influence on the Times' board to orchestrate a sale of the paper, something along the lines of Dow Jones' recent sale to NewsCorp, they could double or even triple the share price at a time when actual profits for the company are sinking.",

        "That makes a shareholder revolt pretty tough to pull off, but it may not matter so much in the end.",
