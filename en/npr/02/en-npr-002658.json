        "In a statement, EPA transition official Doug Ericksen said it was an effort to limit excessive travel costs and save taxpayer money, but some EPA staff pulled from the event are based just blocks away in downtown Anchorage.",
        "Organizer Eilo says the EPA worked hard to avoid disrupting the conference, and only one of more than a hundred sessions had to be canceled.",
        "Still, he says this adds to a list of concerns.",

        "Snyder released emails related to the Flint water crisis.",

        "Remember, this started when Flint was under the control of a series of state-appointed emergency managers.",
        "And so he is hoping that by releasing 274 pages of electronic messages between him and his advisers related to Flint that, you know, this can help explain what's going on.",
        "And what then did we learn from these emails that the governor released?",
        "That Rick Snyder was informed in late September, there might be a problem.",
        "That was 17, 18 months after the first complaints from Flint.",
        "But, Snyder's aid seemed to think that it wasn't the state's job to do something about it, that it was serious but that the responsibility rested with Flint officials even though, under local emergency management, the state treasurer had to sign off on the drinking water switch that caused the problem in the first place.",
        "Also these same aides to the governor kind of dismissed the early complaints about lead contamination.",

        "The temptation, I think, is to think of the Inquisition as a kind of throwback.",
        "Nothing quite says Medieval the way the word inquisition does.",

        "If you do, you begin to see that the Inquisition has a lot of characteristics that are not really medieval but in fact modern.",
        "You know, there's always been persecution, there's always been hatred, but the Inquisition is something that is institutionalized.",
        "And institutions require a kind of infrastructure.",
        "You need to be able to keep records, to, you know, amass information, and then you need to be able to find it.",

        "It's uncanny.",
        "There's an inquisitor named Bernard Gui.",
        "He compiled an Inquisition manual, you know, for use by other inquisitors, and it became the basis of many such manuals.",
        "And if you look at that and then you look at modern manuals for, for instance, police forces or the military, you begin to see that there isn't a trick that is used nowadays that wasn't in use by the Inquisition, you know, the psychology of interrogation, the ruses that people would use when you're questioning.",
