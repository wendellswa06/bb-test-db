        "You know, Farai, also, I would add, it's kind of interesting.",
        "If you look at Ohio and Texas - to sort of play upon what Michael just said - Senator Obama won in all of the big cities in Texas.",
        "You know, for example, he won in Houston.",
        "He won in Dallas.",
        "He won in Austin.",
        "Senator Clinton took over the rest of the state and, you know, to just paraphrase a friend of mine, Chris Matthews, over at NBC, one of the things that we were noticing as we were watching the returns come in is that you could almost argue that we're beginning to almost see a sort of class warfare.",
        "People who have - who are educated, who have college degrees that earn you know, $50,000 or more per year, tend to vote for Barack Obama.",
        "We saw that strong last night in Texas and in and in Ohio, more blue collar workers that are really feeling economically insecure at this point in time seem to be remembering the good old days of Bill Clinton as a lot of people told us in exit polls.",
        "And some of these people felt that if they vote for Senator Clinton, that she will be getting the sage advice of her husband, and that jobs will - you know, manufacturing jobs will somehow just miraculously start to pour back into Ohio.",
        "It is very interesting to see how this is playing out.",
        "Michael, what about this whole delegate situation?",
        "In a second, I want to move on to the Republicans, who have a very different situation, a very different way of counting the numbers.",
        "But there, right now, does not seemed to be a way to avoid some kind of hand from Democratic Party leaders, whether it's superdelegates or whether it's the head of the DNC.",
        "What's going to happen considering that no matter who wins, they're not going to reach this magic number?",
        "You know, Farai, there's so much that can be said about this delegate counting process, you know.",
        "If the Democrats counted the delegates the way the Republicans do, this nomination would have ended some time ago and we wouldn't even be talking about Barack Obama because Hillary Clinton has cleaned up in the larger states that have had the contests.",
        "But we have this proportional system, and in some places, it's even more convoluted when you consider in Texas you have the primaries and then the caucuses and a proportional distribution thereafter.",
        "I think it's going to go to the superdelegates.",
        "And I - while I'm not crazy about the idea that there should be superdelegates, I think that if they are going to be there, and they are, they ought to be able to vote their conscience, whatever their conscience - however they define that.",
        "And so for that reason, I'm not necessarily too upset about it.",
        "The reality is, many of these superdelegates have put in years and years in the party and campaigns and former elected officials and so on and so forth.",
        "And it seems to me that they have, you know, almost as much of a reason to claim some knowledge of their local electorates as anybody else.",
        "Having said all that, though, it is going to go to the superdelegates.",
        "And I have to tell you, Farai, if the Obama supporters' argument that the superdelegates should vote the way the states are going, is the way that this begins to break out, then Hillary Clinton has a chance again, because she's won so many of the larger states.",
        "But you know...",
        "This is great positioning for the Republican party and for Senator McCain.",
        "Number one, what President Bush's endorsement of Senator McCain does for him is it sort of lends him a little bit of support and credibility from the conservative part of the party that likes President Bush but is not so enchanted with Senator McCain.",
        "Also, it gives him a huge jump on Senator Clinton and Senator Obama in terms of fundraising, and he can immediately start his general campaign right now.",
        "From now and through November, he will start campaigning against Senator Obama.",
        "He will start campaigning against Senator Clinton, and they are giving him a blueprint, literally blow by blow about how to campaign against them.",
        "And I think that the fact that they were - that Clinton and Obama will not only be campaigning against one another, but the fact that they're now going to be in a position where they have to campaign against him, it would allow him to stay in the media and garner attention and people will not forget about him the way we forgot about Governor Huckabee and even Ron Paul.",
        "Well, Governor Huckabee, does he still have any power in terms of wrangling conservatives in the party?",
        "It seems as if he's going to play nice with Senator McCain.",
        "What good can he do to McCain, or are conservatives still going to be upset?"

        "I think conservatives, there is a segment of the conservative coalition that is still not yet ready to accept John McCain, and so he's going to have to spend his time working on that segment.",
        "And perhaps Huckabee can be helpful in that regard.",
        "Everything I've heard suggests that the two of them have a pretty good personal relationship, and that Huckabee would be helpful.",
        "He probably wants to be vice president as well.",
        "So I would imagine that an opportunity to get on the ticket would be even more of an inducement to Huckabee to do all he can to get behind McCain.",
        "Conservatives, and evangelical conservatives in particular, are quite enamored with Governor Huckabee.",
        "Women, who, you know, disproportionately go out and vote - whether they're Democrats or Republicans - but, you know, the polls are showing that Republican women really like Governor Huckabee.",
        "He is from the South.",
        "And I think when you put all of that together, he could be a very attractive candidate for Senator McCain, because I strongly suspect that the very social conservative wing of the Republican Party is never going to fully embrace Senator McCain.",

        "They can be peaceful, open green spaces, especially appealing in crowded cities, like Philadelphia, where people sought more community involvement for historic cemeteries' upkeep and ended up with a city gardening and a continuing education center.",
        "Peter Crimmins of member station WHYY takes us there.",
        "Two hundred years ago, The Woodlands cemetery in west Philadelphia was the country estate of William Hamilton, one of America's preeminent horticulturalists.",
