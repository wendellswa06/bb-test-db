        "You're welcome.",
        "And, you know, yes, I think we know the president frequently clashes with reporters, but this is the first time that we've seen him actually deny people's credentials since he took office.",
        "And then also remarkable that following the exchange, the press secretary, Sarah Sanders, shared what I think reasonable people see as an altered video justifying the suspension of Acosta's pass.",
        "Now, Susan, you wrote about this in your weekly letter from washington about what a divisive and unusual week this has been.",
        "How concerned should we be about all of this, particularly people who are not in the media?",
        "Well, look.",
        "I do think it's extremely disturbing on so many levels.",
        "Obviously, we have a norm-shattering president.",
        "Already one of the norms that he's most consistently railed about is that of respect for the free and independent press.",
        "As you know, even before he became president, this was a theme of Trump's What I'm disturbed by is, No. 1, it's by design.",
        "This is a political calculation.",
        "You saw this actually from the moment that President Trump entered office - actually was in February of 2017 that he first used the term enemy of the people to refer to journalists.",
        "Now, of course, I'd like to say to your listeners - we're not the enemy of the people.",
        "I lived in Russia for four years.",
        "When Stalin sent millions to the gulag, the official sentence that they used to condemn people to the camps was enemy of the people.",
        "This is a phrase that President Trump knows full well is resonant with that.",
        "And it is contrary to our Constitution, which enshrines protections for journalists.",
        "And, you know, that exchange the other day, just quickly, to me, encapsulated, you know, how calculated President Trump's attacks on us are, you know.",
        "To that point, you know, Kelly, you wrote an interesting column about this.",
        "And you offered an interesting perspective, which is that, namely, this - given that this is calculated, that Jim Acosta should have responded differently.",
        "And that you also say that his own behavior was unprofessional and that this could have been anticipated, and he could have handled this differently.",
        "Could you talk a little bit more, as briefly as you can, about why you say that?",
        "So historically, the White House press corps has notoriously asked long-winded double-barreled argumentative questions, but that is not the best practice for asking questions.",
        "And we teach this all the time to journalists that the best practice for asking questions is to ask a neutral question and ask an open-ended question.",
        "And I wish that Jim Acosta had done that because then it would not have opened the door for the president to accuse him of being an enemy of the people, fake news, biased.",
        "And what you saw, you saw the president this week being horrific to three other reporters who were doing just that, who were asking neutral, open-ended, Hard-hitting questions.",
        "And what happens when you do that is it reveals the true president right?",
        "And it doesn't allow him to seize control of the situation in the way that an argumentative question allows him to seize control.",
        "I have to say, though, Margaret, as a former White House correspondent myself, I saw plenty of argumentative, obnoxious, attention-seeking reporters, particularly from conservative media outlets it has to be said.",
        "Their credentials have never been pulled.",
        "Oh, yeah, never.",
        "I mean, and of course he's not going to pull anybody's credentials who is on his side.",
        "But - and I'm not suggesting that White House press conferences are anything other than theater, but if they were, we would get better results.",
        "Margaret, what do you have to say about this?",
        "Well, I actually wrote a column saying that I thought that CNN should take a very strong stand on this and sue the Trump White House because whether or not we like Jim Acosta's particular style of asking questions - I think that is, you know, something we can talk about, of course - but I think it's beside the point, which is that the president and the White House shouldn't be determining whose reporting they like and don't like because that's a very slippery slope.",
        "You know, you start to go down that road and then it's going to be like, well, we liked this story you wrote, so you're in.",
        "But we didn't like this story you wrote, and so you're out.",
        "And I think there's a really serious First Amendment issue here that should be addressed and addressed in court."

        "That doesn't mean that the president or someone else can't decide to have an exclusive interview or give particular information to somebody, but when there is general access, you can't start saying you're in and you're out.",

        "I wish they would, I really do.",
        "I wish that the White House Correspondents Association would band together, not to present a united press, but to present a united defense of the First Amendment.",
        "I completely agree with Margaret that the president should not pick and choose who is admitted into the press corps and into the press conferences.",
        "And I wish that they would band together when the president refuses to ask a question to then have the next reporter follow up and insist that that question is answered.",
        "And also to - I think that they should boycott the press conferences until he allows Jim Acosta to come back into the White House.",

        "So I don't think it's the right action.",
