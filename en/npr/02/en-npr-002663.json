        "These days especially, you make careful decisions every time you fork over your credit card - weighing your options, the quality of the item, how much you really want it.",
        "Well, guess what.",
        "You may think you're making rational choices; you may believe you are, but a lot of the time you're not.",
        "The emotional parts of your brain intervene before your intellect even knows what's going on, and it turns out that the same mechanisms apply whether you're choosing a power drill for Uncle Ed, a baseball team, a movie star or a politician.",
        "We're talking about the cutting-edge of marketing and technology.",
        "Neuromarketing, it's called and it beats the pants of standard market research because it doesn't rely on what we tell pollsters or how a few of us react in a focus group; it looks directly into our brains.",
        "Martin Lindstrom spent four years and $7 million on a project to combine market research and advanced scanning devices.",
        "He joins us in just a moment.",
        "Later in the hour, a triplet of stories coming out of Chicago: all the buzz from the Tribune's bankruptcy, laid-off workers holding a sit in to astonishing corruption charges against Governor Rod Blagojevich.",
        "We'll check in on the windy city.",
        "But first, why do you buy what you buy?",
        "What's the brand loyalty you've never been able to shake, and you still can't explain it?",

        "Well, thanks, Neal.",
        "Thanks for inviting me.",
        "And let's begin with the Pepsi Challenge.",
        "Tests show that about half of us prefer Pepsi in blind taste tests, nowhere close to their actual market share.",
        "But then it gets really interesting when people know in advance that this cup is Pepsi and that cup is Coke.",
        "Well, exactly what happened was really surprising, because when people were not aware of what they were drinking, they loved Pepsi.",
        "But when they were told while they had their brains scanned, DfMRI, the total opposite happens.",
        "The preference for the taste changed its mind, literally, and said, hey, I don't like Pepsi anymore; I do prefer Coke.",
        "So, what we learned here is that emotion time after time actually overwrites everything in our brains and make us change our mind, and we really believe what we're thinking.",
        "And so, as you put it, the generations of advertisements, all the jingles suddenly go off in our heads - the very Coke-iness(ph) of Coke, as you put it - is what makes our emotional part of our brain think, I like Coke.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "You know, what's fascinating about this, it happens every time.",
        "You have to remember, when you and I walk down the supermarket aisle, about 60 percent of all the brands we buy, we made those decisions in only four seconds.",
        "So, literary there's no way we can go through a concrete, deep analysis of every brand we pick down.",
        "Typically that is our soft conscious part of the brain which are making the choices for us."

        "Our subconscious parts of the brain, and fMRI can tell us that how?",
        "Well, the way it works is very simple.",
        "When we ask people in focus groups or whatever techniques we have, we answer things which we think are real or what we think is the truth, but the case is, we're so influenced by everything - we don't like the person interviewing us, may be in a bad mood today, or it really means that perhaps I'm actually not saying the truth because I'm not aware of what the truth is.",
        "With fMRI and all the similar neuroscience-based technologies we're looking to the brain.",
        "And what we do with fMRI - and the F stands for functional - we basically are running the whole movie of the brain to see what regions in the brains are activated.",
        "So, for example, when we did an amazing smoking study to see why people are smoking, we looked into an area called the nucleus accumbens; that's basically the craving spot in our brain.",
        "And when we could see that being activated, it fired it all, lit it up as a fireball, and then we knew there was activity going on.",
        "Then we had a team of professors and doctors out of Oxford in U.K.",
        "analyzing the data and then helping us to conclude what really goes on as people expose for ads, a TV commercials or whatever it may be.",
        "And the astonishing part of that smoking study was you were trying to figure out the effects of the warnings on cigarette boxes - and not just the namby-pamby warnings that we have in the United States...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "But the really horrifying things, the pictures of a black lungs and that sort of thing that they have on...",

        "I just wanted to comment.",

        "For example, people would refer to refrigerators as Frigidaires.",
        "People would refer to napkins that you can clean your nose as Kleenex, and you even order a soda not by saying soda pop, by ordering, can I have a Coke?",
        "And then they refer, well, do you want, you know, a lime Coke or whatever Coke?",
        "And they refer to it as a Coke.",
        "And I found that I shop a lot of times, even if it's been 30 years, I still shop with those brands.",
        "The foreign ministry put out the word that Pakistan had been sharing intelligence with the U.S.",
        "on Osama bin Laden's compound since 2009.",
        "Foreign Secretary Bashir repeated that assertion as he countered CIA chief Panetta's suspicions that Pakistan plays a double game when it comes to militants."
