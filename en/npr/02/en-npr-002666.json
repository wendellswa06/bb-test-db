        "If you take the entire world's population in over the last three years, we smoked 13 percent more.",
        "It's the same as 15 billion cigarettes was puffed up every day across the world.",
        "So, I wanted to find out why, and that's a reason why we decided to look into the health warnings.",
        "And those health warnings in North America is not very dramatic.",
        "In fact, even the European ones, which are saying smoking kill and actually takes the space of half a packet, is not as dramatic as the one from Canada and Brazil and Thailand and Australia, where you're literally see lungs and arms and legs cut off as a reflection of smoking too much.",
        "Whenever we scanned consumers' brains - smokers and former smokers - what happened was that the nucleus accumbens - so, the cravings spot in their brains - again were lighting as a fireball.",
        "We literally could see that one of the most powerful tools to make people smoke was the health warnings on cigarette packs.",
        "We're talking with Martin Lindstrom about his book, \"\"Buyology: Truth and Lies About Why We Buy.\"\" If you'd like to join the conversation, tell us about the brand loyalty you can't shake, and can't quite explain, give us a call, 800-989-8255; email us, talk@npr.org.",

        "I grew up with my dad in love - I'm 48 years old - and my dad was in love with Chrysler all his life, and I grew up with that sort of brand loyalty passed on.",
        "And I remember having an old beater of a Dodge Dart; it was bulletproof.",
        "But as we got into the '70s, we ended up with a few automobiles that were really pretty horrible, and it took us a long time to shake that brand loyalty.",
        "It just all seemed kind of relevant to this topic today, considering, with the big-three auto bailout, and I just thought I'd ask your comments on that.",
        "Are we little irrational on some of the big three that we still seemed to be a bit tied to?",
        "Martin Lindstrom, does the same mechanism apply if we're talking about a big-ticket item like an automobile that does when we're talking about a Coke or Pepsi?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "In fact, it counts even more, because a big-ticket item is something we've been saving for a long time.",
        "Typically we will use it on many years because it's so expensive, and typically we buy that item because it also tells the surrounding world who we are.",
        "So, when Matt is telling this story, it's not unusual, and in fact, what we can see is that people typically, if they are really in love with a brand and it really sort of is letting them down, they typically are first changing the brand after the third attempt when they have been let down, because that is the brand loyalty.",
        "In the end of the day, Matt, by the way, your loyalty is almost like a human being, not the same, but almost.",
        "It's like if you have a good friend and he's letting you down once, you will not skip him.",
        "It has to take him a couple of tries before he really manages to make sure he doesn't like you and you don't like him anymore.",
        "So, really, it's the same here.",
        "It may be not as dramatic, but it's the same mechanism as we're talking about.",
        "It's emotions in systematic way.",
        "That describes my experience to a tee.",
        "It took a couple of Dodge Aspens and Plymouth Volares to realize, hey, man, maybe we need to go to Japanese, and that's what we wound up doing."

        "How come advertising is so ineffectual?",

        "And what happens right now is that, you know, the advertising industry cannot reach you anymore because you have a filter which is incredibly thick.",

        "And that is something which really doesn't - it doesn't count if it's a lot of new models coming out.",
        "At the end of the day, it's something else which comforts me; that is, the brand listens to me, I admire the brand, and people admire me because I wear or buy that brand.",
        "So, Matt - William, I guess the problem is we've all become a devout Toyota-ists, and it's going to take awhile before we reinvestigate the Ford faith.",

        "And marketing - marketers would argue that people, you know, they're just responding with their freewill to what we're saying, but I don't know, I wonder if your guest could comment on freewill being maybe subverted by, you know, old marketing methods and then especially this new method...",

        "And I'm not saying regulation is the answer to everything, but I certainly am saying there are some times in order to you communicating to kids or saying certain statements in the air which really are not truthful, no, should not be legal, and I think many countries are failing on that criteria.",
        "So, first of all, let me say one thing.",
        "I 100-percent agree with you.",
        "The second thing I want to say, neuromarketing is a little bit like a hammer.",

        "And that's exactly the case here as well.",

        "Now, here is the good news, Walter.",
        "None of those things are possible.",
