        "They expected to sell almost millions of that Segway.",
        "And guess what.",

        "They even had promotions on Amazon.com.",
        "They had a lot of PR, so much PR that I don't think any other release of a car has managed to have that much attention.",
        "But at the end of the day, what really happened here was that the mystery was not there.",
        "They did everything right and everything went wrong.",
        "And what we see is - and I want to say that, too, to the class listening right now - nine out of 10 of all new product releases around the world is failing.",
        "Guess what.",
        "In Japan, it's 9.7 out of 10 new product releases which are failing.",
        "The reason why?",
        "We're more skeptical, point one, as consumers, which is good.",
        "But the second reason why is because when we interview consumers and we ask them what they really want, what they're saying and what really is the truth very rarely actually match together.",
        "Typically we can't express what we want, and that's the reason why a lot of products are totally waste of money.",
        "Here is one of the students writing a question, Lauren in Pylesville, Maryland.",

        "Well, absolutely, Lauren.",
        "And I think - no, I want to take you back into a fascinating story which I love.",
        "The Coca-Cola bottle was developed in 1915, and the briefing originally was pretty intelligent.",
        "The briefing was to develop a bottle which is so systematically designed that if you break it down on the floor and it smashes into thousands of pieces of glass, you can still pick up one piece of glass and recognize the brand.",
        "And I've called that theory for smash of brand.",
        "And what's so powerful about that is if you take an Apple iPod today and look at it in the front, there's no logo on it.",
        "You still recognize that this is Apple.",
        "If you look at United Colors of Benetton, their ads, or you look at a Tiffany box, you will see that (unintelligible) color is enough to tell you who the brand is.",
        "That is going to be the next generation of hard to build brands.",
        "You're no longer going to see that logo there; you're going to see what I define as mashable component, so a color or a shape.",
        "Just think about \"\"Wall-E,\"\" the Disney movie.",
        "There you have a very shiny robot walking around supposedly that's sponsored by Apple.",
        "It looks like an Apple, but you really can't see it because there's no logo on it.",
        "At least on a subconscious level, however, we're aware that this is the Apple brand.",
        "And that's the way brands are going to appear as a product-placement feature, that you're not going to see the logo; you're going to see signals indirectly telling the story about the brand.",
        "So, it will matter less that James Bond prefers a certain brand of vodka.",
        "It's really the more subtle signal that will work.",
        "Well, that's right, Neal.",
        "And I think, Neal, when it comes to James Bond, he had - he spent around $100 million product-placement-wise in the latest movie which was released a couple of weeks ago here in United States.",
        "And what's interesting is we can see from the study that mostly it's a total waste of money.",
        "If you take a look at \"\"American Idol,\"\" which we were testing when we tested Coca-Cola, we tested Ford and Cingular before they turned in to be AT&T, we learned that Coca-Cola was doing a great job and so was, by the way, Cingular, now AT&T.",
        "But Ford was a total waste of money, and the reason why was because our brains want to make sure they can justify why a brand is appearing in a movie.",
        "If it supports the storyline, if the actor becomes the hero, our brain would say, hey, that makes sense.",
        "Let me remember that.",
        "But if it's totally out of context, then suddenly the brain will actually delete the brand in the brain and then I'd just have to sell it to you, what does the heck does a Ford car have to do with a singing contest?",
        "And that's the reason why Ford was spending supposedly $26 million sponsoring that show every year.",
        "Literally, it's deleting the brand in the brain.",
        "Now, it's not to say that \"\"American Idol\"\" is a waste of money for Ford; they just needs to change the concept, but at the present format, it certainly is deleting the brand in the brain.",
        "Well, yes and no. It is a goal, and I think a lot of brand marketers are flattered by it.",
        "The problem, however, is that suddenly it actually becomes generic and the company cannot control it anymore.",
        "That's the reason why supposedly Google were objecting to put the term into the U.K.",
        "dictionary, saying Googling, because they were afraid of that it becomes a generic term for searching.",
        "And if it comes to a generic term, what happens is that they can no longer either copyright it or trademark it or whatever type of term we're using for that particular device.",
        "So, in the end of the day, it is incredible powerful, yes, but if it goes too far, it actually turns against you and can be a little bit of a disaster.",

        "I don't really have brand loyal to any brand, but I'm willing to bet if you hook me up to an fMRI and showed a reel of cute, brightly colored commercials from Japan, my brain would light up like the Vegas Strip.",
        "I don't know what it is about Japanese products, but I can't seem to get enough of them.",
        "I even import them on websites like eBay and J-List.com.",
        "And, so are Japanese advertisements better in that regard than American ones?",
        "No, they're not.",
        "They're just very, very different.",
        "The Japanese market is known for one thing; that is, that they're releasing almost three times as many new brands as in the rest of the world.",
        "We are exposed for eight years of television commercials throughout life in Japan; only six years in United States.",
        "So, they actually have a competition, which is incredibly hard.",
        "But what they're doing which is different is that they are building a lot of human dimensions into their commercials.",
        "So, Hello Kitty and a lot of the other cartoons coming out of Japan are really human, and people love them because they can see themselves in them.",
        "You know, I spoke to a Hello Kitty fan the other day.",
        "She had 19,000 pieces of merchandising items at home, and not only that, her husband has a website called hellokittyhell.com..."

        "Let's get Mike on the line, and Mike calling us from Columbus in Ohio.",
        "Yes, I have a comment and a question.",
        "First, a comment: I've worked in marketing and advertising for a number of years, and I wondered if this is severely regulated or controlled or whatever.",
        "How do people find out - how are people going to find out about brands?",
        "Secondly, the question: I don't know that it's been covered so far, but how does a person form his or her initial attachments to a brand?",
        "On that first point, I'll say that the First Amendment is going to make it awfully difficult to impose any kind of regulations on this sort of thing.",
        "But anyway, on the second point, if you would, Martin Lindstrom?",
        "Well, the way you create a relationship with the consumer is to make sure you mirror the consumer's emotions into the brand.",
        "So, if I really love a brand, typically, I love it because I feel the brand understands me, but also because it reflects something which I'd like to stand for or something I can relate to.",
        "I think a good example here is the Mini Cooper, the car.",
        "Now, what's interesting is that car was actually manufactured using fMRI in Germany, where they wanted to replicate a cute, little baby face, and guess what.",
        "As people watch that particular car, had their brain scanned, they actually had exactly the same brain reaction as if you're watching a baby face.",
        "It was such a cute, little baby face that people just wanted to touch it.",
        "That was one of the reasons why that brand became so popular, because it was a humanization of a car and because a lot of people, in particular the female, doesn't feel that cars are very human and very sort of lovable;, that really struck a chord with them.",
        "So, the trick here is, if you can talk about tricks at all, is to make sure you can relate to the brand.",
        "The brand actually have an opinion, an opinion you can relate to.",
        "And most importantly, that brand tells the world who you are and who you're not, because quite often, we want to be seen as being more important than we are, and brands are helping us to make that happen.",
        "Thanks, Mike.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "And here's an email, Todd in Southfield, Michigan.",
        "French's Mustard, Heinz Ketchup and Mountain Dew, we will never stray from these brands.",
        "And well, I guess, that's typical of a lot of people once they're set.",

        "You know, that glass bottle creates a feeling of quality and also, we feel the taste is better just because we're touching it.",
