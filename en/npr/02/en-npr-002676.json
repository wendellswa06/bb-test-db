        "Robert, thanks for being here.",
        "Great to be with you.",

        "In brief, it shows that President Trump as a candidate was aware of his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, making some sort of effort to make a payment to Karen McDougal, the model that you mentioned.",
        "And this awareness is something that President Trump has long denied.",
        "And this is part of the ongoing effort by Michael Cohen to show that he could cooperate with the special counsel, Robert Mueller, should he be charged in the future.",
        "And when Michael Cohen makes reference to our friend David, he's talking about an executive with the National Enquirer or the parent company of the National Enquirer, right?",
        "It's not entirely clear by the transcript, but based on our reporting at The Washington Post and others, he's referencing David Pecker, who is running the tabloid - the National Enquirer - through an American media company.",
        "And he worked closely with Michael Cohn and Trump over the years to have exposure in the tabloids.",
        "So now Rudy Giuliani, though, is making a different argument.",
        "He says the tape is somehow exculpatory.",
        "It shows that this is the first time that Donald Trump is hearing about this possible deal to buy McDougal off.",
        "Is that your understanding of the tape?",
        "Is that how you hear it?",
        "We're right now in the middle of a legal war between Michael Cohen and President Trump's legal team.",
        "I experienced it firsthand this week and last night when this tape came out on CNN, I talked to Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, who said the president was actually just informed by Cohen about Karen McDougal and that perhaps potential payoff by that conversation.",
        "At the same time, Michael Cohen and his adviser and lawyer, Lanny Davis, are saying, you know what, the president knew everything, and we've got to prove it with this tape.",
        "Is - just to be clear - is the Trump campaign now acknowledging the affair and the payoff?",
        "Not exactly.",
        "They try to dance around the affair.",
        "Giuliani is saying the president is being made aware of something, but he wasn't aware of it in the past.",
        "That's NPR political reporters Don Gonyea and Sarah McCammon in Des Moines.",
        "This is some harsh rhetoric, even for North Korea.",
        "Is this just more attention seeking from Kim Jong Un, or should we be taking this seriously?",
        "This does seem a little different from what we've seen over the years.",
        "Over the years, we've seen North Korea having as its only real lever in international affairs is the threat to do military harm.",
        "The other thing we've seen is that when new presidents come into South Korea, as has happened recently there just last month, there's usually a time of testing and provocation from the North Korean government.",
        "But this seems a little more than before."

        "I think Americans should not believe that the new North - that the North Korean regime is able to carry out its threats to hit Austin, Texas, or Hawaii or Seattle with nuclear weapons as they were purporting it with the press conferences.",
        "But the problem seems to be on both sides of the Korean divide.",
        "There's an increasing tensioned desire to sound tough, and it's just an unstable situation.",
        "The North Koreans very certainly could damage South Korea and even Japan with their weapons.",
        "So I think this is - it's more than just the normal saber rattling - nuclear saber rattling we've heard from the North.",
        "Well, let's turn now to a domestic issue and look ahead to next week.",
        "The sequester is set to actually kick in.",
        "The Federal Aviation Administration has said it will start closing hundreds of airport control towers.",
        "Does this mean we can't fly?",
        "No. It's going to mean that flying will mainly be slower in certain parts of the country.",
        "One thing that many people may not understand about the role of control towers in aviation is they don't really do anything to keep the plane in the sky or keep it from falling down.",
        "Their functions are essentially those of traffic policemen at busy intersections or like stop traffic lights at intersections too.",
        "And so at these 140 odd towers they're going to close next week, what it'll mean is that anybody who's coming into that airport - whether it's a regional airliner or a private plane or an executive jet - is going to have to check with the other planes headed in via kind of CB radio.",
        "And they'll report on five miles out to the north, anybody else headed for Lancaster Airport in Pennsylvania, et cetera.",
        "So presumably, in ways in which it would be less safe would be if there was some collision at a crowded airport, mainly it'll be one more sort of slowing down of the air travel system.",
        "Lastly, Jim, there are rumblings that there's been a breakthrough on immigration reforms.",
        "Senator Chuck Schumer reportedly says there may be a deal between business and labor on how to manage low-wage foreign workers.",
        "What do you make of this?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think we've seen the macroelements of a deal for quite a while now in the sense that the Republican Party has recognized that for both the nation's good and its own long-term positioning, it needs to seem something other than just flatly resistant on immigration reform.",
        "And now it's been the micro level, essentially a question of how many temporary guest laborers and at what wage levels can be brought in to alleviate certain regional or seasonal labor shortages.",
        "And it looks as if the labor representatives and some of the big business representatives are agreeing between themselves, which is what a number of the senators from both parties have been looking forward.",
        "So I would expect that next month, this will be an actual sign of progress in public affairs.",
        "James Fallows is national correspondent with The Atlantic, and you can read his blog at jamesfallows.theatlantic.com.",

        "Sheridan has already survived wilderness firefighting, martial arts combat, and construction work in the South Pole.",
        "I wondered if he had some tips for those of us who feel slightly less equipped, and started by asking him what drew him to the apocalypse in the first place.",
        "You know, it never really came to a head until I had a son - which was really the catalyst for this book - really coming to grips with the responsibility I felt and, you know, if the big one hits and I'm not there, and if there's a zombie apocalypse and I'm not ready, to kind of hope for the best and tough-it-out attitude wasn't enough anymore, you know?",

        "So he actually, you know, will flint nap and break rock to get sharp edges and use those sharp edges for his knives to cut wood and make a bow drill to get fire.",
        "And it takes a long time.",
        "Yes, it's tough.",
        "Another thing you said was going to be critically important was transportation and that we should all know how to steal a car.",
        "If there is a huge outbreak, and, you know, 99 percent of people are killed by the flu or whatever, then you can go around stealing cars to your heart's content.",
        "And it's pretty easy with older cars, and it's pretty impossible with newer cars.",
        "I mean, most modern cars have so many electronic.",
        "They all have some switches, and they have chips in the keys, so you're never going to steal anything that new.",
        "But, you know, like a 1993 Honda Civic, that thing, you just jump in there and pop out the stuff on top of the ignition switch, and you can reach in and start it."
