        "Even Albornoz feels Chile's wage gap.",
        "She told me that her closest male friend from college, who often used her notes to study by, makes 10 times her salary even though Albornoz was a government minister, which would normally be a huge bargaining chip.",
        "Women have made some strides in the past few years.",
        "Participation in the workforce is up by almost 10 percent.",
        "But Chilean women are still behind the rest of Latin America, and they're not breaking into the major industries that drive Chile's economy.",

        "Olate also points out that there are laws on the books that should improve wages and working conditions.",
        "But she says they're rarely enforced.",
        "Some laws have helped women become more independent - like divorce.",
        "Yet it only became legal to divorce in Chile, in 2004.",
        "And there are also laws that hold women back - like a law that says that any business with more than 20 female employees must pay for day care until children turn 2.",
        "Conservative legal historian and professor Gonzalo Rojas admits that the law often causes big businesses to simply limit female hires.",

        "Principals in the Bush administration, the top people, kept meeting every single day.",
        "And they kept setting policy in these meetings so rapidly that the career professionals in the interagency reviews that tended to moderate things couldn't catch up.",
        "Now some people would say that's good; you had to respond rapidly, and you had to move quickly and you had to get rid of the risk aversion that we'd seen before 9/11.",
        "And that's all true, but the question is how far from one side to the other do you swing?",
        "You also write of the intelligence that the Central Intelligence Agency gathered before the war in Iraq.",
        "It's been widely known that there was no intelligence good enough to show that there was weapons of mass destruction, but you seem to go a little bit farther here, writing that there was actually intelligence gathered that seemed to fairly conclusively say, through source after source after source, that there was no nuclear program, at least, in Iraq.",
        "What I write about was an interesting program in which the CIA asked a series of relatives of Iraqi scientists to talk--to find ways to talk to their relatives.",
        "And I focus on one woman from Cleveland, and her brother was in the--had been in the Iraqi nuclear weapons program in the '80s and early '90s.",
        "And she went back to Iraq at the request of the CIA and talked to her brother.",
        "He just said, you know, `We haven't had a nuclear weapons program since the end of the Gulf War when it was abandoned.",
        "And she went back to America and told the CIA that.",
        "And she was--you know, they didn't really believe her.",
        "They thought that she was just getting fed disinformation by her brother, and they kind of ignored her and the other relatives who've said the same thing."

        "What were the steps that were taken?",
        "Well, there was--I write about a couple of meetings, one in Rome, I think, in 2002 in which one CIA officer who participated in the meetings called it, you know, kind of a secret pep rally where people from headquarters came out and told them that it was, you know, kind of time to get on board and that they should go out and start to try and gin up support within the foreign intelligence services of the countries they were serving.",
        "And the problem was that the CIA professionals in the Middle East were unenthusiastic about the war going in.",
        "Well, given the skepticism within the CIA in particular toward this war, who was it that ultimately pushed the agency to provide the intelligence to back up the assertions that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and to generally support the program?",

        "Well, here's what I'm wondering.",
        "A lot of people have asked if Vice President Cheney in particular went over to the CIA and pressured intelligence analysts or leaned on them in some way.",
        "You seem to write of a situation where Cheney hardly had to, because George Tenet, the director of the CIA, was at least as enthusiastic about gathering whatever evidence that the administration wanted.",
        "Well, he seems to have created an atmosphere where material could go right to the White House."
