        "One of the, if you will, the drawbacks or the reasons some people have turned against some traditional religions is the institutional aspect of it.",
        "You've heard a lot of people say, `I'm spiritual but not religious.",

        "I really see Oprah as per--when I say spiritual teacher, you know, I emphasize spiritual, but here now I want to emphasize teacher.",
        "Oprah is really teaching her audience, which is certainly another traditional function of someone who's up there on a platform.",
