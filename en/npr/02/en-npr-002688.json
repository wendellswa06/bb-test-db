        "That's right.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Sid, would you give it a pretty good rating for science in the film?",

        "It confused some things, I think, like antimatter and the God particle and so on, but these are mere details.",
        "Just having CERN mentioned - and another thought that crossed my mind, Ira, was when they showed the idea of particles going down all the piping in CERN, how beautiful it would be if we could actually have a teaching film that used all that technology to give a great visual representation."

        "Sid, when you talk to scientists, do they try to shy away from being the subject or to talk about science in movies?",
        "Yes, you know, there's an old tradition, which is partly true and partly not so true, that journalism and the media never represent science right, and a lot of scientists do get uptight about that.",
        "So you'll find a certain hard core, which will reject a whole movie if there's even one scientific mistake in it, but a younger scientist and more relaxed.",
        "And our attitude is you're allowed a little suspension of disbelief, as long as you have a good movie and get a lot of the science right.",

        "Do you have a favorite old science movie of yours?",

        "So…",
        "It made it a human story, which has its good points, but they sure drained all of the science out of the second version.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And in fact, you couldn't - I don't think you could understand what happened in that second one, why the Martians died in the end of that movie."
