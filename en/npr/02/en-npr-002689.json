        "Exactly, so - and I had nothing to do but shoot.",
        "So I just put my camera in their face all the time and got some interesting characters and narratives that emerged.",
        "And so from there, once, you know, we don't want to spoil the end of the movie, but they had quite a few disasters that happened along the way that enlarged the picture.",
        "Well Mark, did you have trouble with your brother hanging out with you and watching you do all this stuff?",
        "I like my brother, but you know, it's a bit much to have somebody putting a camera in your face all the time.",
        "And as he said, I was the - I'm the principal investigator of the experiment, and he felt like all my students had to let him talk to them, but I think eventually they warmed up to the whole idea of having somebody there.",

        "I mean, what you went through, the trials and tribulations of the first failure, the first flight, and then the second and what happened on the second flight, you know, the personal experience that went on there - you could not have written a better script, could you?",
        "I gave a talk last night, where, after we showed the movie, and I said well, you know, it could have worked the first time.",
        "It would have been great for me.",
