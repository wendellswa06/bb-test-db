        "So how widespread can we see this movie?",
        "Where is it being shown?",
        "Well, we just released it in New York City theatrically.",
        "And before that, we were at the Imagine Science Film Festival here in New York, and we got great reviews in Variety and New York Times, and so now we're taking it out across the country.",
        "We've got invitations from independent theaters in San Francisco and Virginia and Minneapolis, and we're approaching more.",
        "So we also want to take it out - as an independent, we have to look for innovative ways to get this film out since we can't really compete in the multiplexes.",
        "So we're talking to museums and planetariums, universities and schools.",
        "And so we expect it to get quite a bit of exposure over the next few weeks and months.",
        "Also we have on our Web site, blastmovie.com, we have a place where there's a map, where people can have screening requests.",
        "And we're looking at getting people involved who may not have a venue close to them but still want to see the movie.",
        "And we're talking about organizing house parties and special events to screen it because we really want to get this - in addition to getting the DVD - eventually to schools and even high schools.",
        "Because we really want to get people excited about science because we think the adventure element brings in the general audience.",
        "And in New York, we found that whole families were showing up to the film, and the kids were participating enthusiastically in the Q&As.",
        "So we didn't really realize that we had a kids' film until we started taking it out.",
        "So we're really excited about bringing it out to the general public and having people come to us and have screenings all over the country.",
        "Sid Perkowitz is also with us.",

        "Yeah.",

        "We don't all go to Antarctica, but mostly when you do an experiment, it doesn't work.",
        "It's harder when you're on a NASA timetable, and you have something as delicate as launching a balloon, but the basic idea applies to every scientist.",
        "Jon Kalish has the story.",

        "I would have loved to see a story on one of the grad students, what the failure of the experiment might have meant to one of them because it has different implications than it has for the principal investigator.",
        "And that maybe could be a follow-up kind of story, too, but all in all, I think it was very well done, sends the kind of message we need to send out.",
        "There could have been little films about everybody in this movie.",
        "Yeah, there's a lot of threads.",
        "In fact, The Onion gave us one review and said there are six documentaries in here.",
        "You know, there was quite a few things that - some real depth there.",
        "And there's also an interesting thread - we talked about earlier in the hour about \"\"Angels and Demons,\"\" the science-and-religion thread in there - and there was a great, large science-and-religion thread, Mark, in your film about one of the scientists trying to convince - was it you, trying to convince you - that there was a God behind finding something very important that they were looking for.",
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "Barton Etterfield(ph), who is my comrade-in-arms in making the whole experiment work, is a devout Christian.",
        "And he believes, and he, you know, prayed to make sure that it all would work out, and he was - when it looked like it wasn't going to happen, he was despaired.",
        "And then it all worked out in the end, and you know, you've got to give him credit.",
        "I mean, it seemed like, from his point of view, it all had divine intervention.",
        "But I would imagine a lot of scientists must not have liked that part of the movie.",
        "There are - my brother and I have coined a term, which is probably not new, called scientific fundamentalism, where we have a lot of scientists who see it are so offended by the idea that one of their own, so to speak, has these beliefs that they hate it.",
        "And they hate it so much, that they say the whole, entire movie is about religion.",
        "And in fact it's very - it's just a tiny thread in the movie.",
        "It is a tiny - and to me that's a strength of the film, I think.",
        "Yeah, and we - you know, we get a lot of compliments for that.",
        "We get a lot of compliments for - Paul had access to my family, and so he's in my house with his camera in my kids' faces.",
        "But it shows, you know, what is - the personal aspect of doing this.",
        "And Bart has his personal beliefs, and it would be a mistake not to show that.",
        "When you were editing the film, did you think about cutting any parts out or leaving them in, or…?"

        "Yeah, I mean, that's part of the process of editing.",
        "But I was definitely interested in drawing in a general audience, and so those elements are very accessible to a general audience.",
        "I mean, a lot of people who are not familiar with science find they can really relate to Bart's point of view, and they can relate to Mark's struggles with being separated from his family.",
        "So for me, drawing in those people is very important.",
        "And the interesting thing about Bart is I don't think - you know, he's managed to reconcile his scientific pursuit with his religious beliefs, and I don't think there's, you know, you can't really identify a conflict.",
        "I think that came through.",
        "I think he was not conflicted about what he was studying.",
        "There was no conflict between his religion and what he was studying.",
        "No, in fact he felt that what he was studying enhanced his religion.",
        "Yes.",
        "But it was interesting, he's trying to convert you to…",
        "He actually doesn't really go around proselytizing to all the students or anything.",
        "He pretty much keeps it to himself unless you ask him about it, in which case he's more than willing to spend a long time telling you about it.",
        "And as a filmmaker, I was certainly going to ask him about it.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "We're talking about - the film we're talking about is \"\"Blast!\"\" It's a film that features Paul Devlin - is made by Paul Devlin and featuring his brother, Mark Devlin, and - oh, that's the other thing, and I think Sid pointed this out correctly, is that you have no idea the team of people who are behind a project like this.",
        "And as you say in the movie, these are amateur engineers.",
        "They're building stuff, like out of Tinker Toy stuff, and they have no experience.",
