        "So…",

        "I should note, in the National Hockey League, just over half the players are Canadian - 7 of the 30 teams are in Canada.",
        "So why?",
        "Why hasn't a Canadian team won the Stanley Cup in all these years?",
        "You know, with this kind of thing, there's always a bunch of factors.",
        "And first off, we should say there's a little bit of bad luck there.",
        "Five of the finals since that Montreal win have included a Canadian team, and four of them went to a game seven, which means that a Canadian team was within a goal or two of winning the cup, a couple of bounces either way.",
        "And if that happens, you know, this issue is not nearly what it is.",
        "But there are fundamental reasons as well.",

        "Do Canadian teams have any special access to Canadian talent, or is it just all in the NHL draft?",
        "Yeah, the draft makes sure that the talent's distributed fairly evenly.",
        "There is a free-agent market as well, but some of the Canadian teams would say that it's actually tougher to get players to come back here because, you know, you've got, in the U.S., a lot of southern cities with very pleasant climates.",
        "And would a player rather go there than go play in Alberta, where it's -25 Celsius in winter?",
        "And also, I mean, a lot of people would say that there's a bit more pressure playing at home.",

        "Do you think it's really that much more meaningful to fans in Toronto for a team in Calgary to win the Stanley Cup than it is for a team in Buffalo to win the Stanley Cup?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "You know, a Toronto fan would probably not be too happy to see Montreal go that deep.",
        "A Calgary fan would almost never root for Edmonton.",
        "It's just kind of the notion that the Stanley Cup, which is, you know, a Canadian trophy - it's a beloved national treasure, but it hasn't been on a Stanley Cup parade in Canada since 1993.",
        "Since this is a perennial conversation over the past couple of decades, are Canadians getting sick of hearing about the Stanley Cup drought?",
        "Sure, but they're getting sick of it existing.",
        "I guess when people start talking about it again, there's a bit of eye-rolling - not this conversation again.",
        "But at the same time, I think everyone in this country carries a bit of frustration for it.",

        "Prosecutors painted Bulger as a twisted killer, so callous he laughed after murders, or took a nap as others pulled out victims' teeth so bodies couldn't be identified.",
        "Prosecutor Fred Wyshak got emotional telling jurors that Bulger had no qualms about murdering even innocents.",
        "This was not some Robin Hood story, Wyshak said, but rather a ruthless man who strangled women with his own hands, tortured extortion victims for hours, and joked every time he passed a victim's secret, makeshift grave.",

        "Prosecutors shot back that only Bulger is on trial here; and for jurors to try and use this case to, quote, \"\"send a message that the big, bad government needs to learn a lesson\"\" would violate their oath as jurors.",
        "Carney dismissed suggestions he was aiming for jury nullification - the legal term for when jurors get so mad at the government, they refuse to give the government a conviction."
