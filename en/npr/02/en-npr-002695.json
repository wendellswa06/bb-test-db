        "Right.",

        "Exactly.",

        "Well, the sense of connectivity, transmission that we can hear each other, see each other over great distances in more profound ways more and more as every day goes by, well, \"\"Sleep Dealer\"\" takes that as a given and imagines a hyper connected world, but then looks at that from a point of view we've never seen before, across borders, looking at it from a point of view of a worker in Latin America, a soldier in North America and this blogger/writer character who kind of ties them all together.",
        "And but, you know, so the process is really fun and challenging to try to think about this connected world from many different points of view.",
        "Sid, do you have any reaction to that?",
        "That is the strength of the film as I keep saying in different ways.",
        "It brings out the human aspect of what this connectivity means from the viewpoint of globalization and also from the viewpoint of person-to-person contact - really couldn't be a stronger human story in all the ways that matter, in my opinion.",

        "We're all going there together.",
        "But in science fiction cinema, I'd never seen the future from the point of view of the South, and that also became a really exciting part of my process, was to try to intervene in the genre and try to do something really new with it.",

        "And - but that being said, I'm also really tired, and I want to do a film that's easier to make for my next project.",
