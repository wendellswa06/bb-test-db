        "Welcome to you all.",
        "And let's get right to it.",
        "So you just heard the story of Carlos Posada Carriles, who allegedly detonated a bomb in a Cuban jetliner.",
        "The Bush administration has said they won't extradite him to Cuba, but it's Venezuela who actually wants him.",
        "Is this all clever spin, Mary Frances?",
        "Well, we talked recently on this show about Joanne Chesimard, who is in Cuba, and the United States demanding her back from Cuba.",
        "With Cuba, everything is exceptional.",
        "It's the usual hypocrisy.",
        "It's the Bush administration's inconsistencies in many ways.",
        "I think ultimately what'll happen to this guy is that he will be given asylum at some point.",
        "But Cuban politics, the Cuban-American community in Florida, the fact that the Republican Party relies on their votes, and the fact that Cuba is seen as the last little ragtag bastion of what used to be communism in this hemisphere makes all this very different.",
        "So the talk about terrorism in this case just turns out to be mostly talk.",
        "Well, Callie, you know, Mary Frances just mentioned the Cuban-American lobby, very strong, especially in Florida, but even that community doesn't seem too hot on this guy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that the Bush administration finds itself not only in a state of hypocrisy, but betwixt and between, because he really doesn't want to respond to Castro.",
        "I mean, that's what it comes down to.",
        "Castro is sitting in his space saying, `OK, you said this is what you wanted to do, and no you're harboring this guy, and you're harboring him under ridiculous circumstances; you knew he was here; you let him roam around.",
        "So I think that's a particular face-saving problem for him with regard to Cuba.",
        "And I think it's also a problem, the fact that he dropped his petition asking for US political asylum.",
        "So now it's really on the line.",
        "What are they going to do?",
        "Just from a political standpoint, I don't know how you get out of this unless you just do what it seems to me has to be done, which is let him go to Venezuela at this point, because if you harbor him, you're saying that everything that you have said in terms of your stance against terrorism in the rest of the world is just only when it relates to everybody except in this instance.",
        "And that's just not going to fly.",
        "But Callie mentioned--Farai, it's Mary Frances.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Callie mentioned Venezuela.",
        "See, that's another part of this problem here for the Bush administration.",
        "Hugo Chavez in Venezuela is almost as disliked as Castro, if you can put him in the same category.",
        "There is evidence that's been talked about of the United States attempting to make sure he didn't get re-elected, to overturn his government, to find some way to get him out because he bad-talks about the United States and makes all kinds of policies that we don't like.",
        "So to extradite him to Venezuela would be really tough for the administration to swallow.",
        "It seems to me that also we've talked on this show about a situation where the US government has allied itself with the government in Sudan, which of course is accused of genocide.",
        "And this is yet another case in which the US finds two different polity objectives--the war on terror and its idea of who is an ally and who is a foe in opposition.",
        "I cases like this, Mary Mitchell, what should journalists do in terms of explaining these kinds of complicated stories with different allegiances in the government's mind?"

        "Picture, if you will, waking up, you know, in the morning to finding a 15-foot-diameter swath of compressed dairy products thrown all over the backyard, fence, chairs, windows and sometimes the dog.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "When confronted, a big grin would come across his face and he would giggle and then proceed to plead his case and say, you don't understand; it was like 15 feet in the air and it spun and it was so cool.",

        "To give a sense of 12 men's lives to an arena full of mostly strangers takes a while, and the memorial lasted two and a half hours.",
        "But the gathered came away with a powerful and intimate understanding of just who and what had been lost on that terrible Wednesday evening at the fertilizer plant.",
        "In closing, I would like to say that Cyrus always hated the term hero.",
        "He and I shared the belief that heroes are persons who are etched in marble and that a hero is a sacred and solemn term reserved for only those who pay the ultimate price when others would falter or run.",

        "And when you got to the scene, you forgot fear and you fought that blaze as hard as you could, knowing the danger, buying time so others could escape.",
        "And then, about 20 minutes after the first alarm, the earth shook and the sky went dark - and West changed forever.",
        "Left unsaid, understandably, was the fact that the 12 men who lost their lives should not have come that close to a raging inferno in a plant packed with tens of thousands of pounds of ammonium nitrate.",
        "But only a captain from Dallas, a paid firefighter with 31 years of experience, truly understood what they were up against.",
        "Captain Kenneth Harris was visiting in West when he heard and rushed to help.",
        "Upon seeing the fertilizer plant ferociously ablaze, Harris jumped out of the pickup and ordered his friend to turn around and drive as fast and as far away as he could.",
        "In doing so, Harris likely saved his friend's life, but his instinct to help cost him his.",
        "Without the kind of training and experiential knowledge Captain Harris brought to the scene, the volunteer firefighters did what they knew how, they saw a big fire and in the last moments of their lives bravely, selflessly engaged it in battle.",
