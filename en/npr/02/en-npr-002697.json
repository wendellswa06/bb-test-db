        "I went online yesterday just to--every now and then, just to get the pulse of the country, if you will, I do the AOL poll.",
        "I just wanted to see what people were saying.",
        "And it was running well out ahead that women absolutely should not be banned from doing these things.",
        "If they want to participate, they should be able to.",
        "And in fact, they have proven themselves worthy to do so.",
        "This is Mary Mitchell...",
        "But I think America might be--this is Farai.",
        "America might be uncomfortable with the idea of women, especially mothers, dying in combat.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "This is Mary Mitchell.",
        "And I will have to just say that the word here is `ban.",
        "Whenever government says it's going to ban women from doing anything, it becomes a gender issue.",
        "I don't think it's that complicated.",
        "I really think that it's an issue of--look at the war that we are engaging in right now.",
        "A lot of these women went into the military thinking that they were going just to get a way to get an education.",
        "A lot of them are single parents; they've left their kids home with their mothers and, you know, their grandmothers, and they're dying in combat.",
        "And so what about the children?",
        "I think that you have to look at this realistically, and kind of get over the word `ban.",
        "What makes sense here?",
        "And it doesn't make sense for women to be on the front line, given the makeup of the military today.",
        "Well, I think--I disagree with that.",
        "It's Mary Frances.",
        "I think, first of all, women have been in combat in every war that the United States has fought, some surreptitiously and others that people knew about, going all the way back to the Revolution.",
        "The second thing is that there was a long struggle when women were permitted to be in the military service, to have women in all of the categories, because women were paid less, they were treated worse because they were told, `You don't go into combat; you don't even support combat.",
        "So therefore--and there were people who actually campaigned and struggled--women--in order to get equal treatment for women in the military.",
        "I also think that a man's life is just as valuable that a woman's life.",
        "I think that my cousin who is a woman, her life, and my cousin who is a man, both of who are in Iraq--I think that both their lives are valuable.",
        "I don't want to see him killed any more than I want to see her killed.",
        "If men can go into combat, if our sons and our daughters are equally valuable--fathers are as valuable to their children as mothers are to their children.",
        "So I think that the whole thing is just silly, and that women, as Callie said, ought to be able to do whatever they feel qualified to do, and that the debate is really about gender and tradition.",
        "And now we see the military saying, `It's ridiculous.",
        "And so I think we should move on.",
        "Mary, I'm going to interrupt.",
        "Can I just interrupt one second?",
        "Because I don't want to leave it out here that I think that a man's life is less valuable than a woman's life.",
        "That's not what I'm saying.",
        "I'm saying that in the military today, there are a lot of especially black women who are single parents, who went into the military not thinking they were going to engage in combat.",
        "And so a single mother who has no one else, there's no father around, who gets killed in Iraq, is leaving children who are unprotected, with no support--that's why I think that this is a problem, not that I think that a father's life is less valuable.",
        "Well, what about is a parent's life more valuable than someone who doesn't have kids?",
        "There are a lot of people who've been deployed who--sometimes there's a two-parent family that both are in the military and both are deployed, and the kids have to go live with relatives.",
        "Sometimes it's a single-parent family, male or female-headed.",
        "Should the military make any kind of exceptions for parents?",
        "Well--this is Callie--I think that in some instances, there have been some exceptions.",
        "For example, the same thing when there are two siblings, there's some leeway there about whether or not the next sibling should be able to go if one has been discharged already or sent already into combat.",
        "So I think that there's some flexibility there."

        "What a person may be curled up in as a baby.",
        "But I also think, if I just could answer--follow up with what Mary Mitchell said, I think that this war in particular, the Iraq War, has made clear that even if you entered into the services thinking that this is a great education or `I can have income,' you know now there is a huge possibility that you're going into combat.",
        "And I think that that's going to continue.",
        "So if for no other reason, then, that needs to be put on the table, and everybody can ascertain that and understand that that's a possibility, and so that we should not then end the policy-making part of it, determine where women shall land if they wish to go up the chain of command and into leadership.",
        "And...",
        "And that would be my thing.",
        "I think that the more women we have climbing up that military ladder up into leadership, then I believe that we could have maybe a different sensibility about how we approach getting into war in the first place.",
        "And, Farai, don't even get--Mary Frances--don't even get me started on, in this day and age, there shouldn't be anybody of any color who has to go into the service just to get an education or a job because the economy doesn't produce enough, there's no money to go to school, and that they are going into the service and have to do it just because we don't do enough out here or do what we ought to do.",
        "I mean, don't get me started about that.",
        "That maybe is a separate topic, but...",
        "Oh, it's a big one a lot of people have on their mind.",
        "Speaking of a separate topic, very quickly, I want to get to something in Maryland--a stay-at-home mom who describes herself as having strong traditional family values organized something called Citizens for a Responsible Curriculum.",
        "It's essentially against certain sex education curriculum in schools.",
        "There is a huge fight there--Montgomery County, a Washington suburb of Maryland.",
        "But across the country there are these fights over sex education.",
        "Should the federal government try to standardize sex education, as it's sort of argued, abstinence only, or should it be left up to individual towns and counties to kind of fight it out on their own, whether or not they teach this, given the fact that, you know, some kids in some schools are having sex in elementary school?"

        "Now I think that it's OK for them to do whatever they want to with their own children in their own families and teach them however they want to and follow whatever principles, but to impose ignorance on other people's children by making them not have any sex education at all in the schools or to be told about any of these things, I think, is unfortunate.",
