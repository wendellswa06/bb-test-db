        "But the main thing that the president has been talking about is arming some teachers.",
        "That's a proposal the NRA has backed, but it hasn't gone through the policy process, hasn't been vetted - there's no legislation in Congress, and the White House spokesman said the president won't necessarily propose any legislation.",
        "We already saw the good guy with a gun - that sheriff's deputy in Florida - not able or willing to stop the bad guy with a gun.",
        "So there's still a lot of questions about how arming some teachers would work and even what role the federal government would play since K-12 education is a state responsibility.",

        "And then, if nothing happens, will they become another source of energy for Democrats in the fall?",
        "Corporate America, on the other hand, doesn't take sides in political battles for any other reason other than their bottom line.",
        "So if corporate America does think the NRA has overstepped its hand and this kind of movement to sever ties with them continues, then I think something is really changing."
