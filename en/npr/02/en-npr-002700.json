        "So between having the stomach removed, or die of cancer, it was a pretty easy decision.",
        "Easy choice.",
        "Because you have a 70 percent chance of you have the gene of getting the disease.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, did it also help that many of your family members also had the gene, and also decided to take their stomachs out as well?"
