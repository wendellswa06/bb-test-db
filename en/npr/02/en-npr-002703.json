        "When English and French forces lined up against each other on St. Crispin's Day in 1415, that famous band of brothers was exhausted, hungry, sick with dysentery, and vastly outnumbered.",
        "And while the battle continues to echo through history, there remains a great deal of confusion about where it happened exactly, how the English pulled off their remarkable victory, even what day of the week it happened on.",
        "Juliet Barker's new book, Agincourt: King Henry V and the Battle That Made England, addresses many of these questions.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Certainly not.",
        "They'd been tramping through the French countryside for 18 days, and they were starving, and they were sick, and they'd been under continuous rainfall - so much that the armor would've rusted and they wouldn't have had the chance to clean it up and polish it up and make it look sparkling again.",
        "The main thing about the English army, though, is that there were only some 900 men-at-arms, the knights as we consider them, who were dressed from head to foot in plate armor.",
        "Over 5,000 men in the army - the rest of the army - were all archers, and that was what made the English army so unique, not only that they were employing archers who used the longbow - which was a weapon unique to England - but that there were so many of them and so few men-at-arms.",
        "On the other hand, the French army was almost entirely composed of men-at-arms, and they were in their polished armor because they'd been rested, they were well fed.",
        "They hadn't had to tramp through the countryside.",
        "So the odds seemed entirely in the French favor.",
        "The English were outnumbered by at least 4 to 1, and possible as many as 6 to 1."

        "He wasn't even there.",
        "Well, the problem with the French king was that he was mad.",
        "He thought he was made of glass, so he didn't dare sit down in case he broke.",
        "And that meant that for many years, people in the country had been fighting for power, and so there was this big split in the country between two factions, and everybody hated each other.",
        "And although they all hated the English, they probably hated each other more.",
        "So they were all striving to take control of the battle and to be in charge, and they all wanted - as was the chivalric code of honor - to be in the front line.",
        "And, of course, what they couldn't do was to decide who was going to lead them.",
        "So in the end, they took this very sort of fair, but really stupid decision that all the great princes of the army would be in the front lines, and all their men went to the back.",
        "So, of course, when the front lines were overwhelmed by the English, the rest of the army was left completely leaderless.",
        "The big thing about Henry V was that he was not just a seasoned warrior, but he was also a really charismatic man and he was able to inspire his troops.",
