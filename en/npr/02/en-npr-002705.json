        "Economist and former Medicare trustee Marilyn Moon says there's no cause for immediate alarm.",
        "We've gotten much closer to having insolvency in the trust fund, and we have always found a way to push that off.",
        "In the past, the solution has been raising premiums, or limiting some services, or charging richer people more.",
        "Leavitt is pushing President Bush's plan for healing Medicare: malpractice reform, electronic health records, higher payments for richer people.",
        "Moon says the cure for Medicare is more fundamental than that.",
        "It's not a problem that has anything to do with the fact that this is a public program.",
        "It has to do with the fact that health care in the United States is very expensive.",
        "Moon says until the nation finds a way to bring more money into the system and hold medical costs down, Medicare will have to limp on as it has been, relying on patches that keep it going another few years."

        "And all these men-at-arms were tripping in the mud, and it was really difficult for them with the weight of their armor to lift their feet.",
        "And what happened was that it was like a crowd effect, that the people from behind were pushing to get forward, and they gradually pushed over the front lines.",
        "And there were literally more people who suffocated and drowned in the mud because they couldn't get up again than were actually killed by the English archers.",
