        "But for the final month of the campaign, she's up against this...",
        "It's got problems, but it is governorable.",
        "And having seen it for so many years and from every angle as governor, as a lawyer, attorney general to the governor in the state agencies, as mayor, I've looked at it in a number of ways and I think I can pull it together.",
        "As you mentioned, youve been the governor before.",
        "Youre attorney general now.",
        "You were secretary of state, mayor of Oakland.",

        "And I believe I've got the skills and the knowledge and the knowhow to recreate that era, to restore the working together that characterized California at its very best.",
        "But why do think that you can do it?",
        "I mean, your predecessors, Governor Schwarzenegger and before him Gray Davis, neither of them could do it.",
        "Why do you think you could?",
        "Why do you think you'll be more successful?",
        "I believe the mounting frustration, the seriousness of the fiscal crisis will instill in the legislators a deeper desire and commitment to getting the job done.",

        "Weve had recessions before.",
        "Weve had very high unemployment before, and it comes back.",
        "The key is not to squander the revenue that the taxpayers give us and to pull together as both Republicans and Democrats to scale our spending to meet our revenue.",
        "Well, how specifically do you plan to do this?",
        "I mean just give us an example of something you...",
        "Ill give you an example.",
        "Right now the budget is presented by the governor in January.",
        "It's supposedly balanced.",
        "It then falls apart in a few months.",
        "The staff works on it.",
        "A few legislative committees pour over the numbers.",
        "In May, they have a few more meetings.",
        "And then they just go on, and it takes forever to get a budget.",
        "It's always unbalanced.",
        "It's always wrong and it's always late.",
        "And what I'm proposing is this December, if I'm elected, to meet with all 120 legislators to engage them in the process, dismiss their assistants while we really grapple with it, get each of the legislators to own the solution and the problem and yes, work with their staff, but also learn it for themselves with me as governor and we'll work it through.",
        "We'll keep the public informed.",
        "We'll bring in the lobbyists.",
        "We'll bring in the corporate shapers of Republican policy, the union leaders that the Democrats so often listen to.",
        "We'll get the dynamics of power in California focused on this challenge that will not be solved by blaming but by a collective decision to roll up our sleeves and do it in a transparent inclusionary way.",
        "That has never been done in the history of this state and that's what I'm proposing to do to get over this logjam."

        "His life is a testament to the appetite, particularly in California, or the willingness in a place like California to let people reinvent themselves as many times as they want.",
        "And California really is the place where you can do that.",

        "He would not do well anywhere else where he wasnt as forgiving and where he hadn't been a public figure for 35 years.",
        "People are just - theyve discounted all, almost all of the nuttiness.",
