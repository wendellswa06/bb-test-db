        "He should've gone back to Williamsport the following year, but he was thrown off the team for brandishing a bat at the coach.",
        "Oh, yeah.",

        "We should explain, your uncle's only just a few years older than you are.",
        "Yeah, he's four years older than me.",
        "And he was pitching in a Senior League.",
        "And I chose to watch him pitch opposed to going to practice.",
        "And then when I got to the park the next day, my coach told me I wasn't pitching.",

        "She was totally desperate, got together with other mothers who had the same problem and couldn't get in touch with their sons.",
        "And then finally, when her son reappeared, he confessed to her that he'd actually gone across the border into east Ukraine.",
        "He's also a conscript.",
        "He said he was forced to sign a document saying that he agreed to cross the border, but there wasn't even a date written in there with the terms of his assignment or the length of his assignment.",
        "And she went to the local recruitment office and said, why have you sent my son who's not legally even supposed to be sent anywhere outside of Russia across the border?",
        "And they said, you're making things up.",
        "There are no troops in east Ukraine.",
        "And that's the only answer to this day that she's had from them.",
        "So the implication here is that they want some sort of legal cover should it be discovered that some of these soldiers are actually going to Ukraine - that they were going there legally because they signed a contract.",
        "But why is this being kept so secret?",
        "Because an invasion of east Ukraine, if it were to mean a lot of casualties, would probably not be very popular with the Russian population.",
        "There was a recent survey that said that after economic problems, a third of Russians are really terrified of the possibility that their country could be dragged into a war.",
        "And it's clear that the government is worried about what the possible consequences of people finding out how many people are dying there could be."

        "The water naturally moves from the areas where there's low salt concentration to areas of high salt concentration.",

        "Reverse osmosis, then, is like fighting a law of nature, forcing water to go in the opposite direction, leaving the salt behind.",
