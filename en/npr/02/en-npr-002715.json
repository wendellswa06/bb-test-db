        "Spokesman Frank John gives a tour of one of the very few operating desalination facilities in California.",

        "The water comes from a brackish underground aquifer so it's far less salty than the ocean and far easier to process.",
        "John points to a bank of white metal tubes mounted on racks.",
        "Okay.",
        "So what you're looking at now are the two-stage reverse osmosis skids.",
        "Water is pushed through a succession of these skids or tubes, each of which is filling with a roll of paper-like membrane.",
        "We're forcing the salty water through that membrane to create fresh water.",
        "But that high-quality drinking water comes with its own problems: how to dispose of the by-product - a highly salty brine is one; another is cost.",
        "Aquifer water, like what's used in Newark, is relatively cheap to desalinate.",
        "But a year's worth of desalinated ocean water for one household can cost up to $3,000.",
        "Depending on where you live, that can be 10 times what water usually costs.",
        "And then, there's the hundreds of millions of dollars that would take to build a desal facility.",
        "Peter Gleick is president of the non-profit Pacific Institute in Oakland, which is studying the technology.",
        "I'm not yet convinced that desalination is an economical option for California given the fact that we're still using water pretty inefficiently.",
        "Conservation and efficiency improvements, smart transfers from agriculture to the cities, other kinds of more traditional solutions are still, I believe, better bets than desalination.",
        "While the San Francisco Bay Area Project is still in research stages, the commercial company Poseidon is moving ahead with two large-scale desalination proposals in Southern California, both depend on ocean water.",
        "One of them in Carlsbad could be up and running by 2010.",

        "But one difference Pena Nieto is talking about is that instead of going after cartel kingpin, like the outgoing president, Felipe Calderon, he says he's going to just stop the murders, the extortion, the associated violence with the drug trade instead of an all-out military offensive.",
        "And some people really like that.",

        "He said he wants to reorganize the federal police force into just one agency and put that under the interior ministry.",
