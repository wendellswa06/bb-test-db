        "Well, you don't have a short fuse where you can't control it and still play 18 years - well, actually 20 years and counting.",
        "So I mean, yeah, I might, you know, have a lot of fire burning in me, but I do it with control.",
        "This season or more likely next season, you break 500 homeruns?",
        "Right.",
        "You know, it's a lot of homeruns, so I also have opportunities to drive in 2,000 runs, you know, get 3,000 hits and I think only three players in the history of the game has done that.",
        "So I'm looking forward to it.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's talk, though, about what is clearly going to be the biggest milestone that anyone in Major League Baseball reaches this year.",

        "Barry Bonds, super-controversial figure right now in Major League Baseball.",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "I mean, but the fact to the matter is, you know, God willing, he's going to break the record and, you know, I hope he'll do it.",
        "You trained with Bonds for a while.",
        "And one of the questions about Bonds is, it's not God willing that he's playing at this time, it's thanks to a lot of drugs that he is able to play at this time.",
        "People are saying if that were the case, should Major League Baseball honor a record that's attained by using a lot of performance-enhancing drugs, if that were true.",
        "Well, the thing is that you can't - if you're going to investigate Bonds, investigate the people that own the record.",
        "You know, what was in baseball back then is the same thing that's in baseball today.",
        "And it's just that now people want to expose them when their hero's records are going down.",
        "So...",
        "But the hero's record that's going down is Hank Aaron, who was your hero growing up.",
        "Right.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "Yeah, I mean, but the thing is, that I'm not educated on medicines and what-have-you.",

        "But I read your chapter.",
        "I read your book, and I read the chapter about training with Bonds and Bonds's trainer, Anderson, who got the cream.",
        "But in the book that the reporters from San Francisco wrote, \"\"Game Of Shadows,\"\" they say that you paid $10,000 for the stuff you were getting from Anderson.",
        "That could've been Neosporin.",
        "If you're being charged that kind of money, it's not over-the-counter salves that you're buying.",

        "If you had the greatest season at bat for batting average that we could imagine, you did .400, and that would mean you'd make outs 60 percent of the time.",
        "There'd be more failures than success when you play the game.",
        "Right.",
        "You have to be prepared to go up to the plate, knowing it is statistically more likely than not that you make out when you go up to the plate, even being a great player.",
        "Well, despite knowing that you are going to fail, you got to go out there with the attitude thinking you're going to succeed.",
        "Because if you go up there with attitude that you're going to fail, you're going to fail.",
        "So it's one of those ironic things that you know you have 10 at-bats to do it in.",
        "So you know you got 10 at-bats to get you three hits.",
        "So you know, when you go 0-1, 0-2, you're not all that worried.",
        "But if you're 0-10, that's when the you start looking at things a little different.",
        "So...",
        "What you just said, what is that like?",
        "What happens mentally when you go over 0-10 and you are now in a slump, we'd say."

        "Right.",
        "And so by thinking like that, you wind up going 0-15.",
        "But as an older player, I've come to realize you have to have a short memory.",
        "You know, if you had a bad game, that don't mean you are going to have a bad game the next day.",
        "You can go out and have a bad game today, and go out and hit two homeruns with four hits.",
        "And that'll erase that bad game.",
