        "And I think the financial crisis that hit early September completely changes the dynamic of the election, and the McCain campaign attacks really weren't about economic situation facing the country, and that's what the voters really want to hear about.",
        "John McCain has accepted public financing, and so that means that a lot of the money for these ads comes from the RNC.",

        "And what kind of power does he have on where those ads go and if they're going to go towards him or further down the ticketing in congressional races?",
        "Well, because John McCain accepted public financing, he's limited to $84 million, and the Obama campaign is going to be able to raise many times more money for that.",
        "That's money that the Obama campaign itself controls.",

        "Unfortunately for McCain, he doesn't control the message from the RNC.",
        "And so he does not get to say that they want to maybe push the tax message, and so they've kind of lost control over the message of the campaign as it's run through the RNC or through independent groups.",
        "The really difficult trade off, I think, for the Republicans coming into the home stretch of the election is going to be where they want to spend their resources in the last two weeks.",
        "And that is because, if they judge the McCain campaign can't win the presidency, then they will probably want to divert their resources to the Senate, and the Senate elections are starting to break into the Democratic direction and getting very close to a Democratic pick up of nine seats, which would give them 60 votes in the Senate and allow them to close debate whenever they like.",
