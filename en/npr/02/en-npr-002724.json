        "Good to be here, Neal.",
        "And what do we know about these men?",
        "Well, these are some of the high-valued detainees, some of whom were transferred to Guantanamo Bay in September of 2006.",
        "So these are not your garden-variety folks who are being held, nor the folks who have already been investigated for potential commissions.",
        "These are the high-profile, you know, top notch, the folks that the U.S.",
        "government most wants to punish through these commissions.",
        "And is Khalid Sheikh Mohammad the only one who's the government has acknowledged has been waterboarded?",
        "I think that that's right, although there is one other person who it seems pretty clear according to what defense council have said, was also subjected to coercive interrogation techniques that certainly could constitute torture under some standard.",
        "So, it's probably more than just his case that will bring up that issue of coerced testimony and the admissibility of that kind of evidence.",
        "And all of them have been held either in secret prisons or in Guantanamo Bay for many years, sometimes without access to attorneys.",
        "If these were a civilian proceeding, this would be thrown out of court right away, wouldn't it?",
        "It's - this is so different from a civilian proceeding.",
        "We really have no parallels for it.",
        "And as you enter this show today, I thought one of the questions about how this will go and what sort of evidence will be admitted, we really can't answer that very well.",
        "Really, nobody can answer that.",
        "We've never had one of these commissions.",
        "We have this one, the Hicks' case, where we had a guilty plea, which had as much to do with politics, has which - more to do with politics than any kind of criminal procedure."

        "So this is a new set of criminal procedures that we're going forward that we really don't have any parallels for.",
        "We just heard the general mentioned Susan Crawford, the convening authority.",
        "Who is she and what is her authority?",
        "Right.",
        "She - that term, convening authority, comes from the court marshal system which the government specifically decided not to use here.",
        "So she's the person in charge of deciding whether or not prosecution should go forward.",
        "And that's why General Hartmann, this morning, kept saying that now, it's up to Judge Crawford to decide what to do next.",
        "She was, for 15 years, a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which is the highest court - pardon me - in the military court marshal system in the United States.",
        "So she's an experienced military judge, experienced with appellate review.",
        "She also will have the responsibility to review the proceedings after the fact.",
        "After - if there is a conviction, she'll review the sentence and make a decision on that before any other appellate review goes forward.",
        "And does she appoint - who assigns the judges, the attorneys, that sort of thing?",
        "Well, she does assign - she is in charge of deciding whether or not charges go forward.",
        "And the rules are promulgated by the secretary of defense.",
        "And the folks who are on the actual - who are the equivalent of a jury, who will make the decision about whether or not these - the accused are guilty or innocent and what their sentence will be, they will be chosen the same way that court marshal panel numbers are chosen, which is not in a - by any kind of random selection but by virtue of their age, experience, judicial temperament.",
        "They will be military officers according to the Military Commissions Act.",
        "So she is a part of identifying the persons who are eligible to serve as the triers of fact.",
        "And triers of fact, that's sort of a combination of judge and jury.",
        "Right, although there are military judges as well.",
        "And we've had many rulings, actually, for military judges, including some questioning whether or not those subjected to the initial stages of hearings and investigation and prosecution under these commissions, whether or not those folks are actually correctly charged and subject to these commissions.",
        "And that has to do with the continuing issue in these cases of the jurisdiction of the commission, and that unlawful enemy combatant designation, have the persons to be charged been determined to be unlawful enemy combatants in a way that comports with international law.",
        "And many suggests not because of the deficiencies of the combatant status review tribunals, the hearings that were held to make that determination."

        "And then, there's the question of do the defendants have a chance to pick their own lawyers?",
        "Do they have a chance to be in the courtroom to confront their accusers?",
        "Right.",
        "As General Hartmann pointed out today, he said in no - uncertain terms that they would - that the defendants would have a chance to confront witnesses against them, that they would be able to see the evidence, that it would be an open proceeding in terms of the defendants themselves being able to see everything.",
        "We have not seen that openness in the pre-trial process, so I think defense council would be justifiably suspicious about whether or not that would happen as the trial part of this moves ahead.",
        "And we've Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, in fact, some of the apes in her confession were released to day.",
        "But, also, he's confessed to being the mastermind.",
        "But, again, any defense lawyer would say, come on, this was coerced, this man was tortured.",
        "That's right.",
        "The admissibility of those kinds of confessions or statements or, you know, claims, perhaps hyperbolic of responsibility, those are going to be critical in this.",
        "You know, the primary charge here, really, is conspiracy and solicitation to commit all these horrible crimes.",
        "They aren't alleged that - that question of whether conspiracy, really, is a war crime is another part of what the defense lawyers would challenge; not only the admissibility of that evidence, but whether or not conspiracy can actually be tried before a military commission.",
        "Now, let's get some callers in on the conversation.",
        "Again, our guest is Beth Hillman, a visiting professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, it's tough to know the sources of information from the charge sheet that we have, so I don't know that we can answer that very completely.",
        "But there is in the charge sheet many, many pages of information that is gleaned from - clearly gleaned from informants.",
        "So, the testimony of the persons who have been interrogated at Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere since the time of their capture, there is actually reference in the charge sheet to information from as early as 1996, which is before we had any sense of a military commission that would prosecute these sorts of offenses, and certainly before we had any rules.",
        "One of the problems here is we didn't have any rules until we had persons to charge.",
        "And we didn't have any crimes until we had the Military Commissions Act here, which articulates 28 different crimes.",
        "And conspiracy is the very last one of those to be articulated.",
        "So it's the - just as the crimes are a little uncertain, the evidence itself and what will come before the court here is not entirely clear either.",
        "Hmm.",

        "Thanks.",

        "Your impression of this as a kangaroo court is one shared by many.",
        "It's being fought by the military officers who are part of this.",
        "For instance, General Hartmann, who is an experience judge advocate who has been appointed to be legal adviser to Susan Crawford, the convening authority, he's been very clear that this will follow the rules that have been established and that there is no determination yet that these defendants do have the same presumption of innocence until proven guilty and that the burden of proof is beyond reasonable doubt.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF A ROADWAY)",
        "That said, there has been a lot of criticism of the tribunals even from those who have been involved in the prosecution, most notably, Colonel Morris Davis, who was an Air Force judge advocate who was the chief prosecutor in the Office of Military Commissions.",
        "After his resignation, he complained of the politicization of the process, and he specifically was concerned that the convening authority and the prosecutor's office were too intermingled, that there wasn't a distinction between the decision to be made by prosecutors and the convening authority's rule in the process.",
        "He thought it was too secret.",
        "He thought that the command structure made the office of the chief prosecutor no longer independent.",
        "He really thought that civilian officials were driving the process rather than the military officer who he thought should have control and direction of this.",
        "Thanks for the call, Donnie, and get your exercise in another way next time, okay?",
        "I will do that.",
        "Thank you.",
