        "But in the event after many - there are trials and convictions and appeals and upheld and all of that, what kind of death penalty would be inflicted?",
        "I think this is a very relevant question, given the fact that the last time that we had anything sort of similar to this was in World War II, when President Roosevelt definitely wanted the Nazi saboteurs who had been captured in the United States to be executed.",
        "And that's the reason he established a military commission so that he could execute them rather than subject them to a federal criminal trial, where death wouldn't be an option.",
        "So, the fact that death is on the table here has a lot to do with why we're having a military commission at all.",

        "If they're found not guilty, or if the charges are thrown out for any reason, does that mean they get out?",

        "I believe he's right.",

        "We don't know how it's going to work out.",
