        "And when you heat up - heat is energy, and so if there's more heat, there's more energy for storms to feed off of.",
        "And so the world's oceans already on average have warmed up for well over a degree over the past century.",
        "And in addition, the Gulf of Mexico has been crazy the last few weeks.",
        "I mean it's been two or three degrees more - warmer than normal.",
        "So you add it altogether; it's been four degrees warmer than normal in the Gulf.",
        "And that's a lot of energy.",
        "And the other effect of heat - it causes ocean water to evaporate and rise up.",
        "So with every extra degree in ocean temperature you add, that produces a heck of a lot of water vapor.",
        "I guess once that moisture goes up in a storm like this, it has to come back down.",
        "Is that why we're seeing all the rain all over Texas?",
        "Right.",
        "In fact, you know, you can see from the satellite parts of the storm system were observed to be extending out from the main body back kind of like a tentacle - back over the Gulf and reaching back and picking up more heat and more water vapor and then sucking it back onto land."
