        "And why is it called that?",
        "Sure.",
        "So blue carbon sinks really refer to three main ecosystems - seagrass being one of them, of course, then, also, salt marshes and mangrove forests.",
        "These ecosystems are powerhouses when it comes to removing carbon out of the atmosphere but, even more importantly, storing it in the soil beneath them.",
        "So these coastal blue carbon ecosystems can sequester or remove carbon from the atmosphere about four times the rate of terrestrial forests on land.",
        "And they store about 10 times more carbon in the system itself.",
        "How does it work?",
        "How does it do what it does?",
        "So seagrasses are just flowering grasses that live underwater.",
        "So, like all plants, they remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert that into the actual plant matter itself so the leaves, the flowers, the roots.",
        "And so, then, when those seagrasses die, all of that gets buried underneath.",
        "And because of their root system, which is very intricate, it kind of locks it down and holds it in there.",
        "But the unique thing about a blue carbon ecosystem is that saltwater really inhibits bacterial breakdown of that material.",
        "So, basically, once the plants die, they're preserved within the soil.",
        "And, again, in this study, particularly, these are seagrasses next to the Great Barrier Reef.",
        "And having the seagrasses that absorb that CO2 are actually protecting the reefs against ocean acidification degradation."
