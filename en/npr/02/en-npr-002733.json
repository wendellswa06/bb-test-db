        "Unfortunately, what's happened there is another battlefront in the global war that the radical Islamist terrorists, in this case Hezbollah, have declared against the rest of the world, and the victory there leads to victories everywhere.",
        "What has happened there now, the great tragedy, is the terrible suffering by innocents in Lebanon and Israel, and that's why hopefully there can be an agreement to have that cease-fire policed by an international peacekeeping force.",
        "But short of that, a cease-fire just for the sake of a cease-fire doesn't do anything.",
        "It keeps the terrorists there.",
