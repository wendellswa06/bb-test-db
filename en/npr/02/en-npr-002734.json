        "Hi.",
        "I was just calling - I'm a big supporter of Senator Lieberman.",
        "Thanks, Brendan.",
        "On his national radio program, Rush Limbaugh was his defiant self, speaking directly to other talk show hosts.",
        "I'd like to say that I support him largely because I see that we have a senior Senator in Washington who really understands foreign policy, and I think there's some issues that I agree with Ned Lamont, but that I don't think that he has the depth of knowledge and information on how to deal with our foreign policy, which is so complicated these days.",
        "Brendan, I'm sure Senator Lieberman will have a stinging response.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Thanks, Brendan.",
        "I don't know Brendan, but I thank you - at least not by voice or name.",
        "I thank you very much for that.",
        "Look, part of what's on the line here and the choice of Connecticut Democrats have next Tuesday is really a choice between somebody who comes and wants to be a Senator based on last having served on his local town board and someone who has 18 years of experience and seniority, for instance has traveled to a lot of countries in the world.",
        "I've been to just about every country in the Middle East except Iran, and I'm very committed to not only protecting American security and values there but trying to help achieve a peace that is more than temporary.",
        "So I hope that's something that others besides Brendan will consider as they decide.",
        "Because elections are always about the future, and I know people are angry about some things that have happened in the past on Iraq, but ultimately the future is about more than one issue.",
        "And on those issues, I believe my record of results says that I can do a lot better job than my opponent.",
        "Brendan, thanks for the call.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "We're talking with Senator Joe Lieberman today on the Political Junkie segment on TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."

        "Senator, there was some criticism of your campaign earlier that you didn't get it, that you didn't realize the depth and the anger behind the Lamont challenge.",
        "A recent poll I saw showed 17 percent of the Democrats remain undecided in this.",
        "What do you do in the next week to get that undecided in your column?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, for better or worse, I will tell you that I knew from the beginning that this would be a close race.",
        "I mean, to be really as open as I can be about it, we did some early polling, just sort of doing kind of scenarios in a campaign, and what an opponent might say, and back and forth, and it became a very close race, which it obviously is now.",
        "In the next few days, I'm riding a bus, which we call Joe's Tomorrow Tour around Connecticut, and what it aims to do is to focus the public on the choice here, and not just to express their anger at George Bush through me, but to come out and vote for which candidate can do the better job for them on the health care and the jobs and the environment and education and all the other concerns that they have, and to argue that based on my record of delivering for the state, fighting for the state, that I'm the one.",
        "The other thing, obviously, is to encourage a large turnout, because it's been clear to us…",
        "And turnout will be an important issue.",
        "Senator Lieberman, I wanted to thank you so much for taking time out to join us today.",
        "Thank you very much for being with us.",
        "Not at all.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "And we have another caller from Connecticut, a bit of a surprise.",
        "First on, first off, and now with us is Ned Lamont, Senator Lieberman's challenger, who's calling us from his campaign trail, and Mr. Lamont, very good of you to be with us.",
        "Neal, delighted to be here.",
        "And why do you think this election is close?",
        "I think it's close because everybody tells me it's close."

        "It looks like it's a dead heat, and as I just heard the Senator mention, and I agree with him, turnout is important, and like he, I want as many people to turn out as possible.",
        "I think for once the little old state of Connecticut can make a big decision, and their vote will really count.",
        "What type of a country do we want?",
        "Do we want to stay the course in Iraq or do we want to change course?",
        "And do we want to start investing in this country again?",
        "And that's what Connecticut's going to be deciding on August 8.",
        "Let me ask you about that question of experience that Senator Lieberman just talked about.",
        "Your previous job in politics, Greenwich selectman.",
        "Well it's a real question, whether you think Washington ought to be reserved for those who have been career politicians.",
        "I clearly haven't been that.",
        "As you point out, I was very active in local government, but I'm really running as a guy that started up a business from scratch, and I think maybe that experience is pretty good in the halls of the U.S.",
        "Senate - somebody who hasn't been on the public payroll but has met a payroll.",
        "And I think that will give me a little bit of credibility as I go down to Washington and try and work on health care and other issues - that maybe we can bring together labor and management and make some progress.",
        "Is this election just about sending a message to the Democratic establishment about Iraq?",
        "It's about changing the direction of this country.",
        "It's 63 lobbyists for every single Congressmen.",
        "It's a fact that we've got 47 million people uninsured with no health insurance, a situation that's getting worse.",
        "You know, I can tell you as a small businessman, it's the high cost of health care that's hurting entrepreneurship in our country right now.",

        "You know, it's about investing in clean energy and dealing with our environment in a serious way -not the Dick Cheney energy bill.",

        "Mr.",
        "Lamont, it's Ken Rudin here.",
        "I've heard from many voters who say that they like Joe Lieberman, and they've supported him all his career, but they think he's making a mistake by - should he lose Tuesday's primary to run as an Independent in November.",

        "I do come across that reaction, and like many of the people you talked to, I've known the Senator for many years and like him as well.",
        "But there's a sense that if you want to run as a Democrat, run as a Democrat and play by the rules.",
        "Or if you want to run as an Independent, do that, but don't try and have it both ways, running as a Democrat in the primary and if it doesn't work out, he's going to, you know, bolt the party and run as an Independent.",
        "Have you heard some discussions about lack of funding from Washington should you win the primary, that the DSCC sits out the November race because they figure that either you or Lieberman will win?",
        "I've got to tell you, I'm not that close with the DSCC, so I can't tell you exactly what their machinations are.",
