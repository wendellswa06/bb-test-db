        "And I'm Audie Cornish.",
        "Ukraine's new government was installed today, but it was completely overshadowed by events in the majority Russian Crimea.",
        "Armed men took over two government buildings in the Crimean capital and hoisted a Russian flag over the parliament.",
        "Meanwhile, the fugitive former president, Viktor Yanukovych, appeared to resurface in Russia, releasing a written statement declaring himself to be the legitimate leader of Ukraine.",
        "NPR's Peter Kenyon is following events from Kiev and joins us now.",
        "And Peter, first, what can you tell us about the seizure of the Crimean parliament.",
        "Well, before dawn, armed men arrived at the parliament building.",
        "There had been some testy demonstrating there the day before and they've barricaded themselves in.",
        "There was no official claim of responsibility, but certainly the pro-Russian Crimeans who gathered outside to cheer them on believe it's the work of a separatist movement wanting what they call unity with Russia.",
        "The view in majority Russian Crimea is that armed factions in Kiev had toppled President Viktor Yanukovych and so they argue that they're entitled to do something similar in Crimea.",
        "Now, later in the day, the regional parliament announced its intention to place a referendum on the ballot May 25, that's when they vote on presidential elections around Ukraine, asking Crimeans in specific, whether they want to significantly expand the peninsula's autonomy by declaring state sovereignty.",
        "Now, I can't tell you exactly what that means or even if this referendum will be added to the ballot, but it gives you a sense of how strong the pro-Russian feelings are there.",
        "And Moscow, meanwhile, has reportedly granted Viktor Yanukovych's request for protection and, of course, now with this statement, he appears to be weighing in on the situation.",
        "Tell us more about what he had to say.",
        "Well, first, the short answer, there's been no confirmed sighting of Yanukovych yet in Russia or elsewhere.",
        "This written statement purported to be from him was sent to major Russian news outlets and it declares that Yanukovych says he's still president and he appeared to refer to the parliament takeover, saying now we can see that southeastern Ukraine and Crimea aren't going to tolerate this lawlessness.",
        "And then later, the Russian RIA Novosti Agency reported that Yanukovych is going to hold a news conference tomorrow in a place called Rostov-on-Don.",
        "That's a southern Russian town quite close to the Ukrainian border.",
        "So presumably sometime tomorrow we'll have confirmation of where Yanukovych is and perhaps his intentions.",
        "Peter, what are people there saying about how volatile the situation is in as far as potential Russian intervention?",
        "So health care - I mean, it's a big topic in these midterms.",
        "And, you know, I've been out talking to voters.",
        "It's an issue that people really worry about.",

        "So tell me more about what's amazing.",

        "Or what do we think it's contributing?",
        "Probably on average.",
        "And I haven't done the calculations for this particular patch and its size.",
        "But, you know, we think that there's probably about several billion tons of carbon locked away in the seagrass meadows all over the world.",
        "And the unique thing about these ecosystems, as well, that I really want to mention is not only are they fantastic for removing carbon from the atmosphere, which makes them important for all climate change mitigation policy, but when you destroy those ecosystems, all that carbon can be rereleased back into the atmosphere.",
        "That was going to be - my question is that - are these deep seagrasses endangered?",
        "Is this something that we should be concerned about?",
        "So, again, we don't know that much about deep seagrasses.",
        "But, in general, looking globally, seagrasses are being lost at about 2 percent per year, which is very significant.",
        "But most of that loss is really coming from poor water quality.",
        "What happens when you have pollutants and too much sediment running down the river, it blocks out the light.",
        "It buries the seagrass, and they start to die.",
        "The solution to that is really going to be land-based.",
        "You're going to have to address the pollution component first.",
        "And, finally, do scientists suggest that we should be cultivating seagrass?",
        "Is that even a thing?",
        "Can that be done?",
        "It can be done.",
        "I think, though, that one thing to keep in mind is that seagrasses are very prolific.",
        "And so, if they're not currently being seen there, there's a reason why.",
        "So if you just go and plant in these areas, it's probably not going to do very well.",

        "Could they say they want a different kind of politics and we might see voters, you know, voting on that mission?",
        "I'm not sure that they're going to actually be voting on civility in public life.",
        "I think most voters kind of, in a lot of ways, reflect the politicians, too, and are much more polarized.",
        "And especially in a midterm election, those activist, you know, hard-charging feelings are the things that usually motivate people out to the polls.",
        "And to be honest, we haven't really seen a big change in, you know, kind of the fundamental way of how people feel, you know, since President Trump, essentially, was sworn in.",
        "You know, whether it's a change election or not, it's certainly shaping up to look that way in the House, where all 435 congressional seats are up.",
        "That really hasn't changed.",
        "In the Senate, it's a little bit different because only about a third of seats are up and where those races are being run.",

        "One thing stands out pretty starkly.",
        "Voters really are drawing a direct line between political hostility and divisiveness and some of the violence we've been seeing, right?",
        "Yeah, 4 in 5 voters are concerned that the negative tone and lack of civility in Washington will lead to acts of terror or violence.",
        "That's pretty striking.",
        "And like you said, that does go across party lines.",
        "But here's the rub.",
        "They don't agree on who's to blame for that tone.",
        "You know, about 4 in 10 say it's President Trump.",
        "About a fifth, by the way, David, say that it's how the media reports on the news.",
        "You know, a similar percentage blame President Trump's rhetoric and demeanor for those improvised explosive devices that we saw mailed to high-profile Democrats and critics of the president.",
        "But that's pretty largely reflective of the strongly negative feelings we've seen toward this president since he was sworn in.",
        "Consistently, in poll after poll, about 40 percent of people say they strongly disapprove of the job he's doing."
