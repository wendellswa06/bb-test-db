        "And John, the president has been going on the offensive recently, defending his NSA wire-tapping plan.",
        "What did he say about that last night?",
        "Well, he essentially said what he said before, which is this is legal and this is necessary in the war on terror.",

        "And you can see from the democratic response that they're sort of staying a little bit away from this.",
        "The political tide here seems to be favoring the president if you look at polls.",
        "And the White House certainly has looked at them and knows that if he frames this wire-tapping program as a way to catch terrorists that it works for the president.",
        "And that's the context in which he put it last night.",
        "And on a lighter note, one of the parlor games that journalists engage in every year with these speeches is to count the number of interruptions for applause.",
        "And you've written that all those interruptions for applause is what turns these speeches into long and boring affairs.",
        "Last night, there were 58 interruptions for applause, the fewest of President Bush's tenure.",
        "Did it help?",
        "Well, it was less, but that's still an awful lot.",
        "And this is partially our fault because the press still counts the applause and so lawmakers are forced to go through this charade because they know the next day the coverage will mention that number.",
        "And last night we got the traditional applause from the president's supporters at almost everything he said, and we also got this other, sort of, unserious response from the democrats who stood up and applauded when the president said his social security reform plan didn't get passed.",
        "So there may have been fewer applause, but they were still applied in the sort of unserious and silly way.",
