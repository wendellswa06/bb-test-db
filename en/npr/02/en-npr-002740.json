        "One other thing that jumped out at me this week that I thought was interesting from the White House review, your former colleague, John Brennan, who's now the president's top counterterrorism advisor, he was asked what surprised him most as he's gone through and tried to sort through the attempted attack on Christmas Day.",
        "And he said what surprised him most was the al-Qaida branch based out of Yemen, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, how lethal they've become, that U.S.",
        "intelligence knew they had aspirations of attacking the U.S.",
        "mainland, didn't know they were at the point of actually doing it.",
        "Did you find that surprising as well?",
        "Well, let me try to rephrase what I think John Brennan was saying, and that was, number one, the strategic picture was there, that what we now know as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula is a group definitely worth worrying about, one that is concerned not only with events in Yemen and Saudi Arabia but does also share the transnational aspirations of al-Qaida Central, which makes it a danger to the United States.",
        "But when you get to the point of a specific operation - in this case unleashing a Nigerian to do something against the United States - then you have moved from strategy to tactics.",
        "Strategically, I think we've had a pretty good sense of things, and overall that's what John Brennan was saying this week.",
        "When you get to the tactical operations, trying to get those fragments of information that are actionable and would allow us to roll up a particular plot, that is far more difficult.",
        "Is that a fixable challenge?",
        "One can find ways to deal with that ultimately intractable problem through information technology, through analytic training - all the things we've been trying to do for years - but ultimately it is not something that can be fixed.",
        "Ultimately it is an inherent challenge that will face counterterrorist officials today and tomorrow and next year and beyond.",
        "And it is because of that inherent intractable challenge, we will, despite all our efforts to fix things, still have incidents like the one we had Christmas Day.",

        "This is a huge challenge for law enforcement officials, who have devised an unprecedented and elaborate security plan to protect the new president and the huge crowds.",
        "NPR's Brian Naylor reports.",
        "While President-elect Obama has been thinking about what to say Tuesday and happy Democrats are figuring out what to wear that night, the Secret Service has been planning too.",
        "Actually, their preparations started long ago as the service began working with 57 other agencies to make sure the new president and those who hope to catch a glimpse of him Tuesday are safe.",
        "Special agent Ed Donovan is a spokesman for the service.",
        "The Secret Service certainly recognizes the historical significance of this inauguration.",
        "It's been widely reported that the crowds are expected to be larger than average.",
        "So that's something that we're certainly considering.",
        "And the plan that we come up with is going to have to be elastic."
