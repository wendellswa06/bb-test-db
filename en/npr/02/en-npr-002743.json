        "She also had the students to take the test after listening to 10 minutes of silence, and 10 minutes of a relaxing voice.",
        "And the results of this experiment, says Rauscher, seemed pretty clear.",
        "And what we found was that the students who had listened to the Mozart Sonata scored significantly higher on the spatial temporal task.",
        "Now Rauscher emphasizes that the test measured only a certain kind of spatial intelligence, and that's all.",
        "It's very important to note that we did not find effects for general intelligence, just for this one aspect of intelligence.",
        "It's a small gain, and it doesn't last very long."

        "For instance, she got misquoted by a TV program which made her seem like she was saying rock music wasn't cognitively good.",
        "When that happened, I started getting phone calls, literally death threats, from people that were so offended that I would say that rock music was bad for the brain.",
        "So I had to get an unlisted number.",
