        "And I think the thinking seems to be that if you're an unmarried mother, you're so busy raising your children, working and all of that, that the last thing you have time to do is to go and go to the ballot - to go to the booth to vote.",
        "So I think the campaign is rather clever, and it does get your attention because you don't know where these people are going.",
        "Particularly, you've got Desperate Housewives involved and all of that.",
        "But I think it's good, because they're raising issues that - some of the main issues that women should care about are healthcare, education, opportunities for jobs, equal pay, social security.",
        "We should all be considering that.",
        "But if there is 20 million women out there who aren't voting, then this is a good campaign.",
