        "Hi, Renee.",
        "Hi, Steve.",
        "And who do we start with?",
        "We're starting today with the strongest challenger to President Hamid Karzai.",
        "His name is Abdullah Abdullah, and some Americans might remember him as the very visible foreign minister of Afghanistan after 2001.",
        "And Steve, to give some perspective: just as American candidates are often defined by their biographies - think John McCain's years in a North Vietnamese prison or Barack Obama born to a mother from Kansas and a father from Kenya - so too at the heart of Abdullah Abdullah's biography is one famous relationship here.",
        "As a young doctor in the 1980s, Abdullah became the closest friend and advisor to a legendary leader of the Mujahideen.",
        "That man, Ahmad Shah Massoud, fought the Soviets and then the Taliban until he was assassinated by al-Qaida two days before September 11th.",
        "He was a great human being, the most peaceful person being caught in the war.",
        "Yes, and given no choice but to fight.",
        "Now Abdullah Abdullah has chosen to run on that association, with many campaign posters showing Massoud gazing down on the candidate.",
        "(Soundbite of traffic)",
        "On this day those posters are plastered on the walls and storefronts of the bustling village of Charikar in a province neighboring Kabul.",
        "It's Massoud country - a place where thousands of frantic supporters poured into a small stadium and in the blistering midday sun cheered on the candidate who once touched their greatest hero.",

        "Women in burqas press together clutch children.",
        "Men in turbans crowd up to the very rim of the stadium.",

        "What's changed?",
        "I think that was a very superficial reading of the situation.",
        "The reason for that sort of a judgment was that President Karzai was very vigorous in making alliances with different political leaders.",
        "But what he had not calculated, that was the feeling of the people, the sense of the people, which was for change.",
        "So the leaders did join President Karzai and did support President Karzai, but the people didn't.",
        "Because the Indian food is not cheap.",
        "First of all, it is really because there's a lots of intricate cooking in this, and the cost behind the whole presentation of the buffet is great.",
        "Gill's wearing a dress shirt and slacks, but the way his red turban is coiled tight identifies him as a Sikh.",
        "Gill explains that Sikhs and buffets go way back.",
        "In our temples, if you go there, there is a buffet, which is actually called langar in our language, and anybody can eat whatever they want to eat as cooked over there.",

        "Today's langar is feeding more than a thousand people.",
        "This is 10 times or one hundred times dimension of what goes in a restaurant.",
        "That's Gurbaksh Kaur.",
        "She's slipping 10, 20 chapattis at a time.",
        "It's good karma to take food.",
        "In the early 1500s, when the first Sikh gurus created the langar, it was a time of class struggle and a communal meal was a revolutionary concept.",
        "The priest here, Wadhawa Singh Gill, says for Sikhs the langar killed the caste system.",
        "In India, they discriminate between rich and the poor.",
        "We do not discriminate between human beings, and we are requiring to sit at one place at one level.",
        "All are one.",
        "Now the air hangs with the aromas of cardamom, cumin and sautéed onions.",

        "What's in it is actually chickpeas flour-fried.",
        "And then it also has some of the same herbs and so forth in there.",
        "It's actually part of the main course.",
        "I'm in the line with mostly Sikhs today, but it's true that at any langar in any Sikh temple anywhere in the world is open to all, rich or poor, any race or creed or color, and free of charge.",
        "After all, the langar is what Sikhs like to call society's great leveler."

        "In fact, the share of the nation's housing wealth - the whole housing pie held by people under 45 - has fallen from 24 percent in 2006 to only 14 percent today.",
        "And that has consequences.",
        "Americans who were born in the 1980s really are at a substantial risk of accumulating less wealth over their lifespans than previous generations because housing is the way a lot of people save.",

        "Wow.",
        "So what about people's ability to just get a loan?",
        "The crash was blamed, in part, on lending terms that were way too lax, right?",

        "They did.",

        "But it's not yet at the kind of worrisome levels.",
        "And then the other thing that's interesting is that Americans as a group have a lot more equity in their home than they did five years ago, but people aren't using their houses as ATMs with home equity loans and stuff as they did in the bad old days.",
