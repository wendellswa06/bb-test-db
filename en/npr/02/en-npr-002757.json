        "Omar, if somebody is not going to renovate their entire house or start from scratch with building a new one, what would the easiest things be to do to make it greener?",
        "Well, you know, I had a fascinating conversation with a woman named Amy Empson who runs MyGreencasa, a Web site for do it yourself green remodeling projects.",
        "She suggests people start small and not get overwhelmed.",
        "I think people look at the price tag, they think thousands of dollars in renovating my home - it's just too much.",
        "But a lot of the remodeling project you can do are very small.",
        "And sometimes the most eco-friendly thing to do is to just reuse materials you already have in your home rather than sending the old stuff to landfills and buying new materials.",
        "On her site, she details how she turned old VW bus into a jungle gym playscape for her son�",
        "Hmm.",
        "�and how she installed cork flooring in some of her rooms.",
        "Sometimes the most effective things you can do are also the simplest and the cheapest: getting an energy audit and seeing where your home can be improved.",
        "You might spend less than $300 and see an immediate impact by looking at just the weather stripping, the caulking and the insulation.",
        "And also as you replace older appliances with new ones, if you're looking at dishwashers or washer dryers that are aging or breaking down, you know, look at the more energy-efficient models to replace them.",
        "You can do a little bit over time and see a really big impact.",
        "And also looking at location specifics stuff, I mean, what works in Boston might not necessarily work in the 109 degree temperatures we're having here in Texas.",
        "Right.",
        "Omar Gallaga, who covers technology culture for the Austin American-Statesman.",
        "Omar, thanks so much.",

        "Thanks so much for joining us.",
        "A pleasure.",
        "From the opening sequence, we see that Nurse Jackie is addicted to some little red pills, and oops.",
        "So, why introduce this?",
        "It's a compelling element, but making her an addict is also unusual.",
        "I think that her life is very complicated.",
        "There are many aspects of it that are mutually exclusive.",
        "And in my worldly experience, I have discovered that people who have lots of things in their lives that don't really fit together have to find some way to kind of deny that it's happening, and she lives in a place where lots of pills can be found.",
        "So, it seemed to make a perfect match to me.",
        "Edie Falco, can I ask you something about your own worldly experience…",
        "Go on.",

        "You know, I read in preparing for this that you had, at one time, struggled with addiction.",
        "Is there a correspondence between your struggle and what you're bringing to this character?",
        "I'm sure there must be.",
        "My experience is that if you have ever struggled with addiction, you're always struggling with addiction.",
        "It's a personality trait, really.",
        "You learn how to kind of, you know, keep it at bay through many years of whatever your journey may be, therapy or 12-step programs or whatever.",
        "So, it is a mindset I understand deeply, and I'm sure that went into my portrayal of Jackie.",
        "I never really know specifically, but I'm sure that's in there.",
        "You know, I also felt that she was just fascinatingly complex.",
        "Besides admiring her name, which I hope the writers went through a lot before…"

        "During his Senate career, Santorum did speak out for balanced budgets, lower taxes and privatizing Social Security.",

        "If the economy is strong, deficits go away.",

        "He strongly supported President Bush's request for tens of billions of dollars to continue fighting the war in Afghanistan, and anywhere else Mr. Bush saw as necessary.",
        "I think the president believes, first and foremost, we need a strong economy.",
        "And we need to fight the war on terrorism and potentially that there may be other conflicts that we're going to engage in, and deficits have to take a backseat to that.",
        "Today, this idea that deficits have to take a backseat is anathema to the very definition of fiscal conservatism.",
        "It may be where Santorum is most vulnerable in the coming Republican primaries.",
        "Time and again, Santorum supported Bush administration policies that ballooned the deficit.",
        "He voted for the Medicare prescription drug program, the No Child Left Behind education bill.",
        "He supported foreign aid.",
        "And every time President Bush came back to Congress asking for more money to fight and build infrastructure in Iraq, Santorum supported him."

        "One was a trainer at the first marine park he was at, Sealand in 1991, who slipped and fell in the pool and was killed by Tillikum and two other whales.",
        "And then, in 1999, after Tillikum had moved to Sea World, a park guest stayed after dark and for some reason put on his him swim trunks and jumped in the pool with Tillikum, seemingly wanting to swim with the killer whale.",
        "And the next morning he was found dead in Tillikum's pool.",
        "After Dawn Brancheau was killed, OSHA basically cited Sea World for safety violations, telling it to end direct human-to-whale contact, is that right?",
