        "So caseloads are high: 400 cases at a time for attorneys who handle just misdemeanors.",
        "And to do all this work, the public defender's main source of income comes from court fees, from the money that's collected from people who break the law.",

        "But it's the public defender's dependence on fees that raises the most questions.",
        "Because the money comes mostly from the same poor people they're assigned to represent.",
        "There's a $40 application fee, just to get a public defender.",
        "And then there's the fee that puts Bunton in what he calls a weird and uncomfortable position.",
        "Some folks refer to it as the Bad Person Tax.",
        "That's another fee, it's $45.",
        "But it's collected only if the client pleads or is found guilty at trial.",
