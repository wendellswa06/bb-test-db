        "This is the problem that engineer Anupam Pathak wanted to solve.",
        "He can't cure Bremhorst's tremor.",
        "Instead he developed a spoon he calls Liftware.",
        "So you can kind of feel it gently vibrating.",
        "Those are the actuators inside.",
        "I'm holding the chunky handle of the spoon at the San Francisco office of Pathak's company, Liftlabs.",
        "As he says, the handle of the spoon vibrates, slightly.",
        "There's no on-off switch.",
        "The device starts automatically when you pick it up.",
        "And so, right now it's kind of sensing your motion and it'll respond.",
        "It responds by moving the spoon that snaps onto the handle.",
        "There's a little motion sensor right near the spoon.",
        "So if I had tremor, it's going to move opposite to what the shaking is doing.",
        "So if I move to the left, it'll physically move the spoon to the right.",
        "Essentially canceling out the impact of the tremor, as the spoon moves from plate to mouth.",
        "According to a clinical trial, a Liftware spoon cancels out more than 70 percent of a user's tremor.",
        "And I don't think it took us five minutes to say this is remarkable.",
        "Sheila Garner oversees a couple of dozen senior and assisted living complexes in Northern California.",
        "She was impressed enough with the Liftware demonstration to order some for her residents with essential tremor.",
        "And certainly we'll be able to free up staff time from assisting people with their eating.",
        "But really, our focus is on the fact that this provides a level of dignity for residents with essential tremors that they haven't been able to have, because there isn't a utensil that would help them in being able to eat unassisted."

        "Sharon Alexander, the facilitator of the support group, says members gave Pathak a lot of feedback.",

        "After Dawn's death, OSHA investigated extensively how Sea World works with killer whales.",
        "And they issued what was called a willful citation saying that swimming with killer whales and working as closely as Sea World did with them is a risk to trainers and that Sea World had been indifferent to those risks when it put employees in close contact with the whales.",
        "And they recommended a series of safety improvements that Sea World should make which would fundamentally change the nature of Sea World shows.",
        "Sea World obviously said - forget it, no way.",
        "If the court rules in OSHA's favor, what could it mean for all of these marine mammal parks all over the country?",
        "Well, Sea World - there are, I think, of 42 killer whales in captivity all around the world, Sea World owns 25 of them.",
        "So, Sea World is really the prime marine park.",
        "If OSHA wins this case, Sea World will have some chances to appeal it further.",
        "But if, in the end, OSHA prevails, then Sea World will be in a position where they will have to likely stay out of the water with killer whales because if anything ever happened again, you can imagine the liability.",
        "And they will also have to step back from the whales when they're not in the water and keep barriers between them.",
        "And that will change the relationship that they have with the whales, there's no doubt about it.",
        "Sea World has attracted trainers and attracted sort of the imaginations of people by basically hugging whales, swimming with whales, being very close.",
        "And so the essential image that people have of killer whales and Sea World whales will change, and that will affect their business for sure.",
        "In the course of your reporting, you have met former trainers, some of whom have said this is very dangerous work and expressed anxiety about doing that kind of work.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, it's been very interesting to talk to trainers.",
        "Well, they express two things.",
        "One is the absolute thrill of diving 20 feet down into a pool and having a 6,000 to 10,000-pound animal come up underneath you and launch you into the air.",
        "So, that's the adrenaline, that's the appeal.",
        "At the same time, they understand that killer whales can injure you, and many of them suffer injuries that they don't even necessarily report because they don't want to be benched.",
        "So, it is controversial, even within the trainer ranks, the degree to which, you know, there are risks.",
        "And some trainers, they are after the thrill and they'll work with the killer whales regardless, and others are much more cautious.",
        "They have suspended these shows since the death of Dawn Brancheau.",
        "They have not been doing these water work shows since then, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, they've had shows.",
        "They have a new show called One Ocean.",
        "But what they do in the show is they no longer swim with the whales.",
        "So, the trainers are out on stage, they are with the whales when the whales slide out of the water onto the stage, but they are not jumping off the whales' noses, they're not riding the whales, they're not doing all the classic tricks that Sea World used to do to thrill the audiences.",
