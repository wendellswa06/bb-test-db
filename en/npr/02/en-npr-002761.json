        "It was February 25th, 2003, a month before the invasion of Iraq.",

        "But her daughter knows there's no scientific evidence to back up her mother's theory.",
        "And it's the ongoing clash of ideas that forces the scientist to choose between family loyalty and what her science education has taught her.",

        "So I was just fascinated.",
        "If I could present - how could I present this, and, in a way that could be universalized?",
        "Because I think we are all in a situation, world-wide, where we have science and technology, ideology, ideas, what is proven by way of experimentation, and the clash with belief systems, which are anti-evolution, for example, and all kinds of belief systems with very strong convictions.",
