        "I wouldn't say there's a consensus about that.",
        "There is a strong case to be made that one of the factors that led to the financial crisis was pushing so hard to get people into homes without thinking hard enough about whether they could pay them back.",
        "And when that met a financial system, banks on Wall Street that were looking for any way to make securities and make money, that that was a combustible combination and the government failed to stop it.",
        "So I think it was a major cause, not the only one.",
        "So what are the options now?",
        "Well, the question is: Is there something the government could do differently that would make us less susceptible to something like this again?",

        "That's not what presidents have traditionally said.",

        "Well, it's down to about 62 percent now.",
        "Basically, in other countries, it varies a lot.",
        "But there are countries like ours, where people own a lot of houses - Canada, Spain, Ireland - yet the government doesn't subsidize it so much and they don't have this fixation with the 30-year fixed rate mortgage.",
