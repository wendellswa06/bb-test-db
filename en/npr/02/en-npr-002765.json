        "First, why do people there think all this is happening when it's happening?",
        "Well, most people think that that government has basically turned off the Internet because of the large anti-government demonstration that has been announced by the Iranian opposition.",
        "This demonstration is due to take place here on Tuesday.",
        "And many people suspect that the government has decided to switch off the Internet in order to prevent people from spreading the news to each other; from knowing which routes to walk when they will hit the center tomorrow in those demonstrations called for by the anti-government opposition."
