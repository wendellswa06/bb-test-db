        "We begin the program in Peru today, where voters are headed to the polls to decide who will be that country's next president.",
        "The front-runner is a 40-year-old congresswoman named Keiko Fujimori.",
        "Her name may sound familiar because she is the daughter of Peru's former president, Alberto Fujimori, who's now imprisoned for human rights abuses during his term.",
        "He is, as you might imagine, an extremely polarizing figure.",
        "He's credited with stabilizing Peru's economy after a crippling inflation crisis, but he is also reviled for shutting down Congress and the courts and prosecutors say committing crimes such as directing paramilitary death squads, hence the 25-year prison sentence.",
        "Now, the country could elect his daughter to its highest office.",
        "To hear more about this, we spoke with freelance journalist Simeon Tegel, who's been covering the election in Lima.",
        "And I started by asking him to describe the rest of the presidential field.",
        "There's maybe two others who are still in the race at this point and who are fighting for second place.",
        "Whoever gets it will then get into the June 5 runoff against Keiko Fujimori, who has a big double-digit lead.",
        "One of them is Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.",
        "He's a 77-year-old former prime minister.",
        "He is relatively conservative, very pro-business, privatization - that kind of thing.",
        "His opponent could hardly be more different.",
        "She's a young leftist congressman.",
        "Her name is Veronica Mendoza.",
        "She's 35 years old.",
        "She - when she talks really tends to focus on issues of equality and poverty and the corruption that is really rampant in Peru.",
        "Her mother's actually French and was in the 1968 student protests in Paris, so her daughter seems to have taken off where her mother left off.",
        "And I take it you assume that there's going to be a runoff, probably because there is such a large field.",
        "But - so how is Fujimori positioning herself in this debate?",
        "We imagine there'll be a runoff because she has about 30, 35 percent in the polls, and you need 50 percent to avoid a runoff.",
        "She's been trying to moderate Fujimori's ideological positions.",
        "Her father, I guess you might say, was on the hard right or authoritarian right.",
        "She's tried to move towards the center-right.",
        "A lot of Fujimori's traditional supporters, for example, are conservative Catholics and evangelicals.",
        "Keiko Fujimori has recently said, for example, that she accepts the idea of same-sex civil unions.",
        "That's quite a big move for her party.",
        "More than ideologically perhaps, she's also been trying to stress that she's a democrat that wouldn't repeat the high crimes and authoritarian behavior that her father once engaged in.",
        "But given how large Alberto Fujimori looms over the history - the recent history of Peru, is this election largely seen as a referendum on his tenure or not?",
        "I think to a certain degree it is, though it's also interesting Peru is a relatively young country.",
        "A lot of voters weren't adults during the 1990s when Fujimori was in charge, so his legacy is really probably the central issue.",
        "But people are also looking forward.",
        "Another big issue is the economy here.",
        "There is a broad consensus within Peru that the free market is the way to go.",
        "People don't want to follow the Venezuelan model, and the one person that seems to be at odds with that really of the prominent candidates would be Veronica Mendoza.",
        "That's Simeon Tegel.",
        "He's a freelance journalist based in Lima, Peru.",
        "Mr. Tegel, thanks so much for speaking with us.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "This is MORNING EDITION, from NPR News.",
        "I'm Renee Montagne.",

        "Supreme Court, people braved a cold, wet night on the pavement, some getting in line days ago for a chance to witness the historic arguments on same-sex marriage.",
        "Today, justices hear arguments on a constitutional challenge to a ban on gay marriage here in California that is much like laws in other states.",
        "A second round of arguments tomorrow involves the federal Defense of Marriage Act.",
        "NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg reports on what is before the court today.",
        "This week's cases fall into the category of the truly momentous, so much so that Supreme Court advocate Tom Goldstein literally pounded the table when speaking to law students last month.",
        "It's actually relatively rare that the Supreme Court decides something of such monumental importance that your grandchildren will be thinking about them, and this is that kind of case.",
        "This is special.",
        "There were no cases like this in the time that I was in law school.",
        "This is a foundational decision that I think is going to be decided for centuries.",
        "On one side of the argument is the idea of equality - on the other, traditional notions of how society has ordered itself.",
        "Today's arguments come in the face of a shift in public opinion that even opponents of same-sex marriage admit is unprecedented.",
        "Polls show that support for gay marriage has jumped from percentages in the low 40s just four years ago to majorities now as high as 58 percent.",
        "California's Proposition 8 was enacted by voter initiative in 2008 to ban same-sex marriage.",
        "The lead plaintiffs in the case are Kristin Perry and Sandy Stier.",
        "Together, they've raised four boys - Perry's biological twins and Stier's two sons, the products of a heterosexual marriage many years ago.",
        "Perry, a children's advocate, and Stier, a technical systems expert, were married in 2004, when same-sex marriage was briefly legalized in San Francisco, but the marriage was later voided by the state courts.",
        "Kris Perry.",
        "That 2012 election, still 11 months away, is very much on the minds of the Obama organization here.",
        "Even though Iowa Democrats don't have the excitement of a contested caucus to keep them interested, spokesman John Kraus says the Obama campaign is using the January 3rd event as a rallying point."

        "A relentless focus on organization helped Mr. Obama win the Iowa caucuses four years ago, a victory that marked the first step on his ultimate march to the White House.",
        "Today, though, the president's approval rating in Iowa is below 50 percent.",
        "And Kraus knows this state's six electoral votes are very much up for grabs in November.",
        "Iowa is a swing state.",
        "It's going to be a tough race, but it's going to be decided by a campaign's ability to organize their grassroots effort on the ground, and that's something we're focused on.",
        "Political analyst Dianne Bystrom of Iowa State University says the president has a couple of things going for him, a tech-savvy campaign staff who make good use of email and social networks like Facebook to spread their message, and lots of campaign cash.",
        "Still, Bystrom sees far less enthusiasm for Mr. Obama among her students today than she did four years ago, when young voters were an important ingredient of the winning Obama formula.",
        "It is going to be, I think, an uphill battle for President Obama to get those young voters back.",
        "Part of it is because of his message in 2008 and he promised so much change.",
        "He really kind of set himself up because no one really can do as much as he promised.",
        "And young voters aren't the only ones who've grown disillusioned with a sluggish economic recovery and persistent gridlock in Washington.",

        "We have people who are just fed up with the way things are going and then we try and talk to them about things that the president has accomplished and the direction he is going.",

        "LaBounty's own support for the president has only deepened.",
        "She voted for Barack Obama in 2008, but this is the first year she's actively campaigned for him.",
        "You can do two things.",
        "You can sit around and complain about it and do nothing, or you can try to make change wherever you can.",
        "Campaign spokesman Kraus says more than TV ads or political events, one-on-one conversations with volunteers are the best way to influence undecided voters.",
        "And they won't stop on January 3rd."

        "The problem is, if the university is maintaining this sort of information on its employees, the temptation to use that information is simply far too great in the future.",

        "There are a few exceptions.",
