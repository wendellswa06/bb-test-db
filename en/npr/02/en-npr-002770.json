        "University of Washington Professor Eric Schnapper is another employment law expert.",
        "This case could be the Fred Thompson of the court's term - much anticipated, but quickly forgotten.",
        "The reason is that most employers don't hire or promote by rigid adherence to test scores anymore.",
        "Part of the legacy of the civil rights law is that employers have had to rethink how they hire and promote, and whether requirements are really related to the job.",
        "Police and fire departments have often been the last to change, in part because promotion to rigid adherence to numbers avoids political interference, and in part because some places the type of test is established in the union contract.",
        "In New Haven, for instance, the union contract requires the promotion test to be 60 percent multiple-choice, written exam.",
        "This despite the test that test designers agreed that minorities do less well on these pen-and-pencil exams and better on reality simulations.",
        "The message from yesterday's Supreme Court ruling is that if a municipality wants to change its testing procedures, it better do it before anyone takes the test.",
        "Michael Rosman of the conservative Center for Individual Rights.",
        "The basic change in reality is that employers will not be able to toss out the results of tests solely based upon disparate impact.",
        "Professor Primus agrees.",
        "My guess is that a lot of municipalities are tonight and tomorrow going to look at the rules that they labor under today and see if there are ways that they can change them.",
        "Just where the Supreme Court is on the question of race and testing remains a bit amorphous.",
        "There do not appear to be five votes on the court to invalidate the provision of the civil rights law at issue in yesterday's case.",
        "Rather, Justice Kennedy, the author of the opinion, charted a deliberate middle ground, narrowing the court's interpretation of the law.",
        "Justice Antonin Scalia warned ominously in a concurring opinion that the court would eventually have to confront to the question of whether the provision is constitutional.",
        "In a rare oral dissent from the bench, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, using a rhetorical skewer, said of the conservative majority: The white firefighters understandably attract the court's empathy, even though they have no vested right to promotions and no person has been promoted in their place.",
        "It was a barbed reference to conservative criticism of President Obama's stated desire for Supreme Court nominees who have empathy.",
        "Conservative opponents of Mr. Obama's nominee, Sonia Sotomayor, used the word empathy to mock her nomination, and she was, in fact, a member of the lower court panel whose decision was reversed by the Supreme Court yesterday."

        "He says crime victims have all sorts of needs that have longed been ignored, and no matter how hard the criminal justice system works to meet those needs, the primary focus will always be on the alleged offender.",
        "Ari Shapiro, NPR News, Washington.",
        "There is a story out of St. Petersburg, Florida, that reminded us of a seemingly innocuous but actually very serious aspect of disaster planning and also of a piece of legislation that passed Congress this summer and was signed into law in October."

        "What does the law do?",
        "It's a wonderful law and we applaud Congress for taking this action.",
        "It requires local and state emergency preparedness authorities to include in their evacuation plans how they will accommodate people that have household pets and service animals in the case of a disaster.",
        "So local and state authorities must submit these plans in order to qualify for grants from FEMA.",
        "That means that - I have a dog and if there is a disaster or a flood and I'm to be evacuated, in the past I might very well have been told you can't bring the dog on the bus that we're going to get you out on.",

        "Does the law in any way address the problem of what you do with the dog once you get out of the city?",
