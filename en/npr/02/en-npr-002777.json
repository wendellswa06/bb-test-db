        "Is there some question which, if it were answered one way or the other, is the red light, green light about your going back home, something which if you--if it were the wrong answer, you'd say, `Maybe back to New Orleans but not back to New Orleans East?'",

        "Right after Katrina we heard somebody cite the--evidently the conventional wisdom that after around eight months or so, people who've been away from the city, you know, they start to lose the desire to come back.",
