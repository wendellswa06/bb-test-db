        "There was - RVers were derided as gypsies, trailer trash and tin-can tourists back in the early days, and I think you still have that.",
        "I think it kind of evokes or it gets reactions from people.",
        "It symbolizes, I think, for some kind of American excess and decadence.",
        "I mean, you have this 45-foot monstrosity on wheels hogging up the highway.",

        "I think it's - I think it's - whether you see it as a - as - like a symbol of environmental indifference or whether you see it as this wonderfully freeing thing just depends on kind of where you sit.",

        "Mr.",
        "O'TOOLE: Well, you do everything you can, all the things you've been mentioning.",
        "And you're dealing with the police and constantly checking with other metro systems to see if there's something more that can be done.",

        "When you manage risk, you have to recognize the fact that as tragic and as awful as this was, the fact of the matter is the system is not a risky environment compared to others.",

        "You're still safer traveling on the Underground than you are getting in an automobile and getting on the highway, going--driving on the M25.",
        "People, at moments like these, tend to make judgment based on fear, not risk.",
        "When you factor in risk and look at it that way, this is still a preferred way to get around London, which remains, relatively speaking, a very safe major city.",
        "Seems that you do have to deal with that public perception, though.",
