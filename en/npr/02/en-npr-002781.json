        "And finally, we mentioned, obviously, beyond the environmental issues, the gas is expensive.",
        "On the other hand, you're eating in the RV a lot, so did you thought of, did you save money, did you spend money?",
        "I probably spent more money because I wasn't - it came to about $280 a day and that did not include gas.",
