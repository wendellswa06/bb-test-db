        "So, now that there is this newer information that's surfaced, what has Rick Ross' response been to that?",
        "Not very significant.",
        "He really used to freestyle that indicated that he still was not particularly interested in what was going on \"\"on the net.\"\" Right now, Rick Ross has one or two songs that are on the radio, I imagine they'll still continue to be on the radio.",
        "But, is he going to come out and say, yes, you know what, that is what I did, I should have been up front and honest about it, and here's why.",
        "If he delivers compelling art about it, if he makes a great song about it, he could, conceivably, just move right past this, like another bump.",
        "But the fact that he lied about it is, unfortunately, a bad first sign.",
        "Jon Caramanica writes about music for the New York Times.",

        "There's a house for sale in Los Angeles - 29 rooms, tennis court, swimming pool and wine cellar, a guest house, game house, movie theater and a grotto, which is not to be confused with any grotto you've read about in the Bible.",
        "The owner wants $200 million.",
        "Local realtors say that's optimistic, which is often their way of saying that's ridiculous.",
        "But the house is Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion.",
        "At the age of 89, Hef may be downsizing.",
        "Insert the double-entendre of your choice here.",
        "But there is a catch.",
        "Any buyer must permit Playboy's founder to continue to live in the house until he moves on.",
        "Twenty-nine rooms should afford privacy all around, but imagine padding down to the kitchen to find yourself walking on cracker crumbs and dirty plates in the sink because some night snacker in his black silk pajamas didn't clean up and downed the last sip of orange juice.",
        "Hef.",
        "The man isn't used to sharing.",
        "The Playboy Mansion is a year younger than its owner and may be getting a little creaky - or worse.",
        "Izabella St. James, a former Playboy bunny who lived there from 2002 to 2004, says much of the furniture is old and ratty, the bedding is soiled and tatty and the dogs who belong to the bunnies who live in the mansion relieve themselves on the curtains and carpets.",
        "That would be a lot to put up with in a budget motel, much less a $200 billion mansion.",
        "Hugh Hefner's been married for three years to Crystal Hefner, who is his third wife and, for whatever it means, 60 years younger than Hef.",
        "He's spent many years sharing his residence with a changing cast of young women, but in 2005 he told Britain's Telegraph, I thinned the herd a couple of years ago because there were some rivalries, some petty jealousies and I was trying to emphasize the quality.",
        "There are some statements for which no truly clever response is possible.",
        "Anyone who wants own Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion must also know it comes with a history of ring-a-ding '70s glitz but also darker chapters of drug use and sexual assault at his celebrated parties.",
        "Recent reports say Mr. Hefner now fills his nights by slurping canned chicken noodle soup and chomping oatmeal and raisin cookies before he watches old movies with his younger brother and a few old friends.",
        "He sits hand-in-hand with his wife.",
        "They say good night at 9 p.m. Imagine spending millions to move into the Playboy Mansion and instead of rampant revelry, you find you have to get in line for the Early Bird Special."

        "Juan, this trip's getting a lot of attention.",

        "Well, the big pitfall is how it plays back at home.",

        "If this election was being held in the countries he's visiting, places like Germany, France, and England, I don't think there's any question, Barack Obama would be a runaway winner.",
        "But the other part of this, Alex, that you have to contend with is this is the first time that he's been in Iraq since January of '06, and it's the first time ever that he's going to Afghanistan.",

        "Speaking to the chief of police today, he remembered not being able to get anyone near the provincial council building, the people inside the provincial council building, not being able to exercise any authority in the city at all, and he remembers having bloody battles on the very street that I'm standing on right now.",
        "And today it is a completely different scenario.",

        "Even though security has improved here, funnily enough you speak to many of the different players here - from the Awakening movement, from the Iraqi security forces, from the political side of things - and they're all quite ambivalent about this happening, because there are tensions between all these groups.",
        "They are vying for power, vying for control.",
        "Elections are supposed to be coming up.",

        "So we see a lot of different things going on at the moment.",
        "And they were very ambivalent for the Americans to hand over control to the Iraqis, because they were seen as sort of peacemaker between all these different groups.",
        "And when this was supposed to happen there was a very large suicide bombing near Fallujah.",
        "And that also raised the specter that perhaps Anbar wasn't as secure as it had been touted to be.",
        "So what we're seeing now is the handover's finally happening, but everyone has said, listen, al-Qaida is still around, security isn't perfect, and there are all these tensions between these Sunnis groups, but it is time for the Iraqis to assume control.",
