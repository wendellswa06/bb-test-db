        "McCain himself sometimes plays into ageist stereotypes, like yesterday, when he said he can still picture the lawmakers behind the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930.",
        "But on most days McCain seems hipper than your average 17-year-old, joking about popular TV shows and appearing regularly with John Stewart.",
