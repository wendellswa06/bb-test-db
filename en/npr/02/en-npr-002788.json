        "But Dr. Steven Laureys, the lead neurologist on Rom Houben's case, sounded like a believer when he spoke with ALL THINGS CONSIDERED host Melissa Block.",
        "Here is Laureys, who leads the Coma Science Group at the University of Liege, describing the first time he tested his patient's ability to communicate through a facilitator.",
        "Showing him different object and asking him afterwards what I have been showing him.",
        "So the first word he communicated to me was the word key, my car keys that I just showed him.",
        "Laureys now says he was uncomfortable with some of what he said in that interview.",
        "And since then he has tested Houben and some other patients more rigorously.",
        "A few days ago, Laureys and his research team presented the results of those tests at a scientific meeting in the U.K.",
        "Laureys says they showed the patient an object or spoke a word.",
        "The facilitator was out of the room.",
        "Then the facilitator was brought back in to help the patient answer questions.",
        "We presented three cases after traumatic brain injury, two failed the test, and that was including Rom.",
        "The man who was supposed to be writing a novel could not even identify an apple through facilitated communication.",
        "Laureys says it's possible Houben passed the earlier test with car keys, which took place years ago, because his facilitator had been in the room and saw the object.",
        "Laureys says he tried repeatedly to confirm the result with Houben's original facilitator but the results were always inconclusive.",
        "If you have answers like, I don't want to do the test or you don't trust me, those kinds of answers, well, then, you cannot say anything.",
        "The recent tests were done with a different facilitator who was prepared to take part in the more rigorous experiment.",
        "Dr. Steven Novella, a neurologist at Yale University, says he's not surprised by any of this.",
        "Steven Laureys is a legitimate researcher and neurologist.",
        "I think he just wasn't familiar with facilitated communication and that bit him in the behind."

        "Yes.",

        "I can say it's the hardest earthquake we've had since 1974, for sure.",
        "And let's remember that most of the population here in Peru lives on the coast, so obviously there was a tsunami alert so there was a widespread alarm."
