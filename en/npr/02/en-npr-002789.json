        "And the whole time I was in Iraq I thought about it every time I listened to any kind of music.",
        "You know, either thought I was absolutely alone, or in a crowd of people if I could pop in the headphones, I felt fine with it.",
        "And I took a lot of comfort in that and that helped get through a lot of it, a lot of the craziness.",

        "But the way the European economy is, roughly speaking, you need more than 1 percent per year annualized growth rate in order to reduce unemployment.",
        "Unemployment's very high.",
        "We want to be seeing on an annualized basis 2 percent, perhaps even 3 percent in this recovery phase in order to feel that they've really turned the corner.",

        "Well, there's a huge debate in Europe about exactly that.",
        "Where the people who think you should have tight fiscal policy saying, aha, this proves tight fiscal policy's working, and the people who want a much looser fiscal policy are saying, well, we've loosened a bit in the past few months and that's working.",
        "I'm afraid it's hard to sort it out, even with all the data that there are, and people are going to continue to argue about exactly where policy should be.",
        "And so each side will use these numbers to ratify their own argument and suggest they'll be right.",

        "The Germans are saying this proves we were right to be austere and the French are saying, no, no, this proves we're right to back off a little bit.",
