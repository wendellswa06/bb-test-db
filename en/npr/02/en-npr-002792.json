        "They're smart.",
        "They're sharp.",

        "Thank you.",
        "This is a question I would love to ask both the Democratic and Republican candidates, but this is about the Democrats, particularly Hillary Clinton but I guess all of them.",
        "One of things that was really apparent when George Bush came into power is he basically hired and/or appointed all of the same cronies that were in his dad's administration and basically, all the Republican administrations going back for several decades.",
        "In reality, you married my daughter and that was it.",
        "But if anybody else were in my shoes, they could have been completely shut out and not had anything.",
        "So, I understand how blessed I am to be a part of your family.",
        "I'm Alex Chadwick, and DAY TO DAY has more just ahead.",
        "I guess I want to know, you know, who are they going to hire, who's - is Hillary going to basically surround herself by a bunch of people who've been on the inside for the past 10 to 20 years and it's going to be more the same?",
        "Or who is she going to appoint to be, you know, in her advisory council, if you will.",
        "I just think that's a big part of the problem that we've had for the past several decades is that continuity of corruption and I guess I want to know what they're going to - how they are going to answer that."

        "Can't give you a full answer on who she's going to appoint, but I can tell you, Bryan, that this is a question that will be addressed on NPR.",
        "Can't say whether it'll be in the debate but our own political correspondent - national political correspondent Mara Liasson is looking at the question of a Clinton dynasty and what that means.",
        "And I believe she'll be burrowing other news developments, reporting that on NPR's MORNING EDITION tomorrow.",

        "Well, that's great.",
        "I mean, I'd like to hear the other candidates answer that, too.",
        "But obviously, for, you know, Hillary Clinton, it's particularly pertinent.",
        "You know, I care about the issues.",
        "I care about their programmatic solutions, but all of that can change as soon as they're elected and ultimately, it comes down to who are they surrounding themselves with and what are they trying to get done.",
        "Robert?",
        "I would just add, Bryan, that, you know, another way of saying, I'm going to bring in all the same old tired hacks who used to be in the administration.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Another way of saying this, I'm going to bring people who have experienced at actually making policy in Washington.",
        "So it's a question where you can see the glass either half full or half empty the way you look at it.",
        "It's also - Michele, go ahead.",
        "I was just going to say that Bryan's question also goes to something that I think many of us are hearing on the ground here.",
        "On one side, voters are talking about the dynastic nature of Hillary Clinton's candidacy, the sort of hopscotch Bush-Clinton Bush-Clinton nature, and whether this would be sort of back to the future.",
        "On the other hand, if you listen to Barack Obama and look at the ads that he's running on television, it's all about change, that, you know, you're going to see sort of a new face and a new administration, so he's really keen in something we hear here."

        "Well, I think that's true.",
        "But I mean, again, just from the, you know, man-on-the-street-voter perspective, you know, we've been through this before, where a candidate, you know, promises to do X, Y and Z and says, you know, these issues are most important to them and they surround themselves with people who then go, you know, take them off into a different direction, whether the candidate-elect, you know, that's going willingly or not, you know, sort of depends on the personality, you know.",
