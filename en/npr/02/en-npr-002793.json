        "The solution has only a combination of three things: One, raise taxes; two, reduce benefits; three, a combination of one and two.",
        "What's the candidate's plan for this - clearly, an area that's on a lot of people's minds, social security, broadly, and retirement, Robert?",
        "A very, very interesting set of questions.",
        "I'm not sure that the number of retirees will actually exceed the number of workers.",
        "But the ratio will decline to something, I think, in the - ultimately, about two to one, which is not the - that's not the ratio which social security works well.",
        "But it's obviously a big question.",
        "And I think that among the Democrats, Obama has actually proposed lifting the cap on the FICA tax and the social security tax.",
        "And that's not a hugely popular position, but he says, only six percent of the American public would pay more in social security taxes and that's part of this approach.",

        "I don't know what else to say.",

        "And I'll be curious to know whether the candidates would be willing to support legislation that would combat large scale media conglomeration in America.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This - do you work in the industry, Leo?",
        "Or why did you (unintelligible)?",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Okay.",
        "Steve Inskeep, media conglomeration, well, as you're talking about more and more outlets on the World Wide Web as - that's what the FCC says, allows more radio and television and newspapers operations to be consolidated because there are so many more news sources today.",

        "I really don't know what the candidate's stance is.",
        "So you have a good question there and something that interest me as a citizen, because we have so many more, obviously, outlets for information because of the Web now.",
        "But a lot of that information seems to be repeating the same statements that somebody reports again and again and again and again.",
        "And as people in the media, we often wonder about the mystery, if it is a mystery, or the conspiracy when it is a conspiracy, that causes a fact, quote, unquote, \"\"to get out there\"\" and get repeated forever whether it's true or not."

        "I mean, and what happens, you know, when folks descend on a city and a state?",
        "Well, I think a lot of our history tends to come back because when people think of South Carolina, they think of many things.",
        "Race certainly is a factor, and it's a factor in our coverage, too, because, you know, we live in a very diverse state.",
        "If you look at this primary to the other primaries, I think the racial diversity here is pretty stark and evident.",
        "So I think the national media, though, they come, and there are a couple of stories that I think sometimes South Carolinians, wince when they see.",
        "One of them probably is the Confederate flag because that's one, I think that our folks who live here sometimes I think tire of, so when the national media comes, it inevitably comes up.",
        "Now, Ron, you have been following John McCain and as you follow him around, how does he seem to interact with the local politics of the places he goes?",
        "Well, certainly, as Leroy can tell you, in South Carolina, he came armed with endorsements this time in 2000, where he was - well, it's widely accepted that he was smeared - he was the victim of a smear campaign, which may have cost him that fate eight years ago.",
        "This time, he had the foresight and the strategy to line up a lot of endorsements from presumably influential state politicians.",
        "So if you're Lindsey Graham, Bobby Harold, the speaker of the legislature there, and Attorney General Henry McMaster were his constant companions in South Carolina.",
        "So he had the, I think, the foresight and learned the lesson of 2000 and came armed this time and narrowly won over Huckabee as we saw.",
        "Now, here at NEWS & NOTES, we talk a lot about walking the line between serving our target African-American audience and, you know, black folks are overwhelmingly Democrats and providing balanced coverage of the political playing field.",
        "So, Ron, how do you think journalists should cover the issue?",
        "It's something that, you know, it's a tough decision.",

        "Well, yeah, the balance.",
        "I mean, when you are looking at really dealing with a primarily African-American audience, there has not been a lot of love, a lot of participation from the Republican side in African-American forums and debates.",
