        "In private conversations, I have spoken to John McCain about the future of the Republican Party if it remains a white party.",
        "Now, he said - he claimed that, you know, the reason most of the people who show up at his rallies and his events not just his but Romney's and the Giuliani's, in the early going states were white was because of these states were overwhelmingly white.",
        "Well, that's factually accurate but it's also, I guess, a bit misleading because the implication is that in a more heavily African-American state that his audience is, the Republican candidates' audiences, would reflect the composition of those states and that's - I think we all know that's simply not the case.",
        "And when I talked to McCain privately about this, he says that the Republican Party cannot prosper and exist in the future if it remains an all-white party.",
        "But if you look at the issues and the rhetoric and the language that the Republican candidates are using in 2008, I mean, it's clear that there's no obvious effort to attract the votes of African-Americans and certainly, the stance of many of these candidates on the immigration issue has pushed the Latinos away from the party where they had made inroads in recent years.",
        "Let me get Leroy in here.",
        "This is not a state without black voters.",
        "You have plenty of black folks in South Carolina.",
        "So was there any love when the Republicans came to town, in terms of visiting African-American communities, trying to get out the vote, sway some independent voters who are black to the Republican side?",
        "One candidate visited what we would call in South Carolina the black belt.",

        "Why or why not?",
        "Oh definitely, more troops would have helped us.",

        "Some mysterious, unseen force, they say, is pulling galaxy clusters through the universe, and these galaxies are traveling, well, they're clocking along at about a million miles per hour and moving in the way that our current understanding of the universe does not predict, they say.",
        "Scientists have dubbed that movement dark flow because we don't know what's going on there.",

        "That is, an extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence.",
        "So we'll need further work on that before you're convinced of this being true?",
        "That's right.",
        "And I think it's, I think people are convinced that there are going to be more surprises, that this very successful picture we have of the universe that's got dark matter and dark energy and a burst of inflation, that there's going to be some more surprising things to come along our way.",
        "And this could be one of them.",
        "What this suggests is, or one possibility is that it's suggesting that the universe is tilted, that everything is kind of moving from, if I may, call it from left to right, because of course galaxies are expanding.",
        "We know about the expansion of the universe, and we studied that very well, and over and above the motions of galaxies, galaxies move apart due to this expansion, over and above that expansion there are velocities that for historical reasons astronomers call peculiar velocities.",
        "And these additional velocities that galaxies have that aren't due to the expansion of the universe are due to the uneven distribution of matter in the universe."

        "And so just to make it very concrete, our galaxy is being pulled by Andromeda Galaxy, which is nearby, and by the Virgo Cluster.",
        "And so that peculiar velocity we understand because it's just the gravitational tug on the nearby matter, Virgo Cluster and Andromeda.",
        "And these flows that Kashlinsky and his colleagues have inferred of clusters that are very, very far away can't be explained by the lumpy distribution of matter.",
        "It's as if something else is causing them, and we don't know what that cause is.",
        "I said one possibility for the cause is literally that the universe is tilted, so everything has a tendency to move in that direction, and right now the data is intriguing, but we're not at that gold standard of proof yet.",
        "They suggested that one possibility is that something outside our visible universe is tugging at it.",
        "Could there be another universe someplace?",
        "Well, so that's what I was kind of alluding to, this idea that the universe is tilted, that this idea of inflation says the our universe is very, very smooth because a small bit early on got blown up to enormous size in an otherwise very irregular universe.",
        "And it could be these irregularities on very, very large scales, way beyond our inflationary patch, are giving rise to these motions, and that would be extraordinarily exciting, that these coherent motions, all these clusters seeming to be going in the same direction, having nothing to do with the distribution of matter in our universe, is telling us something about the largest scales of the universe.",
        "Or it could be that we're really pushing our data to the absolute limits and that it's artifact.",
