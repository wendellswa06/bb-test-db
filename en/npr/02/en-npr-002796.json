        "And interestingly, I don't think anybody a hundred percent believe that, at least on the left or the center.",
        "Those who voted for Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito I think had hoped that it would be somewhat different.",
        "And even Justice O'Connor, who retired, and Justice Alito took her position I'm told is really quite angry about some of what she considers to be the reversals of precedent.",
        "But are you saying, in a sense, that people who are surprised by this only have themselves to blame that it was intended all along?",
        "Yes.",
        "And I think it was fairly clear.",
        "I think it was fairly clear in the President's announced goals.",
        "And if you looked at Justice Roberts and Justice Alito's records, they are very fine lawyers.",
        "Justice Roberts had been a - really a brilliant advocate in the Supreme Court and a short-term judge.",
        "But you could look at his record and have a fairly good idea where he was going.",
        "And Justice Alito, even more so.",
        "So are conservatives gloating?",
        "No.",
        "They're not gloating because they know that would be bad for them.",
        "But I think they're very, very pleased.",
        "I saw Robin Conrad from the Chamber of Commerce saying, for example, from the business community, it's their best term in memory.",
        "And sort of more political conservatives, ideological conservatives, are very pleased.",
        "Some, as I said, on the harder right, are saying the same thing that liberals are, you know, we wish they'd go further and they're just pretending not to.",
        "And they're worried about that a bit because they know the composition of the court could change at any time, and they want to get rid of some precedents.",
        "They want to get rid of, for example, Roe versus Wade.",
        "There are a lot of people who want to get rid of it, and not have it there as a precedent for the next court that comes along.",
        "There's been a lot of coverage about John Roberts' relative youth.",
        "That he's going to be chief justice for a very long time.",
        "Is there a scenario under which he gains confidence to overturn precedent, that some of his hesitancy to take such bold steps has to do with being a first term chief justice?",
        "That's possible.",
        "But also, he doesn't entirely have the votes.",
        "He's got four votes for that, but he doesn't have Kennedy some of the time.",
        "When he has Kennedy, they've done it in some instances.",
        "I mean, there's a rather - to most of us - obscure anti-trust cases here where the court reversed a nearly 100-year-old precedent on price fixing.",
        "And did not leave it to Congress, which they could have done, they did it on their own.",
        "And they had Kennedy for that.",
        "In fact, Kennedy wrote the opinion.",
        "So if they've got Kennedy, they can do it.",
        "But they don't have Kennedy; they have to walk carefully.",
        "And best example of that is the school's case where they had four votes to say that diversity is not a compelling state interest and that race can never be a factor.",
        "And Kennedy just wasn't willing to go that far.",
        "And he wrote a separate opinion that says diversity can be a compelling interest and can sometimes be a factor.",
        "Justice Kennedy has - I think the number was he dissented twice in 68 cases this term, so he's always in the majority more or less.",
        "He's not only always in the majority.",
        "He was in the majority in every one of the 24 five-to-four cases, which is extraordinary.",
        "I'm told you have to go back nearly a half century to find somebody who dissented this little in a term and who is this influential in a term."

        "And they are, in fact, a lot of the lightning rod cases.",
        "Yes, he agreed with her not to overturn Roe versus Wade and to impose a new standard which is - that the state cannot impose an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion.",
        "But he has rarely, if ever, I think he only once really found a burden that he considered undue, whereas she found a lot of undue burdens, especially later in her years on the court.",

        "Certainly.",
        "Justice Kennedy is more conservative than Justice O'Connor on most issues, not all issues.",
        "There are a few areas in which he is more libertarian than she and that shakes out in various ways.",
        "But you change the median justice, you change the direction of the court is also significant that in the old days, the game was if you wanted to get a liberal outcome -again using these broad categories that aren't always perfectly descriptive -you started out with four votes.",
        "And then you had to get either Kennedy or O'Connor, to get either one of them you got a liberal outcome.",
        "Now, if you want to get the liberal outcome, you have to get Kennedy.",
        "So you have one shot rather than two.",

        "Not especially.",
        "On the cases that people have paid most attention to - the partial birth abortion decision, the case involving campaign finance regulation and the schools decision - these were positions he had staked out for a very long time.",
        "He's been a critic of the Supreme Court's doctrine with regard to campaign finance regulation and he expressed that was used again in the case involving the Wisconsin Right to Life Organization.",
        "He had dissented from the court's 2000 decision, striking down Nebraska's Partial Birth Abortion Act, and he basically turned his dissent into the law in the Gonzales against Carhart decision this year.",
        "And then on the schools' cases, he has, for a long time, taken a position that he favors a principle of color blindness in interpreting the Equal Protection Clause.",
        "And while he said in a case involving University of Michigan Law School, that that meant that you could still have diversity as a compelling interest, there, too, he said that the university hadn't actually further that interest in a sufficiently narrow way, and that's basically what he did in this case.",
        "So these decision are consistent with his own jurisprudence.",
        "The only possible surprise is that I think some people might have thought that even though he was in dissent in those earlier cases, he would adhere to the decisions by the courts with which he disagreed, namely the following precedent.",
        "And he didn't in these cases.",
        "In that sense, he went along with this shift under Chief Justice Roberts, whereby the court basically doesn't follow the earlier cases but offers some trivial distinction and says its not overruling the precedents.",
        "Ted Olson, do you agree with that characterization?",
        "Well, partially.",
        "I have some trouble with the liberal conservative characterization of some of these cases.",
        "Justice Kennedy, as Professor Dorf has said, is been relatively consistent over the years in his views.",
        "He's always been a very strong proponent, for example, of freedom of speech and freedom of expression under the First Amendment.",
        "So, his vote in the campaign finance case that said that the government couldn't prohibit advertising during election periods, which identified certain issues, was a First Amendment free speech decision.",
        "Would you call that liberal or conservative?",
        "A lot of people would call it liberal, but people are characterizing that decision as conservative, because the conservatives on the court, so-called conservatives on the court, have been opponents of restrictions on election activities, of election finance activities.",
