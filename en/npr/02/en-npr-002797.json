        "Well, I, you know, you're never wrong, Nina.",
        "You're almost always right anyway.",
        "I don't know.",
        "That's probably the best explanation.",
        "But even so, it's very unusual.",
        "You're right, the court does not vote to reconsider decision it's already made even if new evidence is presented to them.",
        "They're afraid, I think, of a slippery slope that people will keep pestering them with petitions over and over again with new evidence, new affidavits, new court decisions, whatever it is, and their decisions won't just be final.",
        "And so, it is a very unusual situation.",
        "Michael Dorf?",
        "That's all true, except that in this case, when they denied cert the first time, justices Stevens and Kennedy said, but keep us posted on any new developments and we may change our minds.",
        "So that they do have that out to distinguish future cases of people trying to flood them with new paper, although I agree with General Olson that lawyers are clever enough to use this as a precedent even if the court says it isn't one.",
        "We have email from Mark(ph) in Boston.",
        "He says, where did your guest think that Justice Kennedy will fall on the question of the Senate subpoenas to the White House?",
        "Should this question come before the court?",
        "Michael Dorf, I don't want to make have a crystal ball into Justice Kennedy's mind, but do you want feel that one from Mark?",
        "Sure, let me say one thing about the crystal ball first.",
        "I have a friend and colleague in another law school who used to say that the most discouraging part of our job as constitutional law professors, was the fact that 90 percent of the time, we're trying to read Justice O'Connor's mind.",
        "And now, I feel like my stock has gone up since I supposedly am a little bit better at reading Justice Kennedy's mind than some of my colleagues in the professoriate.",
        "So I should begin by saying I don't really know what Justice Kennedy will do with that.",
        "The most relevant item we have on this is the opinion that Justice Kennedy wrote for the court in the case involving Vice President Cheney's energy commission a number of years ago.",
        "That case was not a decision based strictly on the question of executive privilege.",
        "The issue there was the discovery under the civil discovery rules where the administration had raised separation of powers objections but not specifically raised executive privilege.",
        "Nonetheless, Justice Kennedy wrote an opinion that was very differential to the executive branch, and that distinguished the prior case on executive privilege, which was a case involving the Nixon tapes, on the ground that that case involved a criminal investigation.",
        "That suggests to me, at least, that Justice Kennedy is likely to side with the executive in a claim of executive privilege outside of the context of a criminal investigation or at least in the case in which Congress doesn't make a very strong shelling of need for the material.",
        "I'm not so sure if the question were what was your justification for - your legal justification, that's what they're asking for in a lot of the material they're seeking about - the rules and treatment of detainees, for example.",
        "That's - what was your legal justification for doing X, Y and Z, and we'd like to know.",
        "But the fact is, I can't imagine this case getting to the Supreme Court before President Bush leaves office.",
        "I mean, I can conceive of ways, but I think it's much more likely that it gets derailed or filibustered or it's in the district court and then the Court of Appeals and then there's a deal if there is a citation for - I mean, I do not see this getting to the Supreme Court.",
        "This is not the beginning of the Bush term; this is the end of the Bush term.",
        "Well, it depends on how it plays out, right?",
        "What could happen -and this seems farfetched - we could imagine Congress finding that someone in the White House is in contempt of Congress and holding a trial in Congress at which point, whoever it is, let's say Karl Rove, invokes executive privilege.",
        "That would go to the Supreme Court pretty quickly I would think."

        "Is that because they're finding it hard to get enough justices to agree to hear new cases?",
        "Oh, well, you're - the answer to this question is multi-faceted and very boring.",
        "And so, I don't think we should take a huge amount of time.",

        "Each justice provides a law clerk, and the law clerk goes through the 8,000 cases as they're - and makes recommendations.",
        "Well, you can imagine the 23, 24, 25-year-old law clerks are a little bit risk-averse, they don't want to look stupid, and so therefore they make very cautious recommendations.",
        "There's - the second fact is that the lower courts are pretty conservative.",
        "I think they're two-thirds Republican appointees now, so they're sort of in sync with the Supreme Court.",
        "The Supreme Court doesn't have to - it's not in nearly the kind of conflict there may be once was.",
        "The third reason is that - there have been some laws passed that have cut down on the mandatory appeals to the Supreme Court.",
        "And, what am I leaving out?",
        "That's about it.",
        "But that doesn't really explain most of the changes in the last few years.",
        "Most of those changes are about over decade ago.",
        "Oh, I know what else.",
        "There hasn't been a huge amount of big legislation passed in the last 10 years.",
        "And the Supreme Court does a lot of cases that says what did Congress mean when it passed the Civil Rights Act?"

        "Now opponents of the 90-day proposal were suggesting--and I think they could have won a vote on 28 days straight out, but the government pressed and continued to press for a 90-day limit, and they went off the track this afternoon.",
        "Now as recently as last week, we had heard that the--Prime Minister Blair had taken stock of the situation, realized he was not going to win on the 90 days and had decided to back down, and then changed his mind.",

        "And so the measurements that they've used are from a satellite that I bet most of the listeners have heard of, the WMAP satellite, that mapped out the microwave background, and an X-ray satellite called ROSAT that mapped out clusters.",
        "And in both cases we're going to improve.",
        "So right now there's a European satellite called Planck that's making even more precise measurements than the WMAT satellite did, and it's going to start releasing data towards the end of the year.",
        "And then better X-ray satellites, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM satellite.",
        "So I think this is not going to be a puzzle that lies around for 10 or 20 years, but in a few years we'll know, the signal will either get stronger, the indications for these dark flows will get stronger, or they will go away and we'll say, oops, there are peculiar velocities out there, but they're not quite as big as we thought, and they can be explained by the lumpy distribution of matter in the universe.",
