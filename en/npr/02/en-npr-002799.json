        "I asked him whether strategists worry more about North Korean leader Kim Jong Il using a bomb or selling one somewhere.",
        "As with most states, the truth is that the issue of deterrence works, that it would be pretty suicidal for any regime anywhere to use the bomb because of the fear that it itself would be destroyed.",
        "And that deterrent effect does work with North Korea, because after all, their main motivation - Kim Jong Il's main motivation - is regime survival.",
        "The accident drew thousands of onlookers who had lined the banks of the river to watch the rescue effort.",
        "University of Minnesota student Sara Decker handed out water to rescue workers and observers.",
        "She said it was the only thing she could think to do.",
        "Decker says she had been in a car waiting to cross the bridge when the accident happened.",
        "All I can do is thank God that, you know, I'm safe.",
        "You never think something like this is going to happen.",
        "And so I just praise God that there's so many people here that are helping and doing what they can.",
        "The Minneapolis fire chief called off the rescue effort once it became dark.",
        "He said it was too dangerous to send rescue workers and divers into the river to look for victims.",
        "The bridge collapse presents a major traffic challenge to already congested Twin City's freeways.",
        "It also disrupts barge traffic on the river, as huge chunks of concrete and rebar and numerous vehicles remain underwater.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Lorna Benson in Minneapolis.",
        "Just after the storm made landfall in Mississippi four years ago today, folks in New Orleans were breathing a sigh of relief.",
        "There was damage there but the worst of the winds and waves and storm surge seemed to be about an hour east.",
        "Then, the levees broke leaving huge parts of New Orleans under water.",

        "But if you got off the beaten track, you know, the kind of standard tourist experience, and if you went into some of the more residential areas, like Gentilly, or the Lower Ninth Ward, or the Seventh Ward, Lake View, some of those places really have not changed very much in the last four years.",
        "What's the Lower Ninth Ward look like today?",
        "Of course, this was a part of the city that you described in your book, scenes of some horrific flooding at the time.",
        "Well, for a long time after the disaster, the Lower Ninth Ward looked like just kind of a junkyard, as far as you could see.",
        "I mean, every kind of rubble, trucks upside down.",
        "After that, they spent a lot of time cleaning out the debris, and there was a period during which it looked just almost like a park gone to feed, sort of.",
        "You'd see evidence of old houses there, like a set of cement steps leading to nothing, or an old, you know, iron gate left, you know, but everything else gone.",
        "In the past year or so, maybe year and a half, there's been a lot of new construction in the Lower Ninth Ward particularly because of Brad Pitt's project that he spearheaded down there called Make It Right.",
        "And they have been building brand-new houses designed by architects that will be, you know, raised above the flood levels and stuff like that.",
        "And some of them are quite beautiful.",

        "An awful lot of people who were in the Lower Ninth Ward and other neighborhoods like that, which is to say working-class or poor neighborhoods, of course, had to leave New Orleans and ended up in places like Houston or Atlanta or wherever it might be.",
        "But because they didn't have, in many cases, insurance with which to rebuild their houses, and didn't have a lot of, let's say, financial reserves, they had to make lives for themselves, you know, in the places to which they evacuated."

        "And so I think the real fear is that he transfers either the bomb itself or the technology or the nuclear material to another country or to a non-state actor like a terrorist.",
        "And President Bush made that clear straight after the North Korean presumed test, when he put out a new red line saying that it would be the transfer of nuclear material - or transfer of the bomb - which would really bring tough consequences onto North Korea.",
        "How difficult would it be to get a weapon out of North Korea; that is, for the North Korean government to move a weapon somewhere, to sell one?",
        "Well, moving nuclear material, moving nuclear technology, moving even a weapon, isn't impossible.",
        "The North Koreans have a long trade, for instance, in missile parts and in actual missiles, in shipping them around the world.",
        "It's possible they could use those same techniques to try and move nuclear material.",
        "We have see a kind of tightening of the noose around North Korea, an attempt to intercept more and more ships and other types of transport coming out of the country.",
        "And I think we're likely to see that intensified, partly precisely because of the fear that any kind of nuclear technology could be allowed to seep out through some of these known existing channels that North Koreans have.",
        "You know, think about it from the standpoint, though, of someone who might want to buy this weapon.",
        "Here you've got a bomb test which in many people's view would indicate that the bomb doesn't work and earlier missile tests which would demonstrate that the missiles don't work.",
        "Who would want to buy anything from the North Koreans?",
        "They may not want to buy necessarily a bomb itself and the North Koreans may not sell a complete bomb, because they may not have one that works yet, but there is still a lot of technology and material which can be very useful.",
        "For instance, you don't necessarily need an actual bomb.",
        "You could try and get hold of the nuclear fuel and nuclear material and in turn try and make your own much simpler bomb.",
        "Or another possibility is you get out some of the advanced technology or designs which allow you to move your own nuclear program much further forward.",
        "Also, yes, the North Korean missile test in July didn't work, but they do have existing missiles which have been exported to other countries and do work.",
        "You know, last night I heard NPR news analyst Dan Schorr use a term I'd not heard before, the post-proliferation era.",
        "Is that where we are now and what would it mean?",
        "I think it's fair to say that we're at a - potentially at a tipping point at which we could move into a new era of many more nuclear states.",
        "Now, actually, if you look at the moment, there are only really two key countries which are being focused on: Iran and North Korea.",
        "Iran has a program which it says is peaceful but people believe is for the bomb.",
        "North Korea is attempting to carry out tests.",
        "Now, the problem is that those two countries are in very unstable regions - the Middle East and East Asia - in which neighbors may well seek to follow them towards the bomb if those two countries do indeed successfully get the bomb.",
        "And so the fear is that these two countries could start kind of cascades of proliferation and that you could see in the Middle East, for instance, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt, reconsider whether or not they need the bomb."

        "It was the first time in three years that the five men had been seen in public and they were in court for an arraignment to answer the terrorism charges against them.",
        "But the men did their best to disrupt the proceedings.",
        "They refused to answer the judge's questions, wouldn't listen to the hearing in Arabic on headphones.",
        "NPR's Dina Temple-Raston was in the courtroom yesterday, and she joins us from Guantanamo with the latest.",
        "Dina, can you tell us more about what was going on in the courtroom yesterday?",
        "Well, it didn't take long to figure out what the defense strategy was.",
        "The chief prosecutor, Brigadier General Mark Martins, was about halfway through his first sentence when one of the defense attorneys stood up and immediately asked the judge to consider a motion that basically said the entire case should be thrown out.",
        "And then it just got worse.",
        "One of the defendants, Ramzi Binalshibh, who allegedly was one of the plot's money men, he got up and started laying out a prayer rug and chanting.",
        "And then another defendant, a man named Walid bin Attash, was actually tied to a chair because apparently he had a scuffle with guards.",
        "And he started complaining that he was in pain because he was restrained.",
        "And then Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the sort of marquee name in all of this, the self-described mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, he was in the front of the room basically giving the other four men all these subtle cues to sort of direct their misbehavior.",
        "I mean, it was really clear that this was at least part of their defense strategy, that they basically wanted to make the military commissions trial as chaotic as possible.",
        "Now, yesterday was just an arraignment as I understand, but they didn't enter pleas.",
        "They deferred their pleas.",
        "What are the implications of that?",
        "Well, by deferring their pleas is meant to draw out the process a little bit.",
        "I mean, everybody is coming back in June to deal with a bunch of motions that were filed.",
        "And one of them makes the argument that the proceedings weren't brought to court properly.",
        "Another is about attorney-client privilege because all the mail in the detention center is opened, even if it's mailed to detainees from their lawyers.",
        "So, that needs a ruling.",
        "I mean, the point here is that we shouldn't expect any trial to happen any time soon.",
        "I mean, usually when you have an arraignment, you sort of expect witnesses to come to the dock right away, and that's just not going to happen.",
        "The government said they could go to trial as early as this August, but the defense has said they want at least another year to prepare.",
        "So, this arraignment really only marks the beginning of something that's going to be a very long process."
