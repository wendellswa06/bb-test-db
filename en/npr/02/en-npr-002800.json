        "President Obama laid a wreath at Ground Zero in New York today to honor the men and women who died on 9/11.",
        "The White House made every effort to make this a somber, quiet visit, and while a crowd near the site of the World Trade Center waved flags and some signs read, Obama one, Osama zero, it was a very different scene last Sunday night after the president's dramatic announcement when raucous crowds of mostly young people gathered in downtown New York and outside the White House to chant USA, USA and sing the national anthem.",

        "That's right, Neal.",

        "A distinction, but is that a distinction without a real difference?",
        "I think it's an important distinction to make.",
        "I'm disturbed by the idea of celebrating a death.",
        "It's just smacks a little too much of the lynch mob there, you know?",
        "I think it's unseemly sounding, but we all appreciate justice.",
        "We haven't had justice since 9/11.",
        "There was always - no matter whether Osama bin Laden was still an important operational figure or not, he obviously had a lot of psychic weight on us that I certainly felt every time I went through an airport checkpoint and any place where there's an enhanced security going on.",
        "I think it was a great weight lifted off of people, so I don't begrudge them, their sentiments out there in celebrating some semblance of justice here.",
        "One of my readers sent me an old Clarence Darrow quote, often wrongly attributed to Mark Twain, where he said I have never wished a man dead, but I have read many an obituary with great satisfaction.",
        "I think this was an obituary that many of us read with great satisfaction.",

        "I didn't have space to mention it my column, but my wife and a house guest agreed with him.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "They were quite shocked and dismayed that this was going on, and I might add on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED yesterday or the day before, there was a nice piece interviewing college students, others who were disturbed by this display.",
        "However, I stand my ground and feel that there are certain times when one has to observe a sense of justice that has been meted out.",
        "There are some who would say that Osama bin Laden didn't suffer enough considering all the suffering that he caused to others.",
        "So there's a great - everybody's got a different view of justice, but I think we must have some sense of it in order for us to carry on and have some optimism about the future.",
        "Yet there is an aspect of American triumphalism that can sometimes get in the way.",
        "I remember early in the invasion of Iraq, when U.S.",
        "forces cleared out an Iraqi port city, Faw, and raised the American flag.",
        "This is something the Americans have done because of the iconic scene at Iwo Jima in 1945.",
        "That's right.",
        "And so this is something that means a great deal to us.",
        "It also meant a great deal to the Iraqis who said, wait a minute, why are you raising the American flag?",
        "This is Iraq.",
        "That's right, and one key difference, I would say, between that display and Osama bin Laden, is Osama bin Laden attacked us on our soil and killed thousands of people, mostly civilians.",
        "This is something that anywhere on the planet, people recognize a certain sovereignty and safety, security that one should be allowed in one's own country.",
        "So it's certainly, to my - mine -more justifiably offensive to people to raise a flag in bare land when you are already, you know, claiming some kind of ownership to it, it does sense - you know, send a sense of excessive triumphalism."

        "This really reminded me of the night Barack Obama was elected, where you saw this great, surprising outpouring of people on the streets.",

        "You know, I think this - there is an important kind of symbolism that goes on, here.",
        "So those students - some of whom were students of my wife, who teaches at George Washington University, very close to the White House - I can understand their sense of victory because, you know, this is their generation.",

        "Today, you had President Obama after a victory, very somberly, quietly, respectfully laying a wreath at the same scene.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I think President Obama certainly has learned from President Bush' experience that premature triumphalism is the worst kind of all, that you - when you go out and even are perceived as declaring victory, perceived as saying mission accomplished, then you'd better be sure your mission is really accomplished.",
        "They ginned up - they being Washington, Congress, the White House - ginned up a lot of actions - the Patriot Act, the invasion of Afghanistan, the invasion of Iraq - off of the emotions and the need to get back at the people who caused 9/11.",
