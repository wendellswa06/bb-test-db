        "But the America we should want to be should temper and deflect any sense of joy in bin Laden's having been put to death - specifically, by refraining from public celebrations, real or virtual, of what was, after all, the killing of a human being.",
        "Are we, as Americans, people who publicly present ourselves as delighting in a death?",
        "Are we not, if so, much more akin than we have suspected to those who were cheering in the streets after 9/11?",

        "And I respect that.",
        "I would say, though, that we were all affected by 9/11.",
        "I was affected by it.",
        "I had at least one of my Tribune Company colleagues died up there in the Twin Towers, another personal friend died in the plane crash into the Pentagon.",
        "And even if I didn't know anybody personally in there, it certainly changed the mood of our country.",
        "It affected all of us in many ways.",

        "Maybe we were -obviously, the irrational exuberance of the '90s was excessive, no question about it.",
        "But 9/11 also has had a profound impact on all of us.",
        "So my question would be: Where do you draw the line?",

        "The memory of 9/11 is especially personal and painful for my generation, those who were in elementary and junior high school at the time.",
        "This is not the result of choice, but chance, a peculiar function of our age when we collided with history.",
        "For my generation, 9/11 is not a tragic point of common reference.",
        "It's the shared crucible that defined us and made so many of us into the adults that we have become."

        "Hi, Neal, well, we're talking about Lisa Murkowski's defeat, and this is perhaps the most fascinating midterm election I can remember, and yet the Lisa Murkowski defeat is something I did not see coming at all.",
        "Neither did she.",
        "Well, it--certainly the Home secretary changed his mind.",
        "Whether or not the prime minister changed his mind is a little bit more difficult to determine, but if he did, it may have been on the calculation that by very narrowly losing the vote, he could have blamed it on the opposition.",
        "And unfortunately, today, having lost by a majority of 31, even that position is not tenable.",
        "He can hardly blame it on the opposition when 49 members of his own party voted against him.",
        "He even called back a couple of his Cabinet members, who were on overseas visits--of course, they're members of Parliament as well--to get their votes, and what he anticipated would be a very close vote.",
        "As you noted, it wasn't close, as it turned out, and at this point, are people questioning--I mean, Blair over the past eight years or so--this is the first time he's gotten something this big this wrong.",
        "It is quite remarkable, and it is certainly a very significant date.",
        "The leader of the opposition has already been calling for his resignation, and some of his own members--not necessarily for the first time, but they certainly are repeating their calls for his resignation.",
        "Now I think it's far too early to start talking about that kind of situation at the moment, but certainly, we know that the prime minister is not going to stand as leader of the party after--leading up to the next election, and there is now a--in a sense, there's a beginning of the real campaign for the replacement of Blair as leader of the Labor Party and prime minister.",
        "This also comes after, I guess, the most recent scandal, the forced resignation of David Blunkett, who came back to the prime minister's Cabinet after a period of in exile, so to speak, and then had to leave shortly thereafter.",
        "Is there a sense that Blair's lost his touch?",
        "I think that may well be a growing perception.",
        "Certainly, many people from the outside thought that the decision on Blunkett and backing him when it was quite clear he was going to lose his position--he would have to lose his position--was a misjudgment, and certainly, again, overnight, the attitude that the prime minister taken--had he known surely, had he known that there was going to be this many people voting against it, he wouldn't possibly have hung himself out to dry like this, and it does look like misjudgment on two occasions within a week, and that will resonate through the party.",
        "And losing this vote today by such a decisive margin, is that going to be taken as, I guess, the latest sign of evidence that a strong element of Prime Minister Blair's own party, despite the fact that he's led them to victory--thumping victories in two straight elections--despite that fact, they are still very angry with him over Iraq.",
        "I think that possibly resonates somewhere in the background.",
        "But I think this was--these were more straightforward issues.",
        "These were issues that although it appeared that there was support in the country for these issues, the parliamentarians were very, very reluctant to cede away so much of what--they were described as very hard-won rights, and I think that was the pre-eminent issue.",
        "I think Iraq is still there and it will rankle them--it will possibly and probably grow as the end of Blair's prime ministership comes in sight, but these were very straightforward issues, I think, about legal rights and democracy.",
        "And in the end, as you noted, the Parliament did vote to make it possible to hold prisoners without charge for 28 days, double the time that they now have."
