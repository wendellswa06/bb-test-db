        "That's correct.",
        "And even that clearly is a very long time in terms of the traditions--the normal legal traditions in this country, which have already been extended up to 14 days, but I think it's quite significant to note that parliamentarians voted against this measure, even in the knowledge that the--all the senior police chiefs have been calling for support for it.",

        "On the day after announcing his bid for the presidency, Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio dropped his plans to introduce an amendment, making any nuclear agreement contingent on Iran recognizing Israel's right to exist.",
        "Rubio said he recognized such a measure could complicate passing a congressional review of a nuclear deal.",
        "Ultimately, the alternative is not to do anything.",
        "And that would play right into the hands of what the administration's asking for Congress to do, which is to have no role whatsoever.",
        "The White House had repeatedly warned President Obama would veto the bill that Rubio had hoped to amend.",
        "It made clear certain elements in the bill were unacceptable, including a provision requiring a periodic presidential certification that Iran had not been involved in terrorist attacks against Americans.",
        "White House officials also objected to another provision, calling for a 60-day period for Congress to debate and vote on a final nuclear agreement, during which time no sanctions could be lifted.",
        "White House press secretary Josh Earnest said before yesterday's vote that he was aware efforts were being made to drop these provisions.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
