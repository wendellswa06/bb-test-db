        "So while, you know, I would it would not be plausible for me to say that these we should dismiss, you know, these numbers, I do think the real number is probably a little tighter than this, and certainly it is in the polling that we're seeing at the district-by-district level.",
        "And Ken, the number that we just heard mentioned by Alex Vogel, the race in Nevada within the margin of error, and that is that's a stunning result.",
        "Well, it is stunning because from the beginning, or at least since the primary, all the Democrats said that we got the Republican we wanted to run against, Sharron Angle, backed by the Tea Party, made some controversial statements on some positions and things like that.",
        "But the fact that she's still dead even with Harry Reid, with 62 days to go before Election Day, is not good side - good news for the Democratic Party, no.",
        "One of the arguments I've made to some of my Democratic friends about the Angle/Reid contest is if she's only a point or two down, admitting that she started out as a not-perfect candidate, she only has upside, right?",
        "So if she improves a little bit as a candidate, and she's basically even with Harry Reid, well, then, he's got a problem.",
        "But this is a case where, I mean, first of all, if we'd had one of the other ones, he'd probably be down.",
