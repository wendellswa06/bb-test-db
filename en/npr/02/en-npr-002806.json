        "So it's true, that is discussed a lot more than it certainly was four or eight years ago.",
        "Anna, you would think that Democrats would love to run against somebody they could say this person doesn't think Social Security or Medicare is constitutional.",
        "Right.",
        "But let me go back to the issue of using this word.",
        "It is code word.",
        "It's sort of far-right code word.",
        "I think it has much more resonance among primary voters and activists.",
        "I think when people start talking about the Constitution in this manner, which is, you know, not really about the Constitution, in my view, I don't think your average voter really sort of understands what it is they're talking about exactly because, again, it's sort of code.",
        "And you can - even if you have a Republican challenger who himself or herself hasn't said I want to privatize Social Security, if they are supporters of, you know, Paul Ryan's plan, or if they are getting money from John Boehner's PAC, if any way they're associated with the leadership of the Republican leadership of the House, then they in essence support privatization of Social Security and Medicare.",
        "And it is a very, very strong attack, especially in the midterm when you a disproportionately older electorate.",
        "An issue in the Senate race in Pennsylvania, as well, where the Club for Growth candidate on the Republican side has had some - being attacked on that question by the Democrat, Joe Sestak.",
        "So let's here's an email that we have from Florida, and Scott(ph) in Orlando: Please ask your guests what effects Charlie Crist courting Democrats will have on the Senate race and what effects will Bud Childs dropping out of the governor's race and throwing his support to Alex Sink, the Democrat?",
        "We neglected to get to that earlier, Ken, but that's the political news out of the state of Florida.",
        "Well, the latter staff, I mean, Bud Childs is the son of Laughton Childs, the late governor, the last Democrat elected governor of Florida.",
        "He was only polling about four or five percent.",
        "And if anything, he was going to be a spoiler for Alex Sink, the state CFO who was a Democratic nominee for the governorship."

        "So he dropped out basically because he didn't want to elect Rick Scott as governor.",
        "So there's more unity on the Democratic side, in the gubernatorial race, at least, in Florida than there is in the Senate race.",
        "The Senate race is another story altogether because Kendrick Meek is the African-American congressman from Miami who is the Democratic nominee.",
        "If Charlie Crist can pull Democratic votes away from Kendrick Meek rather than split the Republican Party, which is what originally what we thought, if anything - if nothing else, it could send Marco Rubio to the Senate.",
        "Marco Rubio, of course, the Republican, and again, Tea Party favorite.",
        "Tea Party favorite before there was a Tea Party.",
        "Before there was a Tea Party.",
        "And I think Governor Crist might want to call Arlen Specter and ask him how well it works out when you try and, you know, switch around, court some new friends.",
        "I mean, I think he's going to have a really hard time suddenly convincing everybody that George Bush's best friend in Texas is now one of the Democrats.",
        "And, you know, you shouldn't vote for Meek, who's been with him for years, and instead, he should come over with me.",
        "I actually think all this intensity is, you know, do nothing but help Rubio at the end.",
        "And Anna Greenberg, if Crist does manage to eke out a victory, it's going to be interesting to see which party he decides to caucus with.",
        "I mean, all the scuttlebutt is that he's going to, you know, caucus with the Democrats, but who really knows.",
        "Maybe he'll, you know, sort of do a Joe Lieberman and have his vote be that kind crucial vote that everyone's sort of trying to get.",
        "In any case, let's ask a broader question.",
        "At this point, do you think there is enough swing to the Republicans for the Republicans to take over the House of Representatives, Anna?",
        "I'm not going to make any predictions either way."

        "Yeah, look, I think that simply the number of House seats that are in play, if this is a wave election, which obviously the Gallup numbers and other things indicate and if you look at a lot of the race-by-race data, I think the House is definitely in play.",
        "I think the real question now, in light of the generic numbers that have come out, is whether the Senate is actually in play or not.",
        "I, for one, have been saying for a long time it wasn't.",
        "That that kind of a pick-up was just, you know, impossible.",

        "And so there are some people who are not ready for primetime running in these general elections where you don't have the benefit of the grassroots playing such a large role as you see in a primary election, for example.",
        "One of the things that happens is when you've got a wave that's going your way, suddenly you were able to recruit candidates in every race, five or six deep, and you will get some that are not ready for primetime.",
