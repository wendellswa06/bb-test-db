        "Well, we knew it was pretty nasty.",
        "The plane smelled bad, but, you know, you really weren't that concerned about it at the time.",
        "Until later on, you know, after you retire and these health issues start popping up.",
        "Now lots of the folks who flew C-123s have health problems that the VA concedes have been associated with Agent Orange - diseases like prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma or diabetes.",
        "But it's hard to show cause and effect in a lot of these cases.",
        "Because of that, vets who were in Vietnam and have health problems that could be associated with Agent Orange can get benefits based on just the possibility they were exposed.",
        "The VA offers disability compensation and money for survivors of the deceased.",

        "It seemed to us to be a total no-brainer that there was exposure possible.",
        "Since 2011, a growing group of reservists and their families have been calling for the VA to recognize C-123 vets.",
        "A study out in January commissioned by the VA confirms that many reservists were likely exposed.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Which is the most I've directed any play.",
        "But, you know what, I can't every production has felt like a new production.",
        "And with this play, it is really based on the energy and the physicality of the two stars, Viola Davis and Denzel Washington.",

        "It is the most diverse audience on Broadway.",
        "And to sit in there and watch them rub up against each other and laugh and cry, and talk out loud together is something special happening with this production, and with this cast and with Denzel.",

        "Troy Maxson is almost like playing Othello, except that it's an African-American presence that those in African-American community, we know these people.",
        "But August had a way of turning the ordinary man into art, ordinary language into art.",
        "And so there's a musicality to it.",
        "And you have people like Stephen McKinley Henderson who has been doing this for 40, 45 years - a major talent.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Oh, he opens his mouth and the words come out like butter -and Russell Hornsby, Chris Chalk, Mykelti Williamson.",

        "The words, in August Wilson, they're incredibly important.",
        "And you need to make sure, as a director, that - for example, the great speech that Viola Davis gives in - that we can hear all of that.",
        "The audience is so responsive to those stars, and they seem to interfere at times.",
        "They seemed to cover the - parts of the play with laughter and with applause, and it's just makes it hard to hear.",

        "What better, to get too much response than too little?",
        "Absolutely.",
