        "Where many of these plays debuted.",
        "Yes.",
        "What I've discovered is that in working with six different Troy Maxsons, that usually the play is built around the personality and the physicality and the approach to truth exhibited by that particular person who's playing Troy.",
        "And what Denzel brings to it is a youthful, energetic physicality to it.",
        "And it's not hard to imagine him hitting 45 homeruns or whatever, you know?",
        "He's closer to that athlete that he was.",
        "We're going to hear now about a picturesque Swedish island in the Baltic Sea - Gotland.",
        "For military experts, Gotland is an essential strategic spot.",
        "NPR's Ari Shapiro explains this island is at the center of a complex web of alliances in Europe.",
        "When I was in Sweden I didn't go looking for a story about Gotland.",
        "But the place just kept coming up in interview after interview.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #1: An island called Gotland.",
        "And he also has a knack for understanding what the truth is.",
        "So he's not trying to overly theatricalize or overly emote.",
        "He's trying to find the honesty in it.",
        "And what that does, it forces Viola to be as honest as she can.",
        "So it really feels like folks are looking at a real slice of life, and it's almost - many people have said to me leaving the theater, like, I haven't experienced that on Broadway in five or six years.",
        "It just feels raw, and the actors are looking in each other eyes and they're just letting the words come and, you know, it's different, slightly different every night.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "His character played in - well, he was in prison for a long time, then played in the Negro leagues, and then has been lifting garbage cans for a long time.",
        "Denzel Washington walks, in that play, like a man whose knees hurt.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, you know, the one thing about Denzel is that he was a garbage man for, like, a year.",
        "I didn't know that.",
        "Yes.",
        "So he's actually experienced that life, and folks find that hard to believe.",
        "When he was younger, though, he worked for a little while as a garbage man."

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, hopefully, we can do something about that.",

        "He was approached about doing the film.",
        "Scott Rudin, who is an amazing film producer - he is also producing the Broadway show - and he asked Denzel to do a film of \"\"Fences.\"\" And because it was one of the last things that - August did a rewrite of \"\"Fences,\"\" the screenplay, in those last two three months of his life.",
        "So Denzel said he was interested in the film, but he wanted to do the play first.",
        "He had to get inside the skin of the character on stage, you know.",
        "And that's where you really discover characters.",
        "So I think that you will see, hopefully, all 10 of these - all 10 of his plays on film.",
        "Janice, I wanted to ask you, what do your students today make of this play, which is set in the '50s, the '60s and '70s?",
        "They absolutely love it.",
        "It ignites - Wilson ignites such a spark in the students because the issues are all still relevant.",
        "All of them have parental conflict, so they can get, you know, they can identify with Cory and his struggles with his father.",
        "Many of them have, you know - it's just - it touches on every level.",
        "And they just adore the play.",
        "I'm coming to see it July 10th.",
        "Oh, wow, the last weekend."

        "And then we had the privilege of going to the St. Louis Black Repertory to see it performed, and it was wonderful and awesome.",
