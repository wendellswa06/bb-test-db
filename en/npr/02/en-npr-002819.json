        "The song had long associations with the LGBT community as an anthem, but in my newfound activism and in my new sort of awareness around the different struggles the community faced, particularly the AIDS crisis, I've heard the song with new ears, and I heard its urgency through that lens.",

        "But when journalist Zahra Hankir was working in the region during the Arab Spring, she followed reporters who, like her, were women from the Middle East.",
        "It was a little bit selfish in a way because I wondered what these women were experiencing on the field, what they were feeling about what they were seeing, considering that they were from those actual countries.",
        "And also I felt that they had a unique set of challenges that they had to contend with.",

        "Some of these women, particularly the women from Yemen and Egypt and Syria, they faced situations where they had to at first contend with the fact that their families were opposed to the careers that they were choosing for them.",
        "So Eman Helal, for example, the Egyptian photojournalist, her family did not want her to be a journalist at all because she would have to navigate spaces that were male-dominated, that it was expected of the woman to not be in those spaces, to be at home."

        "She ended up being a fixer for international media, but much of her work initially was just her going to the streets taking photographs, moving from place to place with a male chaperone who would not be her relative.",
        "That was a risk in and of itself, and then having to contend with the fact that her family was opposed to that work.",
        "So even though, as women in these countries where women have been historically, if not presently, subjugated, they face all these challenges, at the same time, their gender gives them unique access to people.",
        "I completely agree with that.",
        "And I actually love and admire that about the women, in that they faced their challenges, but they decided they were going to overcome them in their own unique ways.",
        "Eman Helal, I go back to her essay a lot because she decided to embark upon a project about sexual harassment that Egyptian women were facing during the revolution and then in the aftermath.",
        "And that was in part because she experienced sexual harassment herself, so she decided she wanted to raise awareness on this subject.",
        "I was also struck by the essay from Hwaida Saad, who explained how she developed all these sources, really, these men who became fighters in Syria.",
        "And they would share with her details of their life that it becomes clear it's not even - you don't even know if they're sharing those with their own friends and family.",
        "Amira Al-Sharif, again, wrote this in her essay - Western photographers tend to be drawn to the carnage, but I have continued to seek out the other part of Yemen that is full of life, love and hope.",
        "I mean, I guess it's unfair to say that that's a quality that is exclusive to women.",
        "But have you found that that is a tendency in the coverage, to find those more personal stories, especially in war?",

        "When you've been through something that the character you're playing has been through also, you can kind of start to understand them.",
        "And I can say that there's something that all Southern women have in common, and that is that they all have a survival or survivor instinct, that no matter what happens or what they go through, good or bad, they know they're going to get through it, very tough, thick-skinned, and not afraid to go through the fire for what they need and what they love.",
        "You wrote this book, and it takes you all the way from your childhood to shortly after you win your Emmy, which I see up there, and yet there's still so much of your life that hasn't even happened yet and changes that have happened even since the book came to print.",
