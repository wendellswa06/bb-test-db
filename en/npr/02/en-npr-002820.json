        "And this has been happening for several reasons.",
        "First, most things are cheaper for companies doing business in Mexico, compared with the U.S.",
        "And there's another lure - the Mexican government recently introduced tax incentives for new businesses opening up along the border with the U.S.",
        "The cost of living is a lot lower, as well.",
        "And that means American companies can pay their workers in Mexico a whole lot less.",

        "That's according to data from Glassdoor.",
        "The second reason American companies are coming south of the border - there's a shortage of qualified high-tech workers in the U.S.",
        "In 2017, there were about 500,000 job openings in this industry and only about 60,000 computer science college graduates.",

        "Companies have to look for foreign workers to bring to the U.S.",

        "And in many ways, that's also part of the story of the region because displacement and forced exile is part of that.",
