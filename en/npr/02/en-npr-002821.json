        "All of the children are going home.",
        "Even the under-aged, pregnant mothers and the under-aged pregnant teens and the under-aged mothers are all going home.",
        "That's not to say they're necessarily going to stay home.",
        "I think that what's going to happen now is child protective services will proceed as it usually does, bringing individual charges in individual cases and so it's not guaranteed that just because these temporary orders were vacated that new orders won't be entered in.",
        "And all of the parents also had to agree to attend parenting classes.",
        "Right, I mean that's standard, that's standard operating procedure.",
        "I mean given the group's feelings about the state, I just wonder how successful parenting classes might be.",
        "Not that the mothers and fathers won't attend, not that they won't be respectful, but frankly they view outsiders as gentiles, as Babylonians.",
        "I expect them to be very distrustful of what they're going to be taught.",
        "I'm not sure what the state of Texas hopes to achieve with that order.",
        "And I understand that yesterday an elder from the FLDS Church said that in the future the Church would not condone unions involving minors.",
        "Right and that's a - I think that's a change so that's an announcement that will probably be welcomed by the state.",
        "FLDS, although it was not unheard of, the practice of marrying under-aged teens to older men really got started with Warren Jeffs' father, Rulon Jeffs in Ernest.",
        "Not that it never happened before, yes it did.",
        "But Rulon Jeffs, and then Warren Jeffs kind of took that practice up a notch and I don't think many members of the FLDS will feel like this is a blow against them if they go back to having plural marriages between older, young women and older men.",
        "And the - they said that without acknowledging that such unions had happened in the past or at least not openly acknowledging.",
        "Well he did say let's not blame the many for the mistakes of a few which I would say is a tacit acknowledgment of the - mistakes were made as you might say.",
        "Will child protective services still have access to see these children to make sure they are OK?",
        "Yes, they have access from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM.",
        "There's no limit on the access and I expect child protective services are going to be very involved back at the ranch.",
        "One lawyer for one young woman, the daughter of Warren Jeffs asks that orders be entered for her protection.",
        "There were hints that she might have been sexually abused so this is - I mean we are far.",
        "All of the children are going back today.",
        "This is - we are still very much in the middle of this process.",
        "Wade Goodwyn, thanks very much, appreciate it."
