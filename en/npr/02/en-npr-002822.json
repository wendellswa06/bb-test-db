        "Absolutely - Either that, or - you know, it just feels like when they got the call from the 16-year-old girl, I believe it was.",
        "It was very shortly after that, that these children were taken from their parents.",
        "I understand they're acting in the best interest of the children, but I think it may have really damaged those kids.",

        "And that the boys, they argued, were being groomed to be perpetrators, and that was their logic.",
        "I think you've stated that well, and the problem from the point of view of going forward - if I can kind of divide it into two.",
        "There was just a practical problem of biting off more than they could chew.",

        "Well, not quite.",

        "What the court said was that there wasn't an immediate danger, justifying the removal of the children.",

        "And that's the - everybody has to continue to co-operate with Child Protective Services and the criminal investigation, as well, again provide identity information when they come and pick up the children and provide access, as I understand it for both medical and psychological examinations, during the day?",
        "If a department request there would be interviews of the child, visits to the home, medical, psychological or psychiatric examinations.",
        "In addition the court ordered that any adults who live in the household with the child have to be identified, and that children cannot be taken out of the state of Texas.",
        "And, in fact if they're going to travel more than 100 miles from their designated residence that they have to give 48 hours notice.",
