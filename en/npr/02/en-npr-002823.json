        "Neal...",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Neal, could I comment, just to put one thing in context, is that Texas actually has a very low rate of intervention in homes compared to other states.",
        "We have over six million children in the state of Texas and only remove, at this point, roughly 15,000 a year, less than one quarter of one percent.",
        "So I just want to point out that CPS is working with a very small number of kids and is often caught in this public whiplash between if you don't intervene and children are seriously hurt, you're blamed, if you do intervene and people's sense of family integrity is offended, you're blamed, and it's very difficult job to draw that line.",
        "But I do want to point out that statistically Texas has a very low rate of intervention.",
        "Well, I think one of the questions that people have, like our last caller, was the extremity of this - of this action, removing all of the kids.",
        "Could not the Child Protective Services have gone for some order pretty much like the one they have now, where they could come in and talk to the kids at the FLDS ranch?",
        "Well, the problem with the order that they have now in terms of an investigation, is that it's very difficult to get children to disclose any sort of information about the family, if they're living with the family.",
        "And indeed, in this case, where you had these young pregnant women, or girls, really, and you've taken them out of the compound and now you've put them back, they won't have any sense that they can make disclosures and expect the state to provide protection.",
        "So I actually think it's going to be very difficult for CPS to get any information from children under these circumstances.",
        "Again, we're talking with Scott McCown, a retired state district judge in Texas who presided over Child Protective Services cases, and currently he's the director for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, and he's joining us from the studio in Austin, Texas.",
        "If you'd like to join the conversation 800-989-8255, email us talk@npr.org, and this is Talk of the Nation coming to you from NPR News.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller in.",

        "I've been a teacher for about 16 years, and I've been just amazed at the number of students that I've had who should have had the state intervene because of the emotional abuse that they've suffered, the neglect that they've suffered, but the state's never done anything.",
        "And it seems to me that these FLDS folks in Texas have been approached because they are so far out of the norm of society.",
        "My question is, had Texas been successful, or if they are ultimately successful, what ramifications might that mean for other groups in the future who are somewhat out of the norm?",
        "Say Muslim groups, just because they're not Christian, or other groups, just because they're not what we think is normal?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It is a pretty good question.",
        "And I just want to point out, though, that I think if this compound had been simply a polygamous compound, the state wouldn't have acted.",
        "One thing people have asked is, well, does CPS go into homes where there are underage girls and remove those girls when they're pregnant, and they point to a large teenage pregnancy rate and say no. Well, in fact, if they're pregnant by their caregiver, if their parents had been complicit in their pregnancy, then the answer is yes.",
        "I mean, there's lots of girls in CPS custody who were victims of incest or have parents that were complicit in failing to protect them, and CPS removes them.",
        "So the trigger event here for CPS was the protection of the girls, not the polygamy.",
        "And I think it goes back to something that the reporter said at the top of the hour when he was talking about Warren Jeffs, the prophet of this particular group, and his father, and the spokesperson saying you don't punish the many for the mistakes of the few.",
        "But the problem here was that it was the leadership that had adopted this policy and could say to a member of this particular group, your 14-year-old daughter is going to marry this older man, and make that happen.",
        "And in fact, that's why Warren Jeffs is in a Utah penitentiary today.",
        "And so the idea was that the girls were all at risk because the leadership in the sect itself had this tenet.",
        "It was not simply about the polygamy.",
        "So, again, even though you're saying polygamy is a felony in the state of Texas, they're not being investigated for that?",
        "Well, I don't know what they're being investigated for at the present time, because the criminal investigation is proceeding on a separate track and isn't public.",
        "But generally, I can't recall any polygamy prosecutions.",
        "And if you look at Utah and Arizona, where you have large polygamous communities, you have the same issue, that what the authorities - the public authorities there try to do is to protect the teenage girls.",
        "They don't try to target the polygamy.",
        "So as we look ahead to the other groups that might have been involved in terms of the question we had from the caller a minute ago, you don't think that this is going to set a precedent?",
        "No, because, again, the issue was protecting the girls.",
        "Scott McCown, thanks very much.",
        "I appreciate your time today.",
        "Thank you."

        "Mr. Kan will be your country's fifth prime minister in four years.",
        "Why is it such a tough job to keep?",
        "Well, I personally think that the prime minister should stay longer, and I hope that this will be the case this time.",
        "And, of course, it's very important to know other leaders well and for the people in the world to know the Japanese prime minister.",
        "But because of political situations, the last time when Hatoya-san(ph) came, it was a change of party.",
        "This time Hatoya-san thought that he was not able to fulfill his commitments and he thought that he should resign and give to other people.",
        "The last time we were here, we talked about American military bases in Japan and this seems to be the fulcrum of some of the problems the prime minister had.",
        "Many Japanese want to see some of those bases closed.",
        "The prime minister promised during the campaign he would remove an American base on the island of Okinawa, he didn't.",
        "There was public anger over the issue and one of the things that led to the resignation.",
        "What do you expect from Mr. Kan on this issue?",
        "First of all, Japanese feel that U.S.",
        "presence in Asia Pacific is important and indispensable.",
        "That is point one.",
        "Point two is that there's a problem in Okinawa because 75 percent of U.S.",
