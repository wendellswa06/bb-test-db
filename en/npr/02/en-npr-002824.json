        "Now, we've heard from demonstrators from time to time, but today, we wanted to hear from someone in an official capacity to see how this is all being navigated, so we've called on Alvin Yeung.",

        "It's clear that the announcement that this extradition bill is dead or has been tabled is not sufficient.",

        "But then this government has been refusing to set up a commission to look into that.",
        "And more importantly, of course, is a democratic system.",
        "And, as I mentioned, the difference between you and the majority of protesters, frankly, is that you are a lawmaker, and there have been clashes with the police.",

        "But over countless numbers of peaceful protests, it is understandable that some of the protesters would escalate their actions because the government has been turning a blind eye to our demands.",
        "One of the rare qualities and unique qualities of this protesters is whenever we make something that might not be well accepted by the public, they would have the capacity and capability to self-reflect on what they did and apologize publicly.",

        "Our demands are highly sensible.",

        "As to strategy, Hong Kong people has been learning from Bruce Lee, the cultural master, that we have to be water.",
        "So whenever we can, we would show our force, show our power and determination.",

        "Do you have a sense of how you would respond if China decides to use force to control these protests?",
        "Of course, we share the same fear.",
        "In Hong Kong, people has been under threat by Beijing that they would use force, be it the army or the armed police.",
        "But they are the same nature.",
        "Of course, Hong Kong people would suffer if they dared to deploy troops to Hong Kong.",
        "But also, that would declare the end of one country, two systems.",
        "They will also certify the death of this international financial center.",
        "I would say not only Hong Kong people would suffer but also Beijing will suffer.",
        "Leadership of Beijing, their personal investments, will also suffer.",
        "I can only say is we are trying everything we can to avoid bloodshed, and we wish they would never adopt that strategy.",
        "And finally, before we let you go, I want to note that there are people in Hong Kong who are pro-government or pro-regime as it currently exists - that they say that they're happy with the way the chief executive's running Hong Kong.",
        "There was even a rally Saturday in response to the anti-government protesters.",
        "Are you engaging with this group of people in some way?",
        "What kind of dialogue are you having with them?",
        "What do they say to you, and what do you say to them?",
        "Hong Kong is a free and liberal society.",
        "Anybody can take their political stance freely.",
        "But our message to those people who are standing with the government is, look - police brutality is something beyond doubt.",
        "Is that something that these people would support as well?",
        "These are all reasonable demands that those people standing with the government should also support."
