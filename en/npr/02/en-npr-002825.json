        "So, the price of oil dropped dramatically last week, and the stock market surged, so why is that?",
        "Well, I think the prices have been bid up by speculators.",
        "The movement of the price coincided with the realization in the global markets that they couldn't dump dollars into the U.S.",
        "mortgage market anymore.",
        "They needed to find a place to put it, and commodity seemed the safe place to put their money.",
        "And now, with the U.S.",
        "economy slowing dramatically and the Japanese economy being in a position where some people think it is in a technical recession, there is no way that the price of oil could be sustained at those high levels because there is not going to be the demand.",
        "Speaking of things that happen one place and have a reverb in another, there has been a conflict in South Ossetia, which is part of the former Soviet Union.",
        "Has that affected the oil issue at all?",
        "Well, we have seen the price go up a little bit, but that's the key in understanding that this run-up probably was caused by speculators, because now we have news that really would affect the oil supply because there are major pipelines that run through Georgia that feed Europe.",
        "And we have seen...",
        "And we are not talking about Atlanta, Georgia.",
        "We are talking about Georgia in the Soviet Union, just to be clear.",
        "That's correct, right.",
        "And we haven't seen a big spike in the price.",
        "It hasn't gone back up to $140.",
        "So, I think it is clear that the market has gone back to what are the real factors in supply and demand of oil, and not people just dumping money.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Just again, it was the former Soviet Union, which I mentioned before, but it is part of these republics that used to make up the Soviet Union.",
        "And that is just one aspect of the international oil issue.",
        "We have talked about Nigeria.",
        "But has the oil issue over time affected things like unemployment?",
