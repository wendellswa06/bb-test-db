        "Well, they are linked in the following way, that the price of oil is being bid up over time because China and India are growing at a much faster rate and are becoming major consumers of oil.",
        "The problem with the United States - everybody wants to say, you know, we should do more domestic oil and all that sort of thing.",
        "But our economy has grown.",
        "It is almost three times larger than it was in the 1960s.",
        "So when somebody says, you know, we used to consume 100-percent domestic oil, well, that's when the economy was much smaller.",
        "We have outgrown the U.S.",
        "supply of oil, and on the global market, for awhile we were the only players.",
        "Now we have competition.",
        "The Chinese are able to afford all of that oil because we are running a huge trade deficit with them, and that has a lot to do with jobs and wages in the United States and the pressures that are put on it.",
        "And that trillion dollars that China holds has a lot of sway in terms of where the money will go.",
        "They put a lot of money into U.S.",
        "securities and then started drifting into U.S.",
        "mortgages, so that made a lot of dollars available for easy credit in the housing market.",
        "That market looks not where people want to put their money, and so they needed somewhere to park these trillions of dollars that are floating around because of our trade deficit.",
        "And people landed on commodities, at least for awhile.",
        "And now, I think they are drifting back to putting them in more secure, real things.",
        "Well, let's hit two more things before we wrap up.",
        "One of them is mortgages.",
        "Last week, the mortgage giant Fannie Mae reported a $2.3 billion quarterly loss.",
        "It was three times larger than analysts had predicted.",
        "And Freddie Mac, another titanic mortgage firm, also revealed a major loss this quarter.",
        "So, we have talked a bit about how these organizations are linked to the U.S.",
        "government, although they are free-standing organizations.",
        "What does it really mean that they are having such deep financial troubles at this point?",
        "Well, what they hold as assets are home mortgages, and - so when they fall, when home values fall, the value of what they are holding falls dramatically, and that makes them post losses.",
        "But what they are considering an asset are the liabilities of individual households, that is, all of us holding a mortgage, a second mortgage or whatever.",
        "And so that means we are in deep trouble in terms of the household balance sheet.",
        "And we haven't seen the worst of it.",
        "The worst is yet to come.",
        "The unemployment rate is going up because we aren't generating new jobs, not because we have seen massive layoffs.",
        "And the layoffs are yet to come.",
        "You know, we have heard news about airlines laying off people, and the auto industry is cutting back on employment as we've seen sales drop for them.",
        "But we haven't seen those show up in the numbers yet.",
        "So, when they start showing up, unemployment will continue to be a drag.",
        "And people don't have jobs, they can't afford mortgages.",
        "Already we are seeing a huge amount of change in the unemployment numbers, and in fact it's at a six-year high.",
        "Although we have not yet seen - you know, in percentage points, it's not a huge leap, but in a country as big as this, even small changes in the unemployment rate have huge ramifications.",
        "You mentioned that we haven't seen the worst of things.",
        "What has happened so far, and what do you see ahead?",
        "We don't know the answer to that.",
        "Well, there have not been good studies of before versus after these reforms.",

        "Well, they're playing it safe because they want to make the Olympic team.",
        "And I think that's, as I said, it's unfortunate, because as a sport, I think you want to see people go for the homerun.",
        "And now they're kind of going for the single and then trying to steal second.",
        "Christine, thanks very much.",

        "For example, one reform Wells suggests is that the officer conducting the lineup should not know which person in the lineup is the actual suspect.",
        "Otherwise, Wells says, that officer will unconsciously communicate to the witness who the suspect is.",
        "It's just not really possible for people who know an answer to perform these kinds of tasks in a totally neutral way.",
        "Wells also says that witnesses should be told before viewing the lineup that the actual criminal might not be present.",
        "Just that little sentence will apparently change the rate at which people are picked from lineups.",
        "Also, he says, instead of showing the pictures all at once - which encourages the witness to compare the people in the lineup to each other - photos should be shown one at a time because doing it that way encourages people to compare the person they're looking at with the person that they have in their heads, and that seems to result in fewer innocent people getting fingered.",
        "That tends to reduce false picks.",
        "So those are the major reforms researchers like Wells have suggested.",

        "It was probably the biggest change that our investigative bureau had seen since the Miranda warning.",

        "You know, that there was no way that they were influencing anybody during these eyewitness identification procedures.",
