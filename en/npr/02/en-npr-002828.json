        "But what about E.J.'s claim that the Obama administration isn't bargaining hard enough.",
        "There's another CBS poll out this week which says a majority of Americans support the idea of keeping the cuts only for people who make less then $250,000.",

        "After graduating from college, went on to graduate school, law school, practiced law for several years and then in 2006, was elected to represent several neighborhoods in Brooklyn in the New York State Assembly.",
        "But you share a similar political philosophy, correct?",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "I think it was particularly inspiring to me when I had run for office.",
        "Initially I challenged an incumbent, came out of an insurgent movement much like Senator Obama did in Chicago.",
        "And some folks said, well, someone with a name like Hakeem Jeffries, you might have a problem getting elected in my little assembly district in Brooklyn, but it became clear to me that if a Barack Obama could be elected to the United State Senate, first out of Illinois, and then secure the nomination last night for a major political party, that certainly anything was possible.",
        "So it's inspiring for me, it was inspiring for my two young sons.",
        "I think it was inspiring for a lot of African-Americans across this country in terms of what's possible.",
        "What did you say to your two young sons last night?",
        "Well, you know, it's been interesting because I think prior to the start of this campaign, Nickelodeon was the preferred channel in the house, but that's slowly giving way to CNN and MSNBC.",
        "And I wasn't at home yesterday because we're in session in Albany, but I talked to my oldest son and told him that today was the day, it appeared, that Senator Obama would become the nominee.",
        "And he's followed this campaign, he's known that he was competing against someone named Hillary Clinton, and that whoever won was going to then face John McCain to become the president.",
        "And I could tell that there was a gleam in his voice as a result of what I projected to my son would be this primary victory.",
        "What about emotionally?",
        "How is it for you seeing this historic moment, an African-American man, achieve their party's nomination?",
        "I'm very optimistic about where we go as a country in the future, because folks under 45 have not been through the same racial wars as those in the older generations and I really believe see the country, see our communities through a lens that is increasingly color-blind.",
        "And that is perhaps one of the reasons why Senator Obama has done so well, particularly with younger Americans.",
        "He does, though, still have that problem with older, white, working- class voters."
