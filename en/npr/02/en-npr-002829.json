        "The Mine Safety and Health Administration is vowing to tackle black lung and they have a program called Dust Busters, where they've targeted specific mines.",
        "The agency has proposed some major reforms, but they've been blocked by congressional Republicans who've asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the research that shows black lung is back.",
        "And there are concerns that the Obama administration won't move ahead with any reforms in an election year.",
        "In the last 40 years, Scott, black lung killed or helped kill 70,000 coalminers.",
        "Together, the industry and the federal government have paid out $45 billion in compensation.",
        "These are undeniable facts, and you'd think that might trigger outrage and action in Washington.",

        "Well, yeah.",
        "Actually, you can certainly have black on black crime in a political sense.",
        "There was an Oscar-nominated documentary that focused on the really tough mayoral battle of four years - five years ago between Cory Booker, who was a city councilman in Newark at the time, when he went up against Sharpe James, who was the long-entrenched black incumbent there.",
        "And it was very, very tough.",
        "James basically insinuated that Booker was really - even though they were both Democrats, he insinuated that Booker was getting all of his money from white Republicans.",
        "He made insinuations about him not dating black women, all of this kind of stuff.",
        "So, you know, absolutely.",
        "That's a tough ad.",
        "I think, though, the fact Nutter won really demonstrates how much crime in particular, particularly murder, became such a salient political issue in Philadelphia.",
        "And I think in a weird way Rudy Giuliani is sort of kind of smiling here because Nutter appropriated the very controversial stop-and-frisk policy that Giuliani utilized in helping cut down crime in New York City in the '90s.",
        "Melissa, stop and frisk.",
        "You can certainly comment on whether the ad was racial, but also what do you think about that policy?",
        "Well, I mean, obviously, I think it's a deeply problematic policy from the perspective of our civil rights and liberties.",
        "That said, you know, there are some real successes to point to in the case of Rudy Giuliani's New York City in terms of crime reduction.",
        "But given that Rudy Giuliani's New York crime reduction also occurred during a period of economic expansion in our country where people have more opportunities for jobs and education, it's not at all clear that it was sort of a desire or the willingness to, in fact, racially profile, to stomp on civil liberties, to shoot people who were reaching for their wallets.",
        "It's not clear that that's what reduced crime so much as it was that what reduced crime was a change the economic environment more broadly.",
        "There is still to this day a question on what's the cause and what's the effect, because one of the arguments is that the reduction of crime, specifically in New York City, helped make the city appear safer which helped investments across the board and also caused more tourists to come back because the city was becoming less dangerous.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Well, and I think that what happens is that you end up with a New York which is a much better New York for some populations of New Yorkers.",
        "I think what Philadelphia and this particular - it's interesting to frame this around questions of race because, of course, Street is the outgoing mayor.",
        "He's not actually running against Nutter in this case.",
        "And I think the example of the Newark case with James and Booker is apropos here as we're looking at a new developing population of African-American elected officials who are taking a very different tact vis-a-vis local politics.",

        "I mean, it was not surprising when people found that he contributed to Planned Parenthood as late as 1999, so that part of his kind of renovation is open to question.",
        "So let me ask you this very briefly.",
        "You've got Mitt Romney - and then I'm going to go to you, Melissa, because we're closing in on our time - Mitt Romney, Mormon, very different kind of Republican.",

        "He's talking about limited government.",
        "He is really taking the stand.",
        "And I'll tell you, the death of Reverend Jerry Falwell is a tragic and yet fascinating political moment here, because there was a time when the way that the Republican Party built its winning coalition did not require pandering to the Moral Majority or the Christian right."
