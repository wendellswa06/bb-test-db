        "There was never congressional authorization for much of the troop deployment.",
        "There was no strategy.",
        "And even if you asked the simple question today - what is our end state that we want in Syria?",
        "- no one can really answer that nor how we get there.",
        "So taking our troops out of the combat zone was the right thing to do.",

        "in the battle against ISIS and this kind of decision sends a terrible signal to allies around the world.",
        "What would you say to that?",
        "I think most Americans would be surprised to know we only had a measly 2,000 U.S.",
        "troops.",
        "For war hawks and other people to say that this is going to be, you know, the end of the Middle East as we know it and to have all these, you know, fearmongering scenarios is simply not true.",
        "There was a power vacuum in Syria.",
        "There is still a one.",
        "Two thousand U.S.",
        "troops was never going to change that.",
        "We've been in Syria for many, many years with worsening results.",
        "Until we actually have a well-defined mission for our troops and a strategy, I don't think we should be deploying them into combat zones.",
        "Forgive me.",
        "With all due respect, Congressman, that wasn't my question.",
        "My question was the signal that it sends to allies that the U.S.",
        "can't be trusted - that's the question.",
        "So I think it's a fair point that Donald Trump should have given more notice to our allies.",
        "But he campaigned on withdrawing troops from Syria and from Afghanistan.",
        "It should not come as a surprise.",
        "And liberals and Democrats, for years, have been saying - get us out of endless wars.",
        "And the notion that somehow 2,000 U.S.",
        "troops, which is basically the size of just one small- to medium-sized brigade, was going to keep the chaos in Syria from continuing on was always a fantasy.",
        "If we really want to solve Syria, then we would deploy a really large number of troops for an extended period time to win.",
        "But this sort of muddling through was not serving anybody well, and it was putting our troops in harm's way with no well-defined strategy.",
        "And the argument is that the president seemed to be more amenable to the arguments of another world leader, the president of Turkey, than to the arguments of his own appointed advisers and that that in itself sends a poor signal.",
        "What would you say?",
        "I would agree with that point.",
        "He should not be influenced that much based on one phone call with a foreign leader.",
        "But this was not a notion that Donald Trump never brought up.",
        "He repeatedly talked during his campaign as well as during his presidency about taking our troops out of these faraway places.",
        "And he finally decided to do it.",
        "I think he should have given much more notice and had a better process.",

        "I think we could say in Landon Donovan they have a world class player.",
        "He had not been great in European play, but this year, on a loaner to an English premier league team he was good.",
        "And Donovan has just provided the most important goals, has made crosses and been involved in every great play.",
        "The United State isn't the Netherlands or Brazil or Argentina, but they're a tough out in this tournament.",
        "And whoever they play coming up, they're going to have their hands full because the United States is a tough, disciplined team that plays with teamwork."
