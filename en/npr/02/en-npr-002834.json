        "Patrick Toomey, a senator from Pennsylvania, argues that we have enough income coming in from tax receipts to cover the most important obligation here, which he defines as the debt owed to bondholders - that would be interest payments and principal payments coming due - and the minimal payments due to Social Security beneficiaries and the military.",
        "And the rest of it could be just forgotten for a while.",
