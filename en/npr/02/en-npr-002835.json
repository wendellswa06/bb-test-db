        "Okay, would I be out of line by saying stop foreign aid?",
        "Not if your goal is to change our relationship with those other governments, and many people prefer the idea of our not giving any money to any foreign governments for reasons that have nothing to do with the budget deficit or deficit spending.",
        "They just don't think foreign aid is a good idea.",
        "But as far as attacking the budget problem, it is not going to make a discernable difference, not in the short term and not in the long term.",

        "And yet, despite the fact that we've lowered taxes over this period of time, we still have all these problems.",
        "So the assumption that higher taxes are going to tank the economy, crush the economy was not borne out after the 1990 and 1993 budget agreements, both of which raised taxes, and both of which contributed to balanced budgets that we reached by the end of the 1990s, right around the year 2000, as I was saying, and...",
        "Let's point out that the economy grew at 4 percent a year the second of the half '90s, a historic high for a sustained period.",
        "So it was apparently able to survive the higher tax levels that were also giving us a federal budget that was more imbalanced.",
        "So it's not a popular idea ever to raise taxes.",
        "And it's certainly not a panacea to raise taxes.",
        "And, as a caller talked about earlier, it's extremely important, if you are going to raise taxes, that the revenue be dedicated to the problems - such as deficit reduction in this particular case, or paying for the wars - and not just used for what have you, not just allowed to...",
