        "You know, before the Democrats took over Congress, Attorney General Gonzales went up there arrogantly refusing to answer senators' questions when he was being asked about some of the stuff, saying, oh, I can tell you this much but I can't tell you that much and all of that.",
        "Those days are long gone.",
        "We've got a different Democratic Congress and the administration is going to have to be much more transparent, much more responsive, and much more professional about its administration of these very dangerous but necessary programs.",
        "Glenn, one more thing for you, since you do study economics, you're a professor of economics at Brown.",
        "It seems to me from what I have read - and I'm a total privacy nut, not that I'm nuts about my own privacy but about knowing what is legal and what is illegal and what there are trends in.",
        "It seems to me that things like your credit score, your purchasing history are going to become more and more a factor in whether you're considered a risky person; even the military now evaluates people based on their debt ratio as to whether or not they should be sent abroad.",
        "So does this have special implications for African-Americans, for other people of color who may not always have the same credit records as people who have -of races that have more money and more means?",
        "Yeah, and I think this is a good point.",
        "We call it despair at impact.",
        "You undertake a policy which is rational and sensible on its face, like for example evaluating people for some sensitive position based upon all the information that you can gather, including stuff about their credit; did they pay their rent, this and that.",
        "And then you apply this rational means to a population which is heterogeneous, in which people have different experiences.",
        "And so when in the American population, if you use credit history as a way of screening people for jobs or whatever it might be, African-Americans are going to be disadvantaged as a statistical matter, and even though no one may have set out with the intent of harming African-Americans, the impact of the undertaking will be detrimental.",
        "And that's something that ought to be borne in mind and taken into account, although I can think of no hard and fast rule or guideline as to, you know, what should be done.",
        "I say on a case-by-case basis the possibility of adversely affecting a minority of the population should be taken into account.",
        "Of course, Farai -",
        "Yes.",
        "- of course, the irony of that situation is, though, because just as you pointed out, and we discussed on the show before, they are indeed screening people in the military for their - on their debt ratio.",
        "So if you look at the fact that African-Americans proportionally may have more economic or financial difficulties, ironically then that could in actually keep them from going into harm's way because they wouldn't be - because the military would not be sending them overseas because they could be considered a credit risk."
