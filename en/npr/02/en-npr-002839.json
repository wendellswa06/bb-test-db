        "A federal appeals court overturned Washington, D.C.'s handgun ban on Friday.",
        "Now the district argued that under the Second Amendment the right to bear arms belongs only to militias, not to individuals; this is an argument that's been made by many people at many times.",
        "The courts didn't agree.",
        "Residents in high-crime areas spent years fighting to say that they have a right to protect themselves.",
        "This case could still be heard by the Supreme Court.",
        "Now, it's reported that the Supreme Court hasn't heard a gun case like this in almost 70 years.",
        "Do you think that this is going to come back to the table, Marcelo?",
        "I certainly think that this will go to the Supreme Court, and of course this is now in the context of new data on the numbers of homicides in certain pockets, in certain metropolitan districts in the United States.",
        "We are going to have to revisit once again the boundaries of this debate, and again rethink the balance between the right to bear arms and the intended and unintended, or anticipated and unanticipated, consequences of these propositions.",
        "But certainly this is a conversation that we'll come back to.",
        "And it will most likely - I believe the last time the Supreme Court spoke on the matter was in the 1930s.",
        "We're in for a major review of this case.",
        "Well, you know, Robert, what strikes me is residents in high-crime areas who were, like, no. We don't want this ban.",
        "We want to be able to protect ourselves.",
        "Do you find that completely sensical or nonsensical?",
        "I think it's absolutely sensical, and I'm hoping that the Supreme Court does rule on this and there's a rule that there is indeed an individual right to bear arms.",
        "I mean, it's absolutely fascinating, I mean, and I lived in Washington D.C.",
        "for 10 years.",
        "It's absolutely fascinating that this has been on the books, it's supposedly one of the strongest gun bans in the country.",
        "But year in and year out, Washington D.C.",
        "has always been in the highest of localities for murder and violence committed by guns.",
        "So, I mean, it was clearly in the context of the district, the gun ban was not working and all it was doing was actually preventing law-abiding people from having guns themselves and protecting themselves.",
