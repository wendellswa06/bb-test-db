        "Yeah, and it's this activity in the last couple months that really got us curious about what authorities they were using, whether the raid in Pakistan happened with the same legal authority as the raid in Syria happened, and also whether this was the first time this had happened, specifically in the Syria case.",
        "So it got - Eric Schmitt and I to just sort of be asking around, we were curious about what had happened in the past, and that's when we found out that there was this order that happened in 2004, and in fact, that there had been several such raids inside Syria in the past, just not as high profile as the one that happened last month.",
        "And several raids into Pakistan as well, including the one we were just talking about in addition to the one that caused such embarrassment last month.",
        "That's correct and the Pakistani raids have been very few and far between, mostly because of the real political sensitivities to doing that in Pakistan.",
        "As we saw, there was a mission early September, and since then, the United States hasn't done it again because it was - there was such a vehement protest from the Pakistani government that really surprised people in Washington.",

        "We certainly don't think that the missions have occurred in everyone of those countries.",
        "And again, they are used sparingly in part, because when you have the military doing these types of strikes, it does open a kind of a legal kind of worms that using the CIA doesn't.",

        "That is our understanding that Iran was certainly discussed when this order was being put together, but it was deliberately taken out off the table for a whole number of reasons.",
        "I think in part because this order was really specifically designed against al-Qaeda and the history of Iran and al-Qaeda is murky, but it's certainly not - Iran is not a place where al-Qaeda is believed to be operating with a sort of impunity or with a safe haven.",

        "There were separate arrangements worked out between the Pentagon and the State Department, the Pentagon and the CIA that basically allowed or really mandated better coordination so that the American ambassador in a country has knowledge and has to be notified that, for instance, special operations troops are going in.",
        "But before these notifications were worked out and these understandings were worked out, it got pretty hairy, and one of the examples we reported today that they were actually trying to do a mission inside of Pakistan without notifying Ryan Crocker who is the American ambassador in Islamabad.",
        "So it was - in some cases, it's because the information is fleeting, and they feel like they need to act quickly and the more people they tell, the more it can get bogged down.",
        "But this is a real source of tension or has been a source of a tension inside the national security apparatus.",
        "And obviously, this whole decision-making order was decided upon so that people could act quickly on what they call actionable intelligence within a matter of hours rather than trying to plan something for days or weeks or months in advance.",
        "Nevertheless, another institution of government which may feel cutout of this is Congress which generally likes to know when American forces are going into countries the United States has not declared war upon.",
