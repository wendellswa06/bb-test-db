        "And it's our understanding that in these sort of super-secret special operations missions that members of the Senate Arms Services Committee are notified.",

        "In part, as you mentioned earlier, when you're doing actions against Somalia, there's not a real government to anger, and so there's less of a sort of diplomatic blow-back than if you're going to even consider a military mission inside of Pakistan or inside of Syria.",
        "I mean, it is interesting that there have been several missions inside Syria in the past, and it's really only the one that happened a month ago that the Syrian government took issue about and really made a public stink over.",
        "That may be because it was just such a high-profile mission, and it's embarrassing for the country maybe because they didn't know.",
        "It's tough to figure out.",
        "Very quickly, do we know - these are very risky not only for the people involved, but for the country.",
        "Are they effective?",
        "It's hard to say.",
        "For instance, the raids inside of Somalia, they believe that they did were able to strike at members of an al-Qaeda cell in the Horn of Africa and that was effective.",
        "In Syria, they believe a month ago that they killed a pretty senior al-Qaeda Iraq operative.",
        "But it's hard just learning these details.",
        "It's hard at this point to make any kind of big assessment of the success or failure of these operations.",

        "On the more negative side about the letter, he did blame secularization and moral relativism for -clerical child sex abuse, the incident of it here in Ireland, which is a bit ridiculous, at least about its because the time in Ireland, which is most loyal to Catholicism, would've been the middle decades of the 20th century when orphanages, and industrial schools and residential institutions were run for children by 18 richest congregations here in Ireland.",
        "And the Ryan Report last May exposed shocking abuse - sexual, physical, emotional abuse and neglect of children, tens and thousands of them, in those residential institutions through the '20s, '30s, '40s, '50s and '60s in Ireland, long before Vatican II, long before secularization ever hit the shores and the basis which he says is the cause for it all.",
        "We must see in that context.",
        "So it does make his letter that, part of it, any how, look ridiculous.",

        "Mr.",
        "P.",
        "McGARRY: No. I mean, he's been harping on about this since he moved to Rome in the early 1980s, to The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, a type of roll back on the more liberalizing moves of Vatican II, and he tends to see everything in the light of secularization and moral relativism.",
        "And I do believe it diminishes the shocking tragedy that we've had in Ireland, which are clerical child sex abuse and the suffering the people injured, to have it reduced to a simple weapon in his war against secularization.",

        "And the one - a fellow priest of his - he was in the Norbertine Congregation warned, back as far as 1968, about this man's carryon.",
        "He went to his superiors, he went to the papal nuncio at the time, he went to the local bishop and they all ignored him.",

        "P.",

        "Even though the Vatican, the congregation, indeed, of which he'd been prefect for so long until he became pope in 2005, refused to cooperate and even ignored all the correspondence with the Murphy Commission set up by the state to investigate how clerical child sex abuse allegations were handled in Dublin's Catholic Archdiocese.",
        "So, too, did the papal nuncio to Ireland.",
        "He ignored two such letters.",
        "He refused to appear before our parliament's foreign affairs committee, last month, to talk about it.",
        "So, I mean, the Vatican has been somewhat, to be kind about it, disingenuous in that element of its own role where abuse in Ireland is concerned.",
        "And furthermore, it refused to give recognition or backing to three sets of guidelines introduced by the Irish bishop's child protection guidelines, that is in 1996 and 2005, and again, in 2008, whereas, they did give such backing to your bishop's guidelines in 2002 and 2006."
