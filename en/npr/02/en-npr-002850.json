        "Right.",
        "I mean we talk about that the Republican Party is a pro-family party and Rudy Giuliani is so pro-family he's had three wives.",
        "The point is, is that not only his positions on abortion that could be death for him among conservative voters; it's personal things like his private life.",
        "Apparently he announced he's leaving his second wife on a radio talk show host - on a radio talk show program.",
        "This is a good thing.",
        "Right.",
        "That's right, exactly.",
        "We could do that in the next show.",

        "And Lloyd makes a very, very good point that, you know, we talk about eight years of Rudy Giuliani as mayor and he did a lot about crime and things like that.",
        "But what people talk about, they talk about the last four months, starting with 9/11 and what he did.",
        "Look, he was a hero.",
        "The thought of him addressing the Republican National Convention 2004 stems really from his stewardship of the city after those attacks.",
        "Lloyd Grove, Rudy Giuliani decided against - he had prostate cancer and he treated that and that was the reason he decided against a race for the Senate against Hillary Clinton.",
        "How do polls put him in New York State at this moment amongst Republicans and in the presidential campaign at large?",
        "Well, the last poll that I saw, saw that in the city Mayor Bloomberg is a much more popular presidential prospect, even though he hasn't announced, than Rudy Giuliani.",
        "So it seems like the closer you get to people who know Rudy in his previous incarnation, the more people have questions about his leadership.",
        "Now, I mean, I am barely - I just - the caller sort of said he disagree with me - I just want to point out I'm just saying what's out there.",
        "I'm not taking a position on Rudy's candidacy or his mayoralty for that matter.",

        "I am a loyal Republican and I have to say I really enjoyed this last debate.",
        "I thought it was much better than the first debate and that it really challenged the candidates and it really allowed them to air some of their differences that I found really, really enlightening, like especially on the abortion.",
        "I thought that Huckabee had a good example where he not only just, you know, rehashed an old line, abortion is bad, but he actually expanded it on a little bit and it gave him chance to expound on some views.",
        "Ken Rudin, I think there was a little bit more time for the candidates to talk last night.",
        "There was.",
        "Part of the problem with the first debate - it was Chris Matthews and MSNBC, and you can't squeeze 10 candidates and 90 minutes and Chris Matthews in one room, especially with Chris Matthews.",
        "I think for all the criticism people make about Fox News, I thought the three hosts last night -Wendell Goler, Chris Wallace and Brit Hume - asked very penetrating questions.",
        "If candidates refuse to answer or gave wishy-washy answers, they stuck with it, they insisted on answers.",
        "And I thought they did a very, very good job.",
        "But it also allowed Republicans to, you know, in the first debate, if they spoke three seconds beyond their allotted time, they got interrupted by Chris Matthews.",
        "This time they really had a chance to say what they had to say.",
        "Thanks for the call, Ben.",
        "And finally, this email from Carol in Baltimore.",

        "The Republicans have had two already.",
        "When can I expect the Dems to go head to head?",
        "Sunday, June 3rd in New Hampshire is the next Democratic one.",
        "And then Tuesday, June 5th, the next Republican debate, both in New Hampshire, the first primary state."
