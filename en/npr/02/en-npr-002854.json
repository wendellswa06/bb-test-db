        "Thank you for the invitation.",
        "I'm happy to be here this evening.",
        "Well, welcome to all of you, and thank you so much for joining us.",
        "We're at a lovely spot here near St. Louis Cathedral.",
        "It's right over our shoulders.",
        "And we're just a block away from the Mississippi River.",
        "But many parts of New Orleans are absolutely wiped out.",
        "There are miles and miles of empty, devastated neighborhoods.",
        "And this is a question we've been posing all week while we've been here.",
        "How long will it be before New Orleans is anything approaching whole again?",
        "I'd like you each to ponder that question, and Mr. Milling, I'm going to begin with you.",
        "Well, I guess the true issue is the definition of whole.",
        "I don't think any of us necessarily expect New Orleans to return in the shape that it was before.",
        "There are many decisions large and small that have to be made by not only government but also by individuals who own individual parcels of land.",
        "These things don't work quickly, and they shouldn't.",
        "So no quick answers.",
        "Dr. Francis, how long do you think it'll take for the city to get to something approaching what it used to be?",
        "The best way I can answer it is it's going to be longer than most people think or thought it would be.",
        "And I think if we're going to do it right, we've got to take the time to do it, to do it smart, to do it stronger when we build our levees, and to make sure that we are going to treat everybody equitably, not equal, equitably.",
        "Because if we do the equal treatment, we'll all be unequal at the end.",
        "And I think that's going to take some time.",
        "And, Kim Boyle, at the six month mark, do you have a clearer picture now of what it's going to take to bring this city back?",
        "Well, similar to King and Dr. Francis, I don't think you can put a specific time frame on how long it's going to take, but I think it's important for the rest of the nation to bear in mind that six months ago 80 percent of our city was literally under water.",
        "That in and of itself is a significant improvement, that we've dried out.",
        "I think if we try to hold ourselves to a specific timeline or the rest of the nation tries to hold us to a specific timeline, that would be a mistake.",
        "This is going to be a long process, and most of us are in it for the long haul.",
        "I'd like to ask you about one specific problem.",
        "New Orleans has had a very vital and important tourist industry, and even though people are now getting higher wages, those who have jobs in it, than they might've gotten before, in order for it to work there have to be lots of folks who wash dishes and make hotel beds for a living.",
        "And they've got to live somewhere.",
        "Right now they can't afford any place in or near this city.",
        "How do you solve this problem?",
        "Where does the housing come for the people who are inevitably going to have rather low incomes?",
        "King Milling, you know?",
        "Well, I believe the marketplace will take care of a lot of those issues.",
        "I believe that the banks are prepared to make investment in homes, in affordable housing and in multi-family dwellings.",
        "But first you've got to get the land itself available for those activities.",
        "And right now, quite frankly, very little of that has occurred.",
        "Kim Boyle, are you satisfied with this, that issues of housing are still beyond the horizon for New Orleans?"

        "And to do that, this city is going to have to change.",
        "And I don't think anyone here disagrees with that.",
        "Change is stressful, and we've got to work through that stress and make it happen.",
        "It's not - late into the summer of 2003, after we're beginning to bog down, that it begins to rise.",
        "It rises rapidly because people pour into Iraq.",

        "Were we to get out, al-Qaida would be slowly squeezed out.",
        "They might be able to stay a while with the Sunnis, but as the Sunnis - as one side or another wins the civil war, you can bet the al-Qaida will be killed.",

        "The thing that I found - what the general said that I don't understand is he said, I believe, whichever side wins the civil war will eliminate al-Qaida.",
        "It seems that if the Shia win the civil war, the Sunnis will probably not just kind of take it lying down, and they will still have a common cause with al-Qaida, even if it's at a lower level of insurgency.",
        "And if the Sunnis win the civil war, they will have done it with the help of al-Qaida, and they're likely to be grateful for that help."
