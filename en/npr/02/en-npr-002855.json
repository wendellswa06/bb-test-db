        "So if the Shiites truly win, then they will repress this kind of insurgency activity the way Saddam repressed insurgency activity by the Shiites in 1991.",
        "But these things are sort of beyond our control now.",
        "The reason I'm kind of playing it down is that I think - I actually think they won't be as bad as they are, but I'm trying to emphasize that even if they are as bad as the exaggerated pictures that we're encouraged to accept as reality, we don't have a reasonable, rational choice but to take that - pay that price now.",

        "I don't think this has anything to do with al-Qaida capabilities in the U.S., and connecting this al-Qaida business with Iraq, the only connection that disturbs me is that as long as we're in there, we're providing a dramatically improved training ground for them.",
        "And to get out, they can't kill Americans there, and the training will be somewhat different.",
        "And it may not be very favorable for them.",

        "So you see New York, San Francisco, L.A., Seattle, Atlanta, the major international airports sort of being the first cities that get struck.",
        "And then, in this particular model, and there are many different ways, many models of how it might spread, it then goes out from there.",

        "So it's an evolving thing.",

        "From what you've been able to see, is the federal government, at this point, over-blowing the danger here?",
        "Or underestimating the danger?",
        "Well, I--you know, I've been following this for several years now, as have several of our reporters, and it is completely plausible that a pandemic could sweep through this country.",

        "Of course, in the Gulf area, where it's going on, the disaster continues.",
        "But in typical disaster response, you can coordinate and have people come in, move in supplies, do what's needed, and you move out.",
        "This, as you pointed out, involves moving a lot of drugs to the right people, drugs that are in short supply, drugs that may not work totally to help prevent it.",
        "So I think that the emphasis here on getting states and cities to try to think about this is the right approach, and--because the federal government from Washington can't necessarily, you know, they are not--they're too big and bulky to know what's going to be needed in Taos, you know, on week three of the pandemic.",
        "And Joe, reading between the lines of this report, in a lot of ways, it says local, state governments, you're on your own.",
