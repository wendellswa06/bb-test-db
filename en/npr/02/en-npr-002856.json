        "That's right.",
        "The kinds of restrictions on travel, both air travel, rail travel and trucking, will only have-will only slow it down.",

        "Joining us now is Dr. DA Henderson, distinguished scholar at the Center for Bioterrorism at the University of Pittsburgh; former director of the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness.",

        "Nice to have you on the program today, sir.",
        "Happy to be here.",
        "I mentioned you had a chance to glance at this plan.",
        "Does it seem to be scaled properly to you?",
        "Well, I think there is an emphasis here, which I think is distracting, and that is the hope that somehow or other you're going to be able to contain or slow an outbreak.",
        "And I think what the difficulty is, there are very few people who've gone back to 1968, 1957, which were both pandemic years--or 1918, and looked at how rapidly this virus spreads across the country.",
        "For example, at the end of August 1957, there were only a few outbreaks in the south of the United States, and--mainly in Louisiana where schools seemed to have opened early.",
        "And seven weeks later, every state in the union had outbreaks, and 47 of the 50 states had more than half of their counties with epidemics.",
        "So you've got a tidal wave like this, which moves very, very rapidly.",
        "And to be distracted and thinking we're going to quarantine or put up some sort of (unintelligible), or we're going to be able to screen people at airports, or what have you, it's unfortunate that there are those putting emphasis on this, when that is not the best use of resources.",
        "What do you find encouraging about the plan?",
        "Well, I think it's encouraging in the sense of making it clear that this does have to be done at local levels.",
        "The planning has to be done at local levels, and there's not going to be resources to come in.",
        "And I think this is something that's very difficult for many to accept.",
        "And I think the difficulty here--and the biggest problem we're going to face, is going to be the tidal wave of patients.",
        "And we've seen, really, every year, in a few cities, there's been flu around, and when it's gone into a city, you have the hospitals fill up very quickly and then they go on what they call bypass, or they do not accept more patients because they have as many--they've accepted as many patients as their professional staffs can handle."

        "Well, one can predict very safely, that if we have the pandemic through, we're going to have--every hospital is going to be in that position.",
        "And flu healthcare resources, the report points out, are not very mobile.",
        "It's hard to move them from one place to another, or in case of hospitals, you really can't do it.",

        "It recommends vaccine stockpiles, quarantines, travel restrictions, among other steps, which may be necessary.",

        "Why not?",
        "Well, you have--a flu pandemic will involve a good part of the nation fairly quickly, and there will be needs at virtually every city.",
        "The federal resources are comparatively limited and I think they can handle a focal problem, be it an explosion or a hurricane or tornado, by moving people around, but the demand here is just so overwhelming, there's very little you can do.",
        "In terms of hospitals, people have talked about field hospitals or portable units that might be moved.",
        "There are very few of these in the first place.",
        "And the second problem that you have coming in is not only bed space, but who's going to care for the patients?",
        "And if you create more beds, that means you really need more people to take care of the patients, and that's going to be in short supply, because I think the attack rates--that is infection rates--in hospital staffs are going to be very high, because they are the ones that are going to be in contact with a lot of patients.",
        "So it's going to be a critical problem in this area."

        "What about the idea of, since there's going to be a shortage of Tamiflu--in the earlier proposal, there was a suggestion that Tamiflu be targeted to healthcare professionals and other first responders to keep them on the job.",
        "I take it that you're not too fond of the idea of using Tamiflu or--where do you stand on that?",
        "One final question for you before we let you go, Dr. Henderson, and that is that, this reads like a government report.",
        "It's dry language.",
        "It, as you say, skirts around some issues like where we're going to get, you know--whether or not it can be stopped at the border.",
        "It says probably not, but the one thing that it doesn't contain is the whiff of panic that might be in the air if this starts to happen.",
        "Rausch leads an organization called Got Your 6, which aims to change misperceptions about veterans.",
        "Well, the Tamiflu, it is hoped, might be effective in preventing the disease, but it would mean that an individual would have to take a capsule every day.",
        "If you assume that an outbreak is going to go for at least 10 to 12 weeks in a particular city, which is what the history has shown, you would be using the equivalent of 10 treatment doses just to prevent one case of flu and--the treatment of flu requires much less, because you're only giving it for five days--so that if you begin using it for prevention, the very limited supplies that we have are not going to go terribly far.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm a medical student and I learned in my classes that most of the people who died in the 1918 flu pandemic, died not of the flu, but of secondary bacterial infections, bacterial pneumonia, which we can treat today with antibiotics.",
        "And I'm always interested that when this discussion comes up, nobody talks about that.",
        "They talk as though most of the people died of the flu itself.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Dr. Henderson.",
        "Well, actually, this is not true.",
        "In fact, we have gone back and looked at records in 1918 and it was surprising the number of patients who died within a matter of three, four days, which would be primary flu infection.",
        "There were certainly some cases where there'd be secondary infection, that is, pneumonias, which could be treated with antibiotics.",
        "But I think the feeling is that we're not going to have--the great majority are going to have to be treated that way."

        "May I ask a second question?",
        "If you can keep it short.",
        "How about the supportive care we can provide today with fluids, that sort of stuff, which I know will be more limited with the, as you say, the strain on the medical system?",
        "Well, I think there are a number of things that can be done, because influenza will be a problem for individuals who have heart trouble or trouble with their lungs or diabetes or what have you; so we know that we would get a number of patients in with influenza who are going to have other problems that are going to get worse, and that will need treatment.",
        "So that there's going to be a need--a considerable need for medical treatment of patients well beyond just flu, and I think many people have had the feeling we could do like in 1918 and put people in gymnasiums or in armories.",
        "But in 1918 we couldn't do very much and we couldn't do very much in medicine, period, in support.",
        "So they were really warehoused and given food and fluid, but now, you really need more care, and I think this is what worries many of us: what we're going to do to provide anywhere near the quality of care that really is needed to see a lot of these people through this serious problem.",

        "My question is, do you have any idea of when it may happen?",
        "And the second question is, what could we do, individually, such as hydration, washing our hands, using a face mask, so forth and so on?",
        "I'll be bold enough to take the first part of that question.",
        "No. Dr. Henderson, can you help us out in the second part.",
        "Well, the question, what individuals can do, is fairly limited.",
        "And, I think we would say, wash your hands; if you're sick, stay home.",
        "But beyond that, what can you do--you really can't do anything more than--if you have access to Tamiflu and you get it within 48 hours, this may be helpful.",
        "But I think many of us are not terribly optimistic about the Tamiflu, because the flu virus, the H5N1, seems to develop resistance fairly quickly.",
        "So, as far as an individual's concerned, there are just fairly limited things that one really can do.",
        "Dr.",
        "Henderson, Joe Neel again.",
        "This report will probably be remembered--I mean, there are only a few things that can actually go into the stories that reporters are writing, but the one thing I think will capture people is the idea that the government is recommending that everyone stay three feet apart from each other when they're in the workplace.",
        "Do you think that--is that based on science?",
        "Is that a reasonable thing to expect?",
        "Well, that's pure speculation.",
        "I don't think there's any science base for that.",
        "That's the problem.",
        "And, there is the concern about--if you're ill, you should stay home, but we should not forget that the individual influenza is able to excrete the virus for a couple of days before he gets sick.",
        "So if he stays home when he has symptoms, that's nice; but the two couple of days before, he's already been around to spread it as much as he'd need to spread it.",
        "And what about Terry's other question?",
        "Masks--would they provide protection?",
        "Well, masks are suggested to be put on the people who have the flu and then who may be expelling droplets.",
        "It will prevent some spread by way of droplets, but experience is with the masks, by and large, that they do block a certain amount of air coming through, in particular, if they're a little moist, and then the air just flows around the mask, and so you're really doing very little with it."
