        "And I think my experience in dealing with epidemics--and I've certainly dealt with a lot over my career--is that, to the extent you can keep the things going normally in a city and what have you, and trains running and food purchase and so forth, you have less anxiety; you have less panic.",
        "It's when things get seriously disrupted--the normal services and so forth, that apprehension begins and things get worse.",
        "And this is one of the things that worries me about suggesting that people voluntarily quarantine or we try to quarantine people.",

        "And my own thinking that we--very little we can do to keep the flu from spreading, that is quite clear.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "There were so many people ill that many of them got no healthcare whatsoever because the doctors and all of the healthcare professionals, such as they were for 1918, completely overwhelmed.",
        "They could not build coffins fast enough to bury the dead and simply stacked them--this was in December of 1918 in New York, so the bodies froze.",
        "And they simply stacked them up and left them stacked like cords of firewood until the next spring.",
        "And my questions is, is this--and my grandmother died, as a medical student said, died in four days, so it was clearly of the...",
        "Flu, yeah.",
        "...flu, itself.",
        "Healthcare is not delivered on the national level.",
        "It's delivered on the local level.",
        "And when I hear the national government is making plans for it to take over the delivery of healthcare services, frankly, it makes me pretty nervous.",
        "And so, is there anything in the national plan that will move decision-making power down to not just the state level, but to the local level?",
        "Joe, that's not my reading of this plan, at all.",
        "It seems to put a lot of emphasis on local and state governments.",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "I don't see--I don't see a federal takeover in this plan, at all.",
        "I think the federal government is actually stepping back and saying, states and local communities, it's your job to figure this out, and local hospitals, you should have a plan.",
        "And you're absolutely right in your first observation that the infrastructure goes very quickly and that's what this plan is pretty--pretty devoted to, is trying to figure out how to mitigate the effects of having the, you know, people who drive the trucks get sick and possibly die and who replaces them and telecommunications breaking down because repair people can't fix things; and, you know, people not being able to run the back offices at the banks and the financial system going awry.",
        "So there's a lot of attention paid to the infrastructure, not that much on telling hospitals and healthcare what to do.",
        "Thanks, Kate."

        "But I would point out that that is actually necessary but certainly not sufficient.",
        "Each local government has to be monitoring its own plan to make sure it's on track and going forward, and not to be doing it simply because there's a federal requirement to do so.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "Does that seem to be your reading of it?",
        "Well, I think the way we're reading it is, number one, we absolutely have to accept local responsibility for those parts of that plan that are ours to do.",

        "So we have assumed all along that this is really on our shoulders and we have good fortune in our county to have a county executive who also shares that perspective and has been working with us to identify some local resources that do go beyond the federal resources to do our local planning.",
        "So we have entered into this with all of our community and business and healthcare partners assuming that this would fall on us as a responsibility, but not assuming that there would be no federal financial assistance once we understood what that gap was between what our available local resources are and what we would need to actually respond.",
        "And we just have a few seconds left before we have to go to a break, but are you--is the county stockpiling food and bottled water and Tamiflu and that sort of thing?",
        "Are you advising your citizens to do that?",
        "Yes, yes, and yes.",
        "We have passed an appropriation in our county for enough Tamiflu to get us started with healthcare workers and first-line responders.",
