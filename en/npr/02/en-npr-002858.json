        "And you know, charities are going to be tapped out, so where's the money going to come from to bury all of the dead?",

        "I do not see anything in the federal guide that addresses that issue, in particular.",

        "But in terms of funding, I don't believe that's addressed in the federal plan.",
        "Well, is that something on a local level that you all have taken into consideration because, you know, from what I understand, I mean, there's going to be far more people ill that can be helped through the healthcare, but that seems to be the main focus.",
        "We're going to have so many bodies that--and with regulations today, you know, you just can't stack people like cord wood back in 1918.",
