        "What does this city need?",
        "Not an individual, but what does it need in the way of leadership that it might conceivably get out of an election or two?",
        "Well, I guess I'm the oldest sitting around here, and I've watched leadership in the city for a long time.",
        "I think this city needs first somebody who isn't worried about whether he or she is going to get reelected.",
        "Now, I'd vote for somebody.",
        "You would vote for somebody.",
        "I'd vote for somebody who said let me tell you something, you may not like me, but I'm telling you, this is what we have to do.",

        "It's pretty big stakes for government.",
        "Well, you know, if you are convinced as a leader that your not living there is the most important thing, not because you are female, not because you're black, not because you're white, but I'm doing it because you are a human being that doesn't deserve to be treated that way.",
        "Those decisions are going to have to be made.",
        "I'm convinced of that.",
        "But part of the problem that we've dealt with for years is that we've neglected to realize that race and gender and color still matter.",
        "As long as you put it aside, it keeps showing up, because you've not dealt with it.",
        "And I think that kind of leader, who starts to deal with it, I think will galvanize the city.",

        "Many of our citizens who've evacuated have absolutely no idea how the absentee voting process is going to work.",
        "And the right to vote is probably one of the most fundamental democratic rights that all of us have.",
        "And if we cannot put mechanisms in place where we can ensure that all of our citizens, not just our citizens who were here pre-Katrina, and want to participate in this democratic process, if we can't do it through satellite voting in other parts of the state as well as in other parts of the country, which many of us want and has not been accepted, then I think we have a serious problem that taints the upcoming elections for mayor as well as for council members, sheriff, and everything else that's on the ballot in April."

        "But not outside the state?",
        "And we have a substantial amount of our citizens that are living in cities like Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, Memphis, and my position is, if this country can ensure that elections go forth properly in Iraq, that Iraqi citizens who are living in the United States can vote in elections here, I don't understand why we can't ensure that for tax paying citizens from the city of New Orleans.",
