        "Estimates vary about how many veterans have PTSD, but it's almost certainly a minority.",
        "The Department of Veterans Affairs says PTSD can be linked to violence in a minority of cases.",
        "That's usually domestic violence.",
        "In general, veterans are less likely to be involved in crime than civilians.",
        "In the Fort Lauderdale case, there's, so far, no evidence that Esteban Santiago had PTSD.",

        "That's not a symptom of PTSD.",
        "But even other mental illnesses are not statistically linked to gun violence, says Dr. Sandro Galea, Dean of Boston University School of Public Health.",
        "These are common misconceptions, and they've been around for decades.",
        "There's an extraordinary stigma around mental illness.",
        "There's an actual fear, I think, of mental illness.",
        "And in many respects, our systems and structures have reinforced that.",
        "Galea says the stigma makes it harder to get people into treatment for mental illness.",

        "After an absence of 34 years and counting, there is a renewed interest in going back to the moon, a place no person has set foot since Gene Cernan left the last boot mark in 1972.",
        "Of course, if you're like Arthur C.",
        "Clarke, you marvel at one of the greatest mysteries about the moon: how people could have gone there and never have returned.",
        "But there's another story - that's another story and we're not going to talk about that - and perhaps that's about to change in a decade or two.",
        "So for the rest of the hour we're going to be talking about these upcoming moon missions, how they'll help accomplish the goal of sending people back to the moon, and then we're going to talk about the vehicle selected by NASA - just selected - that has been chosen to take astronauts to the moon.",
