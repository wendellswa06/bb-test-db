        "Yeah.",

        "We'll also search for evidence of frozen water at the lunar poles, and we include a neutron instrument, a radar, and an infrared mapper, which is the instrument that I'm working on.",

        "Right.",
        "A perfectly fair question.",
        "Well, yeah, we did learn a huge amount about the moon during the Apollo missions, but much of the, you know, activity was sort of concentrated on the near side of the moon, the part of the moon that we can see directly and communicate with directly from Earth.",
        "Those lunar missions only lasted for a couple of weeks because you're constrained to only land when the sun is shining during the day.",
        "Remember, the lunar day lasts for a month, and so for extended human habitation we'll have to send, you know, people there that could survive both the day and the night, and multiple days and nights.",
        "And we need to learn more about the moon's properties just to accomplish that particular task.",

        "There are other places that may have enhanced resources at the high latitudes.",
        "In the polar regions in particular we may find regions that contain frozen ice, and we'd like to explore those and make the most out of our future exploration of the moon by learning something about it now.",

        "Are we talking about colonization here, other kinds of projects that these missions would serve as a basis for?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you could imagine, you know, the entire, you know, steer of human activities gradually expanding out to space in the future.",
        "Most people think it's something that will eventually come, and the moon is an obvious first stepping stone to that type of endeavor.",
        "It is a planetary body.",
        "It's got a history.",
        "It's a tough, you know, technical job to send people there and have them survive.",
        "So it would make sense that the moon has become a key focus for this, you know, long-term forward-looking program.",
        "And let's talk about somewhat the interest in these polar regions.",
        "Could there actually be reservoirs of ice - of water ice that could be either made perhaps into fuel to use the hydrogen or to use as drinking water?",
        "Yeah, it's a very distinct possibility.",
        "The idea that there might be water cold-trapped at the high latitudes on the moon was first proposed in the early '60s.",
        "The Apollo mission learned a lot about the moon but only about the mid-latitude regions, where the landings were.",
        "Ice was discovered on the planet Mercury, believe it or not, which is the closest planet to the sun, at its poles, in the last decade through radar observation.",
        "And we - there's a good circumstantial case for water at the lunar poles, but we don't have any, you know, absolute hard and fast evidence that it's there.",
        "And so one of the main purposes of many of these orbiter missions is to gather more data to help us answer that question.",
