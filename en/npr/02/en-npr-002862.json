        "Today's document spells out the steps that the federal government will take in the event of a flu pandemic.",
        "And while the document is full of plans on how best to contain the disease outside our borders, it concedes that probably won't work.",
        "And while there are pages about how it will coordinate with state and local governments, it also warns they should not expect massive federal help.",
        "Companies, it says, also need to plan for extended absences, and individuals need to figure out how best to help themselves and their loved ones.",

        "OK.",

        "Why would some areas be more expensive than others?",
        "That's a great question, and it hasn't been fully determined.",

        "Whoa.",
        "Whoa.",
        "Whoa.",

        "No.",
        "In fact, in Manhattan and in San Francisco and in some of the really big, pricey places where the real estate will set you way back, your health insurance is not going to set you way back whereas if you're in Southwest Georgia, everything else in the area is cheap but your insurance is among the highest in the country.",
        "And the reason for that is because there's just one, big hospital system there named Phoebe Putney.",
        "It controls almost the whole market, and they can pretty much charge what they want to.",
        "So you just mentioned that there's a limited number of health care providers; that raises costs.",
        "Then there's the matter of the insurance companies.",
        "Are there fewer insurance companies that want to play in some of these areas?",
        "Is that part of the reason that they're more expensive?",
        "That is, definitely, although it's hard to determine cause and effect.",
        "In those areas you have far fewer than in a place like Atlanta or any of the big cities, where you have a lot of insurers competing against each other.",
        "And in the big cities, you also have a lot of hospital systems competing against each other.",
        "Are some areas, statistically speaking, just less healthy than other areas - and that affects the premiums that people have to pay in that area?",
        "It does.",
        "But I was surprised, when we looked at the top and the bottom 10 areas, how little it matters.",
        "Now - and for instance, Eastern Tennessee has got a lot of problems - heavy tobacco use, obesity.",
        "One hospital CEO I talked to referred to it as the belt buckle in the Stroke Belt.",

        "Well, why is that?",
        "There's - in Chattanooga, there's different systems - the Catholic system, a for-profit system and a public system.",
        "And the insurers basically had everyone bid it out and pick the lowest system.",
        "So they've got a low-cost deal there."

        "It's certainly possible because if there is just one hospital system there, well, if it's good or if it's not good, it doesn't matter.",
        "And in fact, that hospital system is going to have less opportunity to compete against other ones.",

        "And in order for them to have done more, they would've had to do things that would've alienated doctors and the hospitals and the other medical practitioners.",
