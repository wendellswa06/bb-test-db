        "So you might have a major epidemic occurring in a major city like Chicago, whereas rural areas two or three hundred miles away don't get hit until three or four weeks later.",
        "So it's an evolving thing.",
        "And, though, at any one time during the peak, there may be a three or four-week period where there are tens of millions of people who are sick, and that could cause incredible disruption.",
        "From what you've been able to see, is the federal government, at this point, over-blowing the danger here?",
        "Or underestimating the danger?",
        "Well, I--you know, I've been following this for several years now, as have several of our reporters, and it is completely plausible that a pandemic could sweep through this country.",
        "And, if it is as severe as the 1918 pandemic was, it could kill up to 2 million people.",
        "That's the worst-case scenario.",
        "And I think that--a couple of years ago, when there were only a couple of countries with bird flu cases and it was not--hadn't moved into too many humans, it was a really theoretical risk-or a really theoretical construct that it was going to hit this country.",
        "But now that it's--bird flu has moved to 50 countries, birds in 50 countries, and there are more than 200 human cases and 113 of them have died, you know, its notching up.",
        "So it's impossible to predict whether it will happen.",
        "It just depends on when the virus mutates.",
        "But I think that preparation and planning is probably prudent.",
        "We'd like to get you involved in this conversation.",

        "And if you look at how they're talking about distributing Tamiflu, they're talking about doing it through state health departments.",
        "And it would make sense to me to get those state health departments involved, because our issue in emergency medicine, if this were to happen, is number one, are people going to come to work at our place?",
        "And number two, how do we keep these people out of the hospital?",
        "Because there'll be so many of them that there's all these scenarios for putting them in high school gymnasiums and what not.",
        "And I was wondering what your guest thinks about that.",
        "Joe, a lot of good questions there.",
        "Yeah, I don't know where to start.",
        "The plan that's come out today puts great emphasis on getting states mobilized, and that's been the primary focus of the federal government for the last six months, because the report quite flatly states that the federal government just can't do it all.",
        "It's too big of an event; it's not a point-disaster like a hurricane hitting a region or even a tornado hitting a city, that comes and it goes.",
        "Of course, in the Gulf area, where it's going on, the disaster continues.",
        "But in typical disaster response, you can coordinate and have people come in, move in supplies, do what's needed, and you move out.",
        "This, as you pointed out, involves moving a lot of drugs to the right people, drugs that are in short supply, drugs that may not work totally to help prevent it.",
        "So I think that the emphasis here on getting states and cities to try to think about this is the right approach, and--because the federal government from Washington can't necessarily, you know, they are not--they're too big and bulky to know what's going to be needed in Taos, you know, on week three of the pandemic.",
        "And Joe, reading between the lines of this report, in a lot of ways, it says local, state governments, you're on your own.",
        "Yeah, it does say that.",
        "It provides a lot of support to them, gives them outlines of how things may unfold and what they may want to do.",
        "They might want to consider school closures and it talks a lot about shutting down--the effectiveness of shutting down transportation, for example--maybe when a community has an outbreak, closing it off or limiting transportation.",
        "Which, it suggests, may give you time elsewhere, but it's not going to prevent anything.",
        "That's right.",
        "The kinds of restrictions on travel, both air travel, rail travel and trucking, will only have-will only slow it down.",
        "Timothy, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Joining us now is Dr. DA Henderson, distinguished scholar at the Center for Bioterrorism at the University of Pittsburgh; former director of the Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness.",

        "Happy to be here.",
        "I mentioned you had a chance to glance at this plan.",
        "Does it seem to be scaled properly to you?",
        "Well, I think there is an emphasis here, which I think is distracting, and that is the hope that somehow or other you're going to be able to contain or slow an outbreak.",
        "And I think what the difficulty is, there are very few people who've gone back to 1968, 1957, which were both pandemic years--or 1918, and looked at how rapidly this virus spreads across the country.",
        "For example, at the end of August 1957, there were only a few outbreaks in the south of the United States, and--mainly in Louisiana where schools seemed to have opened early.",
        "And seven weeks later, every state in the union had outbreaks, and 47 of the 50 states had more than half of their counties with epidemics.",
        "So you've got a tidal wave like this, which moves very, very rapidly.",
        "And to be distracted and thinking we're going to quarantine or put up some sort of (unintelligible), or we're going to be able to screen people at airports, or what have you, it's unfortunate that there are those putting emphasis on this, when that is not the best use of resources.",
        "What do you find encouraging about the plan?",
        "Well, I think it's encouraging in the sense of making it clear that this does have to be done at local levels.",
        "The planning has to be done at local levels, and there's not going to be resources to come in.",
        "And I think this is something that's very difficult for many to accept.",
        "And I think the difficulty here--and the biggest problem we're going to face, is going to be the tidal wave of patients.",
        "And we've seen, really, every year, in a few cities, there's been flu around, and when it's gone into a city, you have the hospitals fill up very quickly and then they go on what they call bypass, or they do not accept more patients because they have as many--they've accepted as many patients as their professional staffs can handle.",
        "Well, one can predict very safely, that if we have the pandemic through, we're going to have--every hospital is going to be in that position.",
        "And flu healthcare resources, the report points out, are not very mobile.",
        "It's hard to move them from one place to another, or in case of hospitals, you really can't do it.",

        "Why not?",
        "Well, you have--a flu pandemic will involve a good part of the nation fairly quickly, and there will be needs at virtually every city.",
        "The federal resources are comparatively limited and I think they can handle a focal problem, be it an explosion or a hurricane or tornado, by moving people around, but the demand here is just so overwhelming, there's very little you can do.",
        "In terms of hospitals, people have talked about field hospitals or portable units that might be moved.",
        "There are very few of these in the first place.",
        "And the second problem that you have coming in is not only bed space, but who's going to care for the patients?",
        "And if you create more beds, that means you really need more people to take care of the patients, and that's going to be in short supply, because I think the attack rates--that is infection rates--in hospital staffs are going to be very high, because they are the ones that are going to be in contact with a lot of patients.",

        "Henderson, Joe Neel here.",

        "Thanks very much for the call, Terry.",
        "One final question for you before we let you go, Dr. Henderson, and that is that, this reads like a government report.",
        "It's dry language.",
        "It, as you say, skirts around some issues like where we're going to get, you know--whether or not it can be stopped at the border.",

        "Well, the Tamiflu, it is hoped, might be effective in preventing the disease, but it would mean that an individual would have to take a capsule every day.",
        "If you assume that an outbreak is going to go for at least 10 to 12 weeks in a particular city, which is what the history has shown, you would be using the equivalent of 10 treatment doses just to prevent one case of flu and--the treatment of flu requires much less, because you're only giving it for five days--so that if you begin using it for prevention, the very limited supplies that we have are not going to go terribly far.",

        "Well, actually, this is not true.",
        "In fact, we have gone back and looked at records in 1918 and it was surprising the number of patients who died within a matter of three, four days, which would be primary flu infection.",
        "There were certainly some cases where there'd be secondary infection, that is, pneumonias, which could be treated with antibiotics.",
