        "Well, I think there are a number of things that can be done, because influenza will be a problem for individuals who have heart trouble or trouble with their lungs or diabetes or what have you; so we know that we would get a number of patients in with influenza who are going to have other problems that are going to get worse, and that will need treatment.",
        "So that there's going to be a need--a considerable need for medical treatment of patients well beyond just flu, and I think many people have had the feeling we could do like in 1918 and put people in gymnasiums or in armories.",
        "But in 1918 we couldn't do very much and we couldn't do very much in medicine, period, in support.",
        "So they were really warehoused and given food and fluid, but now, you really need more care, and I think this is what worries many of us: what we're going to do to provide anywhere near the quality of care that really is needed to see a lot of these people through this serious problem.",

        "Thank you again for a wonderful program.",
        "My question is, do you have any idea of when it may happen?",

        "I'll be bold enough to take the first part of that question.",
        "No. Dr. Henderson, can you help us out in the second part.",
        "Well, the question, what individuals can do, is fairly limited.",
        "And, I think we would say, wash your hands; if you're sick, stay home.",
        "But beyond that, what can you do--you really can't do anything more than--if you have access to Tamiflu and you get it within 48 hours, this may be helpful.",
        "But I think many of us are not terribly optimistic about the Tamiflu, because the flu virus, the H5N1, seems to develop resistance fairly quickly.",
        "So, as far as an individual's concerned, there are just fairly limited things that one really can do.",
        "Dr.",
        "Henderson, Joe Neel again.",
        "This report will probably be remembered--I mean, there are only a few things that can actually go into the stories that reporters are writing, but the one thing I think will capture people is the idea that the government is recommending that everyone stay three feet apart from each other when they're in the workplace.",
        "Do you think that--is that based on science?",
        "Is that a reasonable thing to expect?",
        "Well, that's pure speculation.",
        "I don't think there's any science base for that.",
        "That's the problem.",
        "And, there is the concern about--if you're ill, you should stay home, but we should not forget that the individual influenza is able to excrete the virus for a couple of days before he gets sick.",
        "So if he stays home when he has symptoms, that's nice; but the two couple of days before, he's already been around to spread it as much as he'd need to spread it.",
        "And what about Terry's other question?",
        "Masks--would they provide protection?",
        "Well, masks are suggested to be put on the people who have the flu and then who may be expelling droplets.",
        "It will prevent some spread by way of droplets, but experience is with the masks, by and large, that they do block a certain amount of air coming through, in particular, if they're a little moist, and then the air just flows around the mask, and so you're really doing very little with it.",
        "Yes, this is true.",
        "And I think my experience in dealing with epidemics--and I've certainly dealt with a lot over my career--is that, to the extent you can keep the things going normally in a city and what have you, and trains running and food purchase and so forth, you have less anxiety; you have less panic.",
        "It's when things get seriously disrupted--the normal services and so forth, that apprehension begins and things get worse.",
        "And this is one of the things that worries me about suggesting that people voluntarily quarantine or we try to quarantine people.",
        "There are an awful lot of people out there that if we're going to quarantine a lot of people that are not going to be able to get paid.",
        "They're hourly workers and they need to continue their jobs.",
        "You have situations here where you would wind up--they're talking about trucking in food, and maybe having to have the Army to drive trucks with--to deliver food.",
        "This is I think--really would be seriously disruptive if you were to this point.",
        "And my own thinking that we--very little we can do to keep the flu from spreading, that is quite clear."

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "There were so many people ill that many of them got no healthcare whatsoever because the doctors and all of the healthcare professionals, such as they were for 1918, completely overwhelmed.",
        "They could not build coffins fast enough to bury the dead and simply stacked them--this was in December of 1918 in New York, so the bodies froze.",
        "And they simply stacked them up and left them stacked like cords of firewood until the next spring."

        "Healthcare is not delivered on the national level.",
        "It's delivered on the local level.",
        "And when I hear the national government is making plans for it to take over the delivery of healthcare services, frankly, it makes me pretty nervous.",
        "And so, is there anything in the national plan that will move decision-making power down to not just the state level, but to the local level?",
        "Joe, that's not my reading of this plan, at all.",
        "It seems to put a lot of emphasis on local and state governments.",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "I don't see--I don't see a federal takeover in this plan, at all.",
        "I think the federal government is actually stepping back and saying, states and local communities, it's your job to figure this out, and local hospitals, you should have a plan.",
        "And you're absolutely right in your first observation that the infrastructure goes very quickly and that's what this plan is pretty--pretty devoted to, is trying to figure out how to mitigate the effects of having the, you know, people who drive the trucks get sick and possibly die and who replaces them and telecommunications breaking down because repair people can't fix things; and, you know, people not being able to run the back offices at the banks and the financial system going awry.",
        "So there's a lot of attention paid to the infrastructure, not that much on telling hospitals and healthcare what to do.",
        "Thanks, Kate.",
        "Are those plans being monitored?",
        "Are the local plans being monitored in any way to make sure that they are, in fact, in place?",

        "Part of the Federal Response Plan that we have worked through the state is, for those in our local health departments, in particular, to report back on a periodic basis on the status of our plan.",
        "But I would point out that that is actually necessary but certainly not sufficient.",
        "Each local government has to be monitoring its own plan to make sure it's on track and going forward, and not to be doing it simply because there's a federal requirement to do so.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And this plan seems to be saying, local, state governments, there's going to be a--we'll help you where we can, but you're on your own.",
        "Does that seem to be your reading of it?",
        "Well, I think the way we're reading it is, number one, we absolutely have to accept local responsibility for those parts of that plan that are ours to do.",
        "The caller that said healthcare is local is absolutely right.",
        "Response to something like this has to be extremely well executed at the local level.",
        "However, part of that execution to be successful has to be for local government to be working to understand, with its healthcare partners and business partners, what it's going to take to respond; and then, in turn, to have a very concrete set of requirements and resource needs that are really beyond the reach of a local government and turned back to the federal government with that very concrete set of resource requirements, and continually request those resources.",
