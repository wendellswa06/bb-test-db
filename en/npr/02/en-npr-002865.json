        "Are you concerned about the level of federal support you may get in the event of a pandemic?",
        "We have, in King County, assumed, from the beginning, that the federal level of support, because of the nature of the pandemic like this where it's nationwide and, in fact, worldwide, would not be the same level of support we could expect, for example, with an earthquake.",
        "So we have assumed all along that this is really on our shoulders and we have good fortune in our county to have a county executive who also shares that perspective and has been working with us to identify some local resources that do go beyond the federal resources to do our local planning.",
        "So we have entered into this with all of our community and business and healthcare partners assuming that this would fall on us as a responsibility, but not assuming that there would be no federal financial assistance once we understood what that gap was between what our available local resources are and what we would need to actually respond.",
        "And we just have a few seconds left before we have to go to a break, but are you--is the county stockpiling food and bottled water and Tamiflu and that sort of thing?",
        "Are you advising your citizens to do that?",
        "Yes, yes, and yes.",
        "We have passed an appropriation in our county for enough Tamiflu to get us started with healthcare workers and first-line responders.",
        "And we are also advising our families and our communities to stockpile food, water, and medications for chronic diseases to last up to six weeks.",

        "Yes, I'm a funeral director and I'm curious if the federal government's considered, you know, how people are going to pay for funerals.",
        "I mean, funerals don't do financing, finance planning or anything like that and most people don't have that kind of money to come up with all at once.",
        "And you know, charities are going to be tapped out, so where's the money going to come from to bury all of the dead?",

        "I would think this would be local.",
        "I think the question that we are facing in our county regarding that is simply, first of all, the safe-the number of deaths, as you're pointing out, that might be imminent within a six to eight period--week period of time.",
        "And we're just beginning to get our arms around those numbers.",
        "I do not see anything in the federal guide that addresses that issue, in particular.",
        "And so I think, again, every local county and health department needs to be looking to see what those fatalities might, in fact, be and what some of those plans might be.",
        "Well, is that something on a local level that you all have taken into consideration because, you know, from what I understand, I mean, there's going to be far more people ill that can be helped through the healthcare, but that seems to be the main focus.",
        "We're going to have so many bodies that--and with regulations today, you know, you just can't stack people like cord wood back in 1918.",
        "And it may not be January in Buffalo.",
        "Anyway.",
        "Right.",
        "We do have a team working in King County on massive fatality planning just because of the issues that you're addressing; and I think it's important that we come up with a plan that is both very respectful of those families that are grieving, as well as something that will also meet the needs in terms of the public health requirements for how to actually manage that number of potential deaths in a very short period of time.",
        "So we're just in the beginning, but we do actually have a team, that's our mass fatality planning team, to take a look at all those questions.",
        "Joe Neel?",
        "And I might--I might point out that Seattle is one of the cities that's most advanced in its planning.",

        "There was an aggressive public health intervention done in several places where it was starting to break out.",
        "That was quite successful.",
        "And it just didn't, for whatever--I can't remember my SARS history at the moment, as to how virulent the virus really was.",
        "But it would have to do with whether SARS is more virulent than the flu, and also how quickly, or how easily it spreads.",
        "So, I--there was quite a bit of panic when SARS was spreading, so I think that in part is--has generated, has helped generate concern here about a possible pandemic flu.",
