        "Bob Rivard, San Antonio and Houston received the largest number of Rita evacuees.",
        "How's the city holding up?",
        "And how are your readers reacting to whatever FEMA's planning for the survivors?",
        "Well, we have taken in quite a few evacuees, more than 12,000 from Katrina and many thousands from Rita.",
        "Of course, Houston was much more of an evacuee center for Katrina, but once Rita hit, Houston had to evacuate and more and more people poured into San Antonio.",
        "But the local officials handled it really well and it's gone very smoothly and we're now down to less than 2,000 evacuees in the city shelters, the four shelters, about 900 of them left over from Katrina and a little bit more than a thousand left over from Rita.",
        "And, you know, some of the people have just sort of been absorbed into the local population that left the shelter, and a lot of people, once they got back on their feet, just found their ways out of the city and on their way to homes of friends and family or back home.",
        "Well, I want to talk about going to dim sum.",
        "My Chinese husband and I go to dim sum with our girls every Christmas Day because what else is there to do?",
        "Nothing else is open.",
        "And then, later, we will be going to see a movie.",
        "A former foreign service officer whose career focused on Europe, Kurt Volker was an ambassador to NATO at the end of the Bush administration.",
        "By the time Russia annexed Crimea and fomented an uprising in eastern Ukraine, Volker was running the McCain Institute and was critical of the Obama administration's approach.",
        "Here's how he put it in an interview in 2015 on the sidelines of a conference in Munich.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)",
        "The most frequent phrase you hear out of mouths now is there is no military solution.",
        "And I think we just have to reject that.",
        "We are seeing a military solution play out before our eyes on the ground in Ukraine, and it happens to be one that we don't like.",
        "It's Putin's military solution.",
        "Volker was brought into the State Department as special Ukraine envoy at a time when the upper diplomatic ranks were thinning.",
        "And he faced a daunting challenge with President Trump, according to Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
        "Donald Trump came into office with a very bad attitude about Ukraine.",
        "As a candidate, he repeatedly talked about how Crimea would have been happier being part of Russia and how basically Ukraine was secondary to his all-important goal of resetting relations with the Kremlin.",
        "Weiss says Volker came in against that backdrop.",
        "And in a very bureaucratically nimble way put U.S.-Ukraine relations on a track of continuity with what the previous administration had been doing, plus a couple of added incentives, including these much talked about shipments of anti-tank weapons from the Pentagon."

        "Volker had to recuse himself from those deals as he made a big push to get defensive weapons to Ukraine.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "In Ukraine's case, it is particularly important because it is under attack every day.",
        "And so it has a desperate need to strengthen these defensive capabilities and prevent any further loss of territory, hold the line and hopefully create the conditions where peace can again be negotiated.",
        "He was speaking there in May before President Trump temporarily delayed the military aid package.",
        "Lawmakers are now investigating whether Trump used that aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt about former Vice President Joe Biden and his son.",
        "Volker's role in helping Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, make contacts with the new Ukrainian government is also under investigation.",
        "Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee who traveled to Ukraine recently, sees Volker as a patriot.",
        "My esteem for Kurt, frankly, makes me even more disappointed that he has become part of this mess and perhaps facilitated the corruption of the State Department.",
        "Volker resigned as special representative last week, and Murphy is calling on him to speak up now.",
        "I'm glad that Kurt stepped down, and now he needs to, you know, fess up to what he knows and what he did.",
        "The whistleblower complaint says Volker was trying to help the incoming Ukrainian president navigate President Trump's demands.",
        "Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters today his department was carrying now U.S.",
        "foreign policy.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "That's what our team, including Ambassador Volker, were focused on, was taking down a threat that Russia poses there in Ukraine.",
        "It was about helping the Ukrainians to get graft out and corruption outside of their government."

        "Well, when you're setting up the phone, there's a little set of instructions that will tell you to scan your thumb or finger from different angles.",

        "So it has to take multiple readings of your print and then piece them together.",
        "The theory is if they do this right you won't have to pick up the phone in exactly the same way every time for this to work.",
        "You know, Apple's not the first company to have tried this.",
        "Motorola introduced a fingerprint scanner back in a phone in 2011 and it received tepid reviews.",

        "But I asked Apple that and I didn't get a clear response.",
        "The thing about any biometric system is there are actually two ways biometrics generally fails, and they're related.",
        "The first way a system like this can fail is it might allow someone who is not me to access my phone.",
        "It could identify your finger as mine and turn it on.",
        "That might be awkward, but it's unlikely to be completely disastrous."
