        "The second kind of failure is that I pick it up my phone and it doesn't let me in - a false negative.",
        "Now, if Apple designed a system that generated millions of false negatives and customers weren't able to get into their phones, that would be a commercial disaster.",
        "So it's pretty likely that Apple has tried to build a system here that delivers more to deliver false positives than false negatives.",
        "So when this phone hits the streets, I'm going to be really curious to see how secure it is in the real world, and whether or not people figure out how to hack it.",
        "Well, on that thought, thanks very much.",
        "Oh, my pleasure.",
        "I grew up in a household of six kids - not such a big deal in 1960s Flint, Michigan.",
        "That's award-winning children's book author Jon Scieszka.",
        "Six kids was a big deal to at least one person - his mother - because all six were boys.",
        "So in our house, a lot of things got broken - couches, cars, collarbones.",
        "My mom had this rule about no wrestling, especially in the living room.",
        "But what are you going to do if your older brother Jim jumps on your back in the living room?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Flip him over your head, onto the couch, maybe into a window.",
        "When I was growing up, I thought everyone wrestled to settle every question, like who gets the last pizza?",
        "Wrestle.",
        "Who gets to sit in the front seat of the car?",
        "Wrestle.",
        "Who is the better, smarter, stronger?",
        "Definitely wrestle.",
        "So in this hierarchy of six boys, we wrestled and got wrestled.",
        "We teased and got teased.",
        "We pranked and got pranked.",
        "You took a punch or two from the guy older than you, then you tried out that punch or noogie or sleeper hold on the guys younger than you.",
        "That's how we played, which is why, as the two oldest brothers, Jim and I figured it was perfectly fine to rope Tom in bed with our dad's ties.",
        "Also, why it was very generous of us to give Brian and Jeff a 10-second running head start before we tried to shoot them with our new BB gun.",
        "And why it was absolutely fine to, you know, cross swords while we were all going to the bathroom at the same time and accidentally peeing on Gregg and some of the smaller guys, who were a bit shorter and had to stand a lot closer to the toilet.",
        "What I learned about being one of six brothers was the value of decisive action.",
        "Even if that action was dropping Jeff down the laundry chute because he was being so annoying.",
        "To earn respect, you followed through on your word.",
        "Doesn't matter what you say.",
        "It matters what you do.",
        "Today, now that all of us Scieszka brothers have matured into the wisdom of that certain age, we settle our differences and disagreements in exactly the same way.",
        "At the most recent Scieszka brother golf outing, Gregg cracked a rib and demolished a coffee table when we deflected his full extension couch dive attack.",
        "And we gave Brian and Jeff a 10-second running head start before we started driving golf balls at them down the hotel hallway."

        "There have been fund-raisers as small as kids on the corners with lemonade stands to some of the major restaurants holding large gatherings and galas.",

        "And I would say Bush supporters and detractors alike were taken by surprise by the nomination and probably are in a wait-and-see mode to see how she does in the hearings as someone who has never sat on the bench."
