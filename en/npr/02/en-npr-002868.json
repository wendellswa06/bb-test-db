        "In Baghdad today, a breakthrough for Iraq's newly formed government.",
        "Iraqi leaders have settled on who will fill the last open Cabinet-level positions in the new government.",
        "A vote by the full National Assembly is scheduled for Sunday.",
        "But also today, a Western convoy was hit by two suicide car bombers in central Baghdad.",
        "The US Embassy says 22 died in the attack including two American security contractors.",
        "NPR's Peter Kenyon is in Baghdad.",
        "Hi, Peter.",
        "Hi, Linda.",
        "What can you tell us about these last appointments?",
        "We understand two Cabinet-level positions will go to Sunnis?",
        "Well, it looks that way, yes.",
        "There's a meeting of the Iraqi National Assembly tomorrow, and according to politicians, including one of the Cabinet ministers that I spoke with today, they'll be presented with a new list, the final list, everyone hopes, including a Sunni Defense minister, is probably the most prominent position.",
        "His name's Saadoun Dulaimi; he's part of a large Sunni tribe.",
        "And then over at the oil ministry, another key position; I spoke with a nominee today, Bahr Al-Ulaum.",
        "He was the original oil minister under the Iraqi Governing Council right after the war.",
        "Now his renaming may signal the end of the temporary reign of Shiite former exile Ahmad Chalabi, who's been the acting oil minister.",
        "That indirectly would be a relief to the Sunnis because Chalabi's been one of the fiercest proponents of de-Baathification, the elimination of Sunni Baath Party members under Saddam Hussein from any position of power in the new Iraq.",
        "So after a number of false starts, people here are hoping that this time the new government really will be on its feet.",
        "Now the power vacuum left by these protracted talks over the Cabinet makeup is being blamed in part for the wave of violence by insurgents that's left over 200 Iraqis dead in the past 10 days.",
        "If this agreement holds, does it look like that might help the government turn things around?",
        "Well, you're absolutely right.",
        "The frustration at the delaying and the dickering has been increasingly loud and angry, and it's not clear whether they can now turn things around, certainly not quickly.",
        "To take the defense minister as an example, Dulaimi is not beloved among all Sunnis.",
        "Some question his credentials, noting that he lived in exile from 1984 until the end of the US-led invasion in 2003.",
        "Others say he's the choice of the former president, Sunni tribe leader Ghazi al-Yawer, not necessarily the clans that Prime Minister al-Jafari should be trying to win over, those suspected of aiding the insurgency; their top choices have all been vetoed however.",
        "The hope, of course, is that bringing Sunnis into the process will help turn things around, but it's been such a process of fits and starts that it's really anyone's guess how quickly that turnaround could begin.",
        "Peter, can you tell us anything else about the car bombing today in Baghdad?",
        "Well, I've spoken with the US Embassy, and it was a pair of suicide car bombers on a crowded street near a girls' high school.",
        "Some students among the wounded, but the target--sport utility vehicles used by an American security contractor.",
        "The embassy says two American contractors were among the dead, a very large bombing in a crowded area.",
        "It's been the story ever since this new government was announced, from the north in Irbil to the south in Suwayrah and very often right here in Baghdad.",
        "Iraqis are hoping for improvement, but by no means certain that they'll get it.",
        "Thanks to NPR's Peter Kenyon, who was reporting from Baghdad."

        "An execution in the state of Alabama is raising more questions about a controversial drug used in lethal injections.",
        "Late last night, Alabama executed Ronald Bert Smith, a convicted murderer.",
        "In that process, the state gave him midazolam, a sedative.",
        "Smith's lawyers had objected to using that drug.",
        "Death penalty opponents say it is ineffective and that prisoners go through excruciating pain caused by the lethal drugs.",
        "The Supreme Court has ruled midazolam can be used, and it was in this case.",
        "Kent Faulk, a reporter for The Birmingham News, witnessed the execution.",
        "And at the beginning of the execution, he says he watched as Smith heaved, coughed and appeared to move.",
        "I spoke to him by Skype.",
        "The whole process began about 10:25.",
        "Several minutes into it, the process of putting the midazolam in through the IVs apparently began.",
        "And soon after that, Mr. Smith began I guess gasping for breath.",
        "His chest would heave up.",
        "His hips - I guess he was trying to get off of the gurney that he was strapped onto.",
        "I guess I could describe it best as a kind of a guppy-out-of-water gasping, and that lasted for about 13 minutes.",
        "He would also intermittently start coughing.",
        "And at one point, he clenched his left fist.",
        "Faulk says a state corrections captain then performed what's called a consciousness check.",
        "It has three parts.",
        "He calls out the name loudly, then brushes the eye back and then pinches the inmate behind his left arm.",
        "They did that consciousness test during the middle of him coughing and everything, and then they waited for a while and administered the test a second time.",
        "And in your view, did he respond to the consciousness test?",
        "It was hard to tell because he was coughing and gasping for breath.",
        "So I don't know if that was voluntary or involuntary.",
        "You have witnessed other executions using these drugs.",
        "Is the coughing and gasping for breath typical?",
        "Of three lethal injections I have witnessed, that was the first time I've seen an inmate make movements like that.",
        "And yet the execution proceeded."

        "Because critical employers like GE Aviation in Rutland are having a hard time finding new workers.",
        "It's pushed the state to get creative.",

        "In Rutland, that may mean mountain biking or hiking, a trip to the local brewpub or the farmer's market, which is where I run into Christopher and Heather Emerson, a Michigan couple who were at the meet and greet the night before.",

        "I was like, wait, people want to help other people these days?",
        "Who does that?",
        "State officials say of the 28 people who took part in Stay to Stay weekends in June and August, 10 have already moved to Vermont or are in the process."

        "So what are the implications of this going forward?",

        "He's asked Bill Barr to undertake somewhat of an investigation, although the parameters of that investigation have not really been described publicly.",
        "And the president has now stripped the directors of CIA, NSA and the director of national intelligence from their authority to control classified information.",

        "Well, the power to declassify information is also the power to selectively declassify information.",
        "So if Bill Barr, in his investigation, comes upon snippets of intelligence that bolster the president's political narrative, then he has the apparent authority under this order issued last night to declassify selectively that information.",
