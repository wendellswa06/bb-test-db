        "Well, you know, you write in your book about your mother who strictly followed the Jewish dietary laws when she was at home.",

        "How does this operate?",
        "Oh that, it's very interesting.",
        "You know, mom would do that.",
        "You know, she would go out, we would go out once a year or twice a year, usually once on Christmas, and then she eats shrimp and lobster sauce.",
        "And you'll find that quite a few Jews who aren't of, I guess you'd say the Orthodox group, the conservative reform, will often keep kosher at home.",
        "But when they leave home -for righter reasons, they seem to eat shellfish, but very often will not eat the pork.",
        "So, yeah.",
        "I guess it's just their own personal secular interpretation of what the dietary laws are all about.",

        "Is this just coincidence or is there actually real connection there?",
        "I think it's a coincidence.",
        "If you look at the cultural traditions all around the world, taking some dough and wrapping around a meat or vegetable product, you know, it's pretty ubiquitous, I think, with culinary cuisines.",
        "You have the ravioli in Italy.",
        "You know, the kreplach, as you said, are the Jewish cuisine; the wontons of the Chinese cuisines.",
        "So I just think that there happens to be a coincidence.",

        "There's one interesting culinary transmission, if I may, that during the Song Dynasty, Jews that converted were given Chinese surnames.",

        "And that is a Sephardic Jewish dish out of either Portugal or Spain.",
        "So I thought that was kind of interesting.",
        "Hmm.",
        "When you go out for Chinese food on Christmas, do you have special dishes that you order every year?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "At this particular restaurant, I just told the shop and the owner to prepare something that she would eat on - for a banquet which didn't have pork or shellfish.",
        "And so she has prepared a banquet for us.",

        "It used to be Chinese food in movies, but now it's expanded to special events.",
        "He writes, I'm a professional storyteller and will be telling stories at Afikomen, our local Jewish bookstore here in Berkeley, California.",
        "I've heard by e-mail of at least half a dozen local Jewish events going on later in the day - concerts, parties and so on.",
        "It seems that Jews are specially inclined to plan events on years when Hanukkah comes early as it did this year.",
        "Professor Siegel, have you found this to be the case?",
        "Well, not here that I know of in the Jewish community that, you know, generally here in Syracuse to my knowledge, people go to the Chinese restaurant and still go to the movies afterwards.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But that's an interesting idea to have a special function on Christmas, you know, such as the caller, Greg, had suggested, the Chinese dinner in Fiddler's sing-along.",
        "It's kind of amusing."
