        "Hi.",
        "About the Jewish-Chinese culinary connection, I grew up - whenever I went to New York to visit my grandfather, we would go to a Chinese restaurant and the owner would usher us in and feed us everything and have us not pay.",
        "And the story was that when my grandfather, who was just a lawyer kind of a, you know, one-person shop lawyer, one of his colleagues came in one day and said, oh, I have this client.",
        "He needs a liquor license.",
        "I don't have time to deal with it.",

        "And from then on, words spreads around the port that if you wanted a liquor license, Hyman Frank was the one to go to.",
        "And so he got liquor licenses for I don't know how many Chinese restaurants but that was part of my childhood, my Jewish childhood, I should say.",
        "A real symbiotic relationship there.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Okay.",
        "Stephanie, thanks a lot for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "This is an e-mail from Emuna(ph) in Berkeley, who writes: I'm working at a Jewish deli and restaurant in the heart of Berkeley's Gourmet Ghetto.",
        "It's the busiest day of the year.",
        "And while I'm not with my family, I am spending the day with a horde of friends - regular customers, neighborhood friends, coworkers, so I feel it is a wonderful way to celebrate Christmas Day.",
        "She writes the fact that we are so incredibly busy on Christmas Day shows that in the U.S., Christmas Day is really a day for family and friends and that we all have traditions which have evolved from that.",
        "And Professor Don Siegel, it strikes me that this is really true for you, too.",
        "Even though Christmas is a day that is set aside for Christians to celebrate with family and friends, here you are at a big banquet table of everybody from your synagogue, doing a very similar sort of thing.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "It's become part of our family and community tradition.",
        "And so I agree with your comment.",
        "Traditions are wonderful when you bring people, family and friends together.",
        "Have the Chinese restaurant owners in your town come to know and expect you?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "They're familiar, you know, with me because of the book and so forth.",
        "And this is one of the two very good Chinese restaurants.",
        "The other one is China Road.",
        "And there, the - I'm sort of the - the chef, Simon Teng is - he actually cooked for Nixon many years ago when (unintelligible) came.",

        "And it's not just the party places that could feel the crunch; helium is used in a number of applications - from MRI machines to microchip production, from laser welding to launching spacecraft.",

        "And since then, there have been periods where the market was a little bit tighter, and periods where it was supplied a little bit better.",

        "Where does helium come from and how does it get put into the supply system?",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, probably a surprise to most people is that helium -all the helium that's produced commercially is a by-product of natural gas processing.",
        "So, only in certain parts of the world, there's enough helium in the natural gas to enable you to recover it economically.",
        "So when they drill for natural gas, do they normally siphon off and store the helium or does it let - they just let it go into the atmosphere?",
        "Most of the helium that's in natural gas is not recovered.",
        "You know, almost all natural gas has trace amounts of helium, but not enough to bother with.",
        "So, it would go through the pipeline with the natural gas and it would be a component of the gas that's burned that just doesn't burn.",
        "Hmm.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "So why now are - you know, is there a shortage?",
        "Well, this shortage is pretty much supply-driven.",
        "I mean there is growth in the market, but the growth hasn't been outrageous, it's probably five percent growth.",
        "But the - what's really happened is there've been problems on the supply side.",
        "And, in particular, there's been a new plant in Algeria that came on later than expected, and with about half of the anticipated capacity.",
        "A new plant in Qatar has ramped up more slowly than expected.",
        "The world's largest source, which is an Exxon Mobil plant in Wyoming, has been running at about 80 to 85 percent of capacity since April of '07, due to an operating problem.",
        "And also, the U.S.",
        "Bureau of Land Management, which operates a pipeline that connects six of the helium refineries, has put some restrictions on those refineries in terms of how much crude helium they are able to take out of the pipeline to run through their plants.",
        "So, the world has actually lost some of its existing capacity because of those restrictions."
