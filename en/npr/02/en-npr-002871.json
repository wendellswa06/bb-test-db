        "Well, helium has a lot of different applications and, of course, you mentioned MRI, which is the single biggest application.",
        "In that application, liquid helium, which is the coldest substance on the Earth, minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit, is used as refrigerant.",
        "And at liquid helium temperatures, the wires in the superconducting magnets lose their resistance to electricity.",
        "So, that's the largest application for helium.",
        "But it's also used as a shielding gas by welders and it's got some high-tech applications.",
        "It's used in the manufacture of semiconductors, optical fibers, and flat panel displays is a growing application.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It's ironic since helium is one of the most abundant gases in the universe.",
        "Yeah, it's - when you hear that it's one of those abundant gasses in the universe, you know, everybody's next question is always, okay, why is there a shortage?",

        "I was curious at this shortage, particularly since it's going to go on, if it's spurned any types of new technologies or other elements that we're looking to replace helium.",
        "Well, I think the biggest thing - you know, whenever there's a shortage of a commodity and helium is just another chemical commodity, prices go up and prices have gone up, and among other things, as a result of price increases, some of the bug users of helium are looking harder at helium recycling or helium recovery.",
        "So, you know, there are certain applications or you can recycle the helium and reduce its usage.",
        "Also, you know, the MRI manufacturers, compared to the early generation machines, the more recent generation machines are much, much more efficient in their helium usage.",
        "And there are substitutes for helium in welding.",
        "We can use different gasses than helium to do pretty much the same thing.",
        "So, you know, there definitely is a move to look for substitutes or to - in this increased interest in recycling, for sure.",
        "Here's a question from avatar in \"\"Second Life.\"\" Idelequest(ph) asks, helium shortage?",
        "I thought the U.S.",
        "has over 90 percent of the world helium reserve.",
        "Well, I don't think that 90 percent figure is correct.",
        "I think, historically, the world produced most of the world's helium - U.S., rather, produced most of the world's helium.",
        "And for many years, the only source outside of the U.S.",
        "was a plant in Poland.",
        "But what you're seeing now is, I believe, more of the new production that comes into being in the next few years will be related to LNG production.",
        "And there are very large natural gas fields in Qatar and Iran, and large gas deposits in eastern Siberia that have helium in them.",
        "And as those gas fields are brought into production, you will see more helium production outside of the U.S.",
        "But…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…there are large reserves in the U.S., but there's also extremely large reserve elsewhere.",
        "That's a very big federal reserve, right?",
        "It's like an oil reserve but one for helium, save for, what, rainy days or - how does that work?",
        "The government has a strategic stockpile of helium that is located near Amarillo, Texas in a depleted natural gas field called the Cliffside Field.",
        "And that strategic reserve was created by a bill that was passed in 1960.",
        "And there's still large quantity of helium stored there, over 20 bcf, and that's like three years world demand.",
        "So, there's a lot of helium in the strategic reserve."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And if we run out of natural gas or the supply goes down, does that mean our potential for finding helium goes down with it?",
        "Well, helium production is definitely tied to natural gas production.",
        "And at some point in the future, I think it's still quite a ways out when the world hits peak natural gas, it will probably hit peak helium.",
        "But I still think that's many years into the future.",
        "Unlike, you know, people talk about peak oil and, you know, there's actually a lot of people think we're getting close to peak oil in the world.",

        "Hmm.",

        "No, I really think that's many, many years out and by that time, there may be new technology for MRI that doesn't require helium to cool magnets.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You know, that's a good question.",

        "There's - many of our customers who think that we have a secret stash of helium and that if they just offered us enough money, they can get more of it.",
        "The problem with helium - and this is kind of unique, it's a byproduct of natural gas production, and the investments required to develop the natural gas production are many, many times bigger than the investments required for the helium recovery.",
