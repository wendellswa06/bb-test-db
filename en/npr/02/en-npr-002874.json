        "Why would he be wearing glasses to a torch-lit rally that could get ugly?",
        "Decker says Storyful has a lot of tricks in its bag to verify, including looking at Quinn's social media accounts, which would probably have given clues about his whereabouts.",
        "But usually the standard rule of thumb is that if you can raise enough doubt about something without even using any of the tech tools, odds are there's a decent chance that, you know, you're right.",
        "Still, at Storyful, they use a lot of technical tools that can help figure out where and when a photo was taken even if it's been altered.",

        "Though as word has gotten out that he wasn't at the rally, it's slowed down.",
        "I understand the anger and frustration that's out there about what happened in Charlottesville.",
        "It was awful, and I understand that people want to be able to do something about it.",
        "I don't know what the right way is, but I can tell you being on the receiving end, this is not the way to go about it.",

        "Here's what Tilly and his colleagues did.",
        "First, they got some ovarian tissue from young women.",
        "Then they isolated cells that appear identical to the ones they had found in mice.",
        "Next they say they showed that the cells could develop into eggs in a dish in the laboratory.",

        "The researchers injected the cells back into human ovarian tissue to see if they would turn into eggs on their own.",
        "To make sure they were looking at the right cells, the scientists genetically engineered them to glow green.",
        "Voila.",
        "The cells started turning into eggs and even formed crucial structures called follicles.",
        "That, Tilly says, nailed it.",
        "It is those follicle structures that are key to maturing that enclosed egg cell to the point that it becomes able to accept a sperm and produce an embryo.",
        "The implications of all this are potentially enormous.",
        "Tilly says it could eventually help restore fertility to women who have become infertile for all sorts of reasons - chemotherapy, early menopause or just normal aging.",
        "So, like men, they wouldn't have to choose between school, jobs and having kids.",

        "We're creating as a world one in which it's increasingly hard for people to have children when they're young, and then saying, but wait, we have solutions, technology, we can do it when you're older.",
        "And that's the part that kind of disturbs me.",
        "While many fertility experts are excited about the possibilities this research raises, others remain skeptical.",
        "They say a lot more work is needed to confirm Tilly's claims and try to understand what's really going on.",

        "DR. DAVID ALBERTINI: I don't see this as really being applicable in the near future for the treatment of infertility.",
        "That would be pie in the sky.",
        "Despite the skeptics, Tilly is focusing on the next step.",
        "He's working with colleagues in Britain to try to fertilize eggs made from these cells to prove they can make an embryo that someday could be implanted in a woman's womb.",
        "And the hope is that could result in a healthy baby."

        "Ouchley says all those trees help slow down the water.",
        "That's one reason towns in the Atchafalaya Basin that were predicted to flood by now have been spared so far.",

        "These nutrients could be taken up by all of these trees that stretch to the horizon.",
