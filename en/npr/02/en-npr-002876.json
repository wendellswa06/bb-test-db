        "And you begin with that tale of two rivers.",
        "The contrast, you argue, is the key to your first killer app: competition.",
        "Yes, if you're trying to work out why in the course of the period after around 1500 or the 1490s the West, meaning Europe and later on its colonies and settlements, forged ahead of the rest and particularly the big empires of the Orient like Ming China, the one answer that leaps out is that there was a very different institutional structure at the western end of Eurasia.",
        "And that took multiple forms.",
        "For example, there are many, many small states.",
        "It's very fragmented politically, whereas China is this monolithic empire with a centralized bureaucracy.",
        "And even within the European states, there's competition between corporate entities, like for example the corporation of the City of London, which the English crown doesn't really control.",
        "So it's a very different institutional setup, and this manifests itself when, in the early 1400s and the 1420s and the 1430s, the Chinese emperor decides to stop oceanic navigation, cancel the great voyages of Admiral Zheng He, which had far exceeded anything Europeans had achieved at that time, going right across the Indian Ocean to the African coast, whereas in Europe, nobody could have done that.",
        "The competition between Portugal and the Italian city-states and then Spain, later The Netherlands and England, the competition to get trade routes and wrest them from the control of other countries propelled an age of exploration, an age of navigation, of commerce and conquest and colonization quite unlike anything that emerged from the Orient."

        "So that's the starting point for my argument.",
        "What I'm really saying is it's the institutions that matter, not national character, not geography, not the weather, not the various theories that have been tried in the past, but these institutions, manmade things that fundamentally changed the incentives that the people had.",
        "To just illustrate, those great treasure fleets the Chinese sent out, their purpose was largely to win some form of glorification for the emperor, that these far-flung places would accept suzerainty, that they would make tribute to China, but the money itself was not that significant.",
        "It was the idea of political glory and empire, whereas Vasco De Gama was out for two things: One, to get very, very rich, and to do it by sticking it to those Venetians.",
        "Right, so the spice trade is one of the things that propels the Portuguese to keep on sailing until they find, finally, that there is a way around the bottom of Africa.",
        "And it's clear that that kind of motivation wasn't at work in the case of Zheng He.",
        "I mean, there may have been some exchange of goods, but the main model for the early 15th century Ming expeditions to the gulf and the East African coast was essentially to get tribute, to get people in these far-flung places to acknowledge that the emperor of China really was top dog.",
        "And that in a sense created no particular reason to keep on going there.",

        "And they'd literally take a giraffe back to the emperor as a token of esteem.",
        "So it's a completely different model.",
        "And I think crucially, the power exists in China for the successor to the Yongle Emperor who got the giraffe to say: We don't really need these things.",
        "That's not our priority.",
        "In fact, I'm a little suspicious of this stuff.",
        "There's great scholarship on why it was that the Ming turned away from oceanic navigation and essentially abolished that capacity.",
        "I mean, we don't even have good drawings of Admiral Zheng He's treasure fleet.",
        "The drawings were destroyed, as well as the ships.",
        "Maybe it was because they were more worried that the northwestern frontier, that the Great Wall border, maybe it was some kind of palace infighting that was going on in the Ming capital - which incidentally was Nanjing in 1411.",
        "It was - later it was moved to Beijing, when they built the spectacular Forbidden City.",
        "We're not 100 percent sure why this happened, but the fact that it was possible for one man sitting in an imperial capital simply to cancel all oceanic voyages, that was one of the key institutional differences because if anybody had tried to do that in Europe - suppose the Holy Roman Emperor had said, right, enough of this exploration, the peripheral countries like Portugal would just have said, well, forget it, we're going ahead, try and stop us.",
