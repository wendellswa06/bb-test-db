        "I think that's a really puzzling thing, and why it was that Islamic science declined even as Western science rose, that's one of the big questions that modern scholars debate.",
        "I think the main explanation for this is that the power of the clergy was growing, in particularly say the Ottoman Empire, which, you know, by the 17th century is the big player in the Islamic world and certainly the player nearest to Europe.",
        "Meanwhile, the power of the churches is in fact waning in 17th-century Europe in the wake of the Reformation.",
        "So there is a kind of fundamental divergence in that respect.",
        "Also, Europe had printing, and that had been banned in the Ottoman Empire.",
        "And printing is pretty important because it spread scientific knowledge.",
        "As the Reformation raised literacy rates so that people could read the Bible, it created the possibility that they could read, well, anything, including, as it turned out, scientific treatises.",
        "So this is another killer app.",
        "And I call it the scientific revolution to distinguish it from science more generally.",
        "There was plenty of science in the non-Western world prior to the 17th century, but after the 17th century, it's extraordinary the extent to which scientific innovation is led by the Western world.",
        "It is not Euro-centrism or anti-Orientalism to say that the rise of Western civilization is the single most important historical phenomenon of the second half of the second millennium after Christ, writes Niall Ferguson in his book \"\"Civilization,\"\" it is a statement of the obvious.",
        "So we want to hear from history teachers and students of history.",

        "Hi, just had a question for you both, whether or not you thought - while I agree about the killer apps discussion that you're talking about, I wonder about truly how much of this advancement was also made as a result of military efforts, or at least during the Crusades, you know, getting that medical knowledge from the Middle East, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that.",
        "Sure, Mike.",
        "Well, the mathematical knowledge doesn't seem to have come from the Crusaders.",
        "It's something I wrote about in my last book, \"\"The Ascent of Money.\"\" It's from merchants, actually, who cross the Mediterranean and bring the new knowledge of algebra, (foreign language spoken), to people like Fibonacci, whose father was a merchant who worked in North Africa."

        "That's the route whereby mathematical learning returns into the Italian city-states, where there's a great commercial culture already, and they need this kind of more sophisticated mathematics.",
        "But you raise a really important point about the way military power plays a role in my argument.",
        "It's very tempting, and it's been done for years, to say that Western ascendancy is just a consequence of empire and ruthless exploitative expansion.",
        "And the point that I want to try and make is that the least original thing that Western societies did after 1500 was empire.",
        "Empire was ubiquitous.",
        "It was what the Chinese had.",
        "It was what the Turks had.",
        "It was the norm.",
        "It's what the Incas had, for that matter.",
        "And a critical question is: Why was it that when the Europeans went into the empire business, they were consistently successful in the wars that they fought and the territories that they conquered?",
        "And one very good explanation for this is that the scientific revolution made Europeans much more effective at war.",
        "I give the example of Benjamin Robins.",
        "He's the guy, a self-taught English mathematician, ironically a Quaker, who applied Newtonian physics to ballistics and created modern artillery, made, if you like, Western guns accurate by showing what it was that happened when you fired a projectile out of a barrel.",
        "And that meant that once you had, from the mid-18th century, European artillery operating on scientific principles, it was really hard to beat a European army, and hardly anybody ever did.",

        "And he goes on to list some things about Western empires that aren't in the world: The Black War in Australia, French reparations forced upon the liberated state of Haiti, Belgians exterminating 10 million people in the Congo, British ordering - and it goes on.",
        "The list of atrocities of Western empires is legion."

        "John Locke's concept that there's a link between freedom of the individual and private property rights, that the law should protect these and that representative government is a way whereby property rights can be protected through participatory legislation."

        "All of this is there in the book, but I also point out that Locke saw property rights applying not only to land but also to people.",
        "And of course the land that new colonists settled in North America was often land taken from native peoples, sometimes by force and sometimes just because the depredations of disease left the population so thinned and weakened that there was no resistance.",
        "And when it came to the ownership of people, Western civilization took an ancient institution that was certainly to be found in non-Western societies, namely slavery, and rolled it out in all kinds of new forms in the new world, in the Caribbean and in the Americas.",
        "And one of the things that I think illustrates your point is the way that, over time, there was a debate within Western civilization about the legitimacy of slavery, and the very people who had been the most ardent slavers, the British, end up leading a very successful campaign to eradicate slavery, beginning with the slave trade and then the institution of slavery itself.",
        "And the United States and Brazil belatedly accept that this is no longer a legitimate institution in a society that bases itself on ideas like freedom.",
        "Now having said all that and agreed with you, I then have to kind of put the sting in the tail, rather as I tend to do when I talk to Steve Pinker.",
        "There's this small problem and that is that between 1914 and '45, or even longer than that if you include the Korean War, we see extraordinary levels of organized, lethal violence as the great Western empires turn on one another and engage in the two worst wars in recorded history.",
        "That's a big problem for the argument about linear progress, and it's one reason that I'm a little skeptical about the idea that we've kind of gotten better, and we just carry on getting better.",
        "One thing that's certainly true is that we've got better at making very, very destructive weapons and that there's one argument which says that the reason we've had relative peace in the world or at least limited wars between major states is that we developed weapons so destructive that we finally became afraid to use them, and that's a funny kind of progress, isn't it?",
        "Mark, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "There is an argument that many will be familiar with, put forward by Jared Diamond in \"\"Guns, Germs and Steel.\"\" You address this in the book, as well, that the West benefitted from the fortunes of geography and being exposed to all kinds of germs that it would later spread to all the rest of the world, and having already become rather accustomed to them, and unfortunates elsewhere were not, and that there are other elements of geography, including rivers and ports and that sort of thing that all worked to the advantage of the Western Europeans.",
        "I'm a huge admirer of Jared Diamond, and I've been inspired by him and indeed influenced by him.",
        "I think the idea that competition is a killer app, I credit him with that insight."

        "But the emphasis that he puts on geography as a determining factor is something I have a slight problem with not because it's not helpful.",
        "It's clear that the reason Eurasia ends up being a great deal richer and more powerful than, say, Australasia or, for that matter, the Americas, has to do with geography.",
        "But, and this is the critical point, the Diamond thesis can't really explain why one end of Eurasia ends up dominating the other end, in other words why Europe ends up so much more powerful than China and India and indeed ends up formally ruling India after the mid-18th century.",
        "And I don't think you can get there with a geographical story that there isn't a significant enough difference, it seems to me, in geography between the two ends of the Eurasian landmass.",
        "And indeed that's why I press the case for an institutional explanation.",
        "You know, you kind of think of this - you can think of this as a big debate between people who think that it's natural resource endowments that determined history, including geography or for that matter climate, and those like me who say it's the institutions, it's the manmade institutions that make the difference.",

        "We took two very similar populations, living in pretty much the same place, and we divided them - the Germans and the Koreans - into communist and non-communist or capitalist parts.",
