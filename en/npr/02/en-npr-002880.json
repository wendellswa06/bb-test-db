        "Well, Kyle, that's a big part of the book, actually.",
        "Clearly, the notion of a separation of church and state goes well back to the very origins of Christianity, and it hadn't paid enormous dividends in the first thousand years of Christian history.",
        "But with the Reformation, something profound changes, and I spend some time in the second chapter exploring what that was.",
        "I actually think it had to do with information technology.",
        "It's the fact that the Reformation, as Marin Luther conceives of it, is about reading.",
        "It's about reading the Bible yourself and reading it in your own spoken language, in the vernacular, that's so crucial.",
        "We know from some very good empirical work that's been done that once a town went Protestant, literacy rates went up.",
        "You would have much more printing, much more reading.",
        "And, of course, with rising literacy, people become much more efficient at what they do.",
        "They learn much more.",
        "And, of course, you learn more than just what's in the Bible because once you can read the Bible, you can read anything.",
        "And once you can print the Bible, you can print anything.",
        "So what happens after the Reformation is that the technology of printing, which was different in its effect from printing as it had developed in China, much more effective at mass producing pamphlets.",
        "This technology explodes in its importance and makes accessible to many, many Europeans a whole range of ideas, not only religious ideas but scientific ideas.",
        "And I think that's one of the key preludes to the scientific revolution and indeed the enlightenment.",
        "The other point that I explore at the end of the book is Max Weber's idea that there's some link from Protestantism to a certain ethic, a spirit of capitalism.",
        "In Weber's famous essay, \"\"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\"\" he speculated that there was something in Protestantism that made people behave differently, made them work harder, made them save more, made them more rational in the way that they behaved.",
        "And there's, I think a little, tiny shred of truth in this, though it turns out that anybody can have a work ethic.",
        "You don't need to be a Protestant.",
        "You can be a Catholic.",
        "You can be a Jew.",
        "You can, in fact, be a product of a Confucian society.",
        "The critical thing is: do you have the incentives and do you have the skills?",
        "And once again, it turns out to be the word ethic, with a D at the end, not the work ethic, that makes Protestantism special.",
        "It's the fact that it causes these big increases in literacy wherever it spreads.",
        "And, of course, missionaries spread Protestantism all over the world, especially in the 19th and early 20th century, I explored a way in which that happened in China with sometimes explosive results.",
        "So it's a big part of the story.",
        "This is a book unlike, say, \"\"The Ascent of Money,\"\" which is heavily focused on finance, which tries to look at the role of religion, broadly the role of culture, the role of institutions, of law and government.",
        "I've done my best to take as broad a scope as possible in this book.",
        "Happily, it also goes into sewer systems, so...",
        "Yeah, very important.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Very important.",
        "Well, you know, \"\"Civilization,\"\" when I was a boy, with Kenneth Clarke, and this wonderful book, which in fact was just an art history book.",
        "It's also a television series.",
        "And there he would pontificate about how superior European cathedrals were to anything else.",
        "And that that was what civilization used to mean - art galleries and cathedrals.",
        "And, of course, actually, in those terms the West doesn't have any particularly exceptional lead.",
        "I mean, the Forbidden City is a spectacular piece of architecture as anything, the West comes up with.",
        "So yeah, it's actually the sewer systems that turn out to be more important than the art galleries in my story.",
        "The fact that Europeans figure out how to have really large cities without succumbing to cholera epidemics every few years.",
        "Neal Ferguson's most recent book, \"\"Civilization: The West and the Rest.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "At one point in the book you talk about how the West seems to be losing faith in those institutions, those killer apps, as you describe them, that gave it its advantage.",
        "In one passage - and maybe I'm reading too much in this - but in one passage, you say there is this almost millennial fear of climate change.",
        "Do you not think that climate change is going to be one of the most dominant factors in the history of the next hundred years and more?"

        "Well, it very likely is.",
        "Of course, I'm no authority on this subject, and you've got to asks scientists, not historians, to assess the probability of really lethal changes in the climate.",
        "That's not my point.",
        "The point is that this idea clearly has a certain appeal regardless of whether you're qualified to understand the science.",
        "We are quite drawn to the idea of some kind of great apocalyptic end to civilization.",
        "It has a certain fascination.",
        "And it's taken all kinds of different forms over time.",
        "So we have, I think, developed a certain cultural pessimism, which is familiar from previous epochs.",
        "It's just morphed into a concern by climate change, man-made alterations to the climate.",
        "I don't want to suggest that I'm skeptical about that.",
        "My position has always been if this theory is correct, the costs are so huge that we should certainly take out some insurance against it, even if we're not 100 percent certain.",
        "And by the way, nobody is 100 percent certain of what the consequences will be of rising average temperatures and CO2 emissions.",
        "No.",
        "Actually, that's his brother that eats the sun.",
        "Different wolf, sorry.",
        "So I'm not going into an argument about that.",
        "What I would say with 100 percent confidence is that if the rest of the world is going to end up with a lifestyle modeled on let's say the Western way of life - and particularly the North American way of life - in terms of the consumption of natural resources, then regardless of what happens to the climate, we have a problem.",
        "Because even if the rest of the world consumed half of what the average American consumes in a lifetime of all of Earth's natural resources that we get through, then we simply start running out of stuff.",
        "I mean, there'd be copper left in 30 years if that was to happen.",
        "A lot of the rare earths that make your cell phones work run out within 10 years.",
        "So there's a separate issue that I try to foreground in the conclusion of the book, which is while it's highly desirable that 300 million Chinese should leave poverty and the gap between the West and the West should narrow; that gap was really egregiously wide back in the 1970s, at the endpoint at the great divergence.",
        "If we're not careful, we are going to create some sort of problem by the sheer weight of numbers and the consumption patterns that seems to be emerging as Asia gets richer.",
        "And...",
        "You don't need to have a view on climate change.",
        "I say this in order to make people who are avowed skeptics on that question acknowledge that there's a problem.",
        "Even if there's no problem with climate, we're going to run out of stuff if we don't change our behavior.",
        "We just have a minute left, but I did want you to address the idea - China, which is racing so quickly to make these adaptations and rising in power, yet a country which has profound political weaknesses and is racing, at the same time, to poison itself.",
        "In many ways, China has downloaded five, but not six, of our killer applications, and it may have got the competition in its economy, and it certainly have - has made great strides in science, not to mention medicine.",
        "The consumer society is flourishing there.",
        "Indeed, it's part of the five-year plan to grow it.",
        "And the work ethic, you bet.",
        "They've got it.",
        "But they don't have the rule of law based on private property rights - they really don't - and they certainly aren't moving in the direction of representative government.",
        "And that's their biggest weakness.",
        "That's their Achilles' heel.",
        "So I'm not one of those people who says, it's a slam dunk.",
        "The future belongs to China.",
        "It's more complicated than that.",
        "And we actually have the potential to reform ourselves, upgrade our civilization, reboot the software before it's too late."
