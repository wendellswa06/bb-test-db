        "Yes.",
        "I mean, the early years of Mugabe's rule were years of considerable developments and prosperity.",

        "And indeed, in its first year, Zimbabwe was promised more than a billion dollars in aide.",
        "And that accounts for part of the reason why there has been, if you like, a relatively subdued response to the election results, is that people are finding it difficult enough to keep the, sort of, family together, to feed the family, let alone get involved in political protests.",
        "But there's no doubt that the anger and resentment that will be felt in Zimbabwe if the elections are rigged.",
        "Because of that aide, Mugabe launched very ambitious programs of education and health.",

        "Unfortunately, Mugabe, his record of, if you like, economic management was not - he wasn't particularly effective.",
        "But far more seriously, he embarked on a campaign to enforce a one-party system.",
        "And that involved a campaign of terra and mass murder against his opponents in the part of the country known as Matabeleland.",
        "And in that campaign, it was a military campaign, at least 20,000 civilians died.",
        "And this happened in the - within, literally, two or three years of independence in 1980.",
        "So Mugabe's record from the very beginning was mixed, that that he's at - the economy did prosper and indeed white farmers prospered throughout the 1980s, and indeed throughout the 1990s.",
        "But nevertheless, another part of Mugabe's record was this campaign which literally amounted to mass murder.",
        "Now, coming to the point about the farm reform, it's quite true that the whole system was skewed in favor of white farmers.",
        "And indeed, they are an extremely effective and professional group, and as I said, they were the backbone of math through the economy.",
        "Mugabe took pretty little interest when he first came to power in the need for land reform.",
        "The British government spent considerable amount of money, 44 million pounds, that's nearly, well let's say $60 million, on assisting him with land reform.",
        "But they stopped when it was revealed that Mugabe, instead of handing land and farms over to peasant farmers for resettlement, which is what the intention was, were actually giving them to his own cronies.",
        "Mugabe continued to rule, basically through a huge system of patronage.",
        "And one of the ways that he wielded that patronage was basically to handout farms to his own circle of supporters.",
        "So the farm reform program came to a grinding halt because of the corruption that was involved.",
