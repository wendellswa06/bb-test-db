        "But Mugabe undauntedly retains a certain measure of support, certainly in the rural areas.",

        "I arrived back to the U.S.",
        "only two weeks ago.",
        "The lesson learned is this, election rigging is a symptom of a broken system, and when people respond violently, they're reacting to root causes, not to the rigging itself.",
        "Land tenure, economic inequity, and a broken economic system prompted the Kenyan violence and the parallels to Zimbabwe are unmistakable.",
        "The stability of the region is very much at stake.",
        "Would you agree?",
        "Well, yes I mean I think I would agree about the causes of the violence in Kenya, that it was an outrage that the election had been rigged which triggered off violence which, in the sense, was underlying ready to be triggered off.",
        "Now, in Zimbabwe, I think it's really different.",
        "People are pretty exhausted.",
        "Kenya is a, and was up to the time of the election, a prosperous and viable state.",
        "Zimbabwe is a broken state, or its people are broken, and they are literally suffering from more or less, mass starvation.",
        "There isn't food in the shops, people are more worried about how they keep the kids fed than they are about, if you like, protesting and, certainly, getting involved in violent demonstrations.",
        "Boesel admits that's not a lot, but it is something.",
        "But I also think that before that violence might occur, it's possible in the next three weeks when Mugabe will unleash his thugs, his militias, his youth groups to try and whip the population into line, as it were, into supporting him on the second round of the presidential vote.",
        "I think there may well be violence before the result of that second round is announced.",

        "I am in Zimbabwean who's convinced the tide is changing and supports the opposition.",
        "However, I think the opposition did wrong by threatening Mugabe with jail time.",
        "As an elder statesman, they should have offered a dignified exit for him, like it or not, he's a war hero who brought liberation to Zimbabwe and deserves whatever little respect we can give him into his twilight years.",
        "And this from Endico(ph) From Lawton, Oklahoma.",
        "As a Zimbabwean who became an American, last Friday before Saturday's vote, I say good riddance to the Mugabe regime, the incoherent policies they passed include one that strips me of my Zimbabwean citizenship.",
        "It also robs me of my historical links.",
        "With over three million Zimbabweans now in the diaspora, many of us were looking forward to this day.",
        "I hope the international community is monitoring all aspects of the transition, including financial transactions so there's no continued looting and plundering of this abused nation.",
        "For those who described Mugabe as a hero for liberating people, I say to them, he's an abusive father who prides himself for having been hard on you as a child, abuse should not be tolerated in any form even from our fathers.",
