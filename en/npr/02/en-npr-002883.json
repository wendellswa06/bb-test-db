        "And so, you know, I - since its early days even to, you know, begin to talk about Mugabe getting out of, you know, being defeated by Tsvangirai, he's just not the sort of person who will accept defeat.",
        "I mean - and the Mr. Meredith has recorded that very well in his writings.",
        "You referenced to Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition.",
        "No, no. I'm talking about Robert Mugabe.",
        "Yeah, I know, but you also mentioned Mr. Tsvangirai's name as you're trying to explain to listeners who he was.",
        "Well, I mean, I have this different set of worries about Mr. Tsvangirai.",
        "I think he's a great trade unionist organizer, and if we wanted to talk about him, one thing we should be asking is whether he - would he has the skill and the ability to lead the country?",
        "Which skill and ability will desperately be needed in the years ahead, and I also have doubts about that.",
        "I think that he's a good man, he loves democracy but, you know, I just don't think that he is presidential material.",
        "But that's another set of questions.",
        "That's another set of questions.",
        "Martin Meredith, do you think Edward has reason to be worried?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, Tsvangirai, has in the past, shown extraordinary courage but he's also noted for poor judgment.",
        "But I'm less worried about that, should he, in fact, eventually emerge as president because Zimbabwe is in such a terrible state that it has alarmed the international community.",
        "Already, there are Western governments lining up with various aid packages.",
        "Now, because the situation is so dire, it requires, if you like, international expertise and that expertise will be parachuted into Harare.",
        "Therefore, - and indeed, even that expertise will find it quite difficult to turn the situation around.",
        "I mean, I think probably Zimbabwe has set back - being set back by as much as 20 years."
