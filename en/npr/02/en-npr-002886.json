        "The current schism between the rising fortunes of urban areas and general decline in many rural ones looks like it's going to be a continuing problem for Democrats and an opportunity for Republicans.",

        "Yeah.",
        "So I think it surprised me and a lot of people because for the last two years, there has kind of been this steady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political - anything about the current environment, and she never has.",
        "And then all of a sudden Sunday, she drops this Instagram post with a really lengthy, almost like scorched-earth post about how she really feels about the upcoming midterms.",
        "And I was just not expecting that.",
        "What's the response been like from her fans?",
        "I've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything.",
        "I mean, she has 112 million Instagram followers, and a lot of people - yeah - really look up to her.",
        "So there is a lot of support.",
        "There's also, of course - there's kind of this movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything.",

        "So they kind of had read into a lot of things she had never even said.",
        "But there is some disappointment on that side today.",
        "Well, you know, Taylor Swift did start out as a country music star, which is a world that leans conservative.",
        "But she's more of a pop star now, so does having a broader fan base kind of free her to take more left-leaning political positions now?",
        "I think it did in some ways because when she made the break from Nashville and kind of declared herself going into the pop world, she didn't have to worry as much about, you know, country radio, which still drives so much of the country music industry.",
        "Now her songs are being played on pop radio, and she did have this broader audience.",
        "I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has those country fans, she did still want to appeal to them.",
        "But I think she probably did feel more free overall to share her opinions.",
        "You know, she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to curating her image.",
        "So what do you think?",
        "Why jump into politics now?",

        "You know, she's done with her concerts.",
        "She doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that, so she posted her message after this.",
        "She kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years, and that's why she was speaking out.",
        "And while she didn't say what those were, I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial...",
