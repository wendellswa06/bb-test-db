        "(Reading) Mr. Dixon obtained a total score on the PCL-R, which placed him in the high range of the clinical construct of psychopathy.",
        "He scored higher than 73 percent of those offenders on this instrument.",
        "Psychopaths are seen as people not capable of empathy or guilt.",
        "And therefore, seen as people bound almost by their nature to do violence.",
        "Further, because psychopaths are so uninhibited by emotion, researchers say they're more comfortable lying, more effective at deceit, which might make them more successful when it comes to getting out of prison - which is why some people feel that this test, the PCL-R, is needed.",
        "Psychopaths are more likely to be released earlier than other offenders.",
        "And then they're more likely to reoffend faster.",
        "Now typically, Richards says, when prisoners are let out of prison early for budget reasons, there's a clear increase in the amount of crime.",

        "But as part of his decision-making, Richards says, he gave all the prisoners he considered releasing the PCL-R.",
        "He says there were very few crimes committed by the people he decided to release, even though his program released a lot of people.",
        "Probably close to 10,000 people.",
        "And we had only three major, serious crimes where individuals got injured, hurt, shot, murdered."

        "The reality, Carbone says, is this: In California, not only the board but the governor must sign off on every parole granted.",
        "And there's just no benefit to being seen as soft on crime.",
        "That's why no governor will set someone free who got a high score on the psychopath test because there's just no political cover if that prisoner re-offends.",

        "There is no political upside.",
