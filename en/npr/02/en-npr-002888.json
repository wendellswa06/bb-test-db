        "You know, when he said that'll be for some other president, presidents, plural, so it could go on a lot longer, and what he really is doing is revealing that, back in his mind, he does not think that those troops are coming home very soon.",

        "But what about the possibility that if the United States were to suddenly leave, that whoever is left standing in Iraq, and it might be some of the Baathist, or some of the sectarian conflict, that people who hope to end up on top prey on the people.",
        "There're two ways to look at this.",
        "One is to say that the Americans can't get out now, because then you would have all these bad things happening.",

        "Did they make their case, Dan?",
        "Well, if they made their case, they made their case against the FBI better than they made their case against Moussaoui.",
        "Judging by what they now knew from Moussaoui, that nobody thought to do anything, two, three, four weeks before 9/11, is simply chilling in its effects.",
        "As to Moussaoui himself, well, he gets his story told.",
        "He gets a chance to possibly get a life sentence instead of getting execution.",

        "Well, almost everything is being downsized.",
        "But it's rather painful for those who work at General Motors, many of whom have given their whole working lives to GM, looking forward to the day when they manage to retire on very good pensions and very good care.",
        "And to say now, we'll give you a whole bunch of money now, but then go away with those requests, is very hard for them.",

        "Why salt and pepper?",
