        "So people, in their houses, had to have a room in the house to get away from it all.",
        "I mean, your book is called, you know, \"\"A History of A Private Life,\"\" but a home wasn't always a private place.",
        "No.",
        "I mean, for a long time, for a very long time, right up at least until - really, until about the age of Elizabeth I and William Shakespeare, most houses, even quite well-to-do houses, were fundamentally a single room, which was called the hall.",
        "And the hall was so important that that became the name of the whole house sometimes.",
        "And indeed, hall, in a wider sense, became a word signifying a grand space, which is why we have Carnegie Hall and Baseball Hall of Fame and the Halls of Montezuma, and so on.",
        "So in kind of original sense, it was a really grand room.",
        "It was the whole house.",
        "But then as time went on, people, they discovered the comforts and attractions, the privacy, and they began to add more rooms onto the home and to spread the house both upwards and outwards.",
        "And the hall became diminished in its importance until now.",
        "In most domestic settings, it's really just a kind of entryway in which we - where we hang our coats and take our hats off and that sort of thing.",
        "I love the story of how we started expanding upwards, and how it began - never would have thunk this - with some - the closed fireplace.",
        "Yeah, well, this - it's - it is an interesting fact how one small thing often leads to bigger consequences or bigger changes in the way we behave.",
        "And there really isn't a much better example of that.",
        "Originally, in a hall, if you went back to the Middle Ages, the time of Beowulf, say, the warmth in the whole hall was provided by a single, open fire in the middle of the room.",
        "The smoke just rose up to the ceiling, and there it accumulated and eventually leaked out through a hole in the roof."

        "But that meant that all of the roof space was useless.",
        "You couldn't go up there because you would choke on smoke.",
        "So it wasn't until the development of really good, functional chimneys - in about the time of Geoffrey Chaucer in the 14th century - that it became possible to direct the smoke out of the house, to channel it up through a chimney.",
        "And for that - that made it possible then suddenly to have upstairs in homes.",
        "And the development of upstairs meant that it was possible now to start thinking in terms of having some privacy.",
        "So it changed the whole world, the whole way we go about domestic life, and it really was the chimney that did it.",

        "It's a Victorian-style home, and it has the nine-foot ceiling.",
        "Some of the Victorians have 10-foot ceilings.",
        "And I was wondering why the ceilings were so high, and I wondered maybe it was because they used to have oil lamps, and by the time they hung the lamp on the wall so you wouldn't run into it with your head, the flame was going up high, and you wouldn't want the flames to get too high to the ceiling.",
        "You thought a lot about this.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "So I was just wondering: Why are those ceilings so high?",
        "Well, I think a lot of it is - was fashion, and it was just kind of showing off.",
        "I mean, in humbler homes, in Victorian times, the ceilings wouldn't have been high.",
        "Having a high ceiling was a way of demonstrating to the world that you were pretty well-off and that you could afford to be kind of extravagant with space."

        "And the fact that central heating was getting so much better in the 19th century was - it was a way of demonstrating how you could keep even a quite spacious room warm.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And, I mean, also, things like large windows would admit more daylight.",

        "We take them for granted today, but it is interesting to learn the publishing industry had quite the boon from home lighting.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, when gas lighting came in in the 19th century, it really transformed everything.",
        "I mean, if we, you and I, were to go back and have an equivalent amount of lighting now, we would find it pretty dim and unsatisfactory.",
        "But to the Victorians, when it came in, they were dazzled by how much light they suddenly had, and they were able to do all kinds of things they'd never been able to do before.",

        "You could - it was a lot more comfortable to do reading of all kinds.",
        "And so people started reading a lot more, and it was a huge - the huge growth in popular fiction and, you know, just at the time of Charles Dickens and people like that, huge, huge growth in that - but also a huge growth in periodicals.",

        "No. I've never heard - why was it called the Pittsburgh toilet?",

        "What I understand is that in the Midwest and particularly the Upper Midwest, people who had industrial jobs would come home dirty from their job and would go right to the basement, where they'd wash up and then be able to come up to the rest of the house cleaner and able to enjoy their private life at home.",

        "Did this have something to do with their wardrobes being very limited?",
        "Well, that's - I mean, that's a very good question.",
        "I have never found an answer to the question, which is: Why don't English homes have closets?",
        "I do know that closet - closet in a sense that we think of it in America, the big, you know, extra little storage room in each bedroom - is an American invention, and it became popular in America in the second half of the 19th century.",
        "Why it didn't catch on elsewhere, I don't know.",
        "But it's something - you know, I grew up in America, and something I miss very much, the convenience of it, living in an English house.",
        "Because one of the problem you'll have in any English house, no matter how spacious it is, is you are always very, very limited for storage."

        "Rather than having hot and cold faucets that you turned on and plumbed into one spigot head, there was actually a hot side and a cold side.",
        "And it was very common at the university and in the local restaurants.",
        "So I'm wondering is that an English custom?",

        "It's still routine for - even in, you know, even in houses newly built now.",
        "Although it's not universal any longer, but it's still pretty routine to have a cold and a hot tap.",
        "And if you're washing your hands, it's just - it's impossible to get the temperature right.",
        "I completely agree.",
        "The only thing I could think of is that the fashion in Britain used to be not to have a bath, but to have a sink wash.",
        "And so you would, you know, you would fill the sink with water, so you'd make the water in the sink the right temperature, and then you would wash yourself from that."
