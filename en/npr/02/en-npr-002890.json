        "Abigail, thanks for the phone call.",
        "Perhaps Mr. Bryson will know about the nook in our stairwell.",
        "Our two-story house was built in about 1885 or '87.",
        "It has a mansard roof, and is in northern California.",
        "The stairwell is curved.",
        "And in the middle of the curve is a nook about five-and-a-half feet tall, a bit more than two feet wide and a foot deep.",
        "The top of the nook is arched, and the back of the nook is curved.",
        "We've been told it's a coffin corner, which allowed some form of respect to be paid to the dead person being carried downstairs in their coffin.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Anything about that?",
        "No.",
        "I've never heard of a coffin corner.",
        "That's - a lot of - I mean, it may well be.",
        "Who knows?",
        "But a lot of these things, the explanations - the kind of explanations that we commonly hear are - tend to be a little bit on the legendary side and not necessarily attached to reality, because they make a good story.",
        "But, again, a coffin corner, I've never heard of that in any other house ever have.",
        "These - the people have - the listeners have some very interesting homes, it seems.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "You know, I loved the - in your book, also, the - I just had never thought that houses did not used to have dining rooms, and the story of how we got them is pretty fun.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "And they're simply - I mean, really what happened was that it wasn't that suddenly people developed a longing to have a space dedicated to the idea of dining because for a long time, you just dined in whatever public room you decided to or even sometimes in bedrooms.",
        "It was very common in former times for - if a woman was dining on her own, to invite her friends to join her in her boudoir, which was not just a bedroom, but also a kind of reception room, but a kind of intimate one.",
        "And they would often have - take meals there.",
        "Queen Elizabeth I, for instance, often would do that.",
        "What happened with - was that soft furnishings came in, and people began to get elegant fabrics in rooms like boudoirs and drawing rooms and living rooms and so on.",
        "And they - the lady of the house didn't want guests wiping their greasy fingers on her good chairs.",
        "And so...",
        "How rude of them."

        "So they came up with the idea of we'll have a room is just devoted to dining, and it will be built so that people can go and eat in there and spill their crumbs and their drinks on special tablecloths, and so on.",
        "And then when they're finish eating, they can return to the main part of the house so that they don't - there's not food stains everywhere.",

        "It wasn't apparent to you what they were for?",
        "Well, it was apparent what they were for, but we kind of start running out of names.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "It's 17 to 19 rooms, depending on how you count things.",

        "When we moved into the house, it was - the walls were painted a plum color.",

        "Oh, okay.",
        "...I presumed that whatever - even if we change the color in the room, we will still always call it the plum room now because that's just - but we don't know - I mean, it was just a kind of extra room.",
        "We think it might have been originally a library, but I don't know.",
        "So we just, by default, by -without planning it, we just ended up calling it the plum room.",

        "Okay.",
        "Bill Bryson, I think since we've teased people up top, we should let them know: Can you explain why forks do have four tines?",
        "Well, they - originally, they had just two.",
        "And a fork was much larger, and it was really designed simply to hold down a turkey or other large hunk of meat for carving, just so that it - to steady it while you carved it with a knife with your other hand.",
        "And the idea of using forks as a way of putting food into your mouth was quite slow catching on.",
        "But initially, they - dinner forks, dining forks had just two tines, as well.",
        "But what you find, as you can imagine, with two tines, you've going to have a very good chance of stabbing yourself in the lip or the tongue.",
        "And so they started adding extra tines kind of as a safety precaution.",
        "And an experiment with different numbers, and some forks had six or even eight at various times.",
        "But for some reason, that is beyond really explaining, we just feel more comfortable with four tines.",
        "It seems to be the number we feel comfortable with.",
        "Very occasionally, you will encounter, in other societies, in other countries, you'll encounter carving forks that have maybe five tines.",
        "And it feels slightly strange in your mouth.",
        "And I - who can say why it is?",
        "All right.",

        "And coming up: saying I do is a recession.",
        "Is the lousy economy killing marriage?",
        "The mistakes, for the most part, can be boiled down to the same kind of mistakes that most of the banks in the country made and certainly, all of Wall Street made.",
        "And that mistake is, as housing values got increasingly out of control, as normal people everywhere in the country realized that housing prices seemed to be growing straight into the stratosphere, instead of becoming more conservative about lending against those ridiculously high values, Fannie and Freddie just continued to make the same kind of loans and indeed, made more aggressive loans during that period of 2005, 2006, 2007.",
        "And it has all come back to haunt them.",
        "Have they changed the way they do business?",
        "Well, they have pulled back dramatically, in terms of the level of aggressiveness that they used to have in credit underwriting.",
        "But the fact of the matter is that on average and over time, Fannie and Freddie represent an economic subsidy from the public at large, to middle- and upper-middle-income homeowners.",
        "You call this a subsidy.",
        "I mean, effectively Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in a way, make our current mortgage market possible, for better or worse.",
        "So realistically, what would happen if they went away?",
        "Without Fannie and Freddie, you'd really have a two-part market.",
        "You'd have so-called portfolio lenders.",
        "So banks and thrifts and the like who make mortgages and then withhold it on their own balance sheets, and then you would have the so-called private label, mortgage-backed securities market -which is basically people originating loans, selling them to Wall Street, and then Wall Street syndicating those loans, selling bonds backed by those loans all over the world.",
        "What are you seeing in the policy discussions, though, about what might actually happen?",
        "Because even folks who say let's do away with Fannie and Freddie don't seem to realistically be talking about doing it overnight.",
        "I don't think there's anyone reasonable - and even mostly unreasonable people, frankly, are not talking about unplugging the GSEs overnight.",
        "I mean, together with the FHA, Fannie and Freddie are doing something like 95 percent of the mortgages in the country today.",
        "In a way, they are the mortgage market right now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So you would see - I mean, if you think that, you know, the fall of '08 was calamitous, believe me, you haven't seen anything yet if you would just somehow turn off the lights at Fannie and Freddie today."

        "The nature of households, and the rate at which they dissolve and re-form, the nature of work and its transient nature across geographies, are all things that suggest that maybe, just possibly, the middle-class American shouldn't stake themselves to a - illiquid, very large, concentrated, leveraged asset - that is to say, a house.",
