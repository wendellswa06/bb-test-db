        "She's seen as a very pro-business.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that one of the big issues that's going to come up, and it's already been put off, is what's called the Employee Free Choice Act.",
        "Right now, most union elections are through secret ballot, and it would allow them actually to do this by just asking people to check a card, saying they wanted to have a union.",
        "And the advantage to the union is that they can do this quietly, frankly, on the side, and not have the businesses know what's going on.",
        "When the businesses realize that a union drive is coming, they often mount a very tough campaign, sometimes hiring labor-union-busting firms, law firms.",
        "And it's been very challenging for unions to organize, and that's been one of their problems.",
        "So, this bill would make it much easier for employees to form unions?",
        "Dramatically so.",
        "Looks like that particular bill won't come up until the summer.",

        "Can the Labor Department and the autoworkers union see eye to eye?",
        "I think it's going to be one of the first big challenges for the Obama administration.",
        "You know, the Bush administration gave $13 billion to Chrysler and GM at the end of the year, and one of the things it said is it wanted real concessions; it wants a very different business model; wants these companies to cut a lot of costs; and it wants the unions to take big, big hits on their wages and salaries and health benefits.",
        "The United Auto Workers head Ron Gettelfinger is going to go to Obama and say, you know, we can't accept this; you have to fix this for us.",
        "President-elect Obama is under a lot pressure to fix these companies and make sure they have a good business plan going forward, because now, as taxpayers - you, I, the rest of our listeners - we're all investors."
