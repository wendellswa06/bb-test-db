        "How do you assess that idea now?",
        "Well, even at the time, I was highly critical because you only have to look at the main mission of the Department of Homeland Security is the prevention of terrorism, and most of its resources, the INS, TSA, are four or five or 10 times larger than this very small little agency, FEMA, that was an independent agency.",
        "As an independent agency, FEMA had direct connection to the president.",
        "It had the clout to actually task the other secretaries in the Cabinet to bring resources to the table and to actually deploy and work in disasters.",
        "It has clearly lost its stature.",
        "At the same time its stature was being lost, its resources were being taken away--both people and dollars--to go to other higher-priority areas in the Department of Homeland Security.",
        "That same thing happened at the state and local level, and that's why we saw failure at all levels in this disaster.",
        "As you take a look at what happened, this must pain you.",

        "Yes, it does, and I will try not to get emotional.",
        "I cannot tell you how many of my friends from the agency have called me and said, `We're trying to do something, but they won't issue the orders for the resources to go out.'",
        "Who is the who in that `they'?",
        "The leadership of the agency, Michael Brown, Secretary Chertoff, other responsible officials did not get the supplies there, did not get the predeployed troops there, did not get what needed to be done.",
        "And they're still being very slow.",
        "I think that we have to look at this disaster as a huge failure of our contract with our citizens.",
