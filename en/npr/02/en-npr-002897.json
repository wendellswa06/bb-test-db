        "Let me come back to you, Andrew, and that question that I posed to you before the break.",
        "We were talking about is there a continent that is safer than another, or one that it worse than another to go to with regard to the protection, or the lack thereof, of gay and lesbian people?",
        "I would say that there are areas in every continent where it's very dangerous, and there are areas where there is, you know, greater tolerance.",
        "Let's look at Latin America, for example.",
        "There is, just recently, Argentina, in the past couple of weeks, has legalized same-sex marriage.",
        "And it was surprising to many people because it was thought that Argentina was the center for the, you know, Latino machismo culture.",
        "And yet, now they have made this big stride.",
        "And what has happened is then the mayor of Mexico City said, well, yeah, Argentina can legalize same-sex marriage, but I, the mayor of Mexico City, you can also have a gay wedding here in Mexico City.",
        "And it was seen as a kind of a trying to catch what they call the pink peso.",
        "And so, you know, there's a competition.",
        "They're going for where is the most tolerant area in Latin America.",
        "In South Africa, as you asked about continents, Africa could be considered to be very dangerous.",
        "I spoke about Senegal, about Uganda.",
        "There's also Zimbabwe, which Robert Mugabe has made a lot of very strong anti-gay statements.",
        "However, South Africa is the only country in the world to have gay rights enshrined in their constitution.",
        "And the big cities, Johannesburg and Cape Town, have very large pride parades, and they also have, you know, marriages with you know, they have businesses that cater to same-sex marriages.",
        "So those would be greater areas of tolerance, as well.",
        "Thank you for that.",
        "We're going to take a call from Denver, Colorado, in a second, but I want to bring in Rachel Tivens to the conversation right now, if I can, the executive director of Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that represents the immigrant LGBT community.",
        "Rachel, welcome to the show.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Nice to have you.",
        "Let's go back to this call, because I think it's germane to what Andrew was just talking about, and then Rachel, we'll come back and spin around and talk with you, as well.",

        "Thank you.",
        "And your comment, sir, is what?",
        "I lived in Argentina three years ago as a foreign exchange student in high school, and I accidentally came out to a few of my fellow classmates.",
        "And there was an immediate response among all of the male students to never spend any time with me outside of what was absolutely necessary for schoolwork.",
        "And then I found it ironic that they passed same-sex marriage recently, when in the United States, I feel comfortable in most situations being out, and there's still only same-sex marriage in a handful of countries.",
        "Thank you for that call.",
        "Andrew, what about that?",
        "I'm not sure what it meant necessarily to accidentally come out, and I didn't want to pry too much with him on that, but his experience, is it typical in any way?",
        "For his part, Dwight Brock says no one enjoys taking someone's home.",
        "But he finds the canceled foreclosure sales annoying.",
        "He expects most of those sales will be rescheduled eventually.",
        "And Brock says taxpayers will get to foot the bill a second time for the sales to be planned and advertised.",
        "Tamara Keith, NPR News.",
        "Well, I think that it is.",
        "As I've tried to point out, it's a complex issue, where even in countries and cities where things - let's say, like London or Cape Town, where, you know, there is a big gay culture, there is still a level of intolerance in some social situations - particularly, let's say, with adolescents or with younger people, or sometimes with older people.",
        "So it's something that is shifting all the time.",
        "It's in flux, and it's right at the center of the political debate.",
        "It's right at the center of the human rights debate, and it also means that it's right at the center of a debate within families, within social groups.",
        "So, you know, I don't think you can say anywhere that it's, you know, one way or the other.",
        "It's in flux worldwide."

        "Rachel, I know that - I believe that you deal with the community more so here in the United States than internationally.",
        "Is that right?",
        "Immigration Equality represents lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and HIV-positive asylum-seekers from all over the world who have come to the United States because they're fleeing exactly the kind of persecution that we're discussing.",
        "In addition, we advocate for equal immigration rights for LGBT immigrants and their families, and it's relevant to some of this back and forth that, of course, there's a tremendous irony here.",
        "On the one hand, the United States has, really, an admirable record in protecting people who are fleeing persecution.",
        "Immigration Equality has represented nearly 500 LGBT asylum-seekers in the past five or six years.",
        "We've won almost all of those cases.",
        "And it is certainly possible to win asylum in the United States if you are fleeing persecution on account of your sexual orientation or your gender identity.",
        "At the same time, of course, there is ongoing discrimination in the United States against LGBT immigrants and LGBT Americans with immigrant partners.",
        "There is no way that an American citizen with a foreign national partner can sponsor that person for a green card.",
        "And for that reason, Immigration Equality has been advocating for a long time for legislative change that would ameliorate that situation.",
        "Is there a region of the United States - I'm sorry, not a region of the United States, but is there a region of the globe, a part of the globe where those who come here seeking asylum primarily come from, and for the same reasons?",
        "Immigration Equality sees asylum-seekers from literally all over the world.",
        "Everywhere in the world that you might imagine that it would not be safe to be lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, we have had clients.",
        "That, you know, unfortunately, is almost everywhere, except Western Europe.",
        "There are some notable trends.",
        "Over the past five years, 40 percent of our asylum-seekers have come from Latin America, 25 percent have come from the Caribbean, and 20 percent of our clients over the past five years have come from Jamaica alone.",
        "We are headquartered in the Northeastern United States.",
        "So we see probably a slightly disproportionate Jamaican population because of proximity, but the primary reason is the extraordinary level of homophobic violence in Jamaica.",
        "The cases that we see from Jamaica and from throughout the English-speaking Caribbean are quantitatively and qualitatively more severe than some of the cases that we see from other places, but, of course, that is not a distinction that the Caribbean gets to carry alone."

        "We have, of course, African clients and Middle Eastern clients with very dramatic and horrible stories of persecution.",
        "Let me ask you briefly to detail for us, before I come back to Andrew, the legal criteria for being granted asylum.",
        "I don't know that people are aware that being homosexual is potentially grounds for getting asylum here.",
        "To win asylum in the United States, an asylum-seeker has to prove that he or she has suffered past persecution, or - and/or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on the basis of one of five grounds: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group.",
        "And since 1994, sexual orientation and gender identity have been recognized as a subset of particular social group.",
        "I have a question for you about that from a particular listener, but before I read it to you, Rachel, let me ask you, Andrew: In terms of the issue of asylum, how important is that?",
        "How large is that in terms of the efforts to find a right place to be by those who are homosexual internationally?",
        "I think it's very important, particularly for people who are facing persecution, who perhaps are facing a legal action against them.",
        "We have seen, for instance - and places where there is a wave of violence.",
        "And, for instance, in Iraq a couple of years ago.",
        "And many Iraqis then fled to Lebanon, to Egypt, where there was a more tolerant group.",
        "But then many, many people are seeking asylum.",

        "When I first came here 14 years ago, I was warned to be very careful, that it was illegal to be a lesbian here and I could be deported.",
        "Now same sex marriage is legal in the capital and probably soon to be legal in the entire country.",
