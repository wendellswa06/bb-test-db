        "So this comes from Aman(ph) in San Francisco.",
        "I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly.",
        "Growing up in Egypt, I was told that there is no such thing as being gay.",
        "The shame and guilt of being gay that I grew up with is almost impossible to deal with.",
        "Why is it most countries will not consider asylum until you are either within their borders while it is near impossible to get a visa to get out?",
        "Had I not left Egypt, I'd have probably been killed by now.",
        "Can you give a response to that?",
        "That is one of the most significant barriers for people who are seeking asylum from all over the world.",
        "The United States allows people to apply for asylum only once they have arrived either in the United States or are present at a land border of the United States.",
        "So what that means is there are many, many potentially deserving asylum seekers.",
        "Immigration Equality gets emails all the time from people around the world saying, you know, for example, I'm a gay man from Iran, can you help me?",
        "And if you can't help me, I'm going to kill myself.",
        "And unfortunately, that is a piece of the way that the asylum system is structured, that it has not yet changed to accommodate the reality of global migration.",
        "And I think that there's no question that we would see a wider variety of people from around the world who are easier.",
        "For example, since 2001, since September 11th, it has been extremely difficult for single Muslim men to get a visa to the United States, even to visit.",
        "And that makes it extremely difficult for someone who might be a gay man from a Muslim country who is genuinely in fear of persecution or fleeing past persecution.",
        "But if you can't get here, it is - the writer is correct.",
        "It is impossible to seek asylum in the United States, and the system of refugee protection that is available internationally is very limited in terms of its recognition of sexual orientation and it's quite difficult to protect yourself when you are still abroad.",
        "I think that with - the way that the system works for people who are seeking to visit the United States as a tourist or for work is in some cases stacked against individual lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people because, for example, to get a tourist visa to the United States, you may have to prove to the satisfaction of the State Department that you don't intend to remain in the United States.",
        "And so some of the traditional ways that you can prove you don't intend to remain are that you have a good job in your country of origin, that you're married, that you have children, that you own property.",
        "If you're someone who has been ostracized by your community, your education may have been affected by anti-gay discrimination.",
        "You may not have a good job and you certainly might not have a spouse and children.",
        "So...",
        "Let me interrupt just to do a little bit of business here, take a call, and then come back and get some more answers from you.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "All right.",
        "We want to take a call, Rachel.",
        "Hold on.",
        "We want to get some answers and get some more comments from people who are in our listening audience.",

        "Charlie, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thanks.",
        "I grew up as a foreign service child in Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Sierra Leone, West Africa - and Singapore, particularly in high school.",
        "And I now work on Southeast Asian studies and part of what I study is sexual orientation, sexuality nationalism.",
        "And I have graduate students working particularly on Indonesia and the gay and lesbian states there."

        "I think what strikes me about a lot of what's being said here is how local some of this phenomenon is, even within a place like Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim majority nation.",

        "They may be circumscribed, but in general they're doing that.",
        "There's a group in Indonesia, GAYa NUSANTARA, which celebrated their 32nd anniversary this week of being a gay rights movement in there.",
        "And even within that gay rights movement, there are some groups that are really sort of Western, upper-educated focused, and then there are some which are more about sort of working class issues in small towns.",

        "But what concerns him is also timing.",
        "Namely, that the federal and state investigations are all happening on the eve of elections.",
        "When you have 50 elected officials all promising to investigate right before an election, rather than being able to quickly sort this out and get going again, all of the financial institutions immediately go on the legal defensive and drag this out for a year or two, and that will delay a recovery.",
