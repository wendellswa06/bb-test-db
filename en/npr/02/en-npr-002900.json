        "But I think what we're finding across the country, a lot of these high students aren't completing their educations because, quite frankly, the quality of education, high school education, in this country is pitiful.",
        "ER Shipp, I can understand this to some degree from a commercial or profit making - what they call a profit making college, because it's about just generating the dollar often for those colleges.",
        "But some of these community colleges - and we should note that we're not talking about the top-flight institutions - but some of these colleges and community colleges are accepting these, and I'm wondering if, in fact, they are doing the same by virtue of the profit making colleges - just to get the tuition in.",
        "There's probably a lot of that going on, quite frankly.",
        "But on the point of how bad the education is for some of these kids in high school, I've often seen that young people coming to college are kind of where I think I might have been in ninth grade, in terms of what I was prepared to do.",
        "And that's at some colleges that are pretty good.",
        "The issue, I think, is should the government be providing financial aid to students who've not yet proven themselves to be ready for college?",
        "And I think that's why this issue has come up most recently in New York.",
        "You know, I don't think we want to be too rigid about what the life course events have to be for a young person to mature into, you know, a productive worker.",
        "True, it would be better if high school education was serving effectively everywhere, and if the kids moved through in a normal way; but, I mean, you have to ask yourself this question - suppose you've got somebody who, you know, messed up when they were 15, 16, 17, but sort of came to their senses when they were 19, 20, 21.",
        "There needs to be someplace for them to go.",
        "If they can benefit from the community college, that's the key question, do they have the qualifications?",
        "This is not just make work - then I don't know that we want to be so rigid about, you know, what credentials a person has to have.",
        "For example, if we're going to have accountability testing, standards, you know, stuff like that in high school, then there're going to be some people who get pushed out just because they're not ready at that time.",
        "Do we want to consign them forever to not getting education?",
        "But they can always go the GED route, though.",
        "And then they have to have something to do after that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think that the problem is most of these kids know that the GED is seen as a throwaway, you know, diploma.",
        "So I think that the issue becomes, you know, do we want to mark children for life simply because their high school experience may not be on the par of what we deem it should be, or whether or not they fail a standardized test that does not allow them to get that high school diploma.",
        "There's got to be some mid-way here.",
        "(unintelligible).",
        "What of those who argue that you're watering down college campuses and expectations if you allow these kids on?"

        "Well, they could, but there have also been some other interesting things.",
