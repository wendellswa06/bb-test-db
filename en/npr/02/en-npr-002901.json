        "And so, I think that that's really where the disconnect is, is getting to know people who are different on a substantive level, not just on a superficial level.",

        "I mean, perhaps I'm being incredibly naive, but I don't think so.",
        "And, in fact, some of them, you know, who don't follow politics as closely as the rest of us, who weren't aware of it until I mentioned it and said, oh, you know, I'm writing this piece.",
        "And they cringed when I said it.",
