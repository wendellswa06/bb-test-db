        "And so that's the thing number one, is that statement was - just not have been the word of that - use of that word just would not have been possible, even if he's older, right?",
        "Because even if he's older, if he had someone who he talked to these issues with on a regular basis, he would've - that word would've been retired when it got retired in popular culture about 30 years ago.",
        "And that's what I think was sort of telling about this.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "You said that there's a generational component to this.",
        "And I think the word Negro brings that up.",
        "I mean, we're seeing that in the context of the census...",
        "Right.",
        "...where there's actually an older generation of black people who prefer that word or want to use that word.",
        "Well, so they say.",
        "You know, what's been interesting about me following that story as well is if I haven't seen the black person, the older black person on the record who they're claiming prefer to use that word.",
        "Because - so I find that a little suspect.",
        "That sounds a bit to me like someone is sort of - is now second-guessing and saying, well, this is how it happened because I have yet to meet that black person who prefers to be called Negro.",
        "I'm not saying there aren't out there.",
        "I just haven't met them and I haven't seen them quoted in any articles about this story.",
        "And what I would say, just to that point, is my grandfather, who passed away about 15 years ago and he was 90 at the time, and, you know, he used the word, I remember, as a child, how funny I thought it was that he still used the word colored.",
        "I mean, it just used to sort of gave me the giggles.",
        "And I'd say, oh, grandpa said the word colored, you know?",
        "And my parents would explain, well, that's the word that he grew up with and that's the word he knows.",
        "And that was about 15 years ago before he passed.",
        "So there is a generational component, but yet again, my grandfather's a good example in that he did have some interactions with white people, but he also lived on a farm that was pretty isolated and things were different when he came of age, so there wasn't a lot of interaction, so it was different.",
        "The point I was making, really, with this peace, though, Rebecca, is that when you're someone who's supposed to be in a leadership position of a party that claims to be committed to issues that benefit people of color, then wouldn't it stand to reason that to learn about the people that you claim to want to help, that you'd spend some substantive time with them?",
        "And I think this incident shows us that he probably has not and does not.",
        "We heard from Congressmen Dan Maffei and Joe Crowley and Senator Lisa Murkowski, talking about what they plan to do during the congressional recess.",
        "You say in the piece as a black woman, I could make being offended by things people say a full time job, but I choose not to.",
        "Instead, I always consider the source and consider the intent.",
        "And as you say, this - in this case, the source is someone who's supposed to be a leader of the party that claims to be of diversity and inclusion.",
        "What about the intent?",
        "Well, that's what's interesting, right?",
        "Because I do mentioned this in piece.",
        "The intent was that he's actually trying to help the first black president get elected, right?",
        "And that's, I think, what sort of negates a lot of this faux outrage that he should step down.",
        "He should resign.",
        "He's a racist, too."

        "Well, let's look at the definition of racist.",
        "The last time I checked, it meant that you didn't like people of a different race.",
        "So I find that hard to believe that if he really was so anti-black, he'd be trying desperately to get a black man elected president of the United States.",
        "And that's what's sort of - I think again, goes back to what we talked about is the difference between racism and someone who has just doesn't really have a substantive understanding of people of a different race, for whatever reason.",
        "Because, again, the irony is he was trying to talk about all the things that do make President Obama electable, and this is the word choice he used.",
        "I think what one person quoted the White House as saying is that they consider him someone with a tin ear and a golden heart, and I think that sort of comes through it a bit in that he was trying to be helpful and not in a particularly fashion to himself.",
        "Well, in the considered-the-source vein, you tell a story in the piece of meeting a young man who used the term colored, and in your mind, that was a teachable moment instead of a moment to be offended.",
        "Right.",
        "Because what was so funny about this story, and I - you know, I remember it so vividly, because it had never happened before, so it sort of stayed with me, is that he clearly was trying very hard to make friends.",
        "And that's what made it so profound to me, is that he was clearly - I could tell he hadn't interacted with a lot of black people.",
        "He essentially made that known when he talked about what small town he was from, which was - didn't have a lot of minorities, still pretty segregated in some ways.",
        "And he was clearly going out of his way, I could tell, to try to make me feel comfortable, and yet he's telling this story about, you know, how he - he said, oh, you know, I met another young woman and she's a woman who - he was just telling me this story about her, and she sounded wonderful.",
        "And then he says, you know, she was colored, too, and she - and he kept talking.",
        "And I could tell that, okay, I don't think that that's the right word, but I also don't think that he meant it, you know, that he meant anything nasty by it.",
        "So, hmm, how I should handle this?",
        "And I was thinking if I, you know, -there are a couple of options you have in situations like that.",
        "But you have to think about - at least I do - what's the long-term takeaway, right?",
        "So if I had reacted in a fashion that embarrassed him, that would probably been the last time he tried to - he'd say, I tried that once.",
        "That didn't go so well.",
        "I don't know that I ever need to talk to any of, quote, unquote, \"\"them\"\" again.",
        "So, instead, you know, I considered it a teachable moment.",
        "And look, those pop up all the time, in varying degrees.",
        "You know, I've had people who I'm friendly with, who've said things that have made me uncomfortable.",
        "And again, I try to consider the source.",
        "Is this someone who's been a friend to me, who cares about me, and I just don't think they understand the context of what they're saying.",
        "Let's try to talk through it.",
        "But in the case of the majority leader of the Democratic Party, even if you consider the source and consider the intent and don't come down on a feeling that he was being intentionally insensitive at some way, he should know better.",
        "He should have more life experience that teaches him better.",
        "Well, one would hope so.",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean, I would absolutely hope so.",
        "I would absolutely hope so.",
        "And if anything, I actually hope as -just as I said about that young man I met in college, I called that a teachable moment.",
        "I hope this one is, as well.",
        "I think that a lot of people, and I've - this is not the first time I've said this.",
        "I mean, I've discussed this in an entire chapter in my book, \"\"Party Crashing,\"\" which you guys have had me on to discuss before, that I think a lot of people coast by on the idea: It's enough for me to vote right, right?",
        "It's enough for me to think right.",
        "I'm a member of the right party.",
        "I'm a liberal, that means - that's more than enough to show that I am committed and I get \"\"it\"\" - it in quotations, right?",
        "And I think that this is a perfect example of how sometimes it's really - it's about more than that, and a lot of times people don't realize it.",
        "And I think that hopefully after this, he will.",
        "It's - look, it's sort of a continuation of a conversation when we look back on the beer summit that was at the White House, right, where people think I'm a nice person, I'm a good person, that's more than enough.",
        "And that's enough to get by in life, but sometimes it's not really enough to continue this conversation that our country began 200 years ago when it comes to race."

        "Now, yes, he is - the guy seems like he got stuck on some time warp from 1967 in using the word Negro, but the truth of the matter is why isn't it - the real issue needs to be addressing that - the whole thing that Obama was electable because he's light-skinned or because he doesn't speak like a African-American from the ghetto or - and I think as black man, the biggest - one of the big things that's not being taught is that he doesn't have the African-American slavery heritage that has to be looked at and dealt with.",

        "I've discussed it in others, and other people have written about it.",
