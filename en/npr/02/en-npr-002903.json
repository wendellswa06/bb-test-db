        "And you pointed out that maybe in the 1950s, there were some people in the country who might have thought Richard Nixon was a crook, but none of them got that information from the Los Angeles Times.",
        "The police come around later, they ask him why he didn't do anything.",
        "He said: I didn't want to get involved.",
        "This entered the lexicon of '60s America and really stuck.",
        "It became the slogan of urban anomie - the whole idea that people aren't going to come to your aid no matter how dire your situation may be.",
        "That's what I believe helped to keep this story in the public eye.",
        "It went viral in 1960s fashion, and there were people all over the world quoting the man at the top of the stairs, who said: I didn't want to get involved.",
        "The irony here, it seems, is that the implication is that it was strangers - I mean, neighbors, but kind of strangers who let Kitty Genovese die, whereas this witness who actually saw something, he knew her, right?",
        "He was drinking buddies with her girlfriend.",
        "He did know both Kitty and Mary Ann Zielonko, and this was definitely an instance in which there was a neighbor who could have helped.",
        "And you write very descriptively about how all this is happening in the backdrop of 1964, and the tensions between police and citizens in cities all around the country.",
        "I mean, racial tensions, of course, but talk a little bit about why would people be reluctant to call the police at this time - especially Kew Gardens; mostly white, mostly middle-class neighborhood.",
        "It was a time when the police weren't necessarily your friend.",
        "You can't call a central dispatcher.",
        "You call the number on your Yellow Pages, usually, and then a desk sergeant, whoever, picks up the phone, will take your report - although there were many accounts in which people called in and were invited to mind their own business, or move to another neighborhood if you don't like it there.",
        "There was much more a feeling among the police - certainly not all of them, but among some - that their business was to fight crime, and the business of the citizens was to wait until the police fought crime.",
        "While you are finding some things wrong with these initial claims, is the science of the psychology all that wrong?",
        "I mean, hasn't it been shown time and time again that people don't necessarily feel obligated to call for help when they see something wrong, especially when there's other people around - right?",
        "- this idea of diffusion of responsibility."

        "If we need help, we are much luckier to have one or two witnesses than to be surrounded by 20 or 30.",

        "And one of the sad quotes that wasn't remembered from this case was that of a wife who told her husband, 30 people must have called the police by now.",
        "One great thing that has come of this is that more or less directly, the 911 telephone system arose from the Kitty Genovese case and now, if you lift a finger and call the police, you can anonymously call in a tip and get a police car going to where it needs to be.",
