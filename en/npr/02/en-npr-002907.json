        "Even people who voted for it did not do so happily.",
        "They did it with some level of urgency that something had to be done.",
        "Had we had more time and more forethought that this was going to be needed, we could probably have come up with something better.",
        "Nonetheless, we did what we did, and the answer to your question, is there - has that diminished the appetite for bailouts or rescue plan, I do think there are two more that may be needed.",
        "First of all, we need a stimulus package to create jobs so that we are addressing the concerns of Main Street, not just Wall Street.",

        "We're saving an industrial, technological, and manufacturing base.",
        "But you don't think that you would run into the same opposition of Americans saying, why are my tax dollars going to bail out companies that are not competing well enough with Honda and Toyota in our own market?",
        "Well, as with the first rescue package, it would be our intention to have some level of recoupment for the taxpayer because, as you say, the resentment by the taxpayer is high for what they consider to be a bailout of inefficiencies, whether it's the financial industry or the auto industry.",
        "But again, it's about jobs in America.",
        "It's about our technological base.",

        "Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, Gore said, have shot up from 280 parts per million at the start of the industrial revolution to 386 parts per million today - and rising, which is why the earth's average temperature keeps going up.",
        "If we continued at today's levels, some scientists have said it can be an increase of up to 11 degrees fahrenheit.",
        "This would bring a screeching halt to human civilization and threaten the fabric of life everywhere on the earth.",
