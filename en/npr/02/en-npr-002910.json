        "The city has been dealing with loss of population for decades now.",
        "And financial trouble - serious financial troubles are nothing new.",
        "But what was the tipping point?",
        "How did we get here?",
        "Well, I mean, last year, the city was facing one of its - the cash crises where the governor and the treasurers - the treasurer intervened at that point to say, look, we've got to have a set of agreements to prevent this from happening again.",
        "Over the last 12 months, though, what we've seen is that the steps that were agreed to in that agreement didn't take place.",
        "So many of the things that we were supposed to do, city council stood in the way of.",
        "The mayor, to some extent, was unable to convince them - the governor just had had enough and decided that this was the only way to get things fixed.",
        "But it sounds like there's just a lack of confidence in institution.",
        "Certainly, the city government, the city council, but also in the state government and perhaps even this emergency manager.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think everybody here has heard - you know, I'm a Detroit native.",
        "I grew up here in the '70s and '80s.",
        "How long we've been talking about the city government turning itself around?",
        "The cash problems that we're having now are connected to the decline of the city's population and tax space over a very long period of time.",
        "And nobody really has had a great answer for fixing that.",
        "Detroit right now is collecting half the income tax money that it was just 12 years ago.",
        "I mean, if you're managing a business that has half the revenue it had 12 years ago, I mean, you'd be looking for a new business to be in.",
        "Cities don't have that option, really.",
        "We've got to figure another way to either downsize so that we are only spending as much as we're now taking in or find a way to get more revenue to the table.",
        "And that gets us to one of the major problems of Detroit, the so-called donut hole effect.",
        "In the 1940s and '50s, at the height of auto manufacturing, Detroit was a booming metropolis.",
        "But racial tensions led to white flight from the city.",
        "Additionally, auto companies opened new plants out in the suburbs, taking jobs and workers with them.",
        "The population of Detroit itself has dropped by a million since 1950, leaving empty neighborhoods, abandoned properties, and too few residents and too few tax dollars to pay for everything.",
        "This is a city that's 140 square miles.",
        "Scott Martelle is the author of the book \"\"Detroit: A Biography.",
        "The Detroit Free Press, one of the local papers, years ago, did this wonderful graphic where they superimposed a map of Manhattan, the city of Boston and the city of San Francisco over the city of Detroit, and they fit in with plenty of room to spare.",
        "So think about that for a second.",
        "I mean, that kind of space with 700,000 people in it at this point.",
        "Seven hundred thousand people, that's fewer than the number of people on the National Mall for President Obama's second inauguration.",
        "Imagine that number of people paying city taxes for the roads, public transportation, education, police services for a 140-square-mile city.",
        "And those people left are increasingly those stuck in poverty.",
        "Scott Martelle says the numbers tell the story."

        "cities have found themselves in dire financial situations.",
        "In 1995, the city of Washington, D.C., faced huge financial education and crime problems.",
        "And like Detroit, Washington, D.C., was subject to an emergency financial takeover.",
        "Anthony Williams was the man appointed to handle the district's financial crisis.",
        "He went on to become mayor of the city for two terms.",
        "But back in the late '90s, he faced a job similar to that facing Detroit's emergency financial manager.",
        "My job was to essentially put in place a budget and financial plan that would bring the district back to a solvency and then ultimately financial recovery.",
        "Mayor Williams says it all has to start with accountability.",
        "I guess there is an understanding that financial accountability is key to public trust, which is key to settled expectations and the willingness of businesses and citizens to live in and invest in a community.",
        "And Mayor Williams thinks Detroit's emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, needs to start by taking some baby steps immediately.",
        "Just start doing things, get some points on the board that show people, you know, there's intelligent life, that there's a light on in the house and somebody's home, so to speak.",
        "So that's, for example, collecting revenue, just basic receipts, creating an environment where people have an understanding bills are going to be paid.",
        "Mayor Williams also acknowledges Detroit's other problems.",
        "There are a lot of racial issues, a lot of alienation from the suburbs, a lot of sense that, you know, the city has kind of been victimized intentionally or unintentionally over years and years and years.",
        "Some of that may be true, some of it may not be.",
        "I guess the point I'm making is that, you know, we got to kind of like avoid re-litigating the past and look toward the future."

        "One option I think is not to target any particular one, but limit the amount of deductions and credits you can take.",

        "They can spread the infection not only from patient to patient, but from bacteria to bacteria.",
        "So, the mechanism of resistance to antibiotics not only works for one bacteria, but can be spread to others.",
        "That means the danger could easily start to spread from infections that are only usually found in hospitals to those that are much more common.",
        "If it spread to things like e coli, which is a common urinary tract infection, it would be a very serious problem."
