        "Tim Walz is a very, very vulnerable and first year incumbent and we're looking forward to really taking the race to the voters and I think we have an excellent chance of turning our district back to the Republicans.",
        "University of Minnesota congressional expert Kathryn Pearson says like many other freshman Democrats, Walz has competing challenges to keep his Democratic base happy, but also to retain those who once backed Republican Gil Gutknecht, the incumbent he replaced.",
        "He should be more concerned about the swing voters and the moderate voters in the middle, those moderate Republicans who voted for Gutknecht in the past, but were dissatisfied with President Bush's performance and defected in 2006.",
        "He really needs to be most concerned about hanging on to those voters.",
        "One such voter is political independent James Mason(ph).",
        "This disabled Vietnam veteran from Mankato initially was for the war in Iraq.",
        "He previously backed then GOP incumbent Gutknecht, but last fall he voted for Walz as a fellow veteran opposed to a war Mason has soured on.",
        "What are we getting out of Iraq?",
        "We are ain't getting nothing.",
        "We're losing - being that, you know, us people had been wounded or seen a lot of wounded, you know, to me, every time I pick up a paper and see somebody, you know, it just - it kind of brings tears to my eye because we're wasting lives.",
        "Mason says he supports Walz's decision to keep funding the war.",
        "So does school teacher Bryce Stencil(ph) who thinks Walz was caught in a very difficult position.",
        "Much like Abraham Lincoln was when he was a congressman back in the 1840s.",
        "Lincoln voted to support the troops fighting the Mexican war but that doesn't mean he supported the policy and I see Mr. Walz in a much the same position."
