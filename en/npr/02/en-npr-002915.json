        "Mostly the gang members were, you would say, broke.",
        "But the crack cocaine, rock cocaine epidemic that started around '82, '83, really fueled an economy that made some gang members millionaires.",

        "So Stanford University just released their own State of the Union study.",
        "It considers a lot of different points, and they said they have found what they call, quote, \"\"a broadly deteriorating poverty and inequality landscape.\"\" And it seems that every day, Americans agree that their views about the economy are still pretty pessimistic.",
        "I think that's absolutely right.",
        "And I think one of the big reasons is that, of course, we have these very big secular changes going on, which are making, you know, income distribution much worse in this country.",
        "A lot of the gains of the recovery that we've seen have come to people at the very top, particularly the very top 1 percent.",
        "And so ordinary people's incomes have not accelerated that much.",
        "And so it doesn't seem as though the economy is doing that well.",
        "The thing that makes it feel as though the economy is humming, for most people, is when the labor market is strong.",
        "And one figure that's stuck out to me, this is people age 25 to 54, the, quote, \"\"prime age\"\" adults, people who, when in good economic times, about 80 percent of them are working.",
        "At the end of last year, that number was closer to 76 percent.",
        "It doesn't seem like a lot of movement, but that's still five million people.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And that's been one of the really striking things about the U.S.",
        "economy in the past few years is that you've seen this very big decline in the share of the labor force that is employed and the share of people that are employed.",
        "Now, partly that is to do with the fact that the population is aging and the baby boomers are aging.",
        "And as you get older, fewer people work.",
        "But a lot of it probably has to do with the weakness of the recovery itself.",
        "And there are people who would like to work but haven't been able to find jobs."

        "You have fewer people who have the income and hence the ability to spend.",
