        "And it's because of the media culture and the rap, the gangsta rap element of hip-hop that has exported gang culture, especially during the 1990s, to pretty much all of the states, all 50 states in the US, and to many countries in Europe and west and south Africa, Central and South America as well.",
        "And that's interesting because if the Crips were founded in Indianapolis instead of Los Angeles, they might not have had that influence with Hollywood and the recording industry right there.",
        "You're absolutely correct.",
        "It's really the music industry and, you know, the elements of the entertainment business which is, you know, based primarily in Southern California, that has the tools and mechanisms and the power to just, you know, broadcast images to Europe in a second."
