        "Well, what if we looked at Pap smears?",
        "Do ovarian cancers shed cells into the female tract through the fallopian tube, through the uterus, and do they collect in the cervix?",
        "And likewise do endometrial cancers shed cells into the uterus that are then collected in the cervix, both of which could be collected with a simple Pap smear brush?",
        "And that was really the hypothesis that we assembled.",

        "In ovarian cancer we detected about 40 percent of the cases, and in endometrial cancer we detected all the cases we tested.",
        "And equally as important, in normal Pap smears or healthy Pap smears, we found that there were no false positives, so no misdiagnoses in the normal cases that we tested."

        "So how close then can we - can you say this could become a practical, very easy test to do?",

        "The difficulty now is jumping through the stringent requirements for any screening test.",
        "This is really just a proof of principle.",
        "The next steps are going to require hundreds and hundreds of patients to be tested to see if we capture 100-percent sensitivity in endometrial cancer, a moderate to high sensitivity in ovarian cancer, and if we still have a really low false positive rate.",
        "If that is accomplished when we reproduce this with more patients, then we have to conduct a prospective blind clinical trial in healthy women to see if this actually makes a difference in the diagnosis of early cancers and even eventually in survival.",
        "This would be a real boon to cancer detection because some of these cancers don't show up until very late...",
        "That's absolutely true and especially for ovarian cancer, where most cancers are detected or diagnosed at a very late stage, which is one of the reasons it's so deadly.",
        "The same goes with endometrial cancer.",
        "It's typically diagnosed because of a symptom of abnormal uterine bleeding in a post-menopausal woman.",
        "Even though that is its normal heralding sign, we oftentimes don't detect it early enough, and there's still about 8,000 deaths a year from that cancer.",
        "But our hope is, is that this will continue to move forward, the stringent next steps, and that eventually it'll get to patients.",
        "Are there any dangers that detecting mutations that are not cancerous and giving you a false positive?",
        "That's a great question.",
        "I think that there are two issues.",
        "One is that if we detect mutations, is that always cancer?",
        "And by definition, we've - we and several other millions of people have done studies or thousands of people have done studies on different cancers and found that these cancers by definition are only in the tumor and not in normal cells.",
        "Now, that is kind of a built-in safety valve.",
        "That gives us some reassurance that if we find a mutation, it's probably cancer.",
        "Now, the other issue is what if you do find a cancer, a mutation, and let's say there is a cancer - will that cancer ever progress?",
        "And we see this often in the debates with prostate cancer."

        "It, in point a fact, that Bush will decide that and will decide it based on trying to balance the Sunnis against the Shias and so on.",
        "Because if the American troops leave and Maliki's government takes over, the Shias will be in ascendancy.",
        "Then you got the Saudis and all the other Sunnis who are now gathered together, who are upset and concerned about it.",
        "Until a democracy, that appears to be like Mr. Bush wants it, exists - I think that he will make decisions about that or he'll keep playing off and making new initiatives here, there and everywhere around the corner until the end of his presidency.",
        "That's what I think - I don't think Maliki can decide this all about - by himself what…",
        "Well, I'm certainly he cannot - I'm sorry go ahead.",
        "He can't do that.",
        "No, Joe.",
