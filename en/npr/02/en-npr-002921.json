        "The Iraqi people in a couple of recent polls in the last few months, including one sponsored by the state department, indicated that the Iraqi people - not necessary the leadership of the government the Iraqi people are ready for Americans to leave.",
        "Another interesting thing is this business about giving the government of Iraq more arms, is reminiscent of the debate in this country often lead by conservatives, that the United States did not provide enough of its own fire power in terms of enough of troops at the beginning of the war.",
        "And Bush has recently acknowledged that.",
        "And others have complained for years and this situation perhaps is resolved now but that many of the troops there did not have enough armored vehicles, for example.",
        "And you heard stories of parents sending their sons vest, a bulletproof vest, because they couldn't get them from their commanders.",
        "And so this kind of thing that Maliki - Maliki, pardon me - is talking about now is reminiscent of the debate in this country involving U.S.",

        "I'm Farai Chideya.",
        "We also have Joe Davidson, editor for the Washington Post, and Nat Irvin of Wake Forest University.",
        "Go ahead, Professor Berry.",
        "I was going to say the bottom line is if we are supposed to be trying to have a democracy in Iraq, if a democracy exist and a majority controls it, the Shias are going to control it.",
        "And as long as we keep dancing around trying to figure out some way to keep that from happening or to keep the Sunni allies and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and so on, and to keep the oil flowing and all that, as we balance that, whenever we decide to leave, what we're doing now is tricky."

        "And all I'm saying is good luck and so here we are just, you know, with the troops, sending more troops and sitting around and waiting until 2008, I guess.",
        "Well, Joe, before we wrap this topic up, you know, it strikes me that President Nixon - God rest his soul - nattering nabobs of negativism, one of the great phrases of politics of all time.",

        "and Iraq relations, and there's a fight in Congress about it.",
        "So what are you hearing, Joe, on the ground in Washington about all these folks with opinions and how they are going to battle each other to determine the U.S.",
        "approach to Iraq?",
        "Well, I guess that battle now is best seen on Capitol Hill with the resolution sponsored by the Democrats primarily, but at least a couple of Republicans.",

        "I think how this resolution comes out, the wording, for example, whether or not this troop increase is considered an escalation.",
        "That was one of the words that is part of the debate.",
        "The Democrats are considering, I believe, not using that word in order to - or at least considering not using it - in order to draw more Republicans in.",
        "So the debate and the opinions takes part over such things can revolve around just a single word.",
        "And so I think we'll see these opinions - obviously, opinions have played a big part in this debate all along, but now that the power has shifted to the Democrats, it puts it on a whole another level.",
        "And I think the debate over this resolution is a prime example of that.",
        "All right.",

        "Barney Frank is right on the point that should be made.",
        "People in New Orleans, where I just came back from, that's what they say - black people and white people - that in fact what it amounts to is ethnic cleansing.",
        "And we have had stories in the last few days about the state's Road Home Program, which is supposed to provide money to people, which had a contractor operating it.",
        "And the contractor now says that he doesn't have, you know, any black and Asian - because there are Vietnamese there in the Gulf -people who are getting this money and he needs to start a new outreach contract to try to reach them to see if they want any.",

        "And you see the other areas where in fact they've already gotten their money and they're building.",

        "It's more accurate to reflect the poor people cleansing, Democratic cleansing, whatever, but I don't really think any of that, actually.",

        "Joe, you got 35 seconds.",
        "OK.",
        "I'm - as an editor, I'm a big proponent of writing that draws attention; and ethnic cleansing, this phrase does that.",
        "The downside of that, however, is that it draws attention to a set of particular words and then we don't focus on the larger issue that I think is trying to be presented.",
        "For example, Barney Frank said if you lose 100,000 black voters, you take a state that was marginally Republican and you've made it solidly Republican.",
        "Well, now that's a political analysis that I think Republicans and Democrats really would want to discuss.",
        "But by focusing on two or three words that draw attention to the largest subject, it also has a tendency to obscure the specifics which might very well be important."
