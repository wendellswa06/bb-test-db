        "All right.",
        "Give me an example one thing that you and I are both interested in is education.",
        "What do we know about these guys, these two candidates and the intersection of education and technology?",
        "Well, they both as it relates to this - the answers in the side by side comparisons.",
        "They both obviously see that education is critical to 21st century and that to our economy, to our innovation, to our growth as a digital, strong nation we have to put more into education.",
        "I was a little shocked that I didn't see more details from Obama.",
        "I saw more specific details from McCain.",
        "For example in McCain's answer he said that he would devote 60 percent of Title 2 funding for incentive bonuses for hiring performing teachers.",
        "So, that's something that we can actually hold him accountable to.",
        "He also said that he would allocate 250 million dollars through a competitive grant program to support states that commit to expanding online education opportunities.",
        "Now Obama has said that he has proposals that are out there, and he has a comprehensive - what he is calling a zero to five program that ensures their children enter school ready to learn and will also give them a 4,000 dollar American opportunity tax credit to help them with higher education.",
        "He also has some other things in there as well, but it seemed that both of them really straddled the line on understanding that teachers were critical, that we needed to do something more with our education, but both of them in a little bit of ways had some differences in terms of what they would be measurable, what would be - what they would be measured on if they were to go into office specifically for science education.",
        "You mentioned that Senator Obama was not a specific on that aspect.",
        "Was there anything else that he was specific on that good or bad?",
        "Good question, I mean he was specific on national security which I thought was interesting because McCain was not that specific on national security.",
        "So, at the, you know, the question was what is your view of how science and technology can best be used to ensure national security and where we should put our focus?",
        "So, Obama kind of goes into specifically what his administration will do in terms of doubling the amount of research dollars for the Department of Defense, putting in more productive research programs in the Department of Homeland Security and he goes on to kind of explain that.",
        "On McCain's side he kind of just talks about as president I will strengthen the military, shore up our alliances, and ensure that the nation is capable of protecting the homeland.",
        "Kind of more generic not as detailed and not as measurable or accountable.",
        "They would only get 10 cents on a dollar of investment.",
        "So far it doesn't look good.",
        "They are taking a firm line against accepting those terms.",
        "So, Liane, a week from today, I think we could very well be looking at GM going bankrupt.",
        "It's a manufacturing business, a business that makes bed pillows and down comforters.",
        "What kind of pillows?",
        "All kinds.",
