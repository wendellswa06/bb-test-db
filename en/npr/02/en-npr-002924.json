        "Business people do two things with their time fundamentally.",
        "The first is that they try to create sales, right?",
        "Revenue, key to business.",
        "But the other thing they devote their time to equally is cost containment.",
        "That is to say, how to not create jobs.",
        "Because the fewer jobs you can create for the revenue you create, the more profit you make.",
        "The only time that businesses create jobs is when middle-class consumers essentially put a gun to our heads in the form of orders for products that we cannot make ourselves, and then we hire people and create jobs.",
        "And his basic argument is this: Make the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in order to give the middle class some tax relief.",
        "The question is, what's a fair share?",
        "Here's conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin.",
        "Fairness is in the eye of the beholder.",
        "The wealthy now pay the dominant fraction of income taxes and they fund the dominant fraction of our government, but they pay a lower fraction of their income in taxes.",
        "And so fairness is either measured by how much of your income goes away or how much of the government you pay, you get a different answer.",
        "Right, because, what, the top 1 percent of income earners in America pay roughly...",
        "The top 5 percent pay 60 percent of income taxes.",
        "In the end, taxing is not a way to make any economy stronger.",
        "It's a necessary cost of having government services.",
        "We value those services.",
        "We want national defense.",
        "We want basic infrastructure.",
        "So I think it's misleading to say, hey, we're going to use the tax policy to somehow make the economy grow better.",
        "It's actually a price, not a benefit.",
        "Say, in a year's time from now, the Bush-era tax cuts are not extended and the rate goes up to about 39 percent for the wealthiest Americans, what is that going to do to the economy?",
        "In your view, what would actually happen?",
        "If we let the entire Bush tax cuts sunset, where the bulk of the money is actually to the middle and lower classes, that's going to be a big shock to the economy, $130 billion a year, $1.3 trillion pretty quickly.",
        "I think that's a strong negative impact.",
        "If we somehow do what the administration is suggesting, only do the high end...",
        "High end, right.",
        "...it's a smaller hit, but that's never really been the argument.",
        "In my view, the argument should be if we want to raise money from the wealthy, let's ask how we're going to raise it.",
        "The least effective way to raise it is to raise marginal tax rates because, as you know, you can get financial instruments to defer that tax, you can rearrange your affairs and avoid it legally.",
        "Let's do tax reform, that's what the Bowles-Simpson commission said.",
        "That's what, you know, all the fiscal commissions have said is if you want more revenue, you have to talk tax reform because how you get it from the rich matters.",
        "And perhaps what matters most is how you define income.",
        "Your wages are easy, everything else is more complicated.",

        "It's simply widening the gap between the richest and the middle class.",
        "And he points out that if the average American family still had the same share of income they earned in 1980, they would have 13,000 more dollars to spend a year.",

        "Otis was his son, his only son, and was the anointed prince of the newspaper.",

        "He brought back with him from Massachusetts a sense - a different sense of what a newspaper was.",
        "So when he became publisher in 1960, his idea was to radically makeover the Los Angeles Times, turned it into a genuine newspaper rather than a mouthpiece for the California GOP.",
        "By 1972, he'd been at it for 12 years, and had pretty much made over the newspaper with the exception of the editorial pages.",
        "And then made the decision to stop endorsing presidential candidates.",
        "And what I wanted to ask you now is that a great deal has changed in the past 35 years, including the ownership of the Los Angeles Times, which I guess just a little while ago shifted hands to a new ownership in Chicago.",
        "But nevertheless, they've decided to start endorsing presidential candidates again at a time when maybe the newspaper's presidential endorsement doesn't mean a whole lot anymore.",
        "Well, that's my opinion.",
        "I think it's shared by a good many people.",
        "I think that the power of major metropolitan dailies and this newspaper has dissipated noticeably over the past 10 to 15 years.",
        "It's been deluded in large part by the Internet but also like cable news and television in general.",
        "There's just too many places to go to get your news, that's one of the reasons that we see daily newspapers circulation dropping to the floor.",

        "Yes.",

        "It continued to advice people on who to vote for for the Congress or who to vote for city council.",
        "It just stopped officially endorsing for president, governor and senator in 1973."
