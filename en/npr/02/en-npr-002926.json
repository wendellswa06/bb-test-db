        "She was indicted under the ordinary homicide law, which allows for prosecution of people who kill other people.",
        "But because Alabama revised its law to include a fetus as if it were a living person or human being already born, it can apply, then, to a fetus.",
        "OK.",
        "So in a statement, the police lieutenant said that the investigation showed that the only true victim in this was the unborn baby.",
        "Is it common to see prosecutions of women for the unintentional death of fetuses that they are carrying?",
        "It's becoming more and more common since the late 1980s, early 1990s, when prosecutors began to charge women for crimes for using drugs during pregnancy.",
        "That has spread out to include prosecutions of women who commit all sorts of conduct during pregnancy that harms a fetus.",
        "It's included attempting suicide.",
        "It's included driving drunk.",
        "It's included botching self-induced abortions.",
        "And many of us are saying it's gotten to a point where pregnancy itself is being criminalized because so many things that someone does while pregnant can be the basis of a criminal prosecution.",
        "I was just trying to understand, like, what is the legal theory here at work?",
        "Is it that women who are pregnant have a higher duty to care?",
        "It's that argument, and it's also the argument that the fetus is equivalent of a child, and therefore, all the laws that protect a child from parental maltreatment would apply to a fetus as well.",
        "I should mention most of these cases involve mothers who fail to protect their children from harm, including, in many cases, mothers who are themselves victims of domestic violence and then get charged with crimes for failing to protect their already-born children.",
        "So this prosecution brings together a lot of theories that are very sexist that would justify massive control of pregnant women on grounds that they owe a duty to their fetuses to behave in certain ways and that - and ultimately make pregnant people vulnerable to prosecution for just about any kind of conduct that can be deemed risky.",
        "Marshae Jones is African American.",
        "What is the relevance of race in your view?",

        "So CrowdStrike is an American cybersecurity firm.",
        "Their name first came up in the news back in 2016 during the election.",
        "Why?",
        "They were the firm brought in by the DNC to investigate the hack that took place in 2016.",
        "And they're most known for being the firm that debunked the initial idea that it was conducted by a lone hacker.",
        "They were the people who basically said this was done by two groups of Russian-backed hacking outlets.",
        "So they introduced the idea of it being a cyberattack, basically, from another country, foreign intervention rather than a random lone wolf.",
        "Yes.",
        "They're sort of the ones that started the whole idea of collusion with Russia.",
        "Now, how does Ukraine come in?",
        "It's very confusing, but let's see what I can do here.",
        "So on the Internet, things move really fast.",
        "It's like a huge game of telephone.",
        "So once this firm caught the attention of the far-right online, they discovered that it was owned by a Russian American man who had previously done some work for a think tank called the Atlantic Council.",
        "It's a D.C.-based think tank, sort of works alongside NATO.",
        "And it's a pretty innocuous place.",
        "It does research on misinformation and digital warfare, things like that."

        "This is not true, of course.",
        "But when things are moving so fast online, facts start to combine together, and it becomes very confusing.",
        "So the idea is people who are on the far-right, conspiracy theorists, went looking for a connection, went looking to say, who are these CrowdStrike guys?",
        "And once they do enough looking, they're able to find a Ukrainian oligarch who they say, aha, this is the connection.",
        "So what about this server that the president implied was somehow in Ukraine?",
        "I mean, he - on this call talked to Ukraine's leader and brought up CrowdStrike.",
        "What would he be looking for?",
        "It's a common misconception that there is some sort of missing server from the DNC hack, but it's not true.",
        "The hack involved 140 cloud-based servers, and they were all decommissioned in 2016.",
        "There was no single server that was, you know, stolen in the dead of night and smuggled to the Ukraine or something.",
        "This was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of both the technology involved and the firm involved.",
        "And trying to make sense of it is almost impossible because it's not really a logical idea.",
        "What's remarkable about the president referring to the DNC hack of 2016 and a 2019 call to a foreign leader?",
        "I think it just goes to show you how much he, like the rest of us, is stuck in this social media feedback loop that started with that election.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "The 2016 election was a huge moment in America.",
        "It created so much discussion and viral content at once that we're all still analyzing and arguing and debating about what happened.",
        "And I think what this call proves is that President Trump is in that feedback loop as well.",
        "You reached out to CrowdStrike.",
