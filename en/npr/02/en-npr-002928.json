        "Well, as some of our colleagues at NPR have reported, the language in that manifesto is remarkably similar to the language the president himself has used.",
        "He's talked about immigrants, especially from the southern border, as invaders many times.",
        "And just to zoom out a little bit, there was a big public opinion poll from the Public Religion Research Institute last year, and it posed to respondents a question about the country's changing demographics.",
        "Now, about 60% of Republicans thought that the U.S.",
        "becoming a majority nonwhite country by 2045 would be mostly negative.",
        "So if that's a position held by most of the voters in one of the two major parties, it's clear that this feeling about the browning of America is not some fringe political position.",
        "And to be clear, I'm not suggesting that the people who feel this way want to commit violence to that end.",
        "But this anxiety over America becoming less white, that's a common powerful strain in our mainstream politics right now.",
        "But it seems like, we should note, that President Trump came out and did not just condemn violence.",
        "He condemned white supremacy yesterday when he was speaking about the violence that we've seen.",

        "Racism is what caused the notion that using drugs during pregnancy, which is a health problem, could be turned into a crime to prosecute pregnant women and mothers.",
        "We can trace that to the so-called crack epidemic at the end of the 1980s, early 1990s.",
        "And the first women who were prosecuted were black women who smoked crack cocaine during pregnancy.",
        "And the vast majority of women who were prosecuted among hundreds of women were black women, even though there is evidence that drug use during pregnancy is not more likely to happen in any particular racial group or economic group.",
        "And so this was clear targeting of black women, which I believe is part of a long history of devaluing black motherhood in particular and also a result of discriminatory behavior in hospitals, where hospitals were much more likely to turn in black patients for using drugs during pregnancy than white patients.",
        "And so the way I looked at those prosecutions, which started all of this, was it was actually punishing these women for having babies - not really any way of trying to protect their fetuses from harm.",
        "And, in fact, these women were being used as scapegoats to blame them for disadvantages, whether we're talking about health disadvantages or other kinds of social disadvantages that were actually caused by structural inequality.",

        "Thank you for having me.",
        "And what would Medicare look like under a Romney-Ryan administration?",
        "Well, I think the basic approach that they've discussed is a - what's called premium support or defined contribution, if you will.",
        "The idea is that instead of the federal government micromanaging the benefits and the payments to providers, the beneficiaries would instead get the value of their Medicare benefits that they could use to purchase from a range of competing plans, including one run by the government, very similar to the way Medicare Advantage is today.",
        "Well, a couple of points that Democrats would dispute in their - one, you call it premium support.",
        "Democrats call those vouchers.",
        "Well, you could use that term as well.",
        "I mean the relevant thing here is the design of the program.",
        "You know, in the approach that we have had so far with this program, the government attempts to be an insurance company and handle all of these issues of paying providers and setting rates and all the rest.",
        "In a premium support approach, the government's role is really just to handle the money, and the beneficiaries make the decision.",
        "So that's how, for example, the federal government operates the program for its own employees.",
        "The federal government for its own employees doesn't micromanage the plan and set one plan.",
        "Rather, they simply provide an amount that the employee can choose from competing providers - sorry, competing private plans and purchase."

        "Well, it's actually more likely to cover more than Medicare covers right now.",
        "And that may seem paradoxical, but it's not when you consider the enormous amount of waste and fraud in Medicare because they're not actually checking to see that the claims are legitimate a lot of times.",

        "The private plans do a much better job of keeping a lid on that and thus have money to spend on other things.",

        "And that's my worst fear.",
        "As hard as the problems are with Iran and North Korea - and these things come together at some point, because the more nations that have nuclear weapons, the more nations that go into enrichment process -the harder it's going to be to keep this stuff out of the hands of someone who would use it."
