        "Call it a cultural write or a publicity stunt, but the poll can make or break the political careers of even the hardiest seeming Republican candidates.",
        "A testament to that is the fact that John McCain and Rudy Giuliani declined to participate in this year's straw poll.",
        "So who's left?",

        "Someone who's also gotten some pretty solid number in the polls is Sam Brownback, the Kansas senator.",
        "And Brownback and Huckabee has been going after the social conservative wing of the party and have been really duking it out over those voters leading up to the event tomorrow in Ames.",

        "I didn't say it was minimal.",
        "It is arcane, but it's not minimal.",
        "No, what you really need to focus on is the approach here, okay, and the question is basically the proposal - the approach in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal health legislation, is similar to what Congress has done in the past, which is to say we preserve the benefits in name, but then to make up savings if we need them, we propose to at some point in the future cut payments to the people actually providing the benefits.",
        "Now, one of two things happens.",
        "Either the cuts go into effect, and the benefits in effect get hallowed out, because OK, you have this benefit, but now you have trouble finding somebody who will take such a low reimbursement to see you - we see this is in Medicaid, for example.",
        "I mean in New Jersey, you can get on Medicaid, but good luck finding a doctor who will see you because the pay is so lousy, they just can't afford to take you.",
        "And we saw this in Medicare with the doctors.",
        "The other thing that could happen is what we saw with doctors is the cuts don't really happen because of the obvious dislocation.",
        "So for example, the '97 Balanced Budget Act proposed to control the rate of growth in physician pay in Medicare, but every time the cuts were going to come into place, Congress stepped in and said, well, no, not this year, we'll do it next year.",
        "Next year, maybe.",
        "Maybe.",
        "And so what's happened is, on top of that $250 billion in physician cuts that they've never actually put into place but would happen if they didn't kick the can one more time, the PPACA puts in another $700 billion in cuts, and this time on hospitals, mainly.",
        "And so the chief actuary of Medicare says, well, you know, if you do actually do those cuts, then you're going to see a lot of these - I think it's 25 to 30 percent going bankrupt.",
        "Of course that's going to scare Congress into not making it, in which case, well, then you've never really saved anything in the first place, and...",

        "And we went through this debate once, but I guess we're going through it again.",
        "How will the Affordable Care Act change Medicare?",
        "Well, first and foremost, it doesn't actually change Medicare for beneficiaries at all.",
        "There are changes to the way we pay hospitals, but specified in the law are no changes to beneficiaries, which is actually a fundamental difference between the president, President Obama's approach, and the Romney-Ryan approach to Medicare.",
        "The Affordable Care Act has savings for in hospitals and overpayments to insurance companies and plows the savings back into the system by ensuring that there's additional assistance for prescription drug coverage; that's happening now for seniors, prevention benefits for seniors, and other ways in which we are promoting the health and welfare of seniors, as well as the American people.",
        "So that's that $716 billion.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "OK, let's get onto the other side's plan, however, and that's the Romney-Ryan plan, so much as we know it.",
        "The voucher program, how would that - we've just heard a description of how it might make Medicare smaller, cheaper, more efficient.",
        "Well, it'll definitely make Medicare smaller.",
        "It will make it less efficient in this fundamental way, which is that right now Medicare is actually more efficient and effective than the private health care market.",
        "It produces - it provides benefits to seniors at lower administrative costs.",
        "Administrative costs in Medicare is three percent; it's 15 to 20 percent in the private market.",
        "So what's so strange about the Romney-Ryan approach to health care is to take that benefit away from people, that guaranteed benefit of Medicare, when it is efficient and effective, people like it, it's a good plan, take that away and give people in return a voucher and say you can choose in the private health insurance market, and now they are also offering the traditional Medicare.",
        "But what they're - the way they actually save money, the reason why this plan is in Ryan's budget proposals, is that it saves, you know, a trillion dollars over time, and the reason why it saves that money is because it increases costs to seniors.",
        "It says to seniors we're going to give you a voucher, it's not going to go up as much as health care costs go up.",
        "We're going to save money.",
        "The value of that voucher will decrease over time."

        "Premiums are generally 12,000, we're going to give you a value that's 6,000.",
        "So you're going to have to bear the burden of those costs.",
        "And that's how the voucher saves money.",
        "I mean it saves money to the federal government and puts those costs on seniors.",
        "And that's why it saves a trillion dollars in Romney and Ryan's budget.",
        "And, you know, I think that's the wrong approach, but you know, at least they're being honest in that they're - they think seniors, their view is that seniors pay too little for health care.",
        "In the long run, though, as we look at our financial problems down the road, don't we have to save money in Medicare somehow?",
        "Is the present system not unsustainable?",
        "Well, you know, we have Medicare challenges, but we should all recognize that what's driving costs in the Medicare program is not that Medicare is bloated, or it's inefficient or ineffective.",
        "In fact, as I said, it delivers the same benefits at lower costs that private health insurance.",
        "What's driving health care costs, what's driving Medicare, is two things: health care inflation, and you know, national health expenditures are - the amount we pay for health care goes up annually as a country more than other costs - it's a rising cost driven by the private market - and the fact that we have an aging population.",
        "And then if that is true, that they are not continuing the prohibition against denial of insurance, what incentive will they provide to an insurer to take on an older person?",
        "I mean, there must be some monetary incentive.",
        "That's my question.",
        "So, you know, in the Affordable Care Act we have numerous mechanisms to drive down health care costs, and in fact those costs, those mechanisms are actually driving down costs now.",

        "It has - it has been at lower levels than in the last 50 years, in the last two years.",
