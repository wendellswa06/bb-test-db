        "Well, I think saying - black people can definitely hate people based on their race, and I think that a lot of black people hate white people.",
        "And I think - I don't I really think that's even up for debate - that there are black people who hate white people.",
        "And I think that if this crime only happened because this woman was white and trying to sit down on the bus, then I do think that it's a hate crime.",
        "Yes, shutting factories down will - relocating them, shutting them down is what really we've been doing for the last 4 to 5 years, but this recent surge has put a lot of factories basically below what we call cash cost.",
        "Factors in the United States, factors in Europe that are frankly relying on just products.",
        "We can switch to natural gas.",
        "Unfortunately, United States natural gas has also surged in the last five years.",
        "We call that the hidden energy crisis.",
        "Well, so if you shut down these factories, you'd move them to places where labor is cheaper?",
        "No, no labor, energy.",
        "Interesting enough, countries that do have an energy policy, countries like the Middle East, countries like China, countries like Russia, it's always fascinating when I give that list, you know, these are not necessarily democracies.",
        "But these are countries that are worked out that their natural resources need to be value added in their country to create meaningful high-paying jobs.",
        "That used to be the United States, but unfortunately, we've decided to restrict supply our own natural resources of this country, and of course, to increase demand with inefficiency.",
        "So, we're inefficient, we weren't in a supply ourselves, so we're at the whim of a global market price.",
        "So you're an advocate of what, in terms of energy policy?",
        "Well, we have been very vocal for many years now, five years, and it really increased voiced a lot.",
        "Really just three things, One is you have natural resources of the fossil fuel kind.",
        "We have the technology to produce this environmentally, increase supply.",
        "Open up, and one, open up the other continental shell, we have been - pick your favorite numbers between 15 and 30 years of supply of the United States in the country already.",
        "Number one.",
        "Number two, the advocates of efficiency across all the consumption, so that's transportation, fuel efficiency, car engines, which of course is now started to happen as well appliances, and buildings, and a whole lot of other areas.",
        "The third, is renewable, because that one gets a lot of press - labor on it, but the right sort of renewable, not the ones on the food chain, but if we can take our discretionary money from the Department of Energy.",
        "(Unintelligible).",
        "Well, as you well know, some of your proposals are quite controversial and would take years probably to yield results, and as you noted at the outset of this interview, oil prices are rising very, very, rapidly.",
        "So, how would your solutions affect you in the future?",
        "We'll, I'll start of with the credibility statement.",
        "We started saying this five years ago, and you can track our statement.",
        "And, can I wish back the past and can we all get the policies in place today that we should have had five years ago?",
        "No, obviously, we need to start today.",
        "I would tell you that the signal on increased production and really speeding up the alternatives in terms of nuclear and, of course, renewable, I think that would send a signal to the market and help stabilize this volatility world thing.",
        "So let's say none of your proposals is adopted, and nothing gets done along these lines at least until the next presidential election, what are you going to do between now and then?",
        "What's going to happen?",
        "Well, you said it earlier, we're raising our prices and raising our prices, and raising our prices, and then we'll cut out cost and cut out cost, and that means shutting down factories in high-cost locations, and we'll create value where we can.",
        "We will invest, of course, in alternatives.",
        "We'll put the RND budget to work.",
        "We'll so what we have to do to make our enterprise as sustainable enterprise.",
        "However, it just really needs to happen that a U.S.-based multinational like ours, leads the way and says here's the right sort of policy that helped the United States of America be even better than it can be.",
        "But meantime, my global enterprise will keep investing obviously."

        "A pound over the course of a year, is now going up five, 10, 15, or 20 cents a pound a month.",

        "So, obviously, color issues are always going to be there in the black community, and I don't really think there's anything wrong with bringing it up and talking about it and having a dialogue because even if, you know, issues aren't coming up everyday, it's still something that most black people were raised with and something that we deal with all the time.",
