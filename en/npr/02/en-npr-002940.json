        "Rick Barry is considered one of the greatest players of all time.",
        "He led the Golden State Warriors to the championships in 1975.",
        "Barry's five sons all played basketball, and this includes his youngest 23-year-old Canyon Barry, who just wrapped up his college career.",
        "But this story isn't just about a basketball dynasty, but a unique free-throws style passed down from father to son.",
        "It's the underhanded free throw.",
        "It's sometimes called the granny, which is sexist, but there it is.",
        "You will rarely, if ever, see it used on the court.",
        "But Rick and Canyon swear it's more accurate than any overhead free throw.",
        "And they have the stats to prove it.",
        "To tell us more, we called Rick Barry in Colorado Springs, Colo.",

        "And when I was in to - high school when he felt my hands are big enough, he was relentless in trying to get me to try underhanded thinking that I could become a better free-throw shooter.",
        "I was in the mid-70s probably at that time, which is OK, not great.",
        "I don't think you're really a good free-throw shooter unless you're shooting 80 percent.",
        "And back in those days, girls shot that way.",

        "In my last six years in the NBA, I refined the technique that my dad had taught me and took a lot of the wrist out of it.",

        "So growing up, I learned the technique - kind of as my dad hinted to - you have to wait 'til your hands are a little bit big enough to kind of grip the ball in the right way.",
        "So that happened for me around my junior year in high school.",
        "And, you know, I never looked back since.",
        "These past two seasons I've been in the high 80s and I'm just looking to continue to get better every year.",

        "It's kind of funny whenever I go to a new place, you know, people don't expect it if they haven't seen me or kind of heard of my background.",
        "So whenever I shoot the first one, everyone's kind of in shock, and then they pay a lot closer attention to see if I do it again on the second one.",
        "Probably the cleverest cheer I ever heard was we were playing a high school playoff game in Colorado.",
        "I was playing pretty well.",
        "I made a bunch of free throws, and I finally missed one and the entire opposing students section started chanting you're adopted.",
        "So I thought that was pretty funny.",
        "I had to give them some props for that.",
        "You have a good sense of humor.",

        "Very few people use it.",
