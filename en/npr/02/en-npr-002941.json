        "Hello.",
        "In 1922, the Rock Island Independents sold me to the Chicago Bears following a game that I remember as clearly as if we played it just today.",
        "We had a great team.",
        "We had lost just once.",
        "And on the Sunday prior to Thanksgiving we played the Bears at Wrigley Field.",
        "Now, understand, in Chicago the officialdom was such that on occasion it made it a little difficult for an outsider to win.",
        "On this day the game was a really tight one.",
        "In fact, it was going along nothing to nothing.",
        "George Halas, who, along Dutch Sternaman, owned the Bears and played for them, was at right end, the opponent for myself, who was the left tackle.",
        "Halas had a habit of grabbing a hold of my jersey, see, my sleeve.",
        "That would throw me a little off my balance.",
        "I didn't enjoy being the victim with reference to this holding.",
        "So I forewarned him what I intended to do.",
        "Likewise, it was necessary for me to forewarn the head linesman, whose name was Roy.",
        "Roy, I said, now Roy, I understand to start with that you're on the payroll of the Bears.",
        "I know that your eyesight must be failing you, because the man - this man Halas is holding me on occasion and is completely destroying all of the things that I am designed to do.",
        "I said, Roy, in the even that Halas holds me again, I am going to commit mayhem.",
        "Well, the condition of the field was muddy and slippery, a very unsafe field.",
        "Halas pulled his little trick once more and I come across with a right, because his head was going to my right.",
        "Fortunately for him, he slipped and my fist went whizzing straight into the terra firma, which was soft and mucky.",
        "My fist was buried.",
        "When I pulled it out, it was with an effort like a suction pump.",
        "This was on a Sunday, and on the following Tuesday, I believe it was, I was told to report to the Bears.",
        "George Halas had bought me for $100.",
        "Now, the language in these stories from back in the '20s is interesting.",
        "You know, words like terra firma and mayhem, not exactly the kind of words that you expect from a football player today.",
        "I know.",
        "They were great characters back then, and they spoke in a combination of elevated sort of erudite language and as the mostly uneducated guys that they were.",
        "I mean in the early days of the game, football was played by a lot of, you know, tattooed, beer-drinking, very tough characters.",
        "They played because they liked the games.",
        "They had other jobs for the most part.",
        "It was about as far as you could get from a big money glamour profession back then.",
        "Now, it's not just traditional sportswriters that you've included in here.",
        "I think our listeners might be surprised to know that you actually have a chapter in here by Jack Kerouac, actually recalling when he played football in high school and college.",
        "It's called Vanity on the Gridiron.",
        "Yes.",
        "It was a - I was surprised to find this myself as I was making my way back through Sports Illustrated's archives to put this book together.",
        "It was an excerpt from his autobiographical novel and in thinly disguised fashion talks about his days at Columbia - although it's not called that in the story the book - and about a coach with whom he in fact had had a bitter relationship, ended up fighting with this coach and eventually dropping out of Columbia.",
        "You know, you got the sense that he really loved the game of football.",
        "He sort of poetically writes about sand lot games when he was a kid.",
        "Throughout the article you also get the sense that he's, in the back of his mind he's going to be a writer, he's going to be a writer.",
        "He's thinking about that as well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The language of the Kerouac piece - there's a story in the book by Don DeLillo.",
        "There's a short story by John O'Hara.",
        "Some of the literary characters who popped up in having written stories in Sports Illustrated about football was really surprising, in they all do it with tremendous affection for the game.",
        "You could see that they all had direct experience with it.",
        "They write extremely knowledgably about the game and they write about it from the inside.",
        "But the language is so distinctive in these stories, you can tell there are real writers at work here."

        "I'm not sure I believe that a successful comedian would be so clueless about his appeal, but let's say he is, just for the sake of the movie's best scene, in which the candidate, played by Robin Williams, changes his mind about being serious in the middle of a televised debate, and more or less turns it into a standup comedy slam."
