        "And according to the Maryland Transit Administration Police, you have a situation where there were several kids - 14 to 15 years old - the victim is white; she was beaten pretty badly; she suffered broken bones in her left eye socket, lacerations on top of her head.",
        "Now, the question that's coming up among many is, this - is this a hate crime?",
        "What do you think?",
        "Is this a - well, they're still kind of trying to figure that out.",
        "I mean, obviously, we weren't there, but from the witnesses' - the victim's own account, this - you know, she said that they were calling her white cracker and then something else they called her as well.",
        "So if we were to use the black standard, so to speak, yeah, it isa hate crime, you know?",
        "But again, you have to let the law do its thing, you know?",

        "- YouTube.",
        "And I just did a simple search of videos that were done for - about - regarding the Jena Six.",
        "And out of those videos, I came out with 1,430 pages of videos talking about Jena Six and how bad it was and all that.",
        "And as far as this young lady, Sarah Kreager, is concerned, I only found two videos.",
        "Now mind you, YouTube is just a reflection of what people want to know about, so this is really - this whole case has, once again, proven to be a big slap in the face of everybody who's out there crying for justice and wanting increased hate crimes because, you know what, all this crying for hate crimes is going to - it's just like the anti-drug laws, it's going to come right back and it's going to slap black folks right on the behind.",
        "So you think that, basically, the hate crime law is going to be applied in a way that hurts black people.",
        "I'm saying that the hate crime law, once - if we're going to raise that kind of standard, then black folks are going to have to be prepared that there are going to - there are black people out there, yes, that do crime based on hate and racism just like white people do, so it's going to - that sort of goes either way.",
        "Lauren, if you go to some folks in - you know, people on college campuses, people in the barber shop, they'll say, black people can't be racist.",
        "Racism is an institutional structure; you cannot be racist if you are a person of color.",
        "How does that parse out for you?",
        "Now, Trey, there are actually very few black on white crimes.",
        "A lot more is black on black crimes, and of course white on white crimes, but the cases of black on white crime get a ton of publicity.",
        "In fact, if you are someone who is a black man who rapes a white woman or a black murderer of a white person are actually much differ penalties than people get for doing these things within race.",
        "Is it possible to really investigate something like this for local police or people who are, you know, looking from the armchair and not bring your own biases to the table?"

        "That's always going to be a problem, and I think the issue of hate crime is an interesting one because in - I'm not a lawyer, but I would say that a hate crime is a hate crime if the act is premeditated.",

        "We've heard reports of an ultimatum to Pakistan: You deal with the Haqqanis, or we will.",
        "That's exactly what we're hearing, and I think one of the most surprising elements of Admiral Mullen's statement - of course, he retires in less than a week, so he was a little freer to speak than he might have been previously - was that he not only named the Haqqanis, who have been the targets of American forces and drones before, but that he explicitly linked them as a surrogate for the ISI, the Pakistani intelligence service.",
        "And so we're in the odd position now of having accused a country that is called a major non-NATO ally, the status they were given during the Bush administration, of helping, indirectly, an attack on the American embassy in Kabul and threatening a response on Pakistani territory after the bin Laden raid, where of course the Pakistanis said it will never again be tolerated, a breach of their sovereignty.",
