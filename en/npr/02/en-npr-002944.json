        "Some of those states, Neal, are showing real courage, are raising the bar.",
        "And if they raise standards, you might see, rather than 90 percent of the students that hitting that proficiency level, you might see 40 or 50 percent.",
        "But that's the truth.",
        "That's reality.",
        "And where states are doing the right thing, they'll get crushed in the current law.",
        "That doesn't make sense.",
        "We need to support them.",
        "We need to focus much more on growth and gain rather than absolute test scores.",
        "Are schools getting better?",
        "Are graduation rates are getting better?",
        "Are more students going into college?",
        "Those of the kinds of measures that I'm interested in doing.",
        "And we just want to support the hard work, the courageous reform that we're seeing around the country over the past two years.",
        "And our goal here is give everybody here in this room and the people listening a chance to talk with the Secretary of Education.",
        "But I do have to say that the philosophy of No Child Left Behind was accountability had to be put into the whole system that, if schools were persistently failures, they had to be held accountable, that if teachers were not performing up to standard, they had to be held accountable, principals, administrators.",
        "Is that principle going to be going by the board?",
        "No.",
        "We're absolutely committed to accountability.",
        "We want it to make sense, though, Neal.",
        "There's been an absolute lack of common sense with the current law.",
        "What the law got wrong fundamentally is the law was very, very loose on what the goals were.",
        "So you got 50 different goal posts, 50 different standards, and many of them got dummied down.",
        "The law was very prescriptive, top-down, on how you get there.",
        "I think that's fundamentally wrong.",
        "We should have a high bar, college and career-ready standards for every single child.",
        "But give states, give districts, give teachers, give schools much more flexibility in hitting that higher bar.",
        "Just to give you an example, Neal, this one's very personal for me.",
        "When I ran the Chicago public schools, I almost had to sue our Department of Education here for the right to tutor our children after school, the kinds of great tutoring programs that everyone, you know, everyone here in this room was involved in.",
        "I got in a massive fight with the U.S.",
        "Department of Education, who didn't, who literally didn't want to let me tutor about 25,000 children after school who wanted to work harder.",
        "That was absolutely ludicrous.",
        "The amount of wasted time and energy, it made no sense.",
        "And so we want to support the creativity, the hard work, the entrepreneurial efforts at the local level, not be an impediment.",
        "That's what got to change.",
        "We're going to get questions from members of our audience here in Studio 4A.",
        "They are from District of Columbia schools.",
        "They're part of 826 DC, a program that provides tutoring, field trips and afterschool programs to help elementary and high school students shape creative writing skills.",
        "We're happy to have all of you with us here today.",

        "Email is talk@npr.org.",
        "And we'll begin with Susan, and Susan's calling from Ann Arbor.",
        "Yes.",
        "I wanted to say that I think that children with disabilities and children that need remediation are not being served under the present No Child Left Behind program.",
        "And I think that they were much better served in the '60s and '70s, when they were given individualized attention and small group locations.",
        "And I don't believe that it's realistic that all children will be achieving 100 percent in math and reading, because this doesn't take into account the varieties of children and people who will be entering the educational system.",
        "And I also believe that children who have exceptional ability in math, reading and English should be challenged and should be given, in some way, a kind of tracking in order to - for them to realize their potential.",
        "And children who are a little bit under that level academically should be trained the way they are, and also that career opportunities should be made available to them.",
        "And I think we're very far behind, for instance, the German educational system, which is doing a much better job of teaching people at the levels where they are."

        "Well, I think I'm going to address that head on.",
        "But it actually goes beyond that.",
        "What I really resent and disagree with the current law is the focus on absolute test scores.",
        "So, Neal, the focus is on just that percent of students, right about that cut score, that proficiency level.",
        "So those students with special needs, who might not be close to that, there's not a big incentive to work with them.",
        "There's not a big incentive to work with the gifted students, the students that are already above that cut score, but should continue to get better.",
        "And so whether you are struggling, whether you're in the middle, whether you're at the top of the class, what I want to know is: How much are you improving each year, every single child?",
        "And under the current law, there are lots of incentives to work with that small percent of children right around that middle cut score, not work with those children who are further behind, not work with those students that are further ahead.",
        "That has to change.",
        "How much is each student improving each year?",
        "And if you have special needs, great.",

        "How much are you improving relative to other children who are gifted?",
        "That's what hasn't happened here.",
        "And again, that's one of the fundamental things we want to change.",
        "So I basically agree with Susan's point, but goes much deeper than just those students with disabilities.",
        "Well, she's talking about the '60s and '70s.",
        "Since then, those children have been mainstreamed, and they have put into much larger groups.",
        "Well, I actually - I'm a big supporter of exclusion.",
        "And I think historically, those children with special needs were kept in broom closets.",
        "They were kept in basements.",
        "And today the vast majority of students with special needs are in regular ed classrooms.",
        "And...",

        "I'm not in favor of keeping any child in a broom closet.",
        "I'm not in favor of that.",
        "And there are opportunities for inclusion throughout the school day in recreational activities, in gym, in lunch, in many different ways.",
        "But if children have specific challenges, they are not really being helped.",
        "And if you go the schools of education and listen to the people who are working in schools they will tell you that, and that whose children are actually being ignored.",
        "And so there are very many ways that you can include all people in schools.",
        "But to have children in the general education classroom who cannot really participate in that classroom, I think that is certainly - that is a specific kind of broom closet.",
        "It may be an invisible broom closet.",
        "Susan, I got the...",
        "Those children still are being ignored.",
        "I got the point Susan.",
        "And again, maybe you and I will disagree on this.",
        "I think the vast majority of children should be included.",

        "And that was very, very detrimental to their learning.",
        "And to helping them fulfill their potential.",
        "Teachers need to be trained and there needs to be additional support.",
        "But I think today we have many, many more children being included in historically.",

        "We try and walk the walk.",

        "It's an investment.",

        "And to me this is, as I've traveled to country I've been to probably 44, or 45 states.",
        "Michael, this is the biggest complaint I've heard is about a narrowing of the curriculum.",
        "And yes reading and math are fundamental and foundational, but science, social studies, foreign languages, dance, drama, art, music, physical education, environment literacy, financial literacy all those things that give our students a world class world amount of education.",
        "And far too many places folks have walked away from that.",
        "And I hear it from students.",
        "I hear it from parents.",

        "I hear it from principals.",
        "Your particular concern about civics education fits right into that.",

        "I've been teaming up with former Justice Sandra Dale O'Connor whose done some great, great work in this area.",

        "Like 826, called a Mikva Challenge that did phenomenal work with children after school in the area of civics education.",
        "Really engaged them in that and made what they're learning during the school day much more relevant.",
        "And again, we're going to do everything we can to support a world class well rounded education.",

        "It starts in first and second and third grade.",
        "Our babies, our seven, eight, nine year olds deserve a world class education as well.",
        "And so this has to be right the way up Pre-K through 12.",
