        "Those are very real, real concerns and real challenges.",
        "And Neal, when I ran the Chicago public schools I had over 400,000 students and 85 percent of them lived below the poverty line.",
        "And so this is an issue.",
        "This is extraordinarily important to me.",
        "I grew up as part of my mother's inner city tutoring program working in the community on the South side of Chicago that was desperately poor.",
        "And so from the time I was a baby I've seen the impact that poverty can have.",
        "But I've also seen the difference that great schools and great adults can make in those children's lives.",
        "And so what is additional after school tutoring?",
        "What of serving students two or even three meals a day.",
        "Children need eyeglasses.",
        "You need to get them glasses.",
        "If they need clothes, you need to get them clothes.",
        "You need to make sure they're safe physically and emotionally and psychologically.",
        "And we have to do all those things so that our students can envision a positive future for themselves.",
        "When I ran the Chicago public schools, far too many of my children were killed due to gun violence in the community.",
        "It was absolutely devastating.",
        "That was one of the biggest challenges that I struggled with.",
        "And I kept it behind my desk a poster, a drawing that one of my teens did for me.",
        "And he wrote in it, he drew a picture of himself as a fireman.",
        "And he said, if I grew up I want to be a fireman.",
        "And that was a really deep concept to me.",
        "It wasn't when I grow up I want to be a fireman.",
        "It was if I grow up.",
        "We have to better protect our children.",
        "We have to keep them safe.",
        "And we have to deal with all those challenges they faced.",

        "Hi.",
        "My name is Helicka(ph) and I'm a tutor at 826 D.C.",
        "And I just wanted to know about the emphasis placed on standardized testing.",
        "And if it's going to be continued being the prevalent measuring forming decision making education.",
        "I think we have about 800 emails on exactly this point.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's a great question.",
        "So I think in some places we over test.",
        "And we need to be smart about that.",
        "I also think it's important to evaluate students on an ongoing basis and know how much they're learning.",
        "But I'm really interested in outcomes.",
        "What are schools graduation rates?",
        "Are graduation rates going up or down?",
        "Are more students who are graduating being successful in some form of higher education?",
        "If you guys graduate from high school today and don't get any more education, how many good jobs are out there for you now?",
        "Not a lot, right.",
        "Not a lot.",
        "So to me the goal can't just be to graduate from high school.",
        "First of all, if you drop out, there are no good jobs - none in the legal economy.",
        "But once you graduate, the goal has to be some form of higher education, four-year universities, two-year community colleges, trade, technical, vocational training, whatever your passion is.",
        "And so I want to look at are test scores a piece of what you have to look at, yes.",
        "But I want to look at graduation rates.",
        "I want to look at once students graduate, how are they doing on the next level?",
        "And where students are being successful and furthering their education, we need to do a lot of more of that.",
        "Where students are unprepared to be successful, then we have to challenge the status quo.",
        "Should we be investing more in technical schools after high school?",
        "Should those kinds of, the goal has always been a good four year college education for everybody.",
        "Is that really...",
        "I always talk about four year, or two year or trade, technical and to me we should be investing not just post high school.",
        "And we're doing that Neal.",
        "A two billion dollar investment in community colleges with the Department of Labor.",
        "So a massive investment in community colleges.",
        "Which I think have been this unrecognized jumble on the education continue.",
        "But again Neal, I would start earlier.",
        "I think, you know, six, seventh, eighth grade, throughout high school.",
        "I think probably the country, we did a better job in these areas in, you know, the '60s or the '70s.",
        "And we somehow got away from that."

        "You know, college or careers.",
        "I think that's an absolute false choice.",
        "I think we got to prepare a lot more students for college, we have to prepare a lot more students for careers, and we have to empower them to decide what they want to do with their lives.",
        "And so it's not about tracking these students.",
        "It's about giving them a range of options and letting them chase their dreams.",

        "My mom has actually been grading papers almost nonstop from kids that have turned them late.",
        "And it's just a frustration both as a student and for my mom being a teacher, watching the school system, at least in our area, seem like it's been kind of backwards.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",

        "There isn't an easy answer.",
        "I think there's a fine line.",
        "I think what you're really getting at is, in some places, are the expectations too low.",

        "We need to have high expectations.",
        "The more we challenge students, the more we raise the bar, the better they do.",
        "And I've seen that throughout my life.",
        "You often hear about if you raise the bar, graduation rate is going to go down.",
        "You're going to encourage more dropouts.",
        "That basically never happens.",
        "When you raise the bar, more students engage.",
        "They do better.",
        "Having said that, if students are struggling, they need individual help.",
        "They need folks not to give up on them.",
        "They need folks to help them through those tough times or help them in a subject they might not be as strong.",

        "And so we're simply not producing the talent, the workers who can fill those jobs.",
        "And at present, I have met with a number of CEOs who says, we're desperately trying to hire and we can't find the workers to fill that.",
        "And so I think we owe you a higher quality education across the country to help get you ready.",
        "We need to make sure once you graduate, you're - again, you're really, you know, college and career ready.",
