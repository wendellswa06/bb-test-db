        "It came about two years ago.",
        "It was impossible.",
        "Nobody would have predicted that to happen.",
        "And we have folks really raising the bar to meet a great trade off.",
        "It gives them a lot more flexibility to hit that high bar, hold them accountable for results but give them a lot more room to move.",
        "That's the kind of thing we're trying to do in ESEA Reauthorization.",
        "Let's go next to - this is Nancy.",
        "Nancy is on the line from Cincinnati.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I have some questions.",
        "I have worked as a teacher at a charter school here in Cincinnati.",
        "And we work directly with several school districts here, most of whom consistently were awarded, you know, excellence awards.",
        "My students were the high risk, special ed students, the kids who, you know, their behavioral issues were - been disrupted the class, and they were, you know, by the time they were sophomores or even - or should've been sophomores or juniors, you know, may have - only had a quarter or less of the credits they needed to graduate.",
        "The system that we had with those school districts was like this.",
        "These students attended my class, and they could receive credits from me that, eventually, hopefully, would lead to their receiving a diploma from their home high school.",
        "The main issue that I had - one of the main issues was that they were able to receive credit for simply participating, what was called participation, and participation literally meant (technical difficulty).",
        "Nancy, we're having trouble with your phone.",
        "And I'm afraid we've lost her.",
        "I apologize.",
        "I think we lost her.",
        "But, again, I think she raises a really important point of are we really expecting students to do well.",
        "And I think what Nancy's point was is that you have children you may have been struggling but where there really weren't high expectations for them.",
        "And what we want to do is provide students who are having a hard time all support, again, during a school day, after school, whatever it might be, but at the same time, we have to be preparing them to take that next step in their educational journey.",
        "And if we're not doing that, we're actually setting them up for social failure.",
        "She mentioned she was a teacher at a charter school.",
        "This from Samantha, in East Lansing.",
        "Could you please explain your believe that charter schools are the source of innovation and improvement given multiple research studies showing that, overall, charter schools do not outperform regular schools, even given their release from constraints in their greater ability to filter out underperforming students?",
        "Many hardworking, innovative teachers in regular schools wonder about your allegiance to charter schools.",
        "My allegiance is to good schools.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "I've been clear everywhere I've gone, and, you know, we just need more good schools in this country.",
        "And good traditional schools are part of the solution.",
        "Good charter schools are part of the solution.",
        "Bad traditional schools are part of the problem.",
        "Bad charter schools are part of the problem.",
        "So, again, people love to make these false choices.",
        "These are all public schools.",
        "They're all accountable to us.",
        "These are all our kids.",
        "And more good schools we have in this country, the better we're going to do.",
        "Where we're seeing academic failure, we need to challenge that.",
        "Great charter schools are part of the solution.",
        "Bad charter schools are part of the problem.",
        "Same is true for traditional public schools."

        "Hi.",
        "My name is Andrew.",
        "I teach ninth grade math at Chavez prep.",
        "And one of the ways we constantly try to improve as a school is always evaluating our teachers and our administrators.",
        "When you're visiting a school, what do you look for to see if that school is a high-performing school?",
        "First of all, thanks for your service, and I love what you guys are doing at Chavez.",
        "I've been out there.",
        "You guys are one of the communities that's working hard in terms of Promise Neighborhoods Initiative, which I think has huge potential.",
        "To me it's real simple.",
        "You can walk into a school - I've been to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of schools - and, honestly, in about two minutes, figure out, are students engaged?",
        "Are they having fun?",
        "Are they learning?",
        "Are teachers actively engaged?",
        "And you can almost just feel it, walking down the hallways or visiting a classroom, where students are bored or disengaged, where teachers aren't, you know, aren't actually committed.",
        "You feel that too.",
        "But the vast majority of classrooms, the vast majority of schools I visit, students are working hard.",
        "Teachers are engaging them in very creative ways.",
        "These are tough times to be a teacher - less resources than before, often higher class size than before - and amazing teachers are finding ways to be very, very successful.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "As I sit down, sort of have further conversations, I love to hear about what schools are doing in terms of the use of data.",
        "I was in a great school today that's doing great work in terms of formative assessments and figuring out who's learning what and why and how can teachers better support each other.",
        "I'm really interested in where schools see every single child as their responsibility and not sort of, you know, picking and choosing or saying, well, this child came to us late.",
        "We can't help them.",
        "But where more and more of the high-performance schools I visit, like you guys, just think about continuous improvement, how we keep getting better, how we celebrate successes, how we keep challenging the status quo, how do we use data to drive on instruction to individualized instruction.",
        "And as I travel, I honestly - it makes me very, very hopeful.",
        "For all the challenges we have, I'm continually, including this morning, inspired by what I see.",
        "This an email question from Larry in Lakewood, Ohio: How can we hold students and parents accountable when they don't contribute to a student's success?",
        "As a teacher, I'm frustrated when I'm told I fail as a teacher when a student chooses not to put forth effort.",
        "I can teach and adapt, but I can't learn for the students.",
        "They have to be responsible for their own efforts or lack thereof.",
        "No question, and that, you know, just to be very clear to these students and students who might be listening, their job, student's job today is to get a great education.",
        "And without that, they are simply not going to have any positive choices in life.",
        "And teachers need to work hard, need to challenge, need to engage.",
        "But anyone who thinks teachers can do this by themselves misses it.",
        "So students have to be committed.",
        "They need help.",
        "They have to be looking for help.",

        "To go back to your question, Andrew, lots of schools have what I call a culture of positive peer pressure, where young people are encouraging each other to do the right thing rather than the wrong thing.",
        "And to me that's so critically important.",
        "Too many places, if you're successful, somehow that's like a bad thing, and we have to challenge that.",
        "So students have to take their responsibility very, very seriously.",
        "And then, Neal, I was at a school today to talk about fathers being more involved and engaged.",

        "I come at this as a dad.",
        "And my wife and I have a third grader and a first grader at home.",

        "I think, historically, far too often we've all pointed fingers.",

        "And I would just like to follow up on the first caller at the beginning of the show, I think, because I am a very avid user of the Internet.",
        "And through my research, I've noticed that although several states do have specific schools, there are a lot of states in this country who either do not have schools that are verily - are dwindling schools that are for the deaf and blind and for other disabled students.",
        "I would just comment.",
        "I'd just like to say that, you know, if more states have schools like this, I don't think we would run into the problem as much as figuring out ways of how to teach the students like who are blind and deaf and so on and so forth to figure out how - we wouldn't have the problem of how to figure out how to teach them in the public school setting.",
        "And I would take my comments off the air.",
        "All right, Paul.",
        "Thanks very much for the call.",
        "Oh, Paul, first I wanted to congratulate you on your commitment to getting your own education and to overcome some tremendous challenges.",
        "So thank you so much for the example you're setting for all of us.",
        "And, again, whether a child is visually impaired or deaf or has special needs, it's incumbent upon all of us as adults and educators to find ways to help you be successful.",
        "And I'm sure you have some tremendous gifts as well, and we have to find out what those gifts are and help you build upon them.",
        "So helping every single - when I say all, I mean all - helping every single student, students with disabilities, students with specials needs, gifted children, wherever it might be, helping every single child be successful, finding the right environment for them, finding the right supports and opportunities for them, again, both during the school day and after school is critically important.",
        "And we just can't allow any students to fall through the cracks.",
        "Neal, our biggest challenge today in this country is our nation's dropout rate.",
        "We have a 25 percent dropout rate in this country.",
        "That's a million young people leaving our school through the streets each year.",
        "That is just morally unacceptable and economically unsustainable.",
        "And so, we have to, you know, get that rate to zero as fast as we can and help young people lead our country where we need to go.",

        "I think, often, people drop out because they're having problems in the neighborhood or at home and going to school becomes that much harder for them.",
