        "The case of Thomas Miller-El, an African-American convicted of murder 19 years ago, has been to the Supreme Court twice.",
        "The first time, two years ago, the court sent the case back to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals with orders to rethink its, quote, \"\"dismissive and strained interpretation\"\" of the proof of discrimination Miller-El's lawyers had offered.",
        "The court noted that prosecutors used their peremptory challenges--that is challenges for no stated reason--to strike 10 of 11 eligible black jurors.",
        "As a red-faced Justice Anthony Kennedy put it...",
        "Happenstance is unlikely to produce this disparity.",
        "Moreover, as the court noted, prosecutors had questioned black jurors more aggressively than white, struck black jurors who gave substantially the same answers as white jurors who were seated and prosecutors had twice used a local procedure known as `the jury shuffle' to move blacks lower down on the list of potential jurors.",
        "There were other factors, too, like the training manual for the Dallas DA's office instructing prosecutors not to seat minorities because they would be more sympathetic to the defense.",
        "The vote in the 2002 Miller-El case was 8-to-1, with Justice Clarence Thomas dissenting.",
        "But when it went back to the 5th Circuit for further review, that court ruled that there had been no race discrimination and, amazingly, it adopted almost verbatim the language of Thomas' dissent, not the court majority.",
        "Today, the Supreme Court kicked back pretty hard, reversing Miller-El's conviction and declaring that the 5th Circuit's conclusion was `insupportable.",
        "A six-justice majority said there is clear and convincing proof that the jury selection was tainted by racial bias.",
        "As for the prosecutors' explanations, the court said, they were a sham and a pretext as exemplified by the fact that 100 percent of the blacks were subjected to a trick question that would disqualify them while only 27 percent of the whites were.",
        "Writing for the three dissenters, Justice Clarence Thomas said the majority was merely speculating that there had been discrimination.",
        "`On the merits of the facts and the law rather than sentiments,' he said, `Miller-El does not merit a new trial.'",
        "In Texas, neither the Dallas DA's office nor the state attorney general's office would comment on today's ruling or say whether they would retry Miller-El.",
        "But it was hard to see today's decision as anything but a rebuke to both the prosecutor's office and the 5th Circuit.",
        "Eric Holder served as US attorney and deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration.",
        "They really need to ask some very, very probing questions of themselves and wonder why a Supreme Court could make the specific findings that it made today that are so damning.",
        "Beth Wilkinson, one of the prosecutors in the Oklahoma City bombing case, noted that in recent years, there's been an evolution in death penalty cases, with the Supreme Court telling lower appeals courts to look carefully at the facts.",
        "The Supreme Court is, as it's expressed in this opinion, almost frustrated with the 5th Circuit's lack of detailed review of these cases.",
        "And I don't know if it's stubbornness by the 5th Circuit, but I think the Supreme Court has made it clear that they expect more rigorous review by the 5th Circuit and every other circuit in the United States of these death penalty appeals."

        "The Miller-El case comes from Texas, with the second-largest number of people on death row.",

        "At issue was the murder conviction of an African-American named Shawn Johnson of an all-white jury.",
        "Prosecutors used their peremptory challenges to strike all three qualified prospective black jurors, and the California Supreme Court upheld the jury selection, saying that the defense did now show discrimination was probable.",

        "He was in between Mr. Aristide's two terms, and, is that going to give him a leg up, do you think, in trying to, well, consolidate his presidential victory, and then move on to incorporate some of the programs that he was talking about?",
        "Right, right.",
        "And in 10 years have moved to the point where there are now about 5,000 drones, not all of them armed, in fact most of them just for reconnaissance.",
        "But what's happened over time is that what became an instrument of a previous strategy has come to shape the new strategy.",
        "And I think you could argue that President Obama would not have been able to enunciate the withdrawal from Afghanistan, first with the surge forces and by 2014 by most of the combat forces, had he not had the drones available, because the American image of the future of the conflict in Afghanistan and Pakistan is to keep just enough forces around that they can have a large drone base and a base for commandos in Afghanistan that could operate both in Afghanistan and of course across the border in Pakistan.",
        "So the drones have become the centerpiece of the counterterrorism strategy.",
        "But even a large drone base is a lot smaller than a small Air Force base.",
        "And a lot harder for people to find and with a lot fewer a lot fewer personnel.",
        "I mean, it takes people to maintain and fix up these drones, but, you know, the advantages of drones are obvious.",
        "Not only are they stealthy, but if one of them does go down, you have not lost a pilot, you don't have a missing in action report, you don't have a hostage situation.",
        "And as this tactic has proved so successful in Afghanistan and Pakistan, obviously in Iraq as well, it has been exported.",
        "Now the United States is making, we're told, stepping up attacks in Yemen.",
        "It's made attacks in Somalia, and of course - that's now five countries that we know about and bases reported as far away as the Seychelles, the island kingdom in the Indian Ocean.",
        "And a sixth, Iraq, which is really where they were using them the most.",
        "In fact, one of the reasons they weren't being used heavily in Afghanistan during the Bush administration is that most of the drones were tied up in Iraq.",
        "Now, they've been able to produce a lot more since.",
        "I think one of the biggest surprises of the Obama administration has been how quickly the administration has adopted and accelerated this program.",
        "In President Obama's first year in office, 2009, there were double the number of drone strikes that there had been I think during the previous four years of the Bush administration."

        "And it has also become an instrument of foreign policy.",
        "As the United States withdraws from Iraq, for example, it would like to keep a drone base in Turkey to watch things in Iraq.",
        "Yet the Turks, they say yes, that would be fine, if you sell us some drones and keep - so we can keep track of the Kurdish breakaway group, the PKK.",
        "That's right, and so there are two big issues here.",
        "One is how quickly do you want to sell this technology, and of course that's driven some by competitive concerns.",
        "It's not like the United States is the only country designing and building drones.",
        "Certainly the U.S.",
        "is well ahead, but the Chinese have caught on that there's something going on here, and so have a lot of other countries.",
        "And while the U.S.",
        "technology is advanced, the fundamental technology of building drones is pretty widely available.",
        "And then the second question, as with any arms shipment comes, what happens when your ally that you've sold this to is using it for some other purpose?",
        "So you know, in Pakistan's case, there's always concern they would use it to deal with India; Turkey, as you say, the PKK.",
        "These issues are rampant, and they will only grow more complicated, and then as you hinted at the beginning, the next big concern is what happens when someone turns this technology on an American city.",
        "And it is - you say all right, one drone firing one missile, it would be a terrible thing, but it's not 9/11.",
        "However, this technology is just in the cradle still.",
        "It's developing by leaps and bounds.",
        "In both drone technology and cyberwarfare, I think it's fair to say that we're sort of at the equivalent point that we were at in the mid to late 1940s, when the U.S.",
        "had set off the first atomic attacks and knew the technology was going to spread, and the Soviets would get it, as they did by the late '40s.",
        "But it was not a widespread technology.",
        "But everybody knew that the bomb was going to spread, and in fact it has, and drones will probably faster than nuclear technology did.",
        "And as it proliferates, then what happens if it falls into the hands of, as we say, sub-state actors, terrorist groups?",
        "Well, you know, there's a little bit of this that was in the run-up to the Iraq war.",
        "There was a speech that President Bush gave in the Cincinnati train station, where he was trying to lay out the threat that Saddam Hussein posed.",
        "And he briefly talked about a drone technology that the Iraqis might be able to put on ships, get near to American shores and launch.",
        "It seemed pretty far-fetched then, and we learned later that they were no place near that capability, but the moment will come, and especially as the drones get smaller and easier to transport.",
        "And you know, what's really remarkable is that a lot of the American drones, including some of the unarmed ones, are pretty small."
