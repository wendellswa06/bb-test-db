        "With the use of drones, you know, and cruise missiles, which have been around for a little bit longer, now politicians have an easier time engaging in military acts because they no longer have the deterrence of American loss of life.",

        "This issue of making war an easier thing to happen has come up every time there has been a standoff weapon system, whether it's missiles or bombers or cruise missiles or whatever."

        "On the other hand, the other way to look at it is that you may be able to stop an incipient war, and that's, I think, what the Obama administration would argue that they did in Libya, that they stopped a much larger loss of life.",

        "The weaponization of drones is proceeding down the size scale.",
        "So whereas today most of the weaponized drones are these very large, almost business-jet-sized devices, what you have now is more and more attention being focused on the weaponization of smaller drones, which raises any number of significant security concerns.",
        "And in addition, what you have is much of the discussion, much of the national dialogue about drones has often been focused on our use and our manufacture of drones.",

        "I think Israel initiated the use of drones in warfare over the Bekaa Valley, and the Syrian air force thought those were Israeli jets and flew up, and Syria lost most of its air force in an afternoon.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "Israel has been always a major player and has unveiled larger and larger and more sophisticated and longer-range drones, in large part to counter the threat from Iran.",
        "And of course, China has been, just in the last year or two, very - has exhibited an increasing array of drones.",
        "I believe they had several dozen different types of drones exhibited at the Zhuhai air show in 2010.",
        "And so they've been very visible, as well.",

        "But the initial resistance in the Air Force, which former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates talked about a lot at the beginning of his tenure, was that the whole role to - the run-up to promotion in the Air Force, was all about being a pilot.",

        "But over time, it's become clear to the Air Force that this is their future, and suddenly, you know, there has been a significant cultural change to the point that there are probably more drone pilots being trained now, than there are fighter pilots.",
        "Here's an email question from Chris(ph): Could the guests comment on the development of autonomous drones, aka Skynet that, of course, referring to the robot bad guy in the \"\"Terminator\"\" movies.",
        "But John Villasenor, what do you think?",
        "I think autonomous is a term that can - it's an umbrella term that can mean a lot of things.",
        "I think we're a long way away from drones that will complete entire missions, including, potentially, decisions to use lethal force, without any human being in the loop.",
        "But autonomous to the extent that it means drones being automatically fly to certain locations without somebody literally at the joystick, that's here already.",
        "And one of the great debates that's going on right now is how far do you turn that dial, and, you know, how much decision power do you allow to rest within the brains - the computer brains - inside a drone.",
        "And the other aspect of autonomy which is very interesting, is how that might enable drones to act in concert with each other.",

        "This is a big concern of people in the Homeland Security world.",
        "And their first concern after - in the years after 9/11 was what would happen if a private plane was loaded with explosives, since there are a lot of private planes that come in there.",

        "Or anthrax or whatever.",
        "But the remote control adds just another level of concern and a question of how fast one could scramble to go stop that.",
        "On this question that came up before, the autonomous weapons, you know, this is one of the reasons that understanding the legal chain of command of the decisions that are made here is so important, because you don't want to have a plane making life and death decisions or software making life and death decisions, any more than you would want that happening on the ground battlefield.",
        "I guess, perhaps I could add a couple of points to that.",
        "So first of all, one thing to keep in mind I think on the autonomous aspect, is that it's not a new technology, but anti-personnel landmines have of course been around for the entire - essentially the entire 20th century.",
        "And they don't make any intelligent analysis at all before they, you know, kill whoever happens to step on them next.",
        "And so, you know, unfortunately we have a long history of machines essentially engaging in killing, and so I think when people are designing - figuring out how to use drones, we have to keep in mind that, you know, there's already been a precedent of these things and try to improve upon that.",
        "And there's also a treaty to ban them, which the U.S.",
        "has been reluctant to sign onto because of their use in the Korean peninsula.",
        "But you're absolutely right.",
        "Right, and then the other point, I guess, to be made about the gentleman's email regarding terrorist groups is unfortunately, it's not in the future, it has already happened that terrorist groups are well aware of drones.",
        "The Aum Shinrikyo sect, which was behind the Japanese subway bombings a number of years ago, was widely reported to have considered but then rejected the use of drones in their attacks.",
        "There's evidence that the Colombian revolutionary FARC group has also looked at drones.",
        "Al-Qaeda is known to have looked at drones, as are some of the groups in the Gaza Strip.",
        "And so, you know, those folks read the newspapers just like the rest of us, and I think, unfortunately, an aspect of anti-terror, of concerns in the future, is going to be how do we protect against the inevitable attempts by terror groups to get their hands on and potentially use drones.",
        "And that raises a question.",
        "We'll get to more calls in just a second.",
        "There have been all kinds of concerns over the past decades about terrorists getting their hands on shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles.",
        "Indeed, some have.",
        "And some attempts have been made.",
        "But David Sanger, these have never turned out to be the bugaboo that a lot of people thought.",
        "That's right.",
        "And there's a new concern about this because there were a lot of these in Libya.",
        "And some have gone missing, and people are not entirely sure who's in their hands.",
        "Fortunately in those cases, if they're old, they misfire a good deal of the time.",
        "But it does raise the question, as any new technology would, do you want to build a clock into these things so that they are not useful later on.",
        "Expiration date."
