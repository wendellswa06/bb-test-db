        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I had a couple questions related to the domestic implications of drone usage.",
        "And for example, we're all talking about military applications overseas, but what about military applications on continental United States and other agencies that would be allowed to use them?",
        "And I'm just curious about any ideas whether drones have been used currently already in the United States, and if they have not, are there plans or ideas of what agencies would be involved to have a mandate to utilize those in the United States?",
        "I know there's been discussion of using them to monitor the border with Mexico.",
        "I don't know that they have been used as yet.",
        "And I guess, John Villasenor, is there any reason they couldn't be used to monitor traffic?",
        "Well, I think they are being used, I don't think, by - to the best of my knowledge, not by the military.",
        "But certainly, the folks in charge of protecting the border have used what are sometimes considered drones, these large, you know, balloons that'll sit up there, that'll - with - that can survey huge amounts of area at one time.",
        "Those are being used, as well as other drones.",
        "And it...",
        "Aerostats, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Aerostats, I believe, is a company, made in South Dakota, that's a very - Aerostar International, I believe, which is a major player in that industry.",
        "In addition, drones are genuinely extremely valuable for law enforcement.",
        "So, for example, if you think of a police force that may not have the budget to have a helicopter, if you can put a drone up over a hostage situation, you might be able to gather some genuine lifesaving information.",
        "So there are lots of very, very legitimate - and they're also used for surveys, agricultural surveys, oil pipeline monitoring.",
        "There's enormous number of completely very good domestic, nonmilitary applications of drones, and I believe they are being used - but, again, to my knowledge, not by the U.S.",

        "Brad, thanks very much.",
        "Here's an email from Hans in Kirkland, Ohio: For drones to be effective, don't you need complete air superiority in the area where they're being used?",
        "Yes, ours fly high enough to avoid small-arms fire from the ground and are fairly stealthy.",
        "However, for instance, if the Pakistani air force wanted to shoot down our Predators, they could do so easily.",
        "This is a requirement of Somalia, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan.",

        "First of all, they run pretty high.",
        "Second, you have to be able to see them.",
        "And so what was the most remarkable thing that really struck the Pakistanis and angered them about the bin Laden raid?",
        "It wasn't simply that the raid happened.",
        "It's that a drone, called the RQ-170, that was coated in stealth material, was hovering over the bin Laden compound and providing photographs of it, and the Pakistanis never saw it.",
        "And that was a very big issue within the ISI and the Pakistani military - still is.",
        "And, of course, they all wonder, gee, are the Americans using that same system to go survey the Pakistani nuclear sites?",
        "And I would just add to that that I would respectfully disagree that it's necessarily easier to shoot these things down.",

        "And it's carried.",
        "It can be launched and controlled at a very low altitude.",

        "I was - it occurred to me that in, you know, in 2000, around that time, people were, you know, the idea of the drone was a great idea, but the idea of arming one was just out of the question.",
        "And in about eight year - about three years ago, I started asking my friends: What changed?",
        "What - how come the attitude of the American people is so different now compared to what it was just 10 years ago?",
        "David Sanger?",
        "What changed was 9/11.",
        "And right after 9/11 is when an exploration began of new and different ways to go after al-Qaida in mountainous areas where you couldn't send troops and where the risk of sending a manned aircraft was pretty high.",
        "And suddenly, what began out of small experiment that the Air Force, and then the CIA were running, mushroomed into a fairly good-size industry.",
        "And because the program has really flourished under the CIA, there really has not been much public discussion by politicians or intelligence personnel or even the Air Force about the conditions under which it's used.",
        "That's one of the arguments in favor of actually moving this over to the military, so that discussion...",
        "Well, that seems to suggest to me that the CIA is now fighting our wars instead of the military.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And that's a question that's been raised at many levels, and you've hit on something that's been the subject of other programs, too.",
        "But, Bob, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Thank you."

        "The question is: Who is doing the targeting?",
        "And some of the issues that have come up in the past have come from questions about whether or not the initial targeting information was polluted, incorrect, didn't have a full understanding of what civilians were around.",
        "Interestingly, John Brennan, the president's chief counterterrorism adviser, made the argument in a speech he gave a few months ago that the number of civilian causalities from these drones have gone down to near zero.",
