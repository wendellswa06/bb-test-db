        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Exactly.",
        "And the controversy was whether Preval had 50 percent or not, and what happened in the last two or three days was, in the first place, that Preval claimed that there was a fraudulent election, and that people were, to put it bluntly, stealing the election from him.",
        "Then, and that's a very critical factor in the whole equation, is the reality of people power, as it were.",
        "Thousands and thousands of people, in particular in Port-au- Prince, went out and protested the results, and put enormous pressure on the electoral council and the interim government of Monsieur Latortue.",
        "And that led to a situation where the interim government decided that it would investigate the claims of fraud, and in the last two days, in particular, it became increasingly clear that fraud existed.",
        "The question is whether that fraud was so widespread that it would have deprived Preval of his victory in the first round or not.",
        "And it appears that the fraud was extensive, probably not as large as Preval had claimed, but extensive enough that it would have cut that 1 or 2 percent that Preval really needed.",
        "And then...",
        "It is important to suggest that, at various points, fraud in elections in Haiti can cut both ways."

        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, most elections in Haiti are not necessarily very clean.",
        "But, in that election, it's probably the cleanest elections we've had, but because you had a significant number of foreign observers, and you had a computerized system, and lists of voters were duly tabulated, etcetera.",
        "But the evidence of the fraud came out on Tuesday evening, when suddenly, they discovered thousands and thousands of ballots burning in a dump.",
        "And, at that point, Haitian TV, Haitian radios went to the scene and discovered that most of those votes actually were votes for Mr. Preval.",
        "And it was very difficult, at that point, to stop the popular pressure.",
        "And the international community began to talk about a deal.",
        "And yesterday, Brazil, which is the most significant actor in Haiti in terms of its contribution to the United Nations troops, declared that it would like to see a deal, whereby Mr. Preval would in fact get his 50 percent.",
        "And the deal was eventually struck last night, and what happened is that there was a so-called blank vote.",
        "And the blank vote was subjected to all kinds of controversy.",
        "The blank vote is a vote where no one votes for anyone, and it's provided, actually, by the constitution.",
        "The problem, though, is the extensive nature of that vote.",
        "It represented something like 125,000 votes.",
        "And most Haitians don't believe that people would have gone to vote, waking up at 4:00 o'clock in the morning, and they're waiting eight, nine, ten hours to vote, and, would have just taken a blank vote.",
        "That did not make sense in the political atmosphere of Haiti.",
        "Yes.",
        "And in addition, it appears, too, that many of those blank votes were stuffed the ballot boxes.",
        "So, last night they decided that they would just discount that vote, and at that point, Preval got his 51 percent.",
        "Well, joining us now on the line, from Haiti, is Amelia Shaw, a freelance reporter.",
        "She's in Port-au-Prince.",
        "Good to have you on the program, Amelia, again.",
        "Oh, it's great to be back, Neal.",
        "I wonder, this declaration of this deal last night, does it sound as if, to an outsider, it sounds as if everybody just decided it was going to be too much trouble, we should point out that this is the, what, fourth or fifth attempt to hold a presidential election in Haiti, that after all this time, too much trouble to have a second round.",
        "Let's just make everybody happy and declare Preval the winner.",
        "Well, it does seem that way.",
        "It seems very much like the international community was, in a sense, scrambling to pick up the pieces after everything fell apart."

        "It's like they held beautiful elections last week which were largely uncontested, up until the time when Preval's lead started to decline.",
        "And many Haitians, I believe, yesterday, were starting to ask themselves, where are we going with this?",
        "How are we going to pull ourselves out of this impasse?",
        "And I think, in many ways, for people, even for people who didn't vote for Preval, necessarily, the celebrations this morning were as much about celebrating the fact that Preval was President as the fact that this conflict had been resolved.",
        "And so, there were many people out there celebrating who didn't vote for Preval, but who were just happy that they had a President.",
        "So, this will not undermine his legitimacy, the idea that six months from now people could start whispering, well, you know, he didn't really get elected.",
        "I think that that's very unlikely.",
        "You know, first he had such wide international backing.",
        "Second, he has just a very wide voter support base.",
        "You know, let's remember, he was, by far, the most popular candidate out of the 33 candidates that were on that ballot.",
        "And he has the fierce support of the supporters of former President Aristide.",
        "Which is also, while it is a benefit to him right now, it's also going to pose it's own sort of challenge down the road.",
        "And particularly, if Mr. Aristide returns to Haiti.",
        "Has there been any news of that at all?",
        "I'm not sure what the official news is, but sometimes people who live in Haiti say that this country sometimes runs on rumors.",
        "And, many of the people who voted for Preval did so with the intention or with the deep desire to have Aristide return.",
        "And, so, you know, people have said to me, a vote for Preval is a vote for Aristide, and so I think that there is just very high expectation among his support base that he will make it so that Aristide can return from exile.",
        "And finally, Amelia, in the days, the last couple of days when there were all these allegations of fraud and charges that the election was stolen, there was unrest developing, another round of unrest, in Haiti.",
        "Has this declaration of Mr. Preval as the winner in the Presidential election, has that diffused all of that?",
        "I would say, absolutely.",
        "Or at least, it's diffused it for the moment, until something else creates instability.",
        "But, this is to say, you know, when those ballots were found on the dump site, and they were televised on national TV, hundreds of Haitians went to the dump and started scavenging, as much looking for, you know, a piece of that historical moment, as they were looking to hold a piece of the truth in their hands.",
        "Which, in their minds, you know, this is incontrovertible proof that there was fraud.",
        "Well, there are lots of problems that Mr. Preval is going to have to face; problems related to the reconstruction of the country, problems related to the creation of a government."

        "And there, he may have a significant problem because it may well be that in the Senate and Congress, you will get a very different configuration of power; people who are opposed to Preval, and some people who are prepared to collaborate with him, but who might not in fact be from his own party.",
        "So, once you have that election, you need to get a prime minister.",
        "And this is going to be one of the immediate, critical issues facing Mr. Preval, because he will need to create a government that could appeal not only to his base, but also to people who voted against him.",
        "So, this is going to be a very complicated exercise, a balancing act, and he needs to be very careful.",
