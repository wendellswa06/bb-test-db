        "In particular, Haitian-Americans.",
        "And he may be able to do that by doing something fairly simple.",
        "That is to say, trying to incorporate into his cabinet, or in some fundamental way, a Haitian- American from Texas who's a millionaire, by the name of Misseur Semaeous(ph).",
        "And if he can draw Mr. Semaeous, I think he would be able to extend, as it were, his power toward the constituency that had been previously marginalized.",
        "I think that would be a very smart move.",
        "And there are other constituencies which have also appeared in Haiti, and people have not really talked about them, and those constituencies are very much what you might call the evangelical vote in Haiti.",
        "The candidate, the two candidates who were Protestant candidates, and they did extremely well in the group that followed Mr. Preval.",
        "They were very close, and actually, if they had joined together, they probably had been in third place.",
        "And one of them, a fellow by the name of Chavongin(ph), declared that he supported Aristide, sorry, supported Preval, and that there was no need for a second round.",
        "So, at that point, I assumed that Mr. Preval will extend his hand towards Mr. Chavongin with all kinds of networks, Protestant networks in Haiti, as well as a very extensive network of connection to the United States.",
        "And, Saudli, thank you very much for the phone call, we appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We should note that the White House issued a statement earlier today, qyote, \"\"We congratulate Mr. Preval on his victory.",
        "We look forward to working with the new government to help the Haitian people build a better future for themselves."

        "There is a saying in Mexico that many Haitians share, and that's so far from God, but so close to the United States.",
        "And to that extent, I think Mr. Preval will feel much better knowing that the United States, at least at the moment, is welcoming his election and accepting the results as fair and free.",
