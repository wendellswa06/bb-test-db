        "It was actually very freeing for me now to say, hey, I might have sucked at that job because sometimes you're in the wrong job.",

        "That's right, we can, you know, it's so painful that I would like to maybe take the break to emotionally recover.",

        "And, you know, you just don't want to wind up in the same boat as Paul.",
