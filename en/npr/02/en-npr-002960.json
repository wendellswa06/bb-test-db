        "Oh what fun.",
        "That's okay, we're doing a reading tonight of stories from the book and Fisher was going to read, but now we have an opportunity to hear your story, Fisher, though.",
        "All right well Fisher you, I think you're included in the section of the book that says, maybe you deserved to be fired.",
        "Maybe you can tell us your story?",
        "And this is probably one of many of my times I deserved to be fired.",

        "And I got to Los Angeles and was greeted by all these happy, smiley people.",

        "And I had learned all my lines, thinking, you know, this is the script.",
        "And I said, well, I can't do this new script, this isn't what I had agreed to.",
        "And there like this isn't Shakespeare this is TV and, you know, you just have to that's the way we work here.",
        "And I guess I was a bit belligerent.",
        "And these beautiful young kids on the show were all coming up to me and saying, oh this is so great to have you and we admire your work.",
        "And I'm like well this is going kill your career guys, this is the worst thing for your acting.",

        "Yeah, exactly, and you guys this is going to be the worst thing for you, this is just crap.",

        "So, yes, it really helped put it into perspective.",
        "Gosh, how does that feel Fisher, to have somebody say well at least I wasn't fired from the cast of Friends?",
