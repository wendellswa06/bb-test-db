        "I'm told that about 150 former and current State Department officials have received letters.",
        "And I talked to a few of the diplomats today who didn't want to be named, and what they described was kind of two rounds of this - that in December of 2017 or January of 2018, they got formal letters about potential security violations, and it included the redacted emails that they had sent.",
        "And one person said it was so redacted it was blank, basically.",

        "One person told me that emails in question were summaries of cell phone conversations with foreign ministers that wanted to get urgent messages passed along to Hillary Clinton.",
        "So, you know, remember, it's cell phone conversations, so not on a very secure line.",
        "One key point to tease out here is that the material here was not classified at the time the emails were sent, right?",
        "They were - it was retroactively classified.",
        "That's right, and that's the big question that a lot of these diplomats have.",
        "You know, they were a dinner conversation with a bunch of foreign officials or with a bunch of foreigners, and they were writing back to this.",
        "Why would that be classified now?",

        "Others didn't know when theirs were retroactively classified.",
        "That's an important point.",
        "Another important point - you mentioned timing, that this picked up again last month.",
        "Do we know why?",
        "I mean, and I'll just come out and ask.",
        "Do we know if this is in any way linked to everything going on with Ukraine and the whistleblower?",

        "For those of us trying to follow along with everything else going on, why does this matter?",
