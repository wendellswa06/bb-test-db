        "A congressional candidate in Florida drew a little ridicule this week.",
        "Bettina Rodriguez Aguilera, who's one of three Republicans and eight Democrats running in Florida's 27th congressional district, has said that she was taken aboard a spaceship when she was 7 years old.",
        "She does not mean at Disney World.",
        "I went in, she says, in a 2009 Spanish-language interview that appeared on YouTube this week.",
        "There were some round seats that were there and some quartz rocks that controlled the ship, not like airplanes.",
        "No, indeed, on airplanes these days, you have to pay extra for quartz rocks.",
        "Ms. Aguilera says she met three beings aboard the ship, two women and a man, all blond and tall, which sounds a little like the Swedish pop group ABBA.",
        "She says their arms were outstretched like the Christ the Redeemer statue that overlooks Rio and that the beings have communicated with her ever since telepathically.",
        "Well, that way you avoid roaming charges.",
        "When the Miami Herald called the candidate for a statement, Ms. Aguilera replied that a couple of former presidents have claimed to see UFOs and said, I join the majority of Americans who believe that there must be intelligent life in the billions of planets and galaxies in the universe.",
        "In fact, a 2012 poll by National Geographic and Kelton Research says 36 percent of Americans believe UFOs exist.",
        "Eleven percent say they've seen a UFO.",
        "Of course, Ms. Aguilera says she's been aboard a UFO and bantered with the crew, which is a little more involved than just saying you once saw something unidentifiable glow in the sky.",
        "I'm actually impressed that a candidate would acknowledge her contacts with extraterrestrial beings.",
        "Many voters say they want candidates from outside the Washington, D.C., bubble.",
        "You don't get more outside of that bubble than another planet.",
        "A candidate who declares extraterrestrial connections is only being transparent, to use a buzz word of our times.",
        "Voters have a right to know.",
        "Do the extraterrestrial beings have political action committees?",
        "Are there extraterrestrial lobbyists?",
        "Do they play golf at a Trump National Golf Club?",
        "Are they interested in a free trade agreement with Earth, or do they believe in Alpha Centauri First policies?",
        "I'm also concerned that the candidate says aliens visited Earth when she was 7 but haven't been back.",
        "Does that mean they came to Earth in search of intelligent life but said, eh, maybe we just better keep looking?"

        "Well, simply, a black hole is something that's so massive, the gravity is so great that the escape velocity from its surface is larger than the speed of light, and since nothing can travel faster than light, nothing can escape, not even light."

        "So it's something that is completely separated from the rest of the universe, and we've never - it's - I should say that black holes are a theoretical construct.",
        "We see objects that we think are black holes, but we aren't 100 percent certain.",
        "They're just so massive and so dense that according to our theories, they can't be anything else.",
        "I should say that they come in all different sizes, and one could imagine black holes ranging from the size of smaller than an atom up to billions of solar masses, and they have very different properties depending upon their mass, very different densities.",
        "And we think they form - we're reasonably certain they form at least in one simple way, when some kinds of very massive stars collapse so that there are 10 to 100 solar mass objects that after they burn their nuclear fuel, there's nothing to hold them up, and they collapse down to become a black hole.",
        "In fact, it was thought that it was originally impossible for that to happen, and John Wheeler, the physicist, originally argued that that shouldn't happen but eventually came around to realizing it must happen and coined the term black hole in the 1960s.",
        "And it's such a wonderful term that it's captured the public's imagination.",
        "Joshua Bloom, tell us how you came to the conclusion that a giant black hole gobbled up a star.",
        "Well, we arrived at that through a bunch of different observations that allow us to put this picture together.",
        "It was the energy.",
        "It was the time over which this event called Swift 1644+57, probably easiest just to call it the event because it's a bit of a mouthful.",
        "The spectrum that we observed across the electromagnetic spectrum and in fact the location of this one event, near the center of a distant and quite anonymous galaxy, all of those pieces of evidence led us to believe that what we're seeing is indeed a black hole swallowing a wayward star as it happened to get too close to that black hole.",
        "And the black hole beamed a jet of light and particles at us at Earth, which is why we saw these high-energy gamma rays.",
        "It's one of the sort of counterintuitive notions about black holes that I think it's worth bringing up that we think of them as these cosmic vacuum cleaners in many ways, sucking up everything around them, but actually, around black holes is where we get a tremendous amount of light in the universe.",
        "It is an efficient place to change mass into light in an E=MC2 sense, and so when you have gas swirling around a black hole, that gas gets very, very hot, and before it falls in, it can be seen across the universe.",
