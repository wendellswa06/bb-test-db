        "It's my life.",
        "And now, even though she's still in the U.S., she's found a way to do that, by forging an unlikely alliance of conservationists and former Israeli soldiers.",
        "Here's how it happened: soon after coming back to the U.S., she met a former Israeli soldier named Nir Kalron.",
        "Nir had heard about the bai massacre, and about her.",
        "He sought her out.",
        "He said he might be able to protect the elephants.",
        "He was part of a security company called Maisha in Tel Aviv that specialized in wildlife protection.",
        "He said to me, you know, you don't have to kill poachers.",

        "She encouraged him to go to the bai and told him who to talk to there.",

        "After serving in the Israeli army, he went off for adventure in Africa.",
        "He hired himself out as a security expert to African leaders.",
        "He also dealt in weapons - legally, he told us, when we called him in Tel Aviv.",
        "God forbid, no, not a mercenary.",
        "I was never a mercenary.",
        "But he told us he did become disillusioned with that work and the people he did business with, like Russian arms dealers."

        "The war is on the ground in the national parks.",
        "Nir and a team of former Israeli soldiers got to the bai about two weeks after the killings.",
        "The Bai was empty, full of carcasses and forensic evidence that we found - ammunition casings and tracks on the ground.",
        "We didn't see a single elephant.",
        "It was quiet.",
        "The poachers were gone.",
        "But Nir knew they could come back and kill more elephants.",
        "He hatched a plan to create a military-style reconnaissance team there, bring in communications equipment, satellite phones, solar power.",
        "He would train local people how to use these tools to warn authorities if poachers returned.",
        "But first, he needed the cooperation of the rebel leader who had taken over the area, a man known as Colonel Bahit.",
        "And I remember thinking, wow, this guy, maybe - we were not sure - but maybe had a lot of blood on his hands.",

        "Nir's experience working with African military officers paid off.",
        "He brought food and gifts.",
        "He took his time.",
        "We went in, met the colonel, agreed on calming the situation down, made a gentleman's agreement that the elephants will not be touched.",
        "The colonel said his men had not killed the elephants.",
        "In fact, evidence the poachers had left behind suggested they'd come from Sudan, on the northern border.",
        "Criminal or terrorist groups are known to traffic in ivory to raise money."

        "I realized that they really care, that the Africans care, not only the officials in different the wildlife services, but villagers.",
        "That realization made me feel less patronizing, and not think of it as a new form of conservation colonialism.",
        "Now, they've even got video cameras set up that send real-time images of the bai via satellite.",

        "The money to do this comes in part from the Wildlife Conservation Society, where Andrea Turkalo works, and from the World Wildlife Fund.",
        "I asked scientists at the Wildlife Fund what they thought of collaborating with a security outfit, with soldiers who'd dealt arms in Africa.",
        "They said ivory poaching is so bad now, they need people with skills that environmentalists just don't have.",
        "Andrea told us she agrees.",
        "Poachers are organized and heavily armed now.",
        "They will kill people, as well as elephants.",
        "And poaching aside, places where elephants live - like the Dzanga bai, that seemed so remote 12 years ago - are now war zones, the kinds of places Nir and his team know how to negotiate.",
        "I think in a lot of areas we're going to have to have people with their skills dealing with these situations, you know, where they go in and they actually deal with rebels and, you know, warlords."
