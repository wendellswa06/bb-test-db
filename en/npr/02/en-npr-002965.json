        "But he's also there to protect her because there are some folks in the Fort Kent area who on social media sites have made it clear they don't like the idea of her leaving her home until she's been cleared so I suspect that the trooper is there to enforce the court order, as well.",

        "There are other possibilities out there of what this could be, but it's the combination of all the observations we have now that really are I think starting to make this picture a bit stronger.",
        "One of the predictions of what it is that we're seeing, indeed if this is a black hole swallowing up a star, is that this event should never happen again.",
        "I think it's worth thinking about black holes and the life cycle of black holes not just in their sizes and their masses but in what they do to the surroundings.",
        "Many black holes are sitting there essentially dormant.",
        "The black hole at the center of the Milky Way, for instance, is considered to be a dormant black hole that is not gobbling up lots of gas around it.",
        "It's not gobbling up nothing, but it's much less than many other black holes, about 10 percent of them, that have a tremendous amount of gas swirling around them, producing what are commonly called as active galactic nuclei or quasars.",
        "And those black holes, we might think of their eating habits of ones of essentially voracious eaters with voracious appetites that last for millions or tens of millions of years.",
        "But the black hole that gave rise to this event that we're interested in was something more of a picky eater.",
        "It wasn't (unintelligible) lots of gas.",
        "If you - it's hard for us to understand - I think that you're saying it would never happen again.",
        "That's an absolute you said that scientists never speak in.",
        "Well, it's a prediction, and I should qualify never.",
        "I should say never in our lifetime or in mankind's lifetime, a prediction that this event should never happen from that galaxy again because the chances of a star getting too close to a black hole are actually pretty small.",
        "We think, from theoretical understanding and actually from some other observational constraints, that this should only happen about once per super-massive black hole per million years.",
        "So that is, you'd have to look at a million galaxies in one year just to see one of these sorts of events.",
        "Now this event was even stranger than that one in a million in that we had a very special vista on that event where the jet was pointing at us and not in some other random direction.",
        "Let me get a - in the short time we have, Lawrence, what do you think?",
        "Do you think this is possible?",
        "Well, yeah, what's amazing about the universe is that it's big and old, and anything that isn't ruled out by the laws of physics happens all the time.",
        "As it was just pointed out, this is a rare event, so people may say, well, how can you believe a one-in-a-million event, but the point is there are 400 billion galaxies in the universe that we can see with telescopes, and therefore rare events happen all the time."

        "It may be rare in any one galaxy, but if we look at enough galaxies, we might see them, and we've discovered that the universe is stranger than we almost ever could have imagined.",
        "Anything that isn't ruled out happens.",
        "And as was pointed out, you might - what may surprise some of your listeners is everyone thinks of sort of black holes as cosmic vacuum cleaners, that if everything falls into one that's near one, but it's the not the case.",
        "In fact, you can orbit around a black hole and not fall in, and black holes very effectively clear out the neighborhood around them, and after that, things that are moving far away from them don't fall in, and you have to be heading straight towards them to fall in.",
        "Otherwise you orbit around them just like you would the sun.",
        "So these kinds of things are indeed rare, but it's amazing that every time we open a new window on the universe, such as the new window we're seeing here, we're surprised.",
        "Well, in the minute or so I have left, another new window that was opened is a team of astronomers saying that they have found the oldest black holes yet, from the early beginning of our universe.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's amazing because what we - what was just pointed is true that most galaxies nowadays, when we look at them, many of them have large black holes in their center, we think, including our Milky Way.",
        "We look towards the center of the Milky Way, we see stars orbiting around something that we can't see, and they're orbiting so fast that the only thing we can understand to explain is a million solar mass black hole at the center of our galaxy.",
        "But what the astronomers have just seen using - looking for X-rays is the suggestion that even the earliest galaxies that were just forming in the universe may have had million or tens of million mass solar black holes, and that opens the question, the chicken-and-egg question: Were the black holes necessary for the galaxies to form, or were the galaxies necessary for the black holes to form, or were they necessary for each other to develop?",
        "And those are the kind of questions we're going to begin to answer as we look at the earlier, earlier universe.",
        "One last question for you, Dr. Bloom.",
        "Where do you go from here?",
        "Well, I think we need to understand whether we have actually seen an event like this from another galaxy in the past.",
        "There's great historical archives at high-energy wavelengths taken by many satellites over the last several decades.",
        "Now that we know what to look for, we need to ask that question have we actually seen this before but never recognized it.",
        "And if we haven't, that gives us a pretty good handle on how often this sort of event happens.",
        "If we've seen it, then it allows us to start actually doing some sort of demographic studies of these.",
        "How were the other events different from this one?",
        "It allows to get, I think, a very nice picture of how black holes in this very interesting eating channel, swallowing up stars rather than gobbling up gas, how it is that they actually grow, how often does this event actually happen, and try to nail that down.",
        "And Lawrence, what's the big question you'd like to know about black holes that are unanswered?"

        "And so that's an issue for government, but in every state they've got some money to subsidize low-income families.",
