        "So it's really a lot of this is a middle class crunch, it sounds like.",
        "Because people who are wealthy obviously have some financial options, people who are truly low-income have some non-profit or governmental options.",
        "That's true.",
        "But for everybody, there's not quite enough of it.",
        "And particularly the younger the child - there's not enough infant-toddler care.",
        "And that's the kind of care that requires fewer children to an adult, and so therefore it's costly to run, and so we have a number of challenges related to supply and demand.",
        "You break this down by race.",
        "It seems that Latino and African-American families paid the greatest proportion of household income on child care.",
        "What does that do to the disparities that might already exist in terms of how people earn in this country and how people spend in this country based on race?",
        "You're right.",
        "But I think the thing you have to factor into this equation that we haven't talked about yet is that many people either prefer or do it because that's what they can afford.",
        "Many of those families use family members, neighbors, friends, some people call it kith and kin care, for their children.",
        "And so in that way you know, families sometimes charge each other less or they do each other favors, that kind of thing.",
        "We just talked to a family - or the mother in a family where, although they have a good set of income, they had a lot of problems, potentially race-based, dealing with getting help.",
        "And there are some racial aspects to how even wealthier African-Americans in particular seem to be able to find help.",
        "So what you're talking about ended up being what manifested for them.",
        "They were put in a position where they had to turn to family.",
        "Now, obviously there is nothing wrong with using family, but does that put a strain sometimes within family?",
        "It can because, you know, we talk about we're going through a period where many more grandmothers, for example, are caring for children.",
        "And sometimes, you know, if grandma is in her seventies and you've got a feisty little toddler that can be quite taxing on families to try to keep that going in a consistent kind of way.",
        "I mean, I think it's deadly, it's putting some sort of brainwash.",

        "So what can we learn about hurricanes by looking inside of them?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, hurricanes are basically like big heat engines.",
        "And over the years we've gained a great deal of knowledge in telling the public where hurricanes are going.",
        "In other words, our hurricane track forecasts are quite good.",
        "Where we suffer some is the intensity forecast.",
        "We still have a limited knowledge in that regard.",
        "By looking inside the storms, essentially popping the hood, if you will, we can actually see the engine.",
        "Now, we can't see the engine directly, but we can see the rainstorms.",
        "And the rainstorms are basically signatures of energy being released in the hurricane.",
        "And so by being able to identify these big pistons, if you will, in the engine, we can say something about intensity processes, the rain potential of a storm.",
        "And ultimately some of this data may find its way in the future into our computer models, which hopefully would improve intensity forecasting.",
        "Did popping hood of Sandy reveal anything interesting?",
        "Yeah.",
        "We could see - as Sandy was moving up the - towards the north, taking these CAT scans and looking at these rainstorms, we could clearly see that there's a very well-defined system, tropical system, with an eye and a well-defined eye wall.",
        "The eye wall is the region of a thunderstorm surrounding the eye.",
        "That was telling us quite a bit.",
        "This storm is still fairly organized.",
        "And even as Sandy moved further north and got over the warm Gulf Stream waters, there we saw intensifications just prior in the hours - prior to landfall because it was really tapping into the fuel.",
        "Fuel supply for hurricane is warm water.",
        "And the warmer the water, the higher the octane for that engine, if you will.",
        "So it's really a very different view of storms and one that NASA has pioneered.",
        "I worked for 12 years at NASA, at Goddard Space Flight Center, working on the TRMM mission and also as the deputy project scientist on the mission that would follow TRMM, the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission, or GPM."

        "Now, I heard that the GOES satellite was down a few weeks before Sandy, and we had to rely on a back-up satellite.",

        "I mean, are they being replaced as they age?",

        "As I mentioned, we can't just pop the satellite up there.",
        "It takes many years of engineering, testing and then launch.",
        "And so we have a plan in place.",
        "There is a program in place, but you have to have the money.",
        "We can't essentially put these satellites on layaway, if you will.",
        "So we really need to have the budget in place and the commitment.",
        "And I think that NOAA and our colleagues there are committed.",
        "I think that there is a desire because we've been - even more so with things like Sandy, we realized the value of these satellites, not just for monitoring the storm, but 85 to 95 percent of the data from these satellites go into our forecast models.",
        "And it shouldn't be missed that Sandy was picked up by some of our best forecast models and the European models eight, nine days out.",

        "But, you know, one of the things - and I may be a bit biased, but some of the technology that, for example, flies on some of the low Earth orbiting satellites like the radars that TRMM flies and the GPM will fly, and even some of the laser technologies that we now have for things like monitoring the surface hide(ph) of the ocean, these can only fly on low Earth orbiting satellites.",
        "But boy, it would really be great to have a precipitation radar or that type of capability on some of our geosynchronous satellites, which basically stay parked and monitor the same location over the Earth.",
        "Now, those geosynchronous satellites are at about 35,00 kilometers or roughly, you know, 23, 24 thousand miles up.",
        "So technologically it's a bit challenging now to put radar on a geosynchronous satellite, but it would be really groundbreaking and an advance if we could.",

        "I think we have primed the system for more intense storms going forward.",
        "Although every single storm might not be a Sandy, with warmer sea surface temperatures and an atmosphere that can hold more water vapor because it's warmer, we've essentially primed the pump for more storms though.",
        "I think climate change, if you will, is the steroid on storms of the future.",
        "We can't link any individual storm, but I think we can show that there is a footprint on the overall intensity increases.",
        "We can't say much, I would argue, about how more frequent these types of storms will be.",
        "I don't think our science and the literature is there, but there is some informative literature by colleagues at NOAA like Tom Knutson and Bender which suggests that we would see more intense storms."
