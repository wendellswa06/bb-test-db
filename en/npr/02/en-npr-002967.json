        "It was hybrid system in that it was a hurricane and then became extra-tropical storm.",
        "But if you think about hybrid cars, it was getting its fuel from the ocean for the first half of its life cycle, but then it transitioned to a mid-latitude cyclone and its getting its fuel from the atmosphere.",
        "And that's the difference in these types of storms.",

        "And also, even the ones you have seen - I don't know if you've seen the full video of it rolling up the globe.",
        "It really puts Sandy in context.",
        "And also part of the video that we didn't get into, we didn't hear from anybody else, is that that high pressure front that bumped Sandy westward, made it take a left hook, was sitting over Greenland, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "Dr. Sheppard told us this in the video, that they seem to be linked, that that warming above Greenland over the summer that caused all that melting may be linked to actually what caused Sandy to turn left.",
        "And you can see - you actually see the images of Greenland melting also in our video.",
        "It's quite dramatic."

        "So, one day at an editorial meeting, she said why don't we write to some well-known authors and see if they'll do a children's book?",
