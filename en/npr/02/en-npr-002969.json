        "You know, like that - well let me see, I don't even know where to start.",
        "I mean, I can tell you that this kind of tradition at the New Yorker, I can take some kind of illegitimate paternity for with covers I was doing in the early nineties for the magazine.",
        "This is me talking, sort of like as a loose cannon, not connected to the New Yorker, or to the people that I know up there, or the artists who I know, but I think they did an amazing, brave, and important thing."

        "There's a lot of kind of strange elitism not coming from the magazine often accused of being elitist, but from the people who say, well, I understand this, it's not very funny.",
