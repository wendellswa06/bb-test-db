        "When we heard Hillary Clinton talking about average Americans, hard working Americans, who was she talking about exactly?",
        "When we heard one newscaster after another managing to garble the name of Obama and Osama, or harping on the middle name Hussein - this guy isn't one of us.",

        "This is not challenging the readership of the New Yorker, is it?",
        "No, it's not - I think ultimately it is, based on some of the returned cancel-my-subscription stuff that must be coming in to their magazine.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But I think a lot of that is from worrying about dare this be said, because if it's said, then somebody might misunderstand.",
        "I think within the safe confines of the New Yorker, I think irony is an understandable concept.",
        "It's important ultimately that the entire country become visually more literate than it is and capable of withstanding and understanding irony and how it functions and all that stuff, and I think that this is actually the education process at work.",
        "With all of the crazy noise around it, it's having that function of making it harder to believe that image, not easier.",

        "No, no, no, I know he's - I know he's a Muslim.",
        "And, you know, that stuff comes from either the right, the extreme right or blogs, and I can see how the Obama people would be mad because you have this.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I thought it could be misunderstood as me objecting to being taxed, because there was this rabbit crucified on a tax form, where I - my objections actually were what my taxes were being used for, not the fact the taxes were there."

        "So, in essence, while some people may fear that the image somehow reinforces these false ideas about the Obamas, in fact, the conversation that it has spurred in the media actively enforces the truth, that these rumors are not only wrong, but they are irrational and ridiculous.",
