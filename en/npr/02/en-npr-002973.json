        "Well, I think we should keep in mind that Tennessee is a Republican stronghold.",
        "I think if Harold Ford had been white, he would have had difficulty running in Tennessee because it's just structurally, it is very difficult for Democrats to run statewide in Tennessee.",
        "So I don't necessarily, I don't want to say that this is completely a racial factor.",
        "I mean is there a racial element in there?",
        "Quite probably.",

        "As well as Michael Steele did in Saint - in Prince George's County and doing with the black vote in Maryland, there is an Eastern Shore element that is, to use a phrase, as redneck as a lot of, as some parts of the South.",
        "And so I think that may have slowed the amount of regular Republican votes he might have gotten out of there as well.",
        "So it's still…",
        "Farai, I mean it's undoubtedly a mix bag, but I think what we need to be asking a real question about is still can African-American candidates win in statewide elections?",
        "And we can only know that to be true when in fact African-American candidates win in statewide elections.",
        "And so of course it's complicated by questions of partisanship and region.",
        "But it remains true that we are still talking about the first, the second.",
        "It's still extremely difficult for black candidates to win.",
        "I want to hit a couple more topics before we let you go.",
        "Ballot initiatives, six states raised the minimum wage, seven banned same-sex marriage, possibly more.",
        "Michigan passed tough new restrictions on affirmative action.",
        "Briefly, Melissa and then Robert, what does this say about the American electorate's mood?",
        "Well, I mean it's interesting how these ballot initiatives are working.",
        "Partly what they're doing is working to get people turned out to the polls.",
        "But they're also working to actually siphon some off some the mixed bag of ideas that people have.",
        "So in other words, you might be a social conservative.",
        "You can go in and kind of vote against gay marriage but still cast your vote for the Democratic candidate who's running for election.",
        "So it may in fact be working against -some of the folks who are putting these on the ballots may find that the initiatives don't lead to an increase in vote for their candidates.",
        "You have had several important men in your life who have been verbally or physically abusive to you, or both.",
        "What did it do to you to not just once or twice, but several times have these relationships that you cared about go in a direction where you weren't even feeling physically safe?",
        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "I mean I think one of the clear examples of that, frankly, was in Virginia, where some of the exit polls showed that 30 percent of voters who voted for James Webb, the Democrat, also voted for the same-sex marriage ban even though he himself was against the statewide ban.",
        "I think that's definitely showing that it works in different ways.",
        "One of the things I think is also happening here with these initiatives is it also reflects a frustration of inactivity on some of these issues at the federal level.",
        "I think many Democrats and many liberal leaners in various states were frustrated that the minimum wage had not been raised in about ten years, and so they decided to put it on a ballot initiative.",
        "DIY - do it yourself.",
        "One last topic because we don't have much time.",
        "You've got subpoena power in the House in the Democrats' hands.",

        "I mean I say this as a Republican, and it wasn't exactly a great night for our party.",
        "However, I think one of the big problems - and it was showed in the exit polls - they were concerned about the issues of corruption and scandal.",
        "And, frankly, the Republican Congress fell down on the job on practicing legitimate oversight on the executive.",
        "And now we're going to end up having some partisan oversight.",
        "If you're not going to have the regular kind of oversight, this is what you're going to end up getting.",

        "And if the Congress is going to increase the number of Democrats, if the Democrats are going to take the White House, they have to not only do oversight, they have to develop a real language, a real agenda, a real vision for what it means to have a democratic America.",
