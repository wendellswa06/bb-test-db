        "While anybody who is supportive of Hillary Clinton learned in 2007 and 2008 never to talk about inevitability, she is, in fact, better positioned heading in 2016 than she was heading into the 2008 presidential cycle, that she is a more admired, less-polarizing figure than she was in 2008.",
