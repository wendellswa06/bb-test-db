        "We should mention, however, that Bebbanburg Castle plays a role in the first of the Saxon tales.",
        "And Uhtred is then kicked out pretty much and raised by Danes and spends the next four and a half books yearning to re-conquer the castle that's been taken over by his evil uncle.",
        "His evil uncle, I think, is going to spend the next four and a half books doing the same sort of yearning.",
        "It puzzles me because when I first started writing the books, I wondered, how on Earth did my family hold on to that castle, I mean, to that fortress?",
        "Because Northumbria was taken over by the Danes, by the Vikings.",
        "And yet, the family, which was Saxon, held on to that land.",
        "It was - at some point it was called Little England.",
        "And I don't know, we don't know.",
        "I mean, we know that somebody called Uhtred existed.",
        "We don't know anything about him.",
        "I mean, almost certainly they held on to the land because they have compromised, but I have a slightly more heroic version in the books.",
        "And indeed, well, there's some compromise involved at various points here, but Uhtred fights on behalf of King Alfred, as you point out, the only king in all of British history to be dubbed The Great.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, they don't actually have a noble committee that sits on this.",
        "I mean, it seems to be - you know, I was really capricious who gets called the great and who doesnt.",
        "But, I mean, he does deserve it.",
        "I mean, if it was up to me, I'd add Elizabeth I to the list.",
        "But - no, Alfred was -he's great because he preserves what will become England.",
        "There comes a point in his reign when he's driven onto the marshes of Somerset by the Danes.",
        "And really if you are a betting man, you have to say that the Saxons are about to be defeated forever.",
        "The Danes have taken Northumbria.",
        "They have taken the kingdom of Mercia.",
        "They've taken East Anglia.",
        "And now it looks as if they're going to take the last kingdom, the kingdom of Wessex.",
        "And once they've done that, we wouldnt be having this conversation in English, we would be speaking Danish.",
        "There wouldnt be an England, there'd be a Daneland.",
        "But Alfred not only survives, but he lays the foundation for what will become a country called England.",
        "Well, that low point you talk of, that's the story of \"\"King Alfred and the Cakes."

        "It still has enormous resonance in both France and in England.",
        "And it's partly the victory of a small army over a very large army.",
        "It's an unlikely victory.",
        "And one of the lovely ways to discover what really happened in history is to write a novel about it.",
        "So I've always been fascinated by Agincourt, so I went back and wrote the novel.",
        "And does this describe your technique for researching a lot of the periods of history that you write about?",

        "I mean, I obviously do an immense amount of research.",
        "You have to.",
        "But - because the further back you go in history, the easier it becomes, because theres not so much known about it.",
