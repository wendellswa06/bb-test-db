        "And the duke of Wellington actually enquired of London whether it was possible to raise a corps of longbowmen to fight against Napoleon.",
        "Well, the truth was they couldn't, because it took about 10 years to make an archer to become as strong as you needed to be to pull that weapon, and also to learn how to aim it, which is very, very difficult.",
        "So it was an extraordinarily difficult weapon to master.",
        "And curiously, the only place that seems to have mastered it ever was in the British Isles.",

        "Composite bow, yes.",
        "...and it's an amazing series of, you know, scenes as he competes and he just keeps putting the target farther and farther away, and had an incredible range.",
