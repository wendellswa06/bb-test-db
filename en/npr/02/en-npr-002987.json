        "A couple of things stood out, Madeleine.",
        "One was, he was very open about how his experiences at Harvard in the 1970s, the experience of going there from a small town in Indiana and the student protests, the anger about Vietnam and Watergate, really upset him.",
        "He said he was really offended by the students who seemed to be, quote, \"\"celebrating in favor of our enemies,\"\" end quote.",
        "Tell me what country allows enemies bent on murdering your citizens to have free access to cross the border?",
        "I mean, this is not unique to Israel.",
        "This is true anywhere in the world.",
        "Has Israel used an appropriate amount of force?",
        "Dozens of people have been killed.",
        "I think they've used an absolutely appropriate amount of force.",
        "I've studied this carefully.",
        "They have significant training and limitations placed upon their soldiers.",
        "They have pushed back women and children, who have been pushed to the front, without firing.",
        "They obviously do the best they can when they have to fire to aim below the knees.",
        "Look, this is a terrible, cynical manipulation by Hamas of the public discourse and of the political arena to try to garner sympathy.",
        "There was a narrative that they play into to help gain public opinion.",
        "And when people stop providing them with a platform, I suspect this will calm down.",
        "When you visit there, though, you realize the complexities of it.",
        "You do have Hamas, which the U.S.",
        "has designated a terrorist organization.",
        "But you also have 1.8 million people in far more poverty than you would see just a few miles away inside Israel, who for most people on most days are literally prevented from going anywhere.",
        "They can't travel, they can't go anywhere.",
        "And many of the people involved in these protests feel that all they're trying to do is walk out into land that they would argue that they have a claim to.",
        "Is there anything that Israel or the United States can do for them to address that specific concern that they feel imprisoned?",
        "I think the United States and Israel would do almost anything to alleviate the humanitarian crisis if it didn't result in a compromise of Israel's security.",
        "There's no lack of will.",
        "There are a limited number of options because the security situation there is so desperate because Hamas, frankly, is so treacherous.",
        "Although you also have this unresolved question of a Palestinian state."

        "Well, it's not going to get resolved if the Palestinians continue to burn tires and fly kites with swastikas that fly over the fence and explode in Israel.",

        "That is David Friedman, the U.S.",
        "ambassador to Israel.",
        "And just to repeat, he was answering questions there before the full extent of today's casualties became known.",
        "The person asking those questions was our colleague Steve Inskeep, who is still on the line.",
        "And, Steve, I've got one for you.",
        "Did you push him on that question of a Palestinian state?",
        "It's been reported that Ambassador Friedman is among the people working on a peace plan, along with Jared Kushner, President Trump's adviser and son-in-law.",
        "Yeah, the two of them are working with Jason Greenblatt, a presidential adviser.",
        "So I asked Friedman, have you got a document, you have a paper with a plan on it?",
        "He acknowledged maybe they had something but maybe not the final version.",

        "All right, NPR's Steve Inskeep reporting today from Jerusalem.",
        "Thanks, Steve.",
        "Good to talk with you.",
        "And this footnote - once the scope of today's casualties became clear, NPR asked Ambassador Friedman if he wanted to add anything to his comments.",

        "Last Tuesday, like many of you, I went to the polls to vote.",

        "Hi, Dahlia.",
        "Hey, Madeleine.",
        "So this is not a common occurrence, is it, for a chief justice or indeed, any justice to give a prime-time interview.",
        "What did you glean from his appearance on ABC last night?",
        "I think it sort of confirms what I have always suspected about Roberts, Madeleine.",
        "Which is, you know, at 51 years old - and that's extremely young for a chief justice - he is of a very different generation than his colleagues on the court, some of whom are in their 80s.",
        "He just doesn't have the hostility they have to TV, to technology.",
        "He's figured out, I think, very quickly, and we saw at his confirmation hearings last year, that TV can be your friend and that you can use it in an enormously effective way to get your message out.",
        "And so I think while a lot of his colleagues kind of want to hunker down in that marble palace, hide under the bench and hope the TV cameras go away, he's figured out how to sort of launch this charm offensive and to use it to make some, I think, very important legal points that he wants to make.",
        "And what were they?",
        "Did he give any indication of his legal leanings last night?",
        "Well, you know, he was very careful not to talk certainly about current cases, not to talk about pending cases.",
        "So he talked a lot about minimalism, about unanimity in the court, about how important it is for the court to decide cases very narrowly.",
        "In fact, he said that boldness is one of his least favorite qualities in a decision.",
        "That rather than boldness, you want to do tiny incremental moves that glean the most support from the majority of the justice to not only offer clarity to courts below, who understand exactly what the law is, but it creates a sort of stability in the case law so that you don't see opinions that veer and careen back and forth depending on the composition of the court.",
        "And he's really sounded those notes at a time when that's a very, very popular idea in the public imagination.",
        "Dahlia, Roberts is a very smooth and accomplished speaker, but did he say anything that surprised you last night?",
        "And it's interesting.",
        "I think in that sense, he joins former Chief Justice Rehnquist and Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito in saying that really, Vietnam was so formative, that student protest on campus was such a defining factor in their subsequent ideological and judicial conservatism.",
        "Paul Ryan has been serving in the House of Representatives since 1998.",
        "He's in his seventh term.",
        "But the reason everyone knows his name who knows his name is that he is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, and he has been putting forward for some years now - but now as House Budget Committee Chairman with some authority - a budget proposal, a plan for how to change the spending and taxing policies of the United States, and eventually balance the budget - not for a couple of decades, but eventually do it, and do it through a program of tax cuts and also program cuts, including great constraints on the spending we do for Medicare and Social Security.",
        "In other words: a controversial budget plan, one that has been highly energizing to conservatives and anathema to liberals."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)",
        "So what do you think it means that Mister Romney has picked a small-government guy to run with on this election?",
        "It means that Mitt Romney has decided that he has still to consolidate his conservative base going into the November election.",
        "At one time, most observers agreed, Mitt Romney thought his problems on the right were in the primaries.",
        "And once he had secured his nomination - which he did around March-April - that he could then begin to tack toward the center.",
        "His own campaign director at point referred to it as hitting the Etch-a-Sketch and starting over with a blank slate, and presenting himself to the country as more of a centrist.",
        "Now we see that that is not going to be possible for Mitt Romney - either because of the way they've been reading the polls, or because of the flak they've been taking from the right, they have decided that they need to go back to the base and secure that going into the fall, especially as we approach their convention later this month.",
        "So, Ron, do you take this as an endorsement of the kinds of things that Ryan has been talking about?",
        "I mean, it would - the vice president doesn't generally get to lead on issues.",
        "He gets to follow.",
        "Let's be clear.",
        "Paul Ryan's budget was already embraced by Mitt Romney earlier this year.",
        "He said he liked the Paul Ryan budget concept, and that he wanted to go in that direction.",
        "So, in a sense, it was already owned by Mitt Romney.",
        "But this is much more powerful.",
        "To put this voice, to put this personality, to put this symbol on the ticket is going to make this not just the Romney-Ryan ticket - as you said a moment ago, and you said a mouthful saying those two names together.",
        "It's going to be, for a lot of people, the Ryan-Romney ticket.",

        "But when Governor Romney was bouncing around the country, from primary to primary, he finally got to Wisconsin when Rick Santorum was his primary remaining rival at that point.",
