        "The ground shook for tens of seconds and the fault gave way over a stretch that's currently estimated around 30 to 60 miles.",
        "Abers notes that the epicenter was not only very close to Port-au-Prince, the quake started at a fairly shallow depth, just six miles below the surface.",

        "And since then, there have been more than a dozen strong aftershocks above magnitude five.",
        "One of the concerns right now is there's a lot of structures that are badly damaged in the main shock, and they're now being exposed to these late aftershocks, some of which are quite significant.",
