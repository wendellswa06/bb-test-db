        "On Mac OS, for instance, there's an option to do a 35-pass erase.",
        "And what that does is it goes to through hard drive and erases it 35 times over - overwriting that data.",
        "There's also software in the market with names like WipeDrive and Drive Erase Pro.",
        "And their sole purpose is to clear what's on your data completely and ensure your privacy.",
        "Okay, that's what they say, you know, on the box - said that they're going to clear all your data, but does the software actually work?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, I looked at reviews of these products on sites like Amazon.com where people have bought them and used them, and in most cases it does do what it says it's going to do.",
        "But there's always a problem when you're dealing with older hard drives that may have problems or disk errors or physical damage on them.",
        "So, not everyone who reviewed the products had a stress-free experience.",
        "One person on Amazon complained that instead of erasing a data drive, the software accidentally wiped out their whole operating system.",
        "Oh boy, it sounds like software is not necessarily a reliable option.",
        "Any other products worth looking into?",
        "Well, one product that I found that was interesting is called the Wiebetech Drive eRazer.",
        "That's eRazer, R-A-Z-E-R.",
        "It's a small box that plugs directly into a hard drive and wipes the data, and you don't have to deal with any software.",
        "If you have an older computer that no longer works, for instance, and you want to clear the hard drive inside before you donate or recycle the computer, it's a good option.",
        "It doesn't require any computer, and there are adapters that plug into virtually any kind of hard drive, even the smaller notebook drives.",
        "The eRazer runs about a $100 to $200, depending on what model and adapters you buy, but it works with virtually anything.",
        "Oh my goodness, it sounds like I should rent an Abrams tank or something and just run over it.",
        "That, to me, is absolutely safe.",

        "Avedikian says the shredded computer parts are all sold to downstream vendors.",
        "He also admits that not every recycling company shreds the hard drives it collects.",
        "Some send computer parts to landfills, or resells them or ship them overseas.",
        "It's a very, very big industry, and unfortunately, some recyclers out there try to find the easy way out, for the quick cash, we call it, but that's their type of business.",
        "But we do everything in an environmentally safe way.",
        "So, nervous hard drive owners, take note.",

        "So they beat the memory out of some of them, and killed those too ornery to even pretend to forget.",
        "That millions of black Americans also refer to ourselves as African-Americans is a celebration of our unique American experience; and it's true, our ancestors didn't land at Plymouth Rock.",
