        "A lot of very important figures in our history, Henry Kissinger, John Hay, William Seward have had that job and I think that she decided that it would take years to build up the kind of influence she wanted in the Senate.",

        "I think in general the appointees have been outstanding and on foreign affairs in particular, Republican senators as well as Democratic senators took a look at how Senator Clinton then dealt with foreign affairs and they admire the way she did it.",
        "So, she will come in I think especially on foreign policy with a great deal of support from both sides.",

        "And I think the first answer to that is how well does Obama do?",
        "I mean, if we are in deep trouble four years from now, the Republicans, even if they don't do anything smart will have a chance for a comeback.",
        "But, I think, unless they fundamentally rethink conservatism and present themselves as a more moderately conservative party, and accept the fact that they're going to run a big government whether they like it or not, they are going to be in the wilderness for a much longer time.",
