        "I was proposing that we hire a former violent felon that was prosecuted out of this district.",
        "To Burris's surprise, Judge Jackson agreed.",
        "Fast forward to today where Porter is working with a group of ex-offenders in an intense seven-month-long program he helped design.",

        "So until that, there was no promise and there was no law prohibiting anybody from getting anything.",
        "So if the rules changed in the middle of the game, it changed on those people who thought legitimately that they could get their record.",

        "But that young woman who is 17, whether she really wants the privacy, the secrecy - whatever we call it - or not, at that time of the crisis, because she's undergoing a crisis, where she would be parenting her own kid.",
        "So at that time, she may or may not believe that she never wants to know anything.",
        "But do you want to be held to all the promises you were made, to all the thoughts that you had when you were 17?",
        "I don't.",
        "The research is very clear that women, as they get older, want that information, want that knowledge, want to know that the life they created is all right.",
        "It doesn't mean they want them - parent.",
        "These laws, and what we're suggesting in the change of these laws, affect human - adopted people after they're at the age of majority.",
        "There are not a lot of 40-year-old men, running around looking for new mommies and daddies.",
        "What they want is the most basic information about themselves that everyone else gets as a birthright.",
        "And what we know about the birth parents, birth mothers in particular, is they don't mind that, they do not mind that in overwhelming majorities.",
        "So in a sense, what we discovered is these laws are seeking to protect people who don't want the protection.",
        "But, I mean, it's not hard to imagine a birth mother - I mean, for instance, let me sort of spin a scenario.",
        "Let's say a birth parent doesn't feel psychologically or emotionally able to handle the stress of renewed contact with a child, with a grown child of someone that she gave up for adoption long ago.",
        "Oh, of course.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I'm sure they exist.",
        "Wouldn't that person be terribly jeopardized by one of these laws?",
