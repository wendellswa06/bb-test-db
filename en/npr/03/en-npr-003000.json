        "But let me start with a little bit of a policy overview, and that is to say, first of all, that we're not opposed to openness.",
        "What we're opposed to is the law empowering one side to force themselves on the other.",
        "As an adoptive father, I can identify with any point on the spectrum, 180 degree spectrum, from people who really feel they have to have this contact, they have to have this information, to those who really - the larger number of them who are curious but they don't feel a great need for it.",
        "I can identify with all those perspectives.",
        "But what the law should do is it should facilitate that kind of contact in exchange when both parties desire it.",
        "So it shouldn't…",
        "So you're talking about a law that would offer some kind of mutual consent?",
        "Exactly.",
        "That should be the basis.",
        "We - in fact, we don't refer to these policies as open records.",
        "We refer to them as mandatory openness, because that's what it is.",
        "It's basically a declaration that all adoptions, past, present and future, should be open, whether the parties want that type of approach or not.",
        "So Adam Pertman, what's wrong with the idea of mutual consent?",
        "I mean, it seems like that would sort of bring everything out into the open and allow parents who gave up children to adoption to sort of have the option to get involved with their birth children or not?",
        "But, also, 10 years after I found out that she had died of cancer, I actually had symptoms of the same cancer.",
        "I had treatments, and one year later, I called my legislator in my town, a representative at my town, and asked him if he would sponsor this legislation.",
        "In 2005, we started off.",
        "It took us two years.",
        "But as of January 1, 2009, any adult adoptee that was adopted in the state of Maine is now able to apply to get their original birth certificate."

        "Well, I can answer that in several ways.",

        "I don't think adoptees - I'm also an adoptive father - I don't think my children or any of the kids like them, when they grow up, are stalkers, are ingrates, are people in search of new mommies and daddies, are people who want to ruin the lives of the women and men who created them.",
