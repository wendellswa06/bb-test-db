        "So these are the issues that are important to black people.",

        "From - what I'm seeing is - and, again, I talked about this before.",
        "When they talk about electability by default terms that we're talking about is a straight, white man.",
        "But as you're seeing these candidates come out and talk about their issues, they want someone who is going to do things and fight Trump.",
        "And they're particularly seeing with the Democratic candidates is that there are so many of those candidates that can do both of those things.",
        "So that's why you see so many people rising in the polls because electability is important.",
        "But they also know that they need someone who's going to be there and get things done because the country has been on the wrong track for so long since this man came into office.",

        "When you're out on the campaign trail on this whole question of electability versus - of, you know, a person you absolutely agree with, what did voters say to you?",
        "I think voters really - so I'm elected, currently, in a part of my district.",
        "And so what I hear voters saying loud and clear to me is, can you and will you do the same thing that you've done for - if elected to Congress?",
        "We want to know that you're going to remain connected to this community in sharing the voices that you hear here.",
        "My authenticity is - what led me to run this race is because voters said we've never really had somebody who's been true to their word and remained in our community and remain visible and viable.",
        "That's what people want to know.",
