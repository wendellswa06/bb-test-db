        "Christopher Burke personally suspects it might even share a world record.",
        "A hundred and thirty-four Fahrenheit was observed in Death Valley on July 10, 1913, and that record is now currently the official - the accepted hottest temperature measured on earth.",
        "Now, I look back at that record with a little bit of skepticism.",
        "Because in 1913, there wasn't even a heat wave.",
        "Christopher Burt says a number of higher temperatures were reported decades ago around the planet, but none of them were reliably documented.",
        "If that Kuwait record of 129.2 degrees is upheld, he says it would tie with the well-documented highest temperature on another day in Death Valley three years ago.",

        "What you have to be able to analyze at 10,000 feet up is why.",
        "Why are we always in this position?",
        "It's because we have set up a dynamic, especially in poor communities, where we ask our cops to contain and suppress those communities.",
        "And when you used to go down to a community like Watts - because there's a real success in Watts that shows the way out of this - they have a completely different kind of policing now.",

        "OK.",
        "You said that that's what it was but that it's different now.",
        "So what has changed in recent years in Los Angeles?",
        "Well, in Los Angeles, as in Dallas and I would say Cincinnati, for example, there are some large policing jurisdictions that, for the last 15 years, have been about the business of changing the mindset of their officers - changing the political mandate that they have when they go into poor communities.",
        "That relationship can no longer be that of a Rambo-like warrior cop who goes in there to contain and suppress and mass arrest and impose mass incarceration on a poor community.",
        "Bottom line - the vision behind this new policing, or healthier policing, is that the cops are there to be part of the community and not just another predator within the community inflicting harm and misery.",
        "Let me just ask - is that the right level to think about this?",
        "Because when we watch videotapes, what we see is an instantaneous reaction by an individual cop.",
        "We see a cop who, if the officer is wrong, acts too quickly.",
        "That's our perception anyway, looking at a lot of these videos.",
        "Do we need to look at that grander policy view rather than at what individuals do?",
        "In the videos that I have viewed, I've seen a lot of dynamics going on.",
        "Some of them are white cops who are clearly afraid of black men.",
        "And that always sets up a dynamic where you have hair-trigger force.",
        "You will also find some cops that are just bad with use of force.",
        "The bottom line is that yes, absolutely - you have to look at the training.",
        "You have to look at the mindset of the officer.",
        "You have to look at the levels of fear of both the folks who've been pulled over and the cops.",

        "For a Supreme Court justice to publicly call out a president - well, it's just not done.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think that there is a concern about that, and that's why this economic stimulus effort and the economic recovery is so important.",
        "The reason why automotive sales have dropped off is because people don't have the income to be able to purchase right now.",
        "In normal times, you would see a normal level of sales.",
        "But these are not normal times.",
        "And certainly the first piece of discretionary income that people will forego are very large consumer products, like a vehicle.",
        "So as long as this economic recovery is slow, the auto sales will be slow.",
        "And that's why it's so important in tandem for this economy to get back on track and for the Obama administration to be able to get into office and pass that economic recovery."
