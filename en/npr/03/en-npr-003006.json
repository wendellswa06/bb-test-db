        "(Reading) As scholars of the medieval world, we're disturbed by the use of a nostalgic but inaccurate myth of the Middle Ages by racist movements in the United States.",
        "The statement was signed by more than 24 organizations representing over 5,000 people.",
        "It says the Middle Ages were complicated and diverse.",
        "(Reading) By using imagined medieval symbols or names drawn from medieval terminology, they create a fantasy of a pure white Europe that bears no relationship to reality.",
        "This fantasy not only hurts people in the present, it also distorts the past.",

        "There were Jews throughout Europe.",

        "The Crusades are not the dominant event of medieval history, and the violence of the Crusades is not the only story that we can tell.",
        "Perry monitors right-wing websites, and he says people commonly cite the Crusades' knights templar and vikings to protest the influx of Muslim refugees in Europe as well as to stir up anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic hate here.",
        "They all depend on this idea that once upon a time there was a pure white Europe building civilization in opposition to the other.",
        "And that's not something that as historians we can just let pass.",

        "We want to get the real story out.",
        "That's our job as historians."
