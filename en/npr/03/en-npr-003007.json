        "There's another meaning for break too, and I fear that that's what you figure out happened to your music?",
        "K'NAAN: Well, I think what happened in my music is that it kind of got stuck in this place where the audience that it was meant for, I mean - and that's - and the way that, you know, the business has courted my music towards a certain audience and the audience that it wanted has a problem connecting to my music because I think that - like I explained in the piece, that there is a spiritual dimension which comes with work, which comes with art and poetry and sound.",
        "And I think that they, in some way - I can't prove this, but I think that they figured that out, that the dimensions tell them that there is something else being hidden, that here there is a personality being cleaned of its soul and of its story.",

        "These are two tunes that you reference in in your piece at The New York Times.",

        "And it's about a very tough subject because the girl is lost love, but lost love in that she died in the war.",
        "And so that - those two combinations of things make it very hard for a song like that to be on the radio here, especially competing against music that's about going out and having fun and buying things and being in a club.",

        "And then it kind of just faded away in a bit, you know, because it was like - I think at first you can be easily fooled by the song, you know, all its shiny package.",

        "Yeah.",
        "A while back, I was actually doing some hip-hop.",
        "I do mostly hip-hop beats now, and I'm in a band.",
        "But when I was writing lyrics, one of the first things we ran into is, you know, not just so much changing the message, have a lot of like strong viewpoints on religion and politics, but also framing the message to where you're actually achieving the desired result.",
        "A lot of this thing to come out kind of angry.",
        "As I don't necessarily want to make people angry, I want to make people think, I want to make people aware of these things.",
        "And I was told at the time, you know, sometimes the way I put things actually pushes people away.",
        "It's almost too strong.",
        "If they don't immediately agree, they don't want to keep listening and they kind of lose a very valid point you might be making because you alienate them by the way with strong language.",

        "And, K'naan, that's something you wrote about, I thought, quite eloquently in your piece.",
        "You're trying to reach people.",
        "And what's wrong with making a message that reaches a lot of people?",
        "K'NAAN: Yeah.",
        "No, I think that's the conundrum, is that you want to reach people, but you also want to reach them in the most authentic way that you can reach them as well because there's no sense in reaching the - one of the goals, which is that you've now have - you now have a mass market and an audience that's listening, but they're in love with a song that means absolutely nothing to you.",
        "And so that's the catch which you have to - which all of us have to kind of be careful about, is to reach your goal authentically is probably, in the end, going to mean much more to you than having reached it in a false way.",
        "Jonathan, you working on that?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And, in fact, with the newer projects now - I'm in a band, and that helps out a little bit because I'm not, you know, in the lyrics side of it.",
        "But with having the whole band, it allows us when the lyrics are maybe a little strong, you know, the music can kind of help smooth out the strong lyrics.",
        "I think - you mentioned Bob Marley.",
        "I think he did an amazing job with that.",
        "In the end, they decided simply to keep the ball rolling since they only had three or four more years in office.",
        "If you listen to the music, it's very feel good.",
        "And if you listen to the lyrics, there's a lot of important messages that aren't always, you know, about good things.",
        "And I think that with a band, the music can really help to still say what you want to say, but the music can be that lubrication that kind of allows people to deal with listening to it and think about it in a not so, you know, negative way.",
        "K'NAAN: Yeah.",
        "And I agree, Jonathan.",
        "And I think that, you know, my past records have done that fairly well also, like songs that were about difficult topics were ingested easily because of the melodic elements that surrounded the songs and also the way in which a story is told.",
        "You know, I never came from a place of, like, judgment or my lyrics have never really harsh towards anybody.",
        "It was just recounting, a story that's being told.",
        "And that way, the audience feels - they don't feel oppressed by your message.",
        "They feel like they're watching somebody tell their story.",
        "And from that, they get a sense of inspiration.",
        "And I think that that's the best way to work.",
        "You know, you don't want anyone ever telling you what to do.",
        "But still, even in that context, you know, you still suffer from - the moments that the ambition starts to creep up inside you and you begin to see an audience and you begin to see a larger audience, you begin to start to get into the job of protecting the audience and protecting them from your message so that they stay in your household, so that you're not too jarring and too difficult and too burdensome.",
        "So that's the - that's why I felt compelled to write the piece."

        "And it turns out - went back and had a great producer working with (unintelligible) and made some of those changes back to the original lyrics.",
