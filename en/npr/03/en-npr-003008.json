        "I think that there's two messages that happen in a song, two informations that the person can receive: one in their ear, which is what you're hearing and the words you're processing, and another in their soul, which is the other information of the music, the spirit of the sound, the moment that you recorded it, the magic that you encapsuled(ph), that you didn't know was there.",
        "That's another information that they're getting.",

        "Well, they did express a great amount of frustration.",
        "And this frustration is on several different levels.",
        "For one reason is that they're being attacked - in fact, according to the U.S.",
        "military, attacks against these Awakening groups have quadrupled since October.",

        "I think that my experience is not necessarily representative of every student at Duke, but there is a very small percentage of the population -I think here, at least that it's safe to say - does regularly engage in what one would consider excessive behavior, and that's part of what Duke in the past has celebrated as a work hard, play hard culture.",

        "They do.",
        "I think Trisha's accurate in depicting the environment.",
        "I think that a couple of other elements, one is though it's a small number, it's a significant enough number to suggest that that may be the norm, and part of the intent of the initiative is to remind our community and many others that the normative behavior by most of our students is very different from that culture of excess.",
        "Yet one of the other things the report says is that some of the exemplars of this culture of excess are in fact looked up to by a lot of very influential on campus: the top fraternities, the top sororities, and of course student athletes like the lacrosse players.",
        "Well, I think that's true for some.",
        "It's certainly true for enough students that it was of concern to us and one of the reasons why, that we've suggested looking deeply into the environmental conditions, the conditions of privilege that would create the impression that that's the cool.",

        "That's not always the case, and there's not a real healthy dating scene.",
        "And also something that came out of that was this idea of effortless perfection.",
        "And what effortless perfection means essentially to me, as a Duke female, is that we are expected to be perfect in every way without really trying very hard - that is pretty, intelligent, involved, engaged, and social.",
        "And I think that that can be pretty oppressive for a lot of women here.",
        "It's not to say that every female feels that way or is impacted by that, but our goal with this report was really to affirm the un-perfect Duke students, I think, in many ways, and like Larry said, to reset the norm.",
        "Mm-hmm, and obviously this report a few years ago that Trisha just talked about, Larry Moneta, that report was important in and of itself, yet some of the same problems persist, or at least, you know, persist into this report.",

        "We did several new programs with undergraduate students.",
        "We're proud of a particular program called the Baldwin Scholars.",
        "I think in this latest effort, we've gone beyond the efforts of the Women's Initiative to look at the faculty culture, the curriculum, and many other aspects.",
        "One of the I think exciting opportunities that we had was really to look in a much more interconnected way at the variety of circumstances that contribute to the culture.",
        "So I think this is, you know, this is not something that we started with the Women's Initiative, it's not something that will end with the Campus Culture Initiative, and it's not something that's unique to Duke.",
        "What is unique is our willingness, as evidenced by both of those processes, to step up and figure out what we can do to continue to move to a much better environment for our students.",
        "And not unique to Duke, I wanted to ask you, Larry Moneta, more about that a little bit.",
        "How typical - well, Duke is not typical - but I mean how typical are these kinds of problems that we see at Duke of other campuses around the country?",
        "Yeah, I mean we were interested in that.",

        "You work on the show.",
        "Well, I've been at seven different institutions, and I would say that these are exactly the kinds of issues that we struggled with at every one.",
        "Their manifestations are different at each school.",
        "It's a function of what the culture, the rituals, how the privilege is distributed.",

        "And I'm, you know, one of the rare individuals who just does not enjoy drinking.",
