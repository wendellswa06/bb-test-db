        "I was going to say, Trisha Bailey, it - the report describes, and other reports that we've seen, certainly describe alcohol at the center of a lot of the social life at Duke as well.",
        "Right, and that's been a large criticism of a lot of students on our campus is that, you know, a lot of the parties do revolve solely around alcohol, and there's been a large call that was started at a pretty grassroots level from a lot of students who are very upset about that and have started their own initiatives which… One of which is called Duke Plays, and their slogan is Work Hard, Play Well.",
        "And the idea is that the larger Duke community can come together and do things that are not completely alcohol-centered.",
        "And last weekend, actually, we had a party in our library, sponsored by Duke Plays, and were able to really come together in a completely different way than I think a lot of Duke students are used to doing.",
        "It was an amazing turnout, and things like that are really what I hope the culture of Duke University will become.",
        "And are those events the kind of things that Larry Moneta was talking about earlier, trying to reset the idea of cool?",
        "Yes, definitely, definitely.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I think that that's precisely what we're looking to do, and to also along with that, you know, the administration has to provide students with spaces to have events like that, and that's - that also comes along with a lot of our recommendations as well.",
        "And just briefly, Larry Moneta, I know that one of the recommendations of this report - I'm not sure it's going to be enacted - was alcohol's been off campus for some years now, to open a pub there on campus to model good behavior.",
        "Well, actually we have a couple now, and I do think there's ample opportunity to have drinking venues for students who are of legal drinking age, as well as to provide a variety of alternatives.",
        "But I want to be realistic.",
        "I mean the worst stance(ph) on campus is going to be the one that I throw.",
        "This is something that really is going to work only to the extent that we have students who are interested.",
        "The Duke Plays movement was born of students who had no affiliation with any particular group.",
        "They just said let's just show that it can be done differently, and they just stepped up and did it.",
        "And we're seeing the first bubbles in this pot all over the campus, and I'm very enthusiastic about the opportunities.",

        "I wonder if the real story, a year after these accusations, isn't more with the opportunism of this woman who has been discredited, the discrediting of the D.A., the cowardice of the administration in allowing due process to happen.",
        "College kids are always going to be college kids, and I can hardly think of a more open environment than today's college campus.",
