        "But from a number of young women in these top sororities in the sort of elite social scene at Duke I found women - the women who were the least empowered to speak up for themselves and assert themselves and who are actually, in the case of many of them, just, you know, sort of, like sort of driven to distraction by these insecurities, which were so bizarre to me because they were in every other way just the greatest women I'd ever met in my life.",
