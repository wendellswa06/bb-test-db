        "Has Russia responded?",
        "Well, not officially.",
        "Anytime we bring that up in the discussions with them they of course deny any involvement, but friends of Russia have been attacking this center from day one.",

        "It uses social media, primarily Twitter, to get things out as quickly as possible, and saying this is a story we have found, these are the facts so use your brain and compare these two.",
        "So it's not censorship, they're not trying to close the websites, but they're trying to show very clearly that these things are really false.",
        "It's not alternative truth, it's really a falsehood.",
        "Should it really be the business of the government to determine what is fake news?",

        "If we don't defend democracy, it will be gone very quickly.",

        "How large is the volume, and how many do you plan to go after on a given day or week?",
        "There's about 40 websites that peddle these stories, so you have dozens of websites that appear.",
        "The goal is for them to pick up a few a week.",
        "One of the stories we've seen repeatedly was claiming that the migration away from Syria to Europe has been caused by American activities in Syria over the last year or so.",

        "They're not American activities in Syria, they're Russian activities, Russian bombing in Syria that has been driving people out from their homes.",
