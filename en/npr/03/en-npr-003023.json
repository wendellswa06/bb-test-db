        "There was intense ground fighting yesterday around the southern Lebanese border town of Bint Jbeil.",
        "Israel says it lost nine soldiers in that area with at least 25 wounded, these were the highest losses yet in a single day for the Israelis since this conflict began 16 days ago.",
        "Meanwhile, Lebanon is looking at one-fifth of its population displaced.",
        "More than 400 killed, 400 civilians, and pockets of civilians still stranded in villages in southern Lebanon without fresh supplies of food and water and medicine.",
        "Ivan, what do you make of Hezbollah's strategy at this point?",
        "The leader of Hezbollah, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, he pretty much spelled it out in a televised address earlier this week.",
        "He said Hezbollah is a guerrilla force.",
        "It will fight a guerrilla war.",
        "It cannot compete with Israeli air power, but the best way to hurt the Israelis, he said, is on the ground.",
        "So Hezbollah will not hold a classic defensive line, he said.",
        "It would give up territory to the Israelis and in doing so this would make Israeli soldiers and tanks more vulnerable to Hezbollah ambushes.",
        "And I think that's what we saw in Bint Jbeil yesterday.",
        "I've read several accounts, Ivan, that quote Israeli sources as saying these Hezbollah fighters are the toughest they've ever faced."

        "Well, if the Israelis are more accustomed to fighting the quite disorganized gunmen of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, then yes, Hezbollah is much more organized.",
        "It's been described by military analysts as the most organized, most disciplined fighting force in the Middle East after the Israeli defense force, and I think, again, we're seeing the result of that in this ground fighting in areas where Hezbollah has had years to prepare its trenches and fortifications and defense posture in anticipation of this Israeli ground incursion.",
