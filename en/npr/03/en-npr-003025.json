        "The mussels thrive on the small organic particles from the fish waste.",
        "And then for the bigger particles that settle more to the bottom, you need also invertebrates.",

        "What proportion of the nutrients that the fish produce get soaked up by the other elements of your system here?",
        "Well, it's still something we are debating, as a matter of fact.",
        "It's more than 10 percent, it's between 10 and 50 percent, but exactly how much, I don't know yet.",
        "The idea here is not only to reduce the impact of fish farming but to produce more foods and ingredients that the salmon company can sell.",

        "He's been on the water 18 years but mussels and seaweed are recently acquired tastes for him.",

        "Some conservation groups have backed off a bit on their opposition to fish farming because the alternatives are worse.",
