        "So are you a flutter as well over Tom Cotton?",
        "- a lot of glowing reviews there.",
        "Well, I don't know if President Cotton is going to be in our future in 2017, although I suppose he's been elected to office as many times as Hillary Clinton has been.",
        "I do think that the response to his letter this week on Iran has been sort of hysterical on the left.",
        "If you step back and think about it, nothing that was in that letter is untrue.",
        "In fact, the administration - the Secretary of State John Kerry doesn't even contest that it's true.",
        "As a matter of constitutional law, any agreement that's not submitted to Congress with Iran is not going to be binding on the next president, is not going to be binding on the next Congress.",
        "Here's the thing, I want to play actually some reaction for Senator Rand Paul at the Foreign Relations Committee hearing talking to Secretary of State John Kerry, saying he signed the letter, essentially, as a message and not just to Iran.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF HEARING)",
        "So why do I sign this letter?",
        "I sign this letter because I assign it to an administration that doesn't listen, to an administration that every turn tries to go around Congress because you think you can't get your way.",
        "And Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, who spoke on our show to Melissa Block about this decision not to sign it.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "Negotiations are tough enough here, and I didn't think it was appropriate to add another element that makes them more difficult.",
        "E J, was this at least effective in drawing some attention to Iran policy?",
        "I mean, obviously not all Democrats - right?",
        "- are completely on board with where the White House is going with these negotiations."

        "I mean, you know, in our country, we have abolished it for many years.",

        "The event's co-sponsor was CNN, and the original cable news network got the conflict it may have hoped for as soon as the questioning began.",
        "Sparks flew right away between Governor Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, who had been the front runner until Perry came along.",
        "In his first debate appearance last week, Perry called Social Security a Ponzi scheme and a failure.",
        "And in a book he released early this year, he suggested the program was unconstitutional.",
        "But last night in Tampa, he walked that back a bit, stressing that no one in the program now should worry about it going away.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE)",
        "But the idea that we have not had the courage to stand up and look Americans in the face - young, midcareer professionals, or kids that are my children's age - and looked them in the eye and said listen, this is a broken system.",
        "It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long before me.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF DEBATE)",
        "Governor Perry, as you well know, you signed an executive order requiring little girls, 11- and 12-year-old girls, to get a vaccine to deal with a sexually transmitted disease that could lead to cervical cancer.",
        "Was that a mistake?",
        "It was, indeed.",
        "Perry said if he had to do it over, he would have gone through the legislature rather than issuing an executive order.",
        "This time, congresswoman Michele Bachmann took Perry on, calling the vaccination, quote, a government injection that was forced on little girls.",
        "Perry explained that parents could opt not to have their daughters get the vaccine.",
        "Bachmann rejected that, and accused Perry of implementing the program to help a campaign donor."

        "The company was Merck, and it was a $5,000 contribution that I had received from them.",
