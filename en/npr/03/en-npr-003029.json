        "Welcome to the program, once again.",
        "I don't know if it's the best, but the new Andre Braugher drama Thief is a refreshing update of the usual cops and robbers caper.",
        "It seems like everywhere you look nowadays, there's something new on that subject, from the Spike Lee movie Inside Man to the NBC drama Heist.",
        "And yet, I found there's something distinctive about Thief, which gives the genre a well-deserved tweak.",
        "You see, most caper stories are all alike, one-dimensional displays of the incredible precision and calculation that goes into pulling off a big score.",
        "More often than not, these con men are slick and charming, like George Clooney in Ocean's 11.",
        "At first glance, Braugher's character, Nick Atwater, might seen like Clooney rehashed.",
        "He's cunning and charismatic as the leader of a crew of thieves.",
        "Emotions don't get the best of him, as we see in this scene in which he kicks out a reckless member of his crew.",

        "I'm not finished.",
        "Izzy, you're out.",
        "But Thief pulls a few nasty tricks on Nick Atwater that elevates the story beyond the usual cat and mouse caper.",
        "We see him get blindsided by personal tragedy that affects his family, who know nothing of his criminal life.",
        "And some of Atwater's schemes go wrong, as in this scene, when his crew reacts to the news that they have to return money from their latest score.",

        "Braugher is surrounded by a strong supporting cast, as this crew goes--including Malik Yoba, Yancey Arias, and Clifton Collins, Jr. That they manage to hang with Braugher at all is great.",
        "He's one of the handful of television actors who mesmerize, regardless of the material handed to him.",
        "That said, the trouble with staffing a show centered on Braugher is that the weak links in the cast fail all the more spectacularly.",
        "There are sizable subplots in \"Thief\" that are listless without him, from the crooked cop working Atwater's case to the Chinese Mafia henchmen out to shut him down.",
        "But Braugher is in enough scenes to make this show a compelling character study.",
        "If you're up for more than just the usual snatch-and-grab story, \"Thief\" is there for the taking.",
        "Andrew Wallenstein is an editor at The Hollywood Reporter.",
        "The show Thief premieres tonight on FX.",
        "This week, Mark Buehrle, who pitches for the Chicago White Sox, made a play on opening day that encourages those of us who believe, at least now and then, that there are a few lessons for life between the foul lines.",
        "Cleveland Indians' catcher Lou Marson hit a ground ball in the fifth inning that Mr. Buehrle - who's actually only kind of stocky - knocked down with his left leg.",
        "The ball dribbled over to the first base line.",
        "But just before Mr. Marson could reach the base for a single, Mark Buehrle scooped the ball into his glove and, without so much as a backwards glance, hiked it between his legs.",
        "First baseman Paul Konerko caught it with his bare hand like Superman stopping a bullet in slow motion.",
        "Mr. Buehrle said it wasn't until a moment later, when he heard the sold-out crowd cheer as if they just saw a dolphin play a grand piano, he realized he'd made an out in a way no one had ever seen before.",
        "Tossing the ball backwards with a baseball glove from between the legs: as Paul Konerko said, it's not something you practice.",
        "By the way, the White Sox won 6-0."

        "Now, Mark Buehrle is a good pitcher whom sports pundits now calls great because he's thrown a no-hitter, perfect game and helped win a World Series.",
        "But in a game in which general managers look for phenom fast ballers who are still young enough for acne, Mr. Buehrle's in his 30s.",
        "His throw was outstanding, but his fast ball might not break a plate glass window.",
        "In a game in which pitchers pace the mound, pat the dirt, murmur mantras and otherwise take maximum time between pitches, Mr. Buehrle pitches so fast you wonder if he has a cab waiting.",
        "He's irreverent and funny.",
        "A team player, but not always a company man.",
        "He marches to his own music and that music is punk.",
        "He rides motorcycles.",
        "Team management asked Mr. Buehrle to stop amusing the crowd during rain delays by sliding on the tarp, saying that a man earning so many of their millions owed it to the club not to risk playing slip and slide for laughs.",
        "A more conventional company man might have seen that dribbling ball and reacted conventionally - pick it up, turn, hold on to the ball, miss the out but keep the runner close, avoid blame.",
        "But some magic mix of experience and irreverence in Mark Buehrle came up with an utterly original out.",
        "It was a nice spring reminder that no matter how much you think you've seen of baseball or life, there's always something new.",

        "Senator Corker - Bob Corker of Tennessee, who's chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and my Washington Post colleague Mike Gerson, who is a conservative, who is much less sympathetic to what may come out of this deal than I am, wrote in The Post, (reading) this was a foreign-policy maneuver, in the middle of a high-stakes negotiation, with all the gravity and deliberation of a blog posting.",
        "In timing, tone and substance, it raises questions about the Republican majority's capacity to govern.",
        "And Mike makes the point in his piece that if we are going to impose sanctions if a deal doesn't work out, we're going to need the Europeans and others around the world.",

        "Ramesh, just to pull one more thing from that Gerson column, he said, why didn't Republicans make this case directly to the American people?",
        "Why do it in this manner?",
        "Your thoughts?",
        "Well, I think that essentially that is what they're doing.",

        "And look, I think that it is questionable as a tactic for a lot of reasons, some of them raised by Mike Gerson.",
        "But I do think that the calls for prosecuting Senator Cotton under the Logan Act, which we've seen from some Democratic consultants, Congressman Jared Polis calling him Tehran Tom - that's the sort of thing I have in mind when I suggest that the pushback has been a little bit hysterical.",
        "All right.",
        "Never heard those things from Republicans during the Iraq War years, but anyway, we'll let it go.",
        "And that was - you know, some of that was hysterical as well.",
        "But that's the - the funny thing is the way that both parties trade sides on this.",

        "I think she made a very strong case for trusting her if you already trusted her.",

        "What's that battle to you?",
