        "The significance of understanding this, that happened in the 1930s, is that one then has the context to understand what's happening today, and as well as what happened in the '50s, the '60s and the '70s.",
        "Balderrama had personal, as well as professional motivation to tell his story.",

        "Rodriguez still felt seared by the loss of his father.",
        "The fact that he used that pain to ensure that another generation wouldn't have to feel it, says Balderrama, was a characteristic of who Ray Rodriguez was.",
        "So I think that's the value of Ray, the inspiration of Ray, to take something that you've suffered through, your family's gone through and to make this a public issue and an educational issue for the American public."
