        "Even without the benefit of the report, we do know a fair amount about the program.",
        "What do we know?",
        "Well, we know, at this point, the methods that the CIA used to try to extract information from al-Qaida detainees.",
        "Some of those methods included waterboarding, exposure to extreme temperatures, use of sleep deprivation and other methods that were approved by the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.",
        "We also know where most, if not all of the secret prisons the CIA had, where they were located.",
        "There were prisons in Thailand, in Romania, in Jordan and other places where the CIA had basically made a deal with the local governments in order to keep detainees.",

        "I mean, I'd say it was pretty fraught from the beginning.",
        "A deal was struck between Dianne Feinstein, the chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and CIA director Leon Panetta in order for them to get these documents.",
        "But the CIA was not making anyone available to be interviewed in person in part because there was this ongoing investigation into actual criminal activities in the program.",
        "The other problem was that the Republicans on the committee pulled out of this investigation early on in part because they began to think that it was going to be very one-sided, it was going to be an effort to smear the Bush administration.",
        "I think it should be noted that that's really what so much of this is about.",
        "It's a fight over who writes the history and how this very controversial period of American history is framed.",
        "So you mentioned the relationship between the CIA and this congressional investigation.",
        "It's been a fraught since the beginning, but still we've not heard anything like what we heard this week.",
        "And however you describe Sen.",
        "Feinstein, nobody would call her a flamethrower when it comes to stuff like this.",
        "No.",
        "I mean, she's been an enormously supportive of intelligence agencies during her time as chairwoman of the intelligence committee.",
        "Really, I mean, all of the backroom jostling I described pales in comparison to what's happened in the last few months where the CIA came to believe or think that maybe the intelligence committee had gained unauthorized access to parts of CIA computers and carried out a search of the computers used by the staff.",
        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",

        "And its funny, when you play that clip, when I hear that sound, I can envision that happening because I've played it so much and I think a lot of us have.",
        "But, yeah, the idea is you had these birds and you slingshot them across the screen, typically on an iPhone or on a smartphone, and into some little construction by a bunch of pigs.",
        "And the idea is to topple the construction and explode the pigs.",

        "In \"\"Cut The Rope,\"\" what happens there?",
        "The idea is you have a little monster and you have a piece of candy, and that piece of candy dangling by a rope and you have to cut the rope to get it to the monster.",
        "So these are the kinds of games that it sounds like they would be played as you're standing in line to get a coffee or if youre, youve got a little time on your hands, just a moment or two when you go to these games.",

        "Oh, absolutely.",

        "The coming of the 3DS by Nintendo.",
        "So Nintendo is the company that I think proved to everybody when it came out with the Wii home console, that games don't have to be hard and tricky to be fun.",
        "You can make a game for everybody and be successful.",
        "And what they are coming out with now is the 3DS, which is a portable gaming system that allows you to play games in 3D without glasses.",
