        "Heim lived in Cairo for some years under a German pseudonym.",
        "And then very late in life he converted to Islam and took an Arabic name.",
        "What did you make of his conversion?",
        "Was it a sincere spiritual event, or was it going deeper cover in Cairo?",
        "I think that to be that kind of chameleon, you kind of have to believe the role that you're playing, in a way.",
        "I think that on the one hand, changing his name to Tarek Hussein Farid made it much harder to find and capture Aribert Heim.",
        "On the other hand, he was described to my co-author, Souad, and I as someone who was a perfect Muslim, knew every greeting, went to prayers regularly, was beloved in the community.",
        "He fit himself in.",
        "And never having justice for his alleged crimes.",
        "That's correct.",
        "He hid himself so well that they could never locate him, which also allowed the legend to grow up around him.",
        "I found the most interesting person in this story, for me, was Heim's son Rudiger, who was born after the war.",
        "He knew of his father's location in Egypt, he communicated with his father by code, he visited him.",
        "Did he ever come to accept that his father did the things that witnesses said he did?",
        "For the most part no. his father really drilled into him the idea of his innocence.",
        "He got a hold of the testimony against him and would go point by point with his son refuting it, explaining that he was doing real operations to try to save people's lives, that he was misunderstood.",
        "And I think that Rudiger, who had grown up without a father and who really wanted to believe in his father's innocence, accepted what he was told.",
        "He did know that his father had been a concentration camp doctor, though, and by the time that Rudiger Heim was an adult, West Germany, where they lived, had experience a revival in interest in pursuing the country's awful Nazi past.",
        "Rudiger Heim is not a Holocaust denier.",
        "It's the leap to blaming his own father for what he had done is the one that I think that he doesn't want to make.",
        "And I think that throughout Germany, I think it's easier to accept collective responsibility than it is to accept individual responsibility, to say we all did a bad thing but not my father or my grandfather or my beloved aunt did it.",
        "Your co-author, Souad Mekhennet, was given papers that Heim had left behind in Egypt, and it was really through that reporting that well after his death in 1992 it could be established that he indeed was dead, that there's no point in pursuing him any further.",
        "His son packed up an old leather attache case, and there were medical records, journals, applications for renewal of his residency status, so many of those things in there that the son was afraid to try to bring back with him to Germany, that he would be caught at the border, and it would reveal everything that his father had done."

        "And that created the blueprint for our reporting.",
        "You also came across some reporting that was a lot less rigorous, reporting that accused the illegitimate daughter of Heim as being a conduit to him.",
        "She'd never met the man and was raised thinking he was dead.",
        "Tips from Simon Wiesenthal that were totally wrong but were reported, allegations against a coupe in Spain that they were a conduit for funds.",
        "Was there just a lot of bad tabloid journalism or the feeling that Nazis are so evil that the rules of confirming things are suspended in the name of virtue?",
        "Nazis have this - sort of they're the guiltiest of the guilty.",
        "And so if you believe that someone is harboring a Nazi fugitive or supporting a Nazi fugitive, then I think it's pretty easy to say, well, those are bad people, and we can go after them in perhaps a way that if it were someone else, you would stop, you would double-check, you would think first.",
        "For you, what was the takeaway here about the pursuit of Nazi war criminals, I guess a period of German and Austrian post-war history that's now pretty well closed just by virtue of time having past?",
        "I do think that the story tells us that the pursuit of justice can't lapse until the perpetrators are gone because I guess I was speaking with an investigator, and I asked him what's the point of putting 85-year-old men on trial.",
        "And he said that, you know, during the Holocaust, newborn babies, 90-year-old great-grandparents, none of them were spared by the people that we're looking for, and so the notion of giving up now because they're old men also doesn't make sense.",
        "And I think that pursuit can also become a prison in its own way.",
        "Living in fear is its own form of sentence.",
        "And so if you relent, if you give up, then you let the murderers rest easy.",

        "After the Soviet defeat and withdrawal in 1989, we basically said our work here is done and withdrew from any meaningful engagement with Afghanistan.",

        "Good morning, Renee.",
        "Do you think this money, this $16 billion will, in fact, be forthcoming over the coming years?",
        "Can Afghanistan count on it?",
        "The Tokyo conference and its outcome I think is highly significant, because it produced, you know, a document in which the international community accepts certain obligations to provide funding, and the Afghan government accepts certain obligations to fight corruption, to build institutions.",
        "And I think as the international community sees the Afghan government deliver on its side, both the incentive and the pressure on international community to provide the promised assistance simply increases.",
        "And I note that President Karzai came out with a 14-point decree for all ministries to begin to implement to deliver on their side of the undertaking, and I find that highly encouraging.",
        "It's highly encouraging, even though President Karzai has made promises before - and feels like many promises before - to crack down on corruption, to manage the economy better, and hasn't delivered."

        "I can give you several reasons, Renee, that I have certainly found compelling.",
        "Perhaps most important is the Afghans have been there and done that.",
        "When I got there at the beginning of 2002, it looked like Berlin in 1945, and that was because of the Afghan civil war.",
        "No one wants to go back to that.",
        "The second point is minority groups clearly see their interests having a voice in national decisions - no major minority politician is thinking in terms of separatism.",
        "It's all how can they be more - rather than less - involved in Kabul.",
        "A third point would be, of course, the enemy himself.",
        "The Taliban and their allies are equal opportunity killers: Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks.",

        "What did it look like to you as you took your last look at Kabul?",
        "A vibrant, bustling city with shops open, streets crowded, horrendous traffic - which some would consider a problem, but frankly I see as a sign of confidence in the security and stability of the capital.",
        "There's a long ways to go, but from the devastated ghost town of 2002 to the Kabul of today, it's an extraordinary achievement.",
        "And I leave with the sense of a city that is very, very much alive and moving into the future."
