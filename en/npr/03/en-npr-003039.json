        "That didn't work out.",
        "Now he's back to plan B, which is to blame Republicans for whatever pain there might be from the sequester, but that may take weeks or even months for the sequester to go into effect and for people to feel it and then for people to react.",

        "I mean, I imagine a lot of people agreed with the president that if - once we got close to this deadline, because these cuts were so draconian and so many programs that nobody wanted to see cut, that people would sit down.",

        "Not by very much, and that's one of the most ridiculous aspects of this entire ridiculous exercise.",
        "The real drivers of the deficit - Medicare, Medicaid, mandatory programs - they are not touched by the sequester, and they're over 50 percent of the federal budget this year if you count interest on the debt.",
        "And the sequester has absolutely nothing to do with that.",
        "So if the two sides are going to attack the true drivers of the deficit, the only way to do that is to come back to that ever elusive grand bargain.",
        "That's the big deal where Republicans agree to some kind of revenue hikes and Democrats agree to entitlement cuts.",
        "That seems impossible.",
        "But maybe now when the political playing field is leveled, both sides will have exhausted every other possible way to avoid this and finally get into some negotiations.",
        "And the chances that that could happen before America really begins to feel these cuts?",
        "I think unlikely.",
        "I think the Americans are going to have to really feel the cuts before grand bargain talks could begin again.",
