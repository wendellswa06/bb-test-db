        "Sadly, although these spending cuts were dreamed up behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, the effects will be felt almost everywhere in America, except in lawmaker's paychecks.",

        "But Dwyer is having to rethink her plans for the future since one of the programs that will immediately get the chop is federal work study.",
        "I definitely depend on my work study a lot just for being able to buy my books for the following semester.",
        "Also, first in line for furloughs are employees of the Defense Department, like Chris Field(ph), a training officer at Fort Meade who's facing the grim prospect of losing 22 days of pay.",
        "I mean, it's not so much fun to think about, you know, losing 20 percent of your paycheck.",
        "You know, my daughter is getting ready to go to college, and I have to start thinking about, you know, how that's going to happen with 20 percent less money.",
        "And, you know, I jokingly told her like, hey, start looking at colleges that are 20 percent cheaper.",
        "But, you know, in reality, you know, you kind of do what you have to do to get your kids, you know, onto school and moving into the next, you know, next part of their lives.",
        "But you don't have to be working for the government to feel the pain from these cuts.",
        "According to the White House, 70,000 low-income kids will have to leave the Head Start program, 125,000 families will lose rental assistance and nutrition programs will lose millions in funding as well.",
        "I'm Sharon Baughman.",
        "I'm the CEO of Christian Senior Services.",
        "And Christian Senior Services is the Meals on Wheels provider for Bexar County in Central Texas.",
        "San Antonio is our main city.",
        "Baughman's staff provides about 3,700 meals a day for Texans in need.",
        "Our problem is that we have so many seniors that are more and more needy that we are getting calls - we get probably 200 new calls a month from people who need home-delivered meals.",
        "And keep in mind that the people who are eligible for home-delivered meals are basically what we call homebound.",
        "They are not able to, on a reliable basis, shop, cook and ensure that they have a healthy course of food on a regular basis."

        "We have several clients over the age of 100 that are continuing to live at home specifically because they are able to count on Meals on Wheels for their nutrition.",

        "I actually saw a memo sent to one agency where they reminded employees that, in fact, they do have to come to work on Monday.",
        "Because you have to think of this more like a brownout than a blackout.",
        "You know, there's no breaker getting switched, the lights are just flickering.",
        "So on Monday, many federal employees are likely to get furlough notices.",
        "These are notices saying that in 30 days, furloughs could begin.",
        "Other agencies are instituting hiring freezes or not replacing people who leave or retire.",
        "And actually, the most immediate effects will be on those who receive money directly from the government.",
        "So low-income housing programs, the food program for Women, Infants and Children, WIC, that's going to be cut by $333 million this year - farm loans, schools that get impact aid funding.",
        "NPR's Tamara Keith.",
        "Since the furloughs won't begin for 30 days, there's still time for Congress to reach a grand bargain before the spending cuts have to be fully implemented.",
        "And Sharon Baughman says that's exactly what they need to do.",
        "I have a budget.",
        "Everyone has a personal budget, everyone has a work budget.",
        "But I never would sit down and say we're going to cut everything by the same percentage.",
        "You look at programs, you look at, you know, where the money's going and you just really do your best to figure it out.",
        "And I think they just have to be grown-ups about it and sit down with both parties and the White House and just make the right decision.",
