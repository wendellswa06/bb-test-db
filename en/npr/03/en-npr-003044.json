        "As an experiment for NPR about Occupy Wall Street, Gourley sorted through 40,000 blogs and articles written since it began and grouped similar ideas together.",
        "You can't read all this as a human or even necessarily get what's going on, so you start to apply algorithms to help kind of cluster, sort, put topics around them and ultimately visualize.",
        "What Gourley's algorithms help visualize is how ideas that germinated at the initial Occupy Wall Street rallies in New York spread to other groups and parts of the country.",
        "Gourley opens up a computer screen filled with dots grouped into color clusters that look like different solar systems with thin lines that connect them.",

        "Orthodox innovators, at least as I count them, very seldom are re-elected to second terms.",
        "But we do see these kind of pent-up frustrations, the sign of failure to deliver on expectations, the failure to deliver the orthodoxy of the Social Security plan, the nomination of Harriet Miers, a disappointment.",
