        "Politically very difficult to do and militarily hard to do, because more people would start leaving the Army than they are now, many captains, for example, and sergeants are leaving.",

        "There are Department of Agriculture inspectors at the docks in Kuwait and they want to make sure that all the equipment is power washed, so all the sand and mud is removed, which could harbor insects and germs that they don't want coming back into the United States.",

        "There's a base in Balad to the north of Baghdad, Camp Fallujah to the west, for example.",
        "They can maintain one of those bases, or open up new bases in a place, let's say, Kurdistan to the north.",
