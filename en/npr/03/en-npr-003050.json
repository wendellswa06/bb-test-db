        "The death penalty, said Souter, is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst, and a tie-breaker does not identify the worst of the worst.",
        "The advent of DNA testing, Souter noted, has led to repeated exonerations of those on death row in numbers never imagined before.",
        "We are thus, he said, in a period of new empirical argument about how the death penalty is different from other sentences.",
        "And false verdicts, he maintained, are probably disproportionately high in capital cases, because of the intense pressure to win convictions in particularly heinous cases and the corresponding incentive for the guilty to frame the innocent.",
        "While it is far too early for any generalizations about the soundness of capital sentencing across the country, Souter said, the cautionary lesson of recent experience addresses the tie-breaking potential of the Kansas statute.",
