        "He's never done that before.",
        "He's resorting to some unusual tactics to try to fix his game.",

        "Normally, he does not play that much on the golf course.",
        "So it's clear that Tiger is searching for something.",
        "And he also had a new swing coach, Sean Foley - who works with a number of other PGA tour players - look at his swing and try to offer some analysis.",
        "So clearly, Tiger is reaching a point where his golf game is in desperation.",
        "I want to explain this for non-golfers.",
        "If you're a totally average golfer, one of the typical mistakes you might make is moving your head when you swing, which causes you not to make contact with the ball in the right way.",
        "It's amazing to think of his caddy having to work with him on such a basic issue, given that he's Tiger Woods.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Basically, the first thing they tell you when you play golf is keep your head down, and keep your eye on the ball.",
        "And here, we have him trying to do that.",
        "And it's really amazing that it's come to this for, you know, the greatest player of our time, and maybe the greatest player in history.",
        "There was a time when other pros just played for second place.",

        "But then you have two relative unknowns.",
        "Graeme McDowell, of Northern Ireland, won the U.S.",
        "Open at Pebble Beach.",
        "And Louis Oosthuizen, a South African, won the British Open.",
        "And not only did non-golf fans not know who he was, but there's many golf fans who had never heard of him.",
        "So anybody could win this tournament?",
        "It is wide open, especially considering what's going on with Tiger.",
        "Phil Mickelson revealed this week that he's been battling an arthritic condition, and he is not in top form.",
        "The number-three ranked player in the world, Lee Westwood, is out with an ankle injury.",

        "Where it has fallen perhaps a bit short is that it has been in what I would call the nudge and encourage the dictatorship phase.",

        "Mr. Gvosdev?",
        "I think that what you've seen is you had a new change in direction that started off with a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of energy at the beginning and then as problems have begun to pop up along the wayside, the enthusiasm wanes and then we're also running into some difficulties because some of the assumptions were made, that the spread of democracy and the growth in American influence would go hand in hand hasn't always been borne out by some of the election results, and at the same time, preferred candidates and parties that the United States would have liked to have seen come to power not only in the Middle East, but we also have to look at Latin America, parts of Eurasia, parts of East Asia, as well, didn't always do as well in the polls as we had expected and that, I think, is leading to this reassessment, particularly with regard to the Middle East.",
