        "The new law, which I think is unique in Europe and the only one of its kind in Europe that makes sleeping on the street a crime that's punishable by jail.",
        "Budapest banned sleeping on the streets and a new federal law allows police to fine homeless or arrest them if they've been cited for sleeping on the street twice in a six-month period.",
        "In recent years, several districts in Budapest made it illegal to rummage through garbage, to beg on the streets.",

        "Tens of thousands of people are not choosing to sleep on the streets.",
        "They are sleeping on the streets because there is nowhere else to go, and the state does not take the measures that are necessary to provide housing for everyone - or some kind of, at least, transitional shelter.",

        "What's more, said Scalia, the dissenters have nailed their policy agenda to the door of the wrong church, since a jury's decision on sentence has nothing to do with guilt or innocence, but what's the appropriate punishment.",
        "Contrary to what the dissent contends, said Scalia, death cases are less likely to have mistaken verdicts, because these cases get more attention by the courts and defense lawyers than any others.",
        "One cannot have a system of criminal punishment without accepting the possibility that someone will be punished mistakenly, said Scalia.",
        "But the possibility that someone will be wrongly executed has been reduced to an insignificant minimum.",
        "Scalia was the author of the Court's other important criminal law decision yesterday, declaring that when a trial judge wrongly deprives a defendant of his paid lawyer of choice, the conviction is automatically reversed.",
        "In this case, a trial judge refused to allow a defense lawyer to participate in a case, because the judge, wrongly thought the lawyer had violated a rule governing conduct in court.",
        "The Bush Administration contended that the defendant was convicted after a fair trial, and that depriving him of his chosen counsel was harmless error.",
        "But the Supreme Court rejected that argument, declaring that it's impossible to know what different choices the rejected counsel would have made, and what the impact of those choices would have been on the outcome of the case.",
        "There are some situations in which a judge can say this lawyer can't defend this person.",
        "But he better be right, because the consequences are that if he's wrong, it's just automatic reversal.",
        "The decision in the right to counsel case was also five to four, with Scalia writing the opinion for himself and the Court's four liberals.",
        "And Justice Samuel Alito, the Court's newest member, writing the dissent."
