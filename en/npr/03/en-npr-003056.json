        "A remarkable outpouring.",
        "Many people consider John McCain to be the most important politician of his age.",
        "He described himself as a flawed individual, like all of us.",
        "But he also stood for civility and honor and sacrifice.",
        "And considering your political opponents are not your enemies - he was willing to work across the aisle.",
        "That's very rare nowadays.",
        "And many people feel that this is a moment when a lot of those basic democratic values, along with human decency and character, are really under attack.",

        "No one mentioned Donald Trump's name yesterday, but the entire service was an implicit rebuke to him.",
        "And that's how John McCain planned it.",
        "When John McCain's daughter Meghan stood up and said the America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great, she got a huge round of applause.",
        "That just doesn't happen at funerals.",
        "One writer said the gathering at the cathedral was a giant meeting of the resistance.",
        "And that was certainly - that tacit rebuke was certainly a subtext of this part of President Obama's tribute to John McCain.",
        "Let's take a listen.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty - trafficking and bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.",
        "It's a politics that pretends to be brave and tough, when, in fact, it's born of fear.",
        "And, Mara, in other circumstances, those words might not have been quite so remarkable.",
        "Not quite so remarkable.",
        "But also, maybe they wouldn't have to be said.",
        "But we're in a first-principles moment in American politics.",
        "And we have a president who rejects the traditional role as a unifier in American life.",
        "And Barack Obama has said that he wasn't going to get involved in every little political battle in America since he's finished his term in office.",
        "But he would speak out when he felt basic democratic values were at risk."

        "But there are other kinds of symbols - a legacy, a program, excellence.",
        "Those could be symbols that could be used for a memorial.",
        "And that's how I approach my work every day - with humility in my heart and resolve in my mind, simply out of respect for my fallen colleagues.",
        "As I listened, I was not thinking about how to protect my daughter in the event of a tragedy like the Virginia Tech shootings, but was instead hoping she will have professors like Puri.",
        "It is his wisdom that I hope my daughter learns from her professors.",
        "Professor Puri also got the attention of Lauren Jackson, listening in Lexington, North Carolina.",
        "He survived a terrible, terrible tragedy, and he was able to turn it into something positive.",
        "It was the right way to handle what had happened."
