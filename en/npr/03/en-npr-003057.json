        "You might be able to track the progress of tainted food, almost like an epidemiologist would.",
        "But in reality, you're saying what the FDA can do is inspect it as it arrives at the port.",
        "That's all they can do.",
        "How often does that happen?",
        "They do very few inspections.",
        "In fact, they only sample about 20,000 food products a year, and this year there will be approximately 13 million enter into the United States.",
        "So you can see the numbers are way out of proportion.",

        "That's what the critic Howard Kissel did with \"\"The Abominable Showman.\"\" It's 1993 bio of legendary producer David Merrick.",
        "Merrick was the guy behind all kinds of huge crowd-pleasers, \"\"Hello Dolly,\"\" \"\"Oliver,\"\" \"\"42nd Street.\"\" If it sang and danced, he probably paid for it.",
        "But Merrick also had a thing for prestige shows: Tom Stoppard's breakout play, \"\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\"\" it was one that proved Merrick had a taste for good material to go with his unerring nose for publicity and his famous penchant for public feuds.",
        "The author respects David Merrick as an impresario, and he understands how much he truly loved the theater.",
        "So, reading about Merrick's excesses in \"\"The Abominable Showman\"\" is like watching a great actor lose track of his lines on stage: It's startling and uncomfortably entertaining and kind of sad.",
        "Garson Kanin was one of the Broadway directors that David Merrick clashed with loudly and often.",
        "And there's rarely been a more vivid picture of the business than Kanin's novel, \"\"Smash.\"\" It's a steamy, smart story set in the decidedly swinging '70s about the making of a Broadway musical.",
        "And \"\"Smash\"\" is chock-full of backstage drama: alcoholic choreographers, feuding songwriters, and more than one instance of what theater people call the showmance, you know, those white-hot affairs that burn out right after closing night.",
        "Now, how much of this juicy business is based on real backstage stories?",
        "Anybody's guess.",
        "But Kanin was there for decades, and his passion for showbiz is cooked into this book.",
        "By the time his fictional musical is ready for its opening night, you'll want it to be a smash as much as its badly behaved creators do."

        "And as a cancer doctor, I see patients every day, people who are benefiting from the use of cannabis.",
        "The problem is the government does not allow cannabis to be studied as a therapeutic agent because the only legal source is the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and they have a congressional mandate only to study substances' abuse, as substances of abuse.",

        "Number one is, yes, marijuana was removed from the pharmacopeia in the late 1930s, in fact, but because it was found that the safety and efficacy issues did not reach the bar that was necessary for drug approval."
