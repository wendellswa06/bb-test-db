        "So the evidence, you know, clinically the evidence is there, and I do disagree that the reason that it was removed from the pharmacopeia, the American Medical Association in 1937, after the introduction of the Cannabis Tax Act, was - stood alone in saying that there is no evidence that cannabis is dangerous and that this act would impede the ability to research it for its effectiveness.",
        "And then it was removed from the pharmacopeia and subjected to Schedule 1, and, you know, the main target in this country's failed war on drugs.",
        "So you think there are not enough resources to conduct the clinical studies that would be needed?",
        "So what was it like to watch those hearings?",
        "Our bodies have been really very careful designed by evolution to ensure that generally we're only going to ovulate one egg a month, maybe two, because one baby is really what we should be carrying.",
        "The uterus is a single occupancy room and not really built for more than 10 pounds of baby.",
        "But she could conceive eight babies, you know, 12 babies, six babies and then is faced with a terrible choice of whether to reduce some of these children.",
        "And if a patient can't bring herself to do that, that's when we see these really, really large multiple births.",
        "And the children are often going to have, you know, serious health problems.",
        "This rise in multiple births that you note in the book, it also converges with another trend.",
        "These children are often born to older women.",
        "That's right.",
        "And IVF, I should say, also contributes to this.",
        "Often doctors, when they transfer embryos - because they don't know which one is going to take - will transfer two or three or four or five.",
        "And so, even with IVF, which is more controlled, half of IVF babies are born as part of a set.",
        "And often it's twins but often it's triplets.",
        "And the older the mother, the more likely she is to be using donor eggs.",
        "Donor eggs usually come from very fertile young women so these embryos are more likely to take.",
        "And as a result, yes, the most rapid increase in multiple births has been among women over 35 and particularly women over 40.",
        "And that is a real health issue.",
        "People think that pregnancy is so safe nowadays, and mercifully it is, but any woman carrying twins or triplets is much more likely to develop preeclampsia, to develop all sorts of serious complications of pregnancy.",
        "And of course, the older the mother is, the more likely she is to develop some serious health problems herself.",
        "Now, you really put a phase on these stories.",
        "In this case, you've been taking about multiples and what multiples mean for women and for couples.",
        "There's a story of Melissa Middleton(ph) and her husband Brent(ph).",

        "Is this something that doctors warn them about?",
        "I don't think that there's enough warning about the risk of multiples.",
        "And doctors will often say, well, parents want twins and we just can't talk them out of it.",
        "And it's true, studies have been shown that many IVF patients who come into the process, as you say, with a lot of hope and optimism - and I'm so sympathetic to that - they come in thinking, well, I've - this treatment is stressful and I've spent a lot of money now.",
        "And if I could get two children, you know, for the price of one, you could say, and not have to go through an IVF cycle again, that would be a good thing.",
        "And if I get three, you know, that would be okay.",
