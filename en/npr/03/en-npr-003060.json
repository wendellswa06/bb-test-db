        "Better - cannabis, this is a flower we're talking about it.",

        "But let me please finish.",
        "They had to cancel five studies because they could not recruit enough patients.",

        "How many elderly cancer patients in this day and age are experienced marijuana users?",
        "They also were not allowed to drive because there was fear of liability in case they got into a car accident because they were under the influence.",
        "So there were - so what Dr. Abrams should say is that there was money, there was cannabis available for the studies.",
        "Why did five of the major studies that they had proposed at the onset of this program, why were they canceled?",

        "Well, I mean, you know, again, all of my studies were done in the in-patient clinical research center so we could observe the patients and make sure they weren't diverting this Schedule 1 substance.",
        "And cancer patients, I don't think, are that enthusiastic about spending, you know, some of the remaining days of their lives in the hospital doing a research study.",
        "Plus there was always a concern that the cannabis that NIDA provides is not particularly potent and that because we live in California, where we've had cannabis available as a medicine for patients since 1996, if patients really wanted to use it, they could.",
        "And as a cancer doctor, ma'am, many patients in my age group, who grew up in the '60s and '70s, with cancer are cannabis-experienced people.",
        "So that is not a problem.",
        "The problem is the closing of the dispensaries now by the federal government in California, when we voted for it in 1996, is not allowing my elderly patients access to their medicine.",
        "And NIDA provides marijuana cigarettes at 3.5 and seven percent THC.",
        "Do you think that you need more than that, especially considering one of the studies that came out of the CMCR that said that at seven percent the side effects were quite above the boundary of acceptable side effects, meaning psychoactive dizziness, confusion and so on?",
        "So my feeling is that the doses that are available for this research are in fact available, but once you get into seven percent or six percent cannabis, you do have side effects that have to be reported in clinical trials, far beyond that boundary of what are...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Again, I hate to disagree with you, but the cannabis available in dispensaries averages from 10 to 15 percent, and legal cannabis in The Netherlands is 14 percent that you get from the pharmacy.",
        "So three and seven percent is not a huge amount, and I think patients need to self-titrate.",
        "It's very different from other medicines, you know, where you tell the patient try it and see what works for you.",

        "Well, of course not.",

        "The FDA requires and insists that one does a window of therapeutic efficacy compared with a window of a side effect profile that may render a drug unacceptable in the market.",
        "And if you do a full-dose response curve, you will find that past a certain percentage of THC, a person is quite incompetent."
