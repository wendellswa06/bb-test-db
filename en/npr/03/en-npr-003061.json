        "Yeah.",

        "A recent study in young people followed for 20 years show that those who regularly use cannabis had better pulmonary function tests than those who didn't.",
        "So there are other ways to deliver cannabis than smoking, and we've investigated a vaporizer, and vaporization is now widely used by patients here in California as a smokeless delivery system.",
        "But in my opinion, smoking is not that dangerous, either, and I'm sure that will get some disagreement from my colleague."

        "And the activation of these receptors causes chemical reactions in cells which have many different effects besides the psychoactivity.",
