        "That's right.",
        "So the objective of the study was to try to understand: How is it the politicians manage to get away with answering different questions than the ones they're asked without being punished?",
        "And so what we did was we recorded a politician being asked a question.",
        "The question was about: What will you do about the health care problem in America?",

        "And what question were they asked?",
        "And so not surprisingly, they thought the person who answered the question about health care with an answer about health care, they thought he was honest, likeable, trustworthy, and they could remember the question he was asked.",
        "But then when he was asked about illegal drug use, they thought he was just as honest, likeable and trustworthy, and they had no idea what question he was asked.",
        "But then when he was asked about war on terror, they were capable of detecting dodges.",
        "They knew what question he was asked - war on terror - but they thought he was a jerk.",
        "And what that - that's a basic study.",
        "We had a series of these that look at different versions, but the basic takeaway is that the most - even egregiously not even acknowledging the question you're asked, but offering an answer that is vaguely related, people don't notice.",
        "They don't detect.",
        "They don't punish.",
        "So you get in the ballpark, so to speak, and people don't detect the dodge there.",
        "Right, but...",

        "That memo said members of Congress from both parties had received 40 briefings over the years on so-called enhanced interrogation techniques that includes waterboarding, which many consider torture.",
        "The memo also listed Speaker Pelosi as taking part in the very first of those briefings.",

        "The memo, which House Republicans requested, says on September 4th, 2002, when Nancy Pelosi was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on enhanced interrogation techniques used on terror suspect Abu Zubaydah, including a description of the techniques employed.",
        "According to a Justice Department memo, Abu Zubaydah had been waterboarded 83 times in the previous month.",
        "At a news conference today, Pelosi flatly denied having been told about that waterboarding.",
        "In the briefing that I received we were told that they had legal opinions that this was legal.",
        "We were not told that it was - that there were other legal opinions to the contrary in the administration.",
        "And we were told specifically that waterboarding was not being used.",
        "A reporter sought to clarify the charge being made by Pelosi.",
