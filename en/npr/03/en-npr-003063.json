        "Is there a way for us to pay attention to the question and say, hey, you're dodging it?",
        "Yes, there is.",

        "And in 2010 midterms, you're up to maybe only 40 percent.",

        "When we parsed out how much of this message actually got people to change their behavior, we found that the direct effect of the message was to mobilize about 60,000 people.",
        "But those people who had a friend who saw the message were actually also more likely to vote.",
        "And this indirect effect of the behavior spreading through the network actually got an extra 280,000 people to vote, four for one.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is that enough to sway an election?",
        "It can be.",
        "You know, in Florida it was, what, 537 votes in 2000.",
        "So it certainly could be if it was focused.",
        "In this particular case, we don't have evidence that it actually made a difference for outcomes, because liberals and conservatives were equally susceptible to the treatment of this message.",
        "Do you think this is a technique that's going to be used in this campaign season?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, you know, what's really heartening is I think both the campaigns are really paying attention to social science, and they're doing experiments, like the experiment we did here, where they - you know, just like a drug, they send a message to some people, and they randomly have other people not see the message, and then they see how it changes their behavior.",
        "But what this study, I think, calls attention to and what they might not be doing fully is that the real impact of these messages is not on the person who receives them.",

        "It involved 61 million people, and with that scale, they were able to look at spillover to friends' networks, and that was really, I think, the - I think that's what James was highlighting, that really the most surprising is that the effect on friends was much larger than the effect on the target.",

        "Where you think that indirect viral effect comes from, James?",
        "Well, one of the - the other thing that we found in the study was that it wasn't any old friend on Facebook that mattered.",
        "The average person on Facebook today has about 150 friends, you know, Facebook friends.",
        "But we also were able to use this separate study to try to figure out which of those people were likely to have a close, face-to-face relationship in real life.",
        "And we looked at just those 10 closest friends, those people you're mostly likely to see every day.",
        "Those are the ones that were driving the whole effect.",
        "The other 140 people, they had no effect whatsoever.",
        "So Facebook is really getting at us not these new ties online but via these real-world social networks we've always had.",

        "I do, and I think that the real-world social network is really important.",
        "You want to be able to activate that.",
        "You want your messages to become organic because people are much more likely to do something from someone they trust than from a stranger when they hear these messages."
