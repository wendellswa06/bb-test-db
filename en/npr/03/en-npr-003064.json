        "But I also think that there's a lot of opportunity for innovation when it comes to spreading information, and this is where, you know, Todd's studies are ingenious.",

        "And then there's another group that says oh my God, everything is different, our brains are different, we can make as many friends as we want now.",
        "And neither one of those things is true.",
        "What this study really shows is that online social networks matter, but they matter because they're a way of accessing these real-world social networks that we've always had, and they're allowing us to see not just our, you know, the people we're directly connected to but the people that we're indirectly connected to, as well.",

        "Hi, I'm calling from the District of Columbia, and, you know, you sort of addressed my question about following up on evasive answers when you said, you know, when you noted that Mitt Romney answered - you know, said I can answer the question any way I want to.",
        "But whom do you think would have the power or the, you know, the gravitas or the persuasive ability to change the way political debates, the so-called political debates, are carried out in this country so that we do actually get answers to questions?",
        "Maybe questions could be more clearly asked.",
        "They often have a preamble, a beginning, a middle and then finally the question.",
        "They're so long, sometimes you're not quite sure what the question was asked.",
        "But whom do you think could do that, the League of Women Voters or maybe the former presidents or...",
        "All right, let me get an answer because we're running out of time.",
        "So I think that this dodging is most important for - because it is specifically the questions that candidates dodge that they suspect will affect voter views of them.",
        "So it's as if the most important questions - they are helping us identify the most important questions by failing to answer them."

        "I don't see why we can't do that.",
        "I mean, I think that we should tell the people who are organizing this year's presidential debates - how hard is it to just get a direct transcript of the question and put it at the bottom?",

        "They've got tons of information at the bottom.",

        "It could be that it's actually more important to think about the character of a candidate than the actual informational content of what they're saying.",
        "And by the same token, it might be more important for us to pay attention to our friends than it is to pay attention to information.",
        "And so once we find out what these biases are, we can figure out how to correct them, but we need to I think be a little bit careful because it could be the reason why we have these biases is because we're already programmed to really pay attention to those things that are most important.",
        "Todd, you also studied different ways to increase voter turnout, including one where you asked people about their election day plans because voter turnout, what was it, 37 percent in the last election?",
        "It was amazing.",
        "What are different ways - and there are some countries that have mandatory, right, you get penalized if you don't go to vote.",
        "How do these work?",
        "Do they work any better?",
        "Are they things that we thought about?",
        "Right, so there - for the last five to 15 years, researchers have been able to run randomized experiments like these pharmaceutical drug trials, like the way James was describing, on voter turnout.",
        "And I've been involved in this, and there are several psychological tools that people have begun to use based on this research to increase turnout."

        "Well, you know, I doubt the fiber content, although they did not say whether in fact it was oatmeal, which as we know is good for our hearts.",
        "And when - rationally, if turnout is high, it should make their vote matter less, but in fact because we've evolved to conform to the behavior of others, emphasizing high turnout makes people more likely to vote or more motivated to vote, and that's completely consistent with what James found.",
        "And that's consistent with a wide variety of other behaviors, too.",
