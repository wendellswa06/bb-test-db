        "In fact, it's one of the three top reasons for de-friending, along with politics and people who share too much.",
        "And this process means that we eventually end up surrounding ourselves with people who have exactly our same beliefs.",
        "So that's one problem.",
        "But another problem is, because it's so easy to access anyone in the world, you can find the person who has exactly the same idiosyncratic point of view as you.",

        "Well, but it does look like, you know, that social networking is becoming a major part of the campaigns and now actually the political debates.",
        "And maybe there is a feedback mechanism, you know, in real time, to the political debates that could be - some creative people could think about.",
        "It's going to have to be - the moderator, in the end, is going to have to be the arbiter or mediator of this whole process, although there are Twitter debate - you know, there was a YouTube debate where people got to ask questions via YouTube.",
        "And that's a nice innovation.",
        "But in the end, they can answer whatever they can get away with answering.",
        "And so how we hold them to that is going to have to be a human or some structure that compares their answer to what's being said, whether it's the fact checker or the question posted.",

        "James Fowler is author of \"\"Connected: How Your Friends' Friends' Friends Affect Everything You Feel, Think, and Do.\"\" Does it go that far, James, the effect - friends' friends' friends?",
        "We saw it go out to the friends in the real-world behavior.",

        "And one limitation we had is it's really expensive computationally to calculate the friends of friends of friends.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "So what - are there any creative ways that you were thinking of that - I'll give you the blank check that I - you said it's very expensive.",
        "If you had a blank check to study this, what would you like to know, and how would you like to study it?",
        "What would you do?",
        "Design an experiment for me.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So I think the next step now is we want to know what kinds of messages are most influential and what kinds of people are most influential.",
        "So we haven't sort of figured out if we're going to do another experiment yet, but as we're discussing this, I'm continuing to work with Facebook, and those are the kinds of questions we'd like to ask.",
        "And that would involve trying out different messages and also trying to figure out what are the attributes of people that seem to be most effective in getting their friends to change their behavior.",
        "What about Twitter?",
        "Are there different kinds of people on Twitter than are on Facebook?",
        "Sometimes when I ask people on Twitter to go to a Facebook page, they jump up and down and say, I don't want to go anywhere near that thing.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "No, they are complements for some people, and they're substitutes for other people, and so you have kind of both ties.",
        "One big difference with Twitter is it tends to be more promotional, tends to be more professional, tends to be more like self-promotion in particular.",
        "But it's also about weaker ties.",
        "It's hard to define the real friends on there.",
        "People have - you know, some people have millions of ties on there, and no one has a million close friends.",
        "And so it's kind of a different beast when you're looking at trying to change real-world behaviors because the research suggests you have to get those real-world ties to be able to get that to happen."

        "Yeah.",
