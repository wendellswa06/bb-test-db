        "So now you'll see sort of the reverse of that.",
        "You'll see new apartment buildings being built, new types of stores are opening up.",
        "You see that also to some extent in Clinton Hill.",
        "I would say Clinton Hill is experiencing a less extreme version of gentrification because it never declined as much as Harlem did.",
        "Give us a brief example of something a resident said during the course of your research about gentrification and how they felt about it.",
        "Sure.",
        "There was some ambivalence about it.",
        "Try to paraphrase one resident.",
        "He was describing what was happening.",
        "This is a resident of Harlem and he was saying, well, you know, there are more supermarkets open, it's easier to access fresh produce, whereas previously he had to go outside of the neighborhood.",
        "But then what - another thing he said that I thought was very telling, he said, yeah, but, you know, what good is a nice neighborhood if you can't afford to live there?",
        "Now, you have an interesting section on social norms.",
        "You know, questions of how loudly people speak on the street, how they dress, how they greet each other.",
        "How does gentrification impact that?",
        "Gentrification, by definition, is newcomers coming into the neighborhood from a different area perhaps with a different set of expectation, a different set of norms.",
        "And what happens is you have some conflict around that.",
        "Newcomers may not like the fact that people are congregating on the street corner and they might see that as a sign of disorder.",
        "Whereas compared to people who had been living there for a while, they feel like, you know, this is something we've always been doing, we haven't been causing any harm so why should we now have to change our patterns of behavior?",
        "So that's just one example of that type of conflict over different types of norms.",
        "So in summary, do you think gentrification is good or bad for the long-time residents of these neighborhoods and in what way?",
        "I think that there is a little bit of both going on - and I think so.",
        "I think my answer is reflecting the ambivalence that many of the residents expressed to me.",
        "On the good side, as I said, these two neighborhoods - and this is common in many other predominantly African-American neighborhoods that experience a lot of disinvestment.",
        "So you had abandoned buildings in the neighborhood.",
        "If you wanted to go to a supermarket, you might have to get on a bus.",
        "If you wanted to have a prescription filled, again, you might have to go outside the neighborhood.",
        "That's something that is not desirable to anyone.",
        "Anyone would like to see that improved.",
        "There are a number of different strategies that could be implemented to improve that.",
        "It just so happens that with gentrification, you're going to see less abandoned building, right.",
        "You have more people coming in with money; more stores are going to open.",
        "So that's I guess you could say the plus side."

        "On the negative side, the issue of displacement is a threat.",

        "Or even more telling, many more people who grew up in the neighborhood, even if they're not displaced, they can no longer afford to stay in the neighborhood.",
        "They have to move outside of the neighborhood.",
        "That's a negative.",
        "And also, as I said, I think the conflict over social norms and the resentment that people who have lived in the neighborhood who feel like they sort of stuck it out when times were bad and now that things are improving it's not improving for them and they or their offspring might not be able to take advantage of it.",
