        "People who in the past were comfortable speaking on the record and speaking out these days are self-censoring.",
        "It is difficult to get information on these developments.",
        "They are rarely reported in Iran's government dominated newspapers and television, and friends and supporters of those target are reluctant to come forward when arrests do occur.",

        "One was a long-time political prisoner whom the authorities said suffered a heart attack during a hunger strike.",
        "Another was Akbar Mohammadi, a student activist who has been in and out of prisons for the past six years.",
        "He, too, died during a hunger strike and was buried before his parents could see his body, prompting suspicions that he was tortured or beaten.",
        "These deaths have had an effect on students who last spring seemed eager to protest actions by the government, says Bill Samii, who monitors events in Iran for Radio Free Europe.",
        "This new school year has just started in Iran, and so I think what the regime is trying to do, possibly by letting these guys die and perhaps rounding up individuals, is to create a sort of atmosphere of fear and intimidation, thereby discouraging any protests that might take place.",
        "As for the crackdown on journalists, the government has just closed Iran's most prominent and popular daily newspaper, Shargh.",
        "The offending material, according to sources in Iran, was a front page cartoon depicting President Ahmadinejad as a donkey.",
        "The government also convicted a prominent reform journalist, Isa Saharkhiz, for his critical writing about Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
        "Saharkhiz is appealing his case and remains out of prison for the moment.",

        "In an interview with NPR, he expressed fears at that time of repression against all elements of the reform movement.",
        "How will they do with the press, with the journalists, with the MPs who will resign, with the party's groups and with the student movement?",
        "So we are waiting for this kind of crackdown.",
        "All of these cases have had a chilling effect on those who felt freer in recent years to criticize Iran's government, says Karim Sadjadpour."
