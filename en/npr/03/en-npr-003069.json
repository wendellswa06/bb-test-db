        "The people who call it home need to have reassurance that their lives will be safer in the years to come.",
        "Protecting a city that sits lower than the water around it is not easy, but it can and has been done.",
        "That means re-engineering the city of New Orleans, and it means restoring surrounding wetlands that create a buffer against hurricanes and floods.",
        "During a storm, those wetlands reduce the energy of the storm as it moves toward New Orleans.",
        "Robert Twilley is a coastal oceanographer at Louisiana State University.",
        "He says in the last 100 years, about a third of the wetlands have been eaten up by the ocean.",
        "He tells his students that means an area of wetlands the size of a lecture hall disappears in the course of one lecture.",
        "Twilley explains it's because the area has become more and more developed.",
        "The coastal wetland landscape in Louisiana, you start with 1900, there was a 1927 flood, oil and gas explorations in 1940.",
        "Navigation really expanded in the--from 1920 to 1950.",
        "All three of those produced extreme changes and all kinds of artificial structures to our coastal landscape, and mainly it's all related to disconnecting the river from the wetlands.",
        "That disconnect essentially prevented providing nourishment and silt to the wetlands so that they basically can keep up with the water level, because the land is sinking and sea levels are rising.",
        "Without the river, you cannot--the land cannot maintain its elevation relative to the rise in water.",
        "When you went up this week in a helicopter to look at these wetlands, describe what you saw.",
        "Well, let's go to Breton Sound.",
        "Breton Sound is an area that is bounded on the east and the west by a levee system.",
        "The storm energy, of course, is in a sort of a circular motion, right?",
        "It spins, as everyone sees in the satellite images, and you really can see across the landscape the translation of what you see in a satellite image to essentially a scouring in almost circular patterns that replicate the energy field of a hurricane.",
        "And so what once was a carpet of wetlands are now essentially circular scouring patterns where there's ribbons of wetlands but large areas of open water.",
        "How do you take a river like the Mississippi that, to some extent--to a great extent, has been artificially channeled and straightened and diverted from where it would naturally go--how do you fix that?",
        "What specifically can you do to make a more--to make it mimic what nature would ordinarily do?",
        "Well, we have mechanisms--we had one built in 1992--that are called freshwater diversions.",
        "They basically reconnect the river to the floodplain.",
        "These are cement structures.",
        "They don't use pumps.",
        "They have gates.",
        "When the river level is at a certain height, by gravity, water flows through the gates, through a series of canals, and nourishes the wetlands.",
        "Would you need more diversions like that?"

        "This has been the challenge all along.",
        "There are, perhaps, more incremental steps that could be taken, but the president - President Trump wants China to make huge changes.",
        "Right.",

        "might hope for right now is a more limited agreement that would, perhaps, suspend the Trump tariffs in exchange for some modest commitments on the part of China to buy more American farm goods.",
