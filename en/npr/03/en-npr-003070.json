        "So what happens next?",
        "So, you know, Victoria's going to go back to Nashville once a month for four months for checkups and blood tests and other follow-up tests to see if these supercells are working.",
        "And doctors will follow her for years to make sure the cells are safe and to see if they're helping her to live a healthier, longer life.",

        "I guess what I'm asking is, how will I know if I'm looking at a political ad on Facebook?",
        "Well, that's one of the criticisms that people have laid on this announcement, which is that we're not really going to see.",
        "As users of Facebook, we're likely not going to see much change on the front end of seeing the apps that we interact with on Facebook's platforms, Facebook and Instagram.",
        "Instead, these changes are more on the back end for Facebook to help verify that the people putting ads out are legitimate political actors.",
        "So to whom is this being disclosed?",
        "Is this being disclosed through Facebook?",
        "Is this being disclosed to the viewer on the site?",
        "How will we know?",
        "Well, it seems like things are slightly unclear still, but what we have heard from the company is that the company is going to move toward a more rigorous verification system.",
        "Before - or, in fact, currently what the company is doing is if you're a political operator, a political advertiser and you want to push an ad on Facebook or Instagram or one of its platforms, what you've got to do is essentially just let Facebook know that you're a political advertiser, a political organization.",

        "That's the main change that's happening on the back end to help the company sort out whether or not you're a political organization trying to advertise or you're an illegitimate actor that's trying to push a political ad.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Again, just for people who - I mean, maybe this is obvious - but why does Facebook remain such an attractive place for political campaigns?",

        "There have also been a lot of canals cut through the wetlands for petroleum exploration, for shipping channels.",
        "Do you just accept those as a fact of life, that there's really nothing to be done about that?",
        "No, it's a very good point.",
        "You know, the key point about this coast and the fact that it is a working coast is it requires access to specific locations, to shipping, to oil and gas rigs, to operations, and access requires canals.",
        "That access also moves water; it moves sod; it moves a lot of the other elements that are part of the risk that these communities are having to deal with.",
        "We have got to re-evaluate access.",
        "You know, again, there's a compromise here because there's a lot of the canals that I don't think industry would mind--there would be no problem that we knock down the dredge boyles(ph) that exist, the artificial banks that prevent water from flowing out into the wetlands.",
        "You know, there are a lot of pipelines out there that were covered by wetlands, and it's very important those wetlands stay there to protect that infrastructure.",
        "And so there's a very aggressive campaign by industry to make sure that we have sustainable wetlands in this area as well.",

        "It is--it would be on the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and the exact size I don't know.",

        "What might be a 21st-century successor to the levee and the seawall?",
        "Well, if you look at the New Orleans from every side, we were surprised to find out that the safest side of New Orleans is the Mississippi River side.",
        "And personally, I was surprised because I thought that generally if you have a mighty river like Mississippi flows through New Orleans, then that's where you expect to see flood.",
        "But Corps of Engineers, after 1927, were given basically a kind of mandate to do whatever it takes so that Mississippi never overfloods.",
        "So they have very strong levees which are very dependable, and I don't think--they're much more dependable and stronger than what we have in the lakefront side.",
        "And those are really levees.",
        "Even if they overtop, they don't create disaster.",
        "In what sense?",
        "If they overtop, then they still hold, and whatever water spills over is--that water gets spilled over it.",
        "So the levees as strong as Mississippi River levees would be a better choice.",
        "But obviously, I would like an national level kind of involvement from engineers of all side to look at this design and make it really, truly American standard.",
