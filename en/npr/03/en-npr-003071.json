        "When oil and gas development in the nearby Permian Basin took off a few years ago, Wren got worried and looked into enforcing some of the existing lighting ordinances passed decades ago to protect the observatory.",
        "I've had one person in the industry comment to me that if you start writing tickets, we're going to aim lights up in the sky just to piss you off.",
        "So Wren changed his approach, instead reaching out to some of the oil men to explain the problem.",

        "You just have dark skies.",
        "You can see stars from horizon to horizon.",
        "He wanted to help, and the fixes were pretty simple - point lights down, not up, and switch to warmer-colored bulbs.",
        "Together, Locke and Wren have written a paper about best practices.",
        "Stacy Locke says the key is getting the companies that own the well sites on board.",
        "They hire all of the service providers so they can mandate that, hey, if you want to work for me, your equipment has to be dark sky-compliant.",
        "As all this is happening, oil field light pollution may be decreasing for now because there's been a major slowdown in drilling activity, and that means fewer lights blocking out the stars.",

        "These were people that the VA felt that they had to help to keep them from slipping into life on the streets.",
        "Quil Lawrence, I know it's hard to generalize, but in your experience, what are some of the reasons that veterans become homeless?",
        "Well, some of it's coming home to a hard economy, as many in a previous generation did and as many are now.",
        "They say that about 1 percent of those who separate from the military then flip into homelessness.",
        "There's also a large crossover with mental illness, but also some of the traumas related to combat.",

        "They can slice and dice different audience segments, meaning different classes of a constituent population and target them with incisive political advertising that triggers what those constituents believe or attempts to trigger an emotional response in ways that you can't do on broadcast or radio because you've got to advertise to the entire constituent population, not just a targeted segment of it.",

        "I think it's very clear that companies should discontinue political advertising until and unless it can show that it can operate political advertising in a way that protects our democracy.",
        "To the extent that we lack transparency into the interactions that we have with political ads and the company remains unaccountable to mistakes that it makes, we should absolutely discontinue political advertising on Facebook.",
        "Now, the company can correct those problems, and if it can, then I think it can come back.",
