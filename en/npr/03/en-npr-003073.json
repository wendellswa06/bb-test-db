        "So the fact that he's under-performing is what's setting off alarms.",
        "And when you look at Senator Obama's performance and break it down and say, well, why is there this difference, you come to white men, who are clearly not taken with Senator Obama.",
        "But the one that really is the - of concern to political insiders is that white, suburban women - people who, in previous elections, were known as soccer moms or security moms, now they're called mortgage moms because of their economic worries - they really have not taken to Senator Obama.",
        "Let's talk about another poll for a moment.",
        "One done last month from the Pew Center found that unfavorable opinions of John McCain are mainly based on his political beliefs, where Obama's unfavorables are largely based on, quote, \"\"the kind of person he is,\"\" unquote.",

        "Well, I think you can deal with issues.",
        "It's harder to reorient the voter's view of you as a person.",
        "In the case of Senator Obama, it's sort of a curious dynamic, because he's really an unknown to voters entering the campaign.",
        "When you start asking questions, you come up with this whole idea of somewhat discomfort.",
        "His favorability ratings have even gone down since February, down about eight percentage points according to a Pew poll, since February.",
        "And what's the intervening event, Alex?",
        "The intervening event is things like Reverend Wright and the controversy over race, Father Pfleger, questions about Michelle Obama and the kind of things that she says about America.",
        "Apparently, some of these things are attaching in the mind of voters who are saying, well, maybe I'm not comfortable with his personal beliefs.",
        "Maybe I don't share his personal beliefs.",
        "He's got to turn that around in a hurry.",
        "And Juan, your best political conversation this week?",
        "Well, Alex, it's inside the McCain campaign, where they are looking at some of the same numbers we've been talking about with regard to white women, but it's been sort of exacerbated by the fact that they perceive that there has - that white women in the country, especially white, female Democrats, feel that Senator Clinton was treated in a sexist manner, not only by the press, but by some of the political operatives, the political elites, in the Democratic Party.",
        "So the McCain camp wants to capitalize on that with the hope of attracting support from white female voters.",
        "Democrats for McCain, neo-cons for Obama, what a crazy world.",

        "There's a reason for this.",
        "The main road's been falling apart for years, not least because it was churned up by the tracks of Russian tracks during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.",
        "It's now being repaired by Chinese contractors, one of the more important infrastructure projects by Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai as he struggles to rebuild his nation.",
        "That means the traffic, including the multitude of trucks heading for Kabul, is diverted along a separate road through the hills.",
        "The word `road' is perhaps an exaggeration; it's a winding band of mud, rocks and potholes which, with a little rain, quickly turn slippery.",

        "That's all that separates you from plunging to certain death in the gullies below.",
        "Yet this didn't deter the drivers of huge trucks laden with C containers, or of the gas tankers, or the men behind the wheels of the brilliantly painted Pakistani trucks carrying wood and cattle and chickens, nor did it bother the taxis and many buses and the SUVs with darkened windows, plying this otherwise deserted landscape.",
        "Nor did it deter Zalmay.",
        "Zalmay wears his beard long.",

        "He passed other vehicles on blind corners.",
        "He chuckled gleefully as he swerved around truck after truck.",
        "He angrily honked his horn as the traffic knotted itself in needless jams, and laughed loudly when people indignantly hooted back.",
        "And so did everyone else.",
        "High in these stark and empty hills, they played a game of chicken, a favorite in this part of the world, in which you drive straight at one another at high speed, veering away only at the last moment.",
        "It took us five hours to reach our destination and another five to get back.",
        "When we finally returned to the capital, the sun was slipping behind the mountains.",
        "Only then did the light in Zalmay's eyes begin to fade.",

        "Supporters of the administration would look at that and say, if a person from Central America is in a risky situation and the desire and need is to just extricate themselves from that situation, why shouldn't they apply for asylum in Mexico?",
