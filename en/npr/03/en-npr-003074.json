        "That's part of why Guatemala is one of the country we see so many people fleeing from.",
        "And then thirdly, most of the people, in my experience, who are seeking asylum from Central America have family or close friends in the United States.",
        "There's a reason that if they have to flee their homes - and that's not usually their first choice - this is a place they'd like to come because they have a place to land and someone who knows them who will help them to get on their feet.",
        "Do you believe the United States has a moral obligation to accept people who, for whatever reason, find that they can no longer live in their home country?",

        "How do you respond to that?",
        "I think we have a moral obligation to do our part, which isn't to say we should take every persecuted person in the world.",
        "We can't do that.",
        "But we can do far more than we are doing at the moment.",
        "And our laws - going back to language that was drafted in the days after World War II when, collectively, most of the world felt pretty awful about the way we turned Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazi government away - we adopted laws that said if you reach the United States and you have a well-founded fear of persecution for one of these particular reasons under the law, we won't send you back.",
        "And I think we do have a - both a moral and a legal obligation to respect that.",
        "And this country has a history of refugee resettlement that is a beautiful part of our heritage.",

        "But last year, when we actually ended up taking fewer than 23,000 refugees, that was less than one-tenth of 1% of the more than 25 million refugees in the world.",
        "Many Christian evangelicals have looked at the immigration situation, especially at the border right now with family separation, and seen horrible things and have privately lamented those things, but yet have stood by President Trump's policies and proclamations.",
        "Where do you stand on the religious component of this?",
        "Do you think evangelicals have done enough?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I don't think evangelicals have done enough, and I say that as an evangelical.",
        "I would say a lot of evangelical leadership has been really straightforward in saying we should continue to welcome those people who are persecuted for whatever reason.",
        "A letter went up this week from leaders of some of the largest evangelical denominations in the country to President Trump, really imploring him not to cut the refugee ceiling further and, actually, to restore it back to a historically normal level.",
        "But I do think, at the Pew level, if you will, this is a divisive issue.",
        "And I am really hoping and I'm personally praying that evangelicals will stop and say, this one's too far.",
        "We don't want to close that golden door on people fleeing persecution, including people who are persecuted for their Christian faith.",
        "I think it's maybe not gotten a lot of attention that Christian refugees from some of the countries where Christians face the worst persecution in the world, along with other religious minorities, are also really dramatically harmed by these policies.",
        "As I understand it, a big part of your work is talking to fellow evangelicals about this - about immigration more broadly.",

        "Thinking about boxes, I wonder if the box of being an African-American poet is something that you struggle with - that you push against?",
        "And what's encouraging to me is when I speak in churches, the response is actually really positive.",
        "I think a lot of churches are afraid to even have that conversation.",
        "But when they do, I find that most people are really receptive if it's grounded not in a political agenda - we're not there to tell people to vote for Republicans or vote for Democrats - but in a biblical message that focuses on who we know God to be, as revealed in the Bible, and his particular concern for vulnerable refugees.",
