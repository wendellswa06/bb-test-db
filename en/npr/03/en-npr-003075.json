        "We've been using the word \"\"miraculous\"\" quite a bit.",
        "Reverend Lowery, looking back through the civil rights struggle, is there an event, a singular moment, or a specific thing that you can point to that brought us to this day with a black man conceivably winning the White House?",
        "Well, I think we have to go back to - oh, my God, we can go to so many places.",

        "Do you think that black people have been wrong about how whites see African-Americans?",

        "I think our people had lost hope, and I think this has given us hope in our power again.",
        "If - Reverend Lowery, if Obama were to lose in November, how much would that change the euphoria that so many African-Americans are experiencing at the moment?",
