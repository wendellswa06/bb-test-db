        "I was actually in Brookhaven, Mississippi, by a great friend and his wife, who took me and my family in, sent to us kind of a spur of the moment thing with the evacuation because the storm kind of grew really fast and came to everyone's attention real quick.",
        "So that was a lot of reason for a lot of the disorganization and everything as it relates to the evacuation.",

        "The cell phones were down and maybe someone had a text message.",
        "And if their cell phone was working, they couldn't charge the battery.",
        "So I knew I had some family that was living and I knew I had some that weren't accounted for.",
        "And thankfully, I found everybody except for one, which was my grandmother who, I guess, in the chaos and everybody trying to figure out what they'll going to do before the storm, slipped through the cracks, and she didn't make it through.",
        "Did the blog and the blogging help you deal with that kind of loss?",
        "I think it helped me get some of the aggravation out.",

        "…the Caribbean and what not.",
        "And actually, I started my blog on August 29th, 2006 because I just got so - and it was a way to vent what, you know, what I was seeing, the progress that wasn't going on.",
        "And the thing that I saw when I got back that irritated me the most, I think, was just all of the misperceptions being put out by the media, which, you know, I don't think it was blatant(ph) on their part.",
        "I think there's just a lot here to understand and a lot of intricacies to what's going on and, you know, that someone who isn't local will probably miss."
