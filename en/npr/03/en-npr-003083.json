        "Krueger points to the Congressional Budget Office forecast, which said the government spending cuts will reduce economic growth this year by about 750,000 jobs.",
        "Now, one area where we saw a drop in job growth in March was construction.",
        "What does that signal?",
        "Well, right.",
        "That's a sector of the economy which was really hard hit during the recession, and we saw very high unemployment among construction workers.",
        "But the housing market has finally begun to recover.",
        "Starting last fall, we saw an uptick in construction employment.",
        "Since September, in fact, we've added 169,000 new construction jobs.",
        "But construction hiring, along with other parts, slumped in March.",
        "And this is an area where the president says the government could really help.",
        "He's been calling on Congress to spend more money on public works projects - building things he says the country needs and at the same time, putting some of those idle construction crews back to work.",
        "Right.",
        "This is one of those proposals we'll see in the president's budget next week.",
        "And, I mean, it seems like we're basically getting a sneak preview.",
        "Right.",
        "And one of the things that we're being told the budget will include is the president's last deficit-cutting offer to House Speaker John Boehner, the offer he made back in December.",
        "Now, that offer included some things that the president's fellow Democrats don't like - like cuts to future Medicare spending, slower cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security payments.",
        "But the White House has made it clear, those sacrifices for the Democrats would have to be accompanied by a sacrifice on the Republican side, namely higher tax revenue.",
        "Here's White House spokesman, Jay Carney.",
        "The president believes that the entitlement reforms he put forward to Speaker of the House John Boehner late last year are acceptable within the context of a broader budget that invests in the economy, protects and assists the middle-class; it protects seniors, and allows us to grow and create jobs.",
        "The alternative approach is not acceptable.",
        "It's not acceptable to the president, and it is not acceptable to the American people.",
        "The president has argued that his vision is the one that the voters opted for last November, and he argues the Republican budget proposal is the one the voters rejected."

        "Scott, for those of us with deja vu, it seems like this same idea of a grand bargain the president's been pushing for the last two years without success.",
        "It really is.",
        "And the sticking point has not changed.",
        "It's the president's call for more tax revenue.",
        "Every time he brings that up, Republican leaders walk away from the bargaining table.",
        "So this time, the president is really sort of trying to go around those Republican leaders, and take his case directly to what the White House calls the common sense caucus.",
        "They're hoping to find at least a few Republican lawmakers who'd be willing to go along with higher revenue, in exchange for getting the entitlement savings that they've been saying they want.",
        "So this coming Wednesday, the same day that his budget comes out, the president will be having a private dinner with a dozen Republican senators, and he'll be pitching his combination of long-term deficit reduction with some short-term spending, to goose that sluggish job market.",
        "Scott, thanks for the update.",

        "Good morning.",
        "It has taken decades, but a project to create a massive park straddling the Texas-Mexico border is moving forward.",
        "President Obama and Mexican President Felipe Calderon signed a joint statement last month pledging to protect the wild lands on both sides of the frontier.",
        "As NPR's John Burnett reports, this comes at a time of rising concern about security along the border.",
        "When Big Bend National Park was established in 1944 in far West Texas, President Franklin Roosevelt wrote to President Manuel Avila Camacho of Mexico: I do not believe this undertaking in the Big Bend will be complete until the entire park area on both sides of the Rio Grande forms one great international park."

        "If they can do it on the northern border, they can do it on the southern border, says Rick Lobello, a conservationist in El Paso who's a longtime promoter of a U.S.-Mexico peace park."
