        "The idea of disposable income and what people like to utilize and use for vacations, African-Americans, whether it be piling into the car and just going down to Auntie's house down South or making a destination plan out West or overseas is something that we've always done, correct?",
        "That's absolutely correct, but I think the new trend is more adventure, more discoveries.",
        "There's so much out there to see, and people have more disposable income today so, therefore, they're going to faraway places as well as the close places.",
        "And what they like to see is not only family, but they like to have a cultural experience and a shared experience that will be memorable for the rest of their lives.",

        "And I woke up a couple of hours later going into an MRI machine and had a number of injuries.",
        "The funny thing was, if it could be funny, that I was in the middle of writing a novella where a man got randomly punched in the chest on a New York City street.",
        "And I suppose that the assault that happened in New Haven then began to creep into and color and even give deeper texture to what I was writing at the time.",
        "So this character, Mendelssohn, who's been murdered, as you mention, with a punch to the chest, much like the one you experienced, when you were writing this, did you already know that that's the way he was going to die, or was this something that happened after the attack?",
        "Yeah, I'd already written the scene, in fact, when he gets punched in the chest.",
        "I got punched in the back of the head.",
        "It was almost like fiction preceding reality and maybe reality then putting a map back upon my fiction in a way.",
        "The one thing I don't want is for this incident to define me.",
        "But I wanted to own it and be able to speak about it.",
        "It was amazing to me that when it emerged in some of the newspapers, that I got letters from hundreds of people around the world, women in particular, who had been in situations where they had been assaulted.",
        "And they said the necessity of telling their story, of being able to speak out, was incredibly important to them.",
        "Well, that's interesting because the last story, of course, involves a nun who was violently raped in Latin America.",
        "And then she sees her rapist on television after he sort of reinvented himself as a peacemaker.",
        "In that story, she confronts him.",
