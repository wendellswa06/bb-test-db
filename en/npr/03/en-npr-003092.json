        "Shortly after Theresa May was named Britain's new prime minister, German media wasted no time in hailing her as the British Merkel, as in Germany's Angela Merkel.",
        "But for all the two women's apparent similarities, when it comes to the U.K.'s exit from the European Union, the leaders of Germany and Britain have some major differences.",
        "Esme Nicholson reports.",
        "It seems that Angela Merkel and Theresa May have quite a bit in common.",
        "Both rose to power within their respective conservative parties to the surprise of their male colleagues, both are reputed to be tough yet pragmatic negotiators who stay clear of political gossip, and commentators attribute Merkel and May's disciplined work ethic to the fact that their fathers were both pastors.",
        "But there's one similarity the media has really milked, the fact that they are women, prompting countless trivial analyses of their ostensible soft power, love of cooking and sartorial decisions.",
        "(Through interpreter) The obsession with her shoes or that she has a nice husband who is prepared to fade into the background or, like Merkel, she has no children.",

        "But as Theresa May met Angela Merkel in Berlin, the media focus switched to their differences and how these will affect the messy business of implementing Brexit.",
        "Alan Crawford, co-author of a biography on Merkel, foresees friction between the two leaders.",
        "Their fundamental views are polar opposites in that the chancellor is a very committed European, and I certainly detect that there's a lack of understanding as to what Britain is doing.",
        "At the same time, Merkel has said that they have to accept the fact that Britain has voted this way and so she'll deal with it.",
        "But that's where the tension will start to appear, I think.",
        "At their joint news conference last Wednesday, Theresa May talked of controlling immigration from the EU into the U.K., but Angela Merkel dodged the issue by insisting Britain must invoke Article 50, the official trigger to start divorce proceedings, before official negotiations can begin.",

        "(Through interpreter) We will wait to hear what Britain wants.",
        "Then we'll issue a response.",

        "And indeed, the minorities, the leaders of the minorities, the former Northern Alliance, are extremely nervous and suspicious about the so-called negotiations going on between - or those that were going on between the United States and the Taliban, such that they were, and they were fairly limited.",
        "Nevertheless, they are opposed to any kind of deal that they are not a party to.",
        "But beyond that, they are really un-reconciled to reconciling with the Taliban, simply because of all of the blood and also because there doesn't seem to be any political space in which to make a political compromise between the ideology of the Taliban and sort of this quasi-democratic system that the United States has helped husband in Afghanistan.",
