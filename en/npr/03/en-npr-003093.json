        "Indeed.",
        "It's an impressive, very large coalition.",
        "It's hard to imagine that we're going to be able to get more international support.",
        "Our European NATO allies have all indicated that they intend to reduce their troop presence.",
        "They are facing the same economic pressures we're facing.",
        "So it's hard to imagine that they're going to be able to contribute a greater share to Afghanistan's continued reconstruction needs into the future.",
        "So unfortunately, the only viable long-term path here is for the Afghans to take more responsibility for their security, for their governance, and that's the real challenge.",
        "You know, are these security forces that we're trying to build up, are they going to be ready?",
        "You know, in many cases, you look at them operating in the field today, and you say, well, these guys aren't ready for primetime.",
        "We're pumping in billions upon billions of dollars.",
        "And there's the associated question that many in Washington ask, that is, you know, at the cost of $9 billion this year and an ongoing sustainment cost of somewhere in the range of $6 to $8 billion, is this even sustainable?",
        "Are we, the United States, going to be able to pay five years from now or 10 years from now billions of dollars a year to fund Afghanistan's army and its police forces?",
        "And so as we look forward, I think the solution can't be to create an Afghanistan that will forever be a ward of the international community.",
        "It needs to be focused on what are sustainable approaches where the Afghans can start to take greater ownership and greater responsibility for their own affairs.",
        "And Jonathan Landay, in the neighborhoods, in the villages where you visited, we hear about degrading the morale of the Taliban and removing middle commanders in the Taliban.",
        "At the same time, the Taliban is degrading those Afghan police and army units that we're depending on.",
        "In fact, in some places where you talk to people about the - the word degrading is a terrible word.",
        "It's a U.S.",
        "military word.",
        "It means killing people.",
        "Indeed there has been a great deal of capturing and killing of mid-level Taliban commanders and officials, (unintelligible) officials, in these so-called night raids by U.S.",
        "Special Forces.",
        "But there has also been a deleterious effect, and that is that these - that you have veteran, if you would, Taliban commanders and officials being replaced by younger, more radicalized Taliban officials and commanders who have been educated in the radical madrassas in Pakistan, and that's a factor that we also need to talk about when you talk about the long-term prospects for Afghanistan, who come back into Afghanistan and assume the positions of the people who have been captured and killed.",
        "And these are young men who are, as I said, far more radicalized than sort of the more nationalistic, old - if you would - school Taliban, who have been inculcated in international jihadism, in bin Ladenism, if you would, who are looking beyond Afghanistan in terms of, quote-unquote, \"\"the jihad\"\" and are looking to bolster this - and win this international recognition as members of this international jihad.",
        "And it's had - as I said, these night raids are having a deleterious effect, in some ways.",
        "Now also, I think we also really need, when you talk about long-term prospects, you've got to talk about Pakistan.",
        "I mean, there is no - as far as I can see or anyone else I know who watches this situation closely, there is no cogent, coherent, U.S.",
        "or Western or international strategy for dealing with Pakistan and the fact that elements of Pakistan's security apparatus are backing, supporting and advising the Taliban and related groups."

        "They look at us and say well, how can we be sure you're going to be in my village, in my district, a year from now or two years from now because the messages that are coming from Washington are ones that are focused on drawdown, on bringing costs down.",
        "And everybody hears that, yet you are now here in this country for a while, and you hear the American people say enough already, let's go out."
