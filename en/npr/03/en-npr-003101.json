        "It was prompted in particular by the administration's use of an obscure national security statute to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.",
        "GOP Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania has been warning since the tariffs were first floated back in March that they would drive up costs and prompt retaliation.",

        "We've got increased prices on U.S.",

        "I've heard from many Pennsylvania manufacturers that happen to rely for some portion of their products on imported steel, and now their products are no longer competitive.",
        "Senator Lamar Alexander pointed to an Electrolux plant in Tennessee that canceled a planned $250 million expansion because of the tariffs.",
        "Even though Electrolux makes appliances using domestic steel, its costs have gone up.",
        "Other manufacturers, like BMW and Harley-Davidson, have announced plans to shift production overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs.",
        "Manufacturing has been enjoying a renaissance in the U.S., adding 285,000 jobs over the last year.",
        "But Linda Dempsey of the National Association of Manufacturers says Trump's tariffs could jeopardize that.",
        "If you start seeing some of those shifts of parts of manufacturing supply chains outside of the United States, we're not going to bring that back.",
        "Despite such criticism, Trump is poised to double, triple or quadruple down on his tariff strategy.",
        "He's threatened to use the same national security statute to impose a levy on imported cars.",

        "But here, we see it can be $48,000.",
        "And the other thing is I would say, when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable, don't just look in your area.",

        "Right.",
        "Like, the whole thing disappears after five years unless we, you know.",
        "Which, if you're a business, you can't really build a factory, and you can't plan on things in the future with a five-year time horizon.",
        "So that's changed under the Mexico part of the deal.",
