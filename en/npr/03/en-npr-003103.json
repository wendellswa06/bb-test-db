        "Would I write an introduction for this book or a preface for that book, or a little filler story for this comic?",
        "And even though I don't have the time to do it, it's hard for me to say no, so I end up spending as much time on things that have nothing really to do with my normal work as I do with my own work.",
        "But somehow, I'm lucky, I get it all crowded in.",

        "Hi.",
        "First, of course, let me get out of the way what a big fan I am.",
        "And I really appreciate all that Stan Lee has done for comics.",
        "I was wondering if, Stan, you've ever had a character that you created that didn't really do very well as some of your other characters, who you thought should've had a lot more exposure to everybody, you just don't feel they had a chance at success?",
        "The funny thing is the ones that I did for Marvel really all did very well.",
        "The only one that didn't become as - or the only two that didn't become as big because we didn't concentrate on them, were Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D and his predecessor, Sergeant Fury and his Howling Commandos.",
        "But I think if we had stayed with them, they would have been as big as Spider-Man and the others.",
        "And now, Nick Fury is going to become rather important in the Marvel movies to come.",
        "And Nick Fury - Jim Steranko, an artist named Jim Steranko did the Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D's\"\" stories, and they were - I thought they were terrific.",
        "Steranko was one of the real brilliant people in our business.",
        "And I might add, he and I are working on a project right now after all those years.",
        "Interesting.",
        "You have - thanks very much for the call, Matthew.",
        "You have worked, over the years, with so many people.",
        "And I guess it's inevitable in any business, we hear about, you know, feuds and who's not talking to whom.",
        "Any regrets over the years of, you know, some of the fights that you've gotten into and never got out of?",
        "Well, there were no fights that I get into that I never get out of.",
        "I mean, there was a little problem with Jack Kirby at one time, but through the end we were very friendly.",

        "He doesn't do interviews and so forth.",

        "We say we were from the Yale Daily News and were doing a story.",
        "We were fakers.",

        "So we - see, we really were Yalies - just Yalie fans, not reporters.",
        "Thanks again.",
        "The story has gotten us a lot of mileage over these 40 years.",

        "You're very welcome.",
        "Brian(ph) is on the line calling from Grand Rapids.",
        "Good afternoon, Neal, and its a pleasure to talk to Mr. Lee.",
        "The question is, of all the characters you've made through the years, have they matured the way you wanted them to.",
        "And if they haven't, do you have any examples?",
        "No, not really.",
        "I never wanted them to mature any way at all.",
        "When I was writing them, I had total control of them and they matured - if you want to use that word - the way I wanted them to.",
        "But I realized the minute you stop writing a series and other writers take over, they've got to do it their way.",
        "I know, if I took over a series that someone else started, I wouldnt want to just exactly duplicate what he had done because every creative person wants to put his own imprimatur on whatever he's doing."
