        "He's reported on Africa's wars, its bad governments and its trouble with farming.",
        "Now here's another factor as he continues his series this week: disease - malaria, cholera, polio, and HIV, the disease that is ravaging the country where Jason begins.",
        "Swaziland is a tiny kingdom of just a million people squeezed between South Africa and Mozambique.",
        "It's also the country with the highest HIV rate in the world.",
        "At some prenatal clinics, more than half the women are HIV-positive.",
        "Nationwide about 33 percent of adults are infected with the virus.",
        "Even before the AIDS pandemic, Swaziland was in the ranks of the world's least-developed countries.",

        "I was sick.",
        "Then I just - and they say that I've got TB.",
        "Then later, they told me that I'm HIV positive.",
        "Polatwana moved back in with her mother in a cluster of ramshackle buildings in the dusty low veldt of southwest Swaziland.",
        "HIV, she says, has devastated her homestead.",
        "In the last five years her father passed away after a long illness, two of her siblings died of AIDS, and Pindile's become so sick she can no longer work.",
        "The disease is making me very poor because my fifth sister died and my second brother was working as a teacher, so he - now no one is working, so that's why we're become very poor.",
        "AIDS wipes out some of the most productive members of society, in the prime of their lives.",
        "Pindile's siblings who died were the most educated members of her family, and they both passed away at the age of 32.",
        "Pindile's family now relies on relief supplies from the World Food Program to survive.",
        "The U.N.",
        "estimates two million Africans die each year of AIDS and 24 million people on the continent are infected with HIV.",
        "But HIV isn't the only health problem plaguing Africa.",
        "This is the landmass that spawned Ebola and the Marburg virus, sleeping sickness, river blindness, yellow fever, cholera, bilharzia, tick bite fever.",
        "Diseases unheard of in the developed world are all too common in Africa.",
        "Polio is making a comeback here after being on the verge of being wiped off the globe.",

        "These malaria parasites have developed a resistance to drugs.",
        "We are now actually seeing that the best way of managing this issue is to prevent it in terms of sleeping under mosquito nets, and also, you know, not getting mosquitoes from the environment, which is very difficult.",
        "Geographically malaria is endemic in most of Africa.",
