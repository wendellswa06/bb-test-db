        "Oh.",
        "...And that he regularly and openly complained about him to White House aides.",
        "One...",
        "Interesting 'cause he's had a lot of praise for McGahn in the last 24 hours or so.",
        "Indeed he has.",
        "And one likely source of tension for them is that McGahn as the White House counsel serves the presidency, not the president.",
        "And so that created friction points when the president would want something and McGahn would have to tell him, no.",
        "I mean McGahn, also - this comes at - the timing's interesting - right?",
        "- because it was recently revealed that he gave hours and hours - 30 hours of interviews to the special counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating any Trump campaign ties to Russia.",
        "Do we know if that - those - that information that he gave the special counsel - does that have anything to do with his departure?",

        "And there are dozens of additional nominations pending, and McGahn gets credit for that.",
        "He really shepherded these through and set up sort of a clearinghouse for nominees, fielding suggestions from lawyers and politicians and conservative advocacy groups like the Federalist Society.",
        "So the question now - who replaces McGahn?",
        "Well, and the answer is we don't know for sure, but it looks likely to be Emmet Flood.",
