        "As you said, the media didn't put a cleeg light on poverty, and frankly, I didn't see politicians in lockstep marching against poverty at the time.",
        "I still haven't seen politicians marching against poverty, but I think what has happened is that we had really forgotten what issues and what strategies actually reduce poverty.",
        "For example, universal healthcare.",
        "When you look at social security and how that has reduced poverty among senior citizens, especially among women, when you look at the fact that we have not increased the minimum wage, and of course I support an increase in the minimum wage but also a living wage, when you look at those issues that we can't votes for in Congress just at the national level, I think you'll see that it's an uphill battle and that elected officials don't see these strategies and these public policies as being policies that really could eradicate or reduce poverty.",
        "And so it's become, I think, an issue that hasn't been really a priority, because no one really can come to grips with the fact that this is the wealthiest and most powerful country in the world, and yet we have 37 million people living in poverty.",

        "So, that being said, how much do you believe the idea of really trying to tout this will assist in moving your colleagues to vote for some of the bills that you've put forth in a very hotly contested election season?",

        "Well, the lobbying effort may not be what the lobbying effort is for the energy companies and the oil companies and the huge moneyed special interests, but I must tell you, the faith community, community groups, the NAACP, there's a coalition building throughout this country.",

        "Well, first of all, of course, the Republicans control the House, the Senate, and the White House, but what we did, is, when I introduced these bills, I wanted to begin to debate and to focus on what these issues are in terms of poverty and why we needed to address it.",
        "The first bill that I introduced really was a bill that required the President just to develop a plan to eliminate poverty by 2010.",
        "This bill was also included in the Congressional Black Caucus's Katrina response bill.",

        "You have to have a vision.",
        "You can't just say because the votes aren't there in this very conservative Congress, we're going to allow this debate to not be real, to not surface, and that we won't hold elected officials accountable.",

        "Let me play that side of the aisle.",
        "Let me play that side of the aisle who will suggest that yes, we're cutting the very programs that you're talking about, but we all have to tighten our belts based on a post-9-11 society, the fact that we're in Iraq, the fact that we're having to shore up all that is around us in this new world.",

        "We have a military budget that's excessive, developing weapon systems that are not for this era, but more for the cold war era that has ended.",
        "And so there are resources in our federal budget that need to be reprioritized, and I believe this debate is going to begin to insist that that happens.",
