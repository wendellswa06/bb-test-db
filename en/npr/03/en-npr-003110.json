        "So just to be clear we're not seeing some kind of evolution of President Trump's personal views on abortion, right?",
        "We're seeing tactics on how to get a Supreme Court nominee through.",
        "That is right.",
        "The word evolution would be appropriate here.",
        "You remember that when he switched from many years of support for abortion rights to total opposition as a candidate for the Republican nomination...",
        "Right.",
        "...President Trump back then said his views had evolved.",
        "But that does not appear to be what's happening here.",
        "You're right to speak of it his tactics.",
        "The strategy that they're serving is to unite all flavors of republicanism and get to at least 50 votes and confirm a nominee to the Supreme Court.",
        "Remember, they took away the filibuster option last year...",
        "Right.",
        "...For Supreme Court nominees.",
        "So 50 would be enough to confirm whomever the president nominates.",
        "But everyone knows that President Trump is picking from a list that was compiled by conservative organizations - organizations that very deliberately chose people they think would want to overturn Roe v.",
        "Wade.",
        "So why is he tiptoeing?",
        "Why the delicate theater here?",
        "Because there are two senators who are Republicans, who are women in the Senate, who have been supporters of abortion rights in the past and are worried about seeing Roe vs. Wade overturned.",
        "Now, that's Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.",
        "So they are the audience of two for what the president is doing with this particular kind of tactic, even though, at the same time, the president is counting on support from the rest of the Senate Republicans, the overwhelming number of whom, of course, are opponents of abortion rights.",
        "Susan Collins of Maine seemed to give a nod to the precarious politics.",
        "I mean, just last weekend, she said that she would not vote for any nominee with a demonstrated hostility to Roe v.",
        "Wade.",
        "That sounds like she's threading the needle, too, doesn't it?",
        "Yes, and perhaps sending a message with respect to a couple of the people on the list.",
        "There is one William Pryor, who is currently an appellate court judge for the 11th Circuit, who in the past has called Roe v.",
        "Wade the worst abomination in constitutional history.",
        "You could interpret that as hostility.",
        "So if that particular person were to be nominated by the president, he would be apparently willing to sacrifice the vote of Susan Collins."

        "OK.",
        "So there is the politics of the individual senators to consider as we head towards the confirmation battle.",
        "But then there's also the politics of voters at large as we head into midterm elections this year.",
        "A majority of Americans do not want to see Roe v.",
        "Wade overturned.",
        "This is an election where we're seeing a lot of energy among female voters, female candidates.",
        "Could a Supreme Court nominee whom conservatives fall in love with backfire in this election?",
        "We have seen something like that before.",
        "In 1992, a record number of women were elected to the Senate, particularly Democratic women.",
        "And that was right after the confirmation of Clarence Thomas and his controversial confirmation hearings, where he was challenged on a - what we would today call #MeToo basis by Anita Hill, a previous colleague.",
        "That was a highly controversial moment in the history not only of judicial politics in America but sexual politics in America.",
        "We'll have to see if that happens again in the circumstances of 2018 and 2020.",

        "There's the incident in Haditha, which has received a lot of attention: western Iraq, 24 Iraqi's killed there.",
        "And now, we have another incident where there're videotape scenes and interviews with survivors.",
        "That's right.",
        "I've seen the videos and in this case - it involves a village, by the way, called Ishaqi, and it's northwest of Baghdad.",
        "And these pictures, I have to say, are more graphic and disturbing than the scenes from Haditha.",
        "The main difference is that these shots include pictures of dead bodies, both adults and young children."

        "According to the Iraqi's, these are evidence, not just sensationalism, because they do show what appear to be bullet wounds.",
        "But they do not show signs of bodies being crushed by falling debris and that was the military account.",
        "Now, we have to note that this video only shows some of the bodies and there's no way to tell whether the bullet wounds were inflicted in a long-distance firefight, as the military claims, or more directly, as the villagers claim.",
        "But there's certainly evidence to suggest more questions need to be asked; and this is the question the investigators will certainly be trying to clarify: did Americans walk into this building and shoot civilians, as the Iraqi's claim, or was is all conducted from a distance during a firefight?",
        "Why is the U.S.",
        "military asking these questions now, given that they dismissed the allegations when they first surfaced in March?",

        "We're hearing more recognition from ordinary Iraqis when questioned from places like Haditha or Hamadiya have come up.",
        "And it could grow into a point of tension between the new Iraqi government and Washington, as time goes by.",
        "For example, military investigators may want to exhume bodies from Haditha, that's very much against Islamic practice and tradition.",
        "Also Prime Minister Maliki wants the Americans to hand over their files on Haditha.",
        "And, of course, it's not clear that the U.S.",
