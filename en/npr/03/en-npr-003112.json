        "These are prime targets for bombers aren't they?",
        "The Iraqi Police have been the target of a lot of activity but being in downtown and being so close to them also gives us a degree of situational awareness that few Americans in Iraq have.",
        "In a sense we're safer because we know what's going on and we're also more effective because we work so closely with them.",
        "That awareness, that has not saved hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Iraqi Police recruits, Iraqi Police trainers who for all their awareness can't protect themselves from suicide bombers and people who appear seemingly from nowhere.",

        "How do you feel it's going on the local level where you're operating?",
        "You know I think there's probably evidence on both sides of the ledger.",
        "On the one hand, the Iraqi Police face tremendous obstacles with respect to manpower and getting basic equipment like fuel for their vehicles.",
        "But on the other, they still show up to work.",
        "And they patrol a number of their cities and they've developed a viable police force that didn't really exist before the Hussein regime fell.",
        "So I think it's going well but it's still going to take a long time to complete.",
        "I think the other thing and I see this a lot now that I'm home on leave is that the media present an incomplete picture of what's going in Iraq.",
        "You don't get the sense, this week for example, that most of these cities, they have a thriving marketplace.",
        "Or that 99 percent of Iraqis go about their daily business without having the insurgency affect them at all.",
        "The, the media stories that I see only the focus on the conflict."

        "It's been a very powerful experience, but also one that I've enjoyed a lot.",

        "Almost surreal.",
        "Soldiers in Iraq are allowed to take two weeks of leave sometime in the middle of their tour.",
        "And it's a great vacation but its difficult knowing that you have to go back for another six months, or seven months at the end of your two weeks.",
        "And so there's the same sense that I had before the deployment.",
