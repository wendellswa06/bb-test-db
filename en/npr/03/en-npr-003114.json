        "Anyway, as we begin to look ahead towards 2010, that's the first thing - the day after the last elections, well, theres some new polls out that suggest that people are very dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country and the way things are going with their politicians.",
        "Yes, that's true.",
        "And we saw that in the election day last Tuesday when there was seemingly a clear anti-incumbent sentiment.",
        "The Democrats were voted out of office in both the Virginia and New Jersey governorships, even though the Virginia - the incumbent wasn't at stake.",
        "And also, Mike Bloomberg in New York City spent $100 million, which is more than I make in two years at NPR.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And he barely won, 51-46 over William Thompson.",
        "So we saw that around the country that there are a lot of people - nervousness.",
        "But the other reason - other people who should be nervous perhaps are Democrats because there seem to be an indication - you can't only go by the Gallup poll that came out today, but it still was interesting - that showed that independents are moving well - clearly towards the Republican Party.",
        "Back in July, the Democrats had a one-point lead among independents.",
        "Now, the Republicans have a 22-point lead, 52-30.",
        "Gallup is probably more GOPtimistic than other polls.",
        "They chose Democrats.",
        "But in a generic 2010 battle for Congress, Republicans have a four-point lead in the Gallup poll and it's something to watch.",
        "The Pew poll does not show that big a switch.",
        "And, nevertheless, it could be a very interesting time.",
        "Interesting, the Pew poll showed that President Obama's approval ratings are not down.",
        "They're 51 percent - not great, but holding.",
        "Right.",
        "And I think that's why a lot of people say that it's wrong - and I agree with this analysis that it's wrong - to say that last Tuesday's elections were a referendum on President Obama.",
        "I think that's oversimplifying things.",
        "But it didn't - it did show worrying signs for the Democrats.",
        "One other item we should mention: There is going to be a new governor of Connecticut.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Scandal, right.",
        "And - but no Democrat has won that governorship in Connecticut since 1986.",
        "For a blue state, that's a pretty long time.",
        "There's a bunch of Democrats running, including Ned Lamont who defeated Joe Lieberman in the 2006 Senate primary, but then, of course, lost to Lieberman.",
        "But he is among the many Democrats who are hoping to win that seat in 2010.",
        "And many Democrats, of course, also awaiting the president's decision on Afghanistan, which have - could have quite an impact on how they do next time around."

        "That was in the bill.",
        "So the Stupak amendment goes far, far beyond the status quo and, actually, is denying women, denying women to access insurance coverage that covers abortion care with their own money in the exchange.",
        "Right now, in America, about 80, 85 percent of private insurance companies cover abortion care.",
        "So they would lose that if this Stupak amendment eventually prevails.",

        "She needed it passed and there are some pro-life Democrats who said that there's no way I vote for this without a Stupak amendment.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Let's be clear here.",
        "There was a compromise in that original bill in the House.",
