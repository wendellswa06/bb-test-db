        "All right.",
        "David, this is why were not going to get into this conversation.",
        "Thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "This is - people that are going to get into this, it's a very emotional issue.",
        "And, obviously, for NARAL Pro-Choice America, it is the issue.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, and look, I - there are strong emotions on both sides of this.",
        "And, you know, maybe we can agree to disagree.",
        "There are people that are never going to agree on the pro-choice position and we will probably never agree on the anti-choice position.",
        "But, nonetheless - and I think there are some areas that we can agree on.",
        "I believe that contraception should be made available to women in this country.",
        "I believe that we should teach honest sex education.",
        "I think that that's a place where people could agree and while still making sure that abortion is kept safe and legal in this country.",
        "But, nonetheless, yeah, there are - emotions run high.",
        "You have to respect that.",
        "But at the same time, I think what happened this Saturday night in the United States House of Representatives was unacceptable.",
        "And I think their ultimate goal - ultimate goal - it was to basically stop health care reform in this country and overturn abortion coverage in this country.",
        "Ken?",
        "Martha Coakley, who's running for the Senate in Massachusetts, said the other day that if the Stupak language is included in the Senate bill, she wouldve voted against it.",
        "My question is if lets say the final the Senate does its thing and the final language that both the House and Senate have to vote on does not include the Stupak language, its possible that many, or some of the 64 Democrats who voted for Stupak may sit out that vote the final vote.",
        "You know, I dont think we can predict that yet.",
        "I mean, again, weve got a long way to go and I politics is about that step at a time and it is about that strategic move, its like a chessboard.",
        "You make a move and somebody else moves.",
        "I think at the end of the day, if the Stupak language is removed from both bills and we have what was known as the Capps compromise, I think ultimately that will prevail and that the people of this country and those members will vote for health care reform.",
        "Again, because it is the status quo.",
        "It is not going as far as Stupak wanted.",
        "And I think theres good common sense on the Senate side, cooler heads prevail.",
        "And I think that absolutely well find that there is that Capps compromise, maybe a little bit more tweaking.",
        "And folks will find their way to vote for it.",
        "Further up the hill, 61-year-old Ruth Castro is the leader of the group she's camped with.",
        "They've all arranged their tents around an improvised cooking area.",
        "Laundry is drying between some trees, and young kids sit at a table, dipping bread into cups of hot milk thinned with water.",
        "Heres an email we have from Keith in Minneapolis: Im a Democrat.",
        "I think running pro-choice candidates against moderate and conservative Democrats is a terrible idea.",
        "The only thing it would achieve is to guarantee conservative pro-life Republican candidates who are firmly against abortion rights will be elected to replace moderate Democrats."

        "You know, its a very good point.",
        "And look, like I said, Ive been around politics all my life, and we look at the district.",
        "We are not so foolish to go into somewhere and actually take out, in this case what hes arguing, a moderate Democrat and end up with a very, very conservative Republican.",
        "But there are districts that we could win that could have a majority of Democrats, a Democrats going to win that district no matter what, and if I can take out an anti-choice Democrat with a pro-choice Democrat in that district and still hold on to that district.",
        "Those are the kind of politics of pragmatism that were talking about.",
        "And again, sometimes you think you can and maybe you cant.",
        "But well talk about that later.",
        "Lets go next to Raymond.",

        "Happy Veterans Day.",
        "Im a 28-year-old centrist, center-leaning Democrat myself.",
        "And I think doing this could end up being cutting off your nose to spite your face.",
        "It sounds a lot like what the Republicans are doing by marginalizing and literally kicking out their moderate and maybe little more liberal-leaning Republican brother.",
        "You know, yeah, Raymond, again, like I said, this country is a very diverse country.",
        "And people that represent the country from all over - I come from Montana originally - it would have been a pretty red state at one time.",
        "But when I was growing up it was a very, very progressive state.",
        "And the fact of the matter is, is again, were very pragmatic about this.",
        "We will make sure that if we go into a district and challenge a sitting incumbent that anti's choice, you know, were not going to be so foolish to allow an anti-choice Republican independent or a Democrat to retain that seat.",
        "So you know, were not foolish here.",
        "Again, were pragmatic, were strategic.",
        "But my bottom line is these folks, this time around, and some of them were pro-choice, these folks that voted and stood with Stupak, is unacceptable.",
        "And I have consistently said when they stood with Stupak, they stood against women in this country.",
        "And for us, they have to be held accountable.",
        "So in a way this is a this is a luxury its the luxury of having a big enough majority that even if you should lose one or two seats on this issue, its not going to make a difference to who controls Congress, you think.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And again, even though we have a pro-choice - or we have a majority - Democratic majority right now, I think that people of American didnt realize that we did not have a pro-choice majority.",
        "We are still very challenged, as I said.",
        "The people that are right now in Congress, the majority are anti-choice.",
        "And we do have to change that balance here, if we are going to really make womens lives better.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Raymond.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Were talking with Nancy Keenan, president of NARAL Pro-Choice America.",
        "Ken Rudin, our Political Junkie, is with us."

        "And lets take a look that in the last two election cycles NARAL Pro-Choice America ousted - 06, 08 - 44 anti-choice Republicans, 44 anti-choice Republicans that we defeated with pro-choice Democrats in the 06, 08 cycle.",
        "So weve gotten kind of hung up on the primaries here and keeping people accountable, but I am every day working to defeat just as many anti-choice Republicans and independents, if thats the case.",
        "In the Senate, same cycle 06, 08, we picked up nine, nine pro-choice seats in the Senate.",
        "And we so we those were held by anti-choice Republicans.",

        "Nancy, I was just going to say, but of course a lot of pro-choice Republicans like Chris Shays, like Nancy Johnson, also went down to defeat in this anti-Republican tide.",
