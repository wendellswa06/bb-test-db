        "Here is the story as written by The New York Times.",
        "You will recall the president fired the FBI director last May.",
        "In an interview, he then linked the firing to the Russia investigation, and that led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to probe Russia's role in the 2016 election.",
        "Then by June, the president was ready to fire Robert Mueller, too.",
        "He ordered his White House counsel to get it done, but Don McGahn said it was a terrible idea and said he would resign first.",

        "Tell us what we know.",
        "What did President Trump ask and why?",
        "First off, I have to say that NPR has not confirmed this report, but what The Times is saying is that as reports started to surface last summer that Mueller was looking at a potential obstruction of justice case, Trump began to argue internally that the special counsel had possible conflicts of interest.",
        "There were a number of things that that Trump was looking at.",
        "One would be Mueller's one-time membership at a Trump golf course in north Virginia - Northern Virginia.",
        "Reportedly, there was a dispute about fees, and Mueller left the club - also Mueller's connection to a law firm that was representing Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.",
        "And then the third kind of big piece here is that he was arguing that because Trump had interviewed Mueller to possibly replace James Comey...",
        "Right."

        "...That that presented a third possible conflict of interest.",
        "So just to review - he was saying that Robert Mueller couldn't do his job properly because there was a spat over golf club fees and that he once represented or worked for a firm that represented his son-in-law, which would have made him more disposed to being favorable to him, you would think.",
        "And some of this we know.",
        "Some of this was said.",
        "The complaints were made publicly at the time.",
        "What The New York Times has added here is just that the president tried to act on his complaints.",
        "That's right.",
        "A lot of these arguments about possible conflict of interest are things that we have heard from the White House over time.",
        "And so at the center of all this is this question of obstruction of justice.",
        "You say this is when the president really started to wage this personal war against Robert Mueller because Mueller was seizing on how the president had fired James Comey.",
        "That's right.",
        "A lot of this does go back to the question of Comey's firing and our understanding of it in the public.",
        "And the timeline is important here.",
        "Remember, Comey was fired on May 9.",
        "Several days later, word leaked out that Trump had asked Comey to lay off Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.",
        "Right.",
        "Flynn was under FBI investigation.",
        "That helped prompt the appointment of Mueller.",
        "That was on May 17.",
        "Comey then testifies in early June before Congress, provides all these details under oath about interactions that he had with President Trump - the requests for loyalty, requests to have Comey go easy on Flynn.",
        "So by mid-June - mid-June - we're talking three weeks, a month after Mueller was put in the job - there were already questions publicly about possible obstruction of justice.",
        "All right.",
        "Tamara Keith's on the line, too.",
        "What is the White House saying about these reports this morning, Tamara?",
        "So White House lawyer Ty Cobb has said that they are declining to comment out of respect for the office of special counsel and its process.",
        "However, President Trump has commented.",
        "He was walking into the World Economic Forum in Davos this morning, surrounded by a massive scrum of reporters and photographers.",
        "And he was asked about the New York Times report."

        "It's nominally a movement under a leader called Baitullah Mehsud, who have build up into a major organization in the northwest and along the southern border of Afghanistan, who steadily increased their capabilities in terms of arms, cadres, and the ability to exercise intimidation and terrorism in the area.",

        "These are not isolated incidents by unknown characters.",
        "They're part of a political strategy by Pakistani Taliban backed by al-Qaida in order to assure that there is no regime change in Pakistan that is against their interest.",
        "But there was a nexus of other homegrown groups that could have had the same drive to eliminate Bhutto, groups that sprang from Pakistan's dispute with India over Kashmir.",
        "Bhutto cut funding to many of those groups during her time in office.",
        "Pakistan security and intelligence services were linked to those groups, which by extension make some people believe the Pakistani government had something to do with Bhutto's death.",

        "Absolutely.",
