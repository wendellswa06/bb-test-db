        "Well, it doesn't change Robert Mueller's investigation.",
        "This is stuff that Robert Mueller would already know.",

        "Right.",
        "And one other thing to keep in mind from this story is it's an example, as reported by The New York Times, of a presidential staff trying to manage the boss.",
        "And in fairness, it's not the only White House staff ever to try to do this.",
        "But you have Don McGahn saying to the president, I'm not going to do what you want me to do.",
        "And later in the same story, as the president continues getting upset over time, The Times says the president's lawyers tried to keep Mr. Trump calm by assuring him that the investigation was close to ending.",
        "Real quick, Tam - president's going to give an address at Davos.",
