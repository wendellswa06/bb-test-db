        "I think it's interesting in looking at all of these alternate endings, you can almost see my grandfather thinking out these different scenarios.",
        "And he does write about it in the 1948 foreword about how he always thought that the book was a tragic one.",
        "So, I think from the beginning he knew that the book would have a tragic end and probably that Katherine would die.",
        "It does seem a little odd, doesn't it, that he wrote all those endings and then you read in the introduction: I always knew there was only one way for it to end?",
        "And that's, I mean, the beauty of this book.",
        "And in looking at these different endings, you know that there's one end but how is it written.",

        "But I must say that on rereading it, it is extraordinary, and extraordinarily beautiful and very compelling, very emotional.",
        "He does have a very distinctive style.",
        "And it's hard for us even to imagine today really how different it was at the time that these books were being published in the 1920s.",
        "It wasn't the typical style of the day.",
        "And I think his contribution is, especially in terms of his descriptions of war and the brutal realities of war, which he puts in this novel and as well as in \"\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\"\" but also in his journalism, was a real contribution to the writing on war.",
        "Do you remember reading \"\"A Farewell to Arms\"\" for the first time?",

        "In a fiery speech, he said, wherever a Serb is buried, that is Serbian land.",
        "So, the plan was speedily rejected and that prolonged the war for more than two years and it ended with the massacre of 8,000 men and boys at Srebrenica under Mladic's command.",
        "The process of international justice at The Hague has been very slow.",
        "Milosevic's trial was underway for five years when he died.",

        "And I want to express my appreciation for the attention you and your program always showed for international news and for this Balkan saga in particular.",
        "When I was covering the start of the breakup of Yugoslavia, it was you and Wi Sun(ph) that first showed curiosity for events that were really too distant and too complicated for most of the media.",
