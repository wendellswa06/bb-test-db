        "Well, you know, people keep saying it wasn't hacked.",
        "We have no idea whether it was hacked because it's not really clear that Hillary Clinton had the team available to detect a hack.",
        "But beyond that - look, what she did was a violation of records laws.",

        "You get concerned that someone who'd started using her executive power even before she was in the executive - what would she do when she got there?",
        "Immigration - you say that (reading) Trump supporters are not wrong to say that elites of both parties have basically conspired to keep both immigration and trade off the agenda, and nor are they wrong to be annoyed when any opposition to increase immigration or to legalizing people who are here illegally is immediately dismissed as racist.",
        "Do you really want to deny that some of the opposition is racist?",
        "No, but there is a difference between saying some of the people who are opposed to immigration are racist and all of the people who are opposed to immigration are racist.",
        "Realistically, we are going to have an immigration policy.",
        "All we're arguing now is the price.",
        "How many people are we letting in?",
        "But, you know, here's what I'm arguing about here, is that your argument that elites conspire to keep this off the agenda.",
        "But there are many decent people who have tried to advance immigration reform in both political parties.",
        "Why, then, is this this extremist reaction?",
        "That's exactly their point - is that meaningfully, sharply restricting immigration was simply not an agenda item either in the Republican Party because business interests like it and because sort of the suburban professional part of the party likes it, the establishment, or in the Democratic Party because...",
        "...So - but your point here is that you feel that in part, Trump is a reaction to the fact that people feel their reasonable concerns were never heard...",
        "Exactly.",
        "...That they were stifled to the point where they were ready to blow a gasket."

        "Seagull says at Virginia Tech, there was more of a delayed response.",
        "But he says Virginia Tech's collective pride in the school helps people stay connected to each other.",
        "Last week, it came in the form of cheers, even at somber ceremonies.",

        "Seagull says even in an environment where the collective spirit is a source of strength, there also can be pressure to recover from the tragedy collectively.",
        "So he says administrators should remind students and faculty that individuals recover in different ways.",
        "I remember, in the aftermath of Oklahoma City, the lead chaplain for the FBI said: If you don't talk it out, you're going to act it out.",
        "That can be anything from anger to substance abuse or even suicide.",
        "Seagull isn't advising Virginia Tech administrators, but overall, he gives them relatively high marks.",
        "On Friday, graduate school instructors learned how to help returning students.",
        "Sherry Lynch is with the on-campus counseling center.",
        "She told them if students have trouble concentrating because they can't stop thinking about the shootings, it can be helpful to just start writing.",

        "Just let the words flow onto the paper.",
