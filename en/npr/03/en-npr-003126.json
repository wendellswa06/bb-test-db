        "Because you have a young guy heading into his 30s who's haunted by and running from where he's been, but really in no hurry to get where he's learned we're all eventually going.",
        "So I lived my life really ping-ponging between not knowing whether to live for the moment or invest in the future, kind of living my 20s in my 30s, and having, as you mentioned, you know, a certain amount of difficulty in relationships and in life, in general, because of those conflicts.",
        "And it's interesting, some might expect - you are the luckiest man in the world, these incredibly long odds you survived to get over your cancer.",
        "Yet you also write about the rage that you felt for losing so much of your life.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the first book that I wrote, \"\"Time on Fire,\"\" is more about those experiences and about that rage.",
        "Because I really emerged as a guy who was extremely lucky to have survived, but very angry about how much more difficult surviving the supposedly incurable illness was made than I thought it needed to be, in ways that I thought needed to be exposed.",
        "And this is a book about how long it took me to shed a lot of that anger and the feelings of loss.",
        "I mean, I did lose five or six years of my 20s.",
        "I had a lot of catching up to do emotionally, professionally, personally, and those experiences, just like returning from a war, and in fact, kind of like returning from a very covert war that not many people know or see, leave one, or left me, bruised.",
        "And this book is about the long journey, but thankfully the very, very successful journey to break through that, to let go of those feelings, and to find my way to an incredible sense of gratitude and happiness beyond that I really thought I ever would be able to achieve.",
        "Well, let's go back to the misery first.",

        "Please, please.",
        "There's a moment in your book - that first book you mentioned was also a stage play that you wrote and starred in, \"\"One Man Show.\"\" You excoriated Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, the place where you got a lot of your cancer treatment, not because they weren't brilliant doctors.",
        "Because they were abusing you, you thought, not giving you the kind of treatment you needed, letting an IV needle stay in your arm as it was still infected for days, even though it was still infected, and things like that.",
        "Yet at some point in this book you find yourself going back to Memorial Sloan-Kettering and offering to volunteer.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I had really brutal experiences there.",
        "Those cultures are very difficult to survive, in addition to the difficulty of the illnesses.",
        "I mean, I was mismedicated.",
        "I had to go to - on missions on other floors to steal sheets and pillow cases because there weren't enough to go around.",
        "They're very, very difficult cultures to survive.",
        "And like many institutions, they are geared to helping the institution thrive rather than individuals who might be trying to benefit from the institution."

        "And I thought, well, OK, I'm closing the chapter on one part of my life.",

        "And the experience I had was fascinating because the place seemed so much less toxic to me when I reentered it, as many times things do, you know.",
        "And I even saw some of the individuals I'd represented as among the most evil, there in the cafeteria hiding, like I was, you know, like on a - like a surreptitious mission.",
        "And I really started to question whether my experiences in the past had been as accurate - my memories had been as accurate as I thought they were.",
        "And I was encouraged by a nurse there, who I had remained somewhat friendly with, to try to volunteer.",
        "I had told her that I was interested in volunteering and offering something back.",
        "And she said why don't you do it here?",
        "And I thought, well, that's insane.",

        "I told her about the difficulties of my experiences and why I thought that might even help me to be a good volunteer, to talk to patients who are having a hard time of their own.",
        "And I left really feeling reborn and rejuvenated, and walked through Central Park and got home and had a phone message that said I won't be able to interview you further on Friday.",
        "And when I was able to get hold of that volunteer coordinator, I was told there was a lot of controversy about the care that I had received 13 years earlier and that they felt that it wouldn't be a good idea for me to be a volunteer there.",
        "So, yeah, I got rejected.",
        "Rejected as a volunteer.",
        "Not easy.",
        "You know, a lot of the book is about the changes in perspective.",
        "The change of walking back in there and seeing it differently, and then within an hour, the complete flip that happens again of realizing that, oh, maybe, maybe nothing really has changed.",
        "That if you've got constructive criticism, it's not wanted.",
        "You're an enemy as opposed to an ally.",
        "So, that's really a good example of the ways that I try, in the book, to examine perspective, because that flipped around 360 degrees, you know, and got me from every angle within just a few hours time.",
        "And tell us what, I think, has to be the most absurd moment in the book, and this involves a long story about movie rights to your first book, and how it was going to be made into a picture, and your meeting with an agent in California who's trying to persuade you to go along with this, in part by promising that, hey, you know, we also represent some amusement parks and we could make a ride out of this.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "And - well, actually, before we even go to that, in trying to get me on board to sign the rights over, I met with the guy who was the president of the William Morris Agency at the time, with all kinds of fantasies of having my life transformed.",
        "And I was told that they also represented Busch Gardens, and that perhaps they could convince them to create a ride out of my book about my leukemia and how badly I'd suffered from it."

        "And I went through one in '96 for a chronic form of leukemia, and you feel kind of, you know, you feel kind of bad and petty afterwards, a couple years after, when you find yourself in traffic and you're getting angry at regular things just like normal people do.",
        "And it's amazing to go through that process and make it, but you do return to just being a normal person within a few years.",

        "You know, I don't see anything - the clip that was played was from many years ago.",

        "And two, you know, they're not the rules that most people play by, and if you want to have playmates, it's pretty hard to play be a different set of rules then everybody else.",

        "It's what a lot of life is, and the trick of the game, the object of the game, is to splash through the puddles of fun as much as you can when they present themselves and not get too down by the other parts.",
        "It's just something that took me a very long time to find a balance to which is what this book is about.",
        "And Steve, Evan writes in his book that people after this experience expected him to have a, you know, a special relationship with God or something like that, did they ask you about your philosophy all the time?",
        "Shortly after the transplant, some people did.",
        "And I felt like I was falling short because I didn't have any, like, great words of wisdom about, you know, having been through this tremendous experience and, you know, just getting back to average life.",
