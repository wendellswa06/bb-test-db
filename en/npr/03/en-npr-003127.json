        "The 1880s, yeah, thank you.",
        "And I was always like, God, is this guy really talented, and I started trying to pursue a career as an actor at that time, and I kind of gave up.",
        "And now, I'm 42-years-old, and I went back to school last year.",
        "I went to Bennington College in Vermont, and I got a master's degree, and I studied theater there, and I did a play.",
        "And people were like, you're really talented.",
        "But the reason I gave up, and this is kind of really strange, and this is why, when I look at the \"\"Sex and the City\"\" show and I see your character, I'm just always so positively - it gives me this like burst of energy.",
        "I guess the thing is that people always say the reason that I never quite get the big part is because they say, you're very ethnic looking, or he's too Jewish looking.",
        "And I remember back in the \"\"Sex in the City\"\" show, you were in that scene where you gave Charlotte the ring, and I think you were in the synagogue.",
        "And there was a comment back there, someone had said, one of the women, there's only baldies and the uglies left.",
        "And I guess when I look in the mirror, I see this balding and ugly guy, but who's amazingly talented.",
        "Do you have any comments or suggestions for me how to deal with things like that?",
        "And I think there was a compliment in there, but go ahead, Evan.",
        "It's like most of the compliments I get.",
        "They're multi-layered.",
        "You know, you're putting your finger on something that's very valid and very vivid.",
        "And something I even talk about in the book because I talk about the casting of \"\"Sex and the City.\"\" You know, my life, and this book outlines a lot of crazy relationships I've had in my life with very volatile and, I like to think, very beautiful women, and most of my five-foot-seven-inch friends have had many adventures with women, men, whatever they like to have.",
        "But there's a conceit in show business where, you know, I'll never get to play the Hank Moody part, which is the role David Duchovny plays on the show I'm on now, \"\"Californification,\"\" even if my life might have resembled Hank Moody's life more than anyone else's.",
        "So, that's just something that I view with amusement.",
        "I mean, I don't expect to get to play those roles.",
        "If I was casting a role, I wouldn't cast myself.",
        "It's just not what the public expects.",
        "The oddity to me is how the public seems to have accepted for themselves in their own lives those rules, whereas I know plenty of people who are breaking those rules all the time.",
        "And there's guys who seem to think that they can never be with beautiful women because they don't look like a Duchovny or a George Clooney.",
        "In my life, and the lives of my friends, I haven't really known that to be the case.",
        "So, I think what you need to cultivate is a spirit of defiance, and go out there and show them what you're made of, right?",
        "That sounds really good.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "Good luck, Gregory."

        "Thank you, Evan.",
        "And would you tell us a little bit about - this involves a bunch of other stories, but tell us a little bit about how an actor experiences pilot season, a strange period of time every year in Hollywood.",
        "Yeah, well, hopefully, you don't experience it like I did.",
        "One of the pieces in the book is called, \"\"The Two-Month Second Date.\"\" I started dating a woman who lived 12,500 miles away from me, which - I've studied the geography, so it's 57 times farther than the International Space Station.",
        "It's as far away from a person as you can get without leaving Planet Earth.",
        "But we met up in Los Angeles to share an apartment during pilot season, which is a huge influx of actors into Los Angeles to audition for roles in shows that will possibly never be aired, in fact, probably never be aired, and oftentimes are shot two and three times with different casts.",
        "And it's extremely competitive, and it sort of reduces the world of actors to, you know, migrant workers much like grape workers.",
        "And I'm really not even sure whose union is more powerful.",
        "So, we lived there together tempestuously.",
        "Someone from Sydney, Australia, completely out of her element, and me only slightly less out of mine.",
        "Pilot season is rough, and it's very funny to me every year with the strikes and economic crises, the way networks talk about revamping the whole system because it really is from another era.",
        "But most of all, the way it impacts me and actors' lives is that, before you go into the room to audition for the network executives, you have to sign what is called a \"\"test deal,\"\" in which they have the option to hire you for the pilot and for every one of six subsequent seasons before you even get to meet the people that you might be working for.",
        "Sight unseen?",
        "Well, yeah, exactly.",
        "I mean, you've met probably the creator of the show, but before you go in and meet the network executives who are going to decide whether that person gets to hire you or not, the people who are actually going to be deciding your fate, yeah, you have to sign this very thick document that entitles them to the option on your services, and at the end of each season, to either pick you up or drop you.",
        "But what you said about posttraumatic stress is totally, totally true.",
        "True for the caregiver, too.",
        "I mean, I came back to Phoenix from being at the Hutch in Seattle and it took me several months to just realize, you know, what is normal again.",
        "And it was really, really tough.",
        "And the same kind of empathy that you talked about for, you know, the soldiers and infantrymen and you know, I think the caregivers feel that, too.",
        "And we're going to give you..."

        "And it's done to just about everyone, even people who have long, long track records in network television.",
        "I happen to think, you know - I don't know how much trouble I'll get for saying this on the radio - I think they're patently illegal, because what it does is it prohibits you from selling your services to the highest bidder.",
        "You can't apply for two jobs at once.",
        "Once you've signed one test deal, you can't apply for any other TV shows until they've either exercised that option or dropped you.",
        "So, it's one of the many ways that the mega-corporations keep the striving individuals in line.",
        "Yeah, it sounds like baseball, in the old reserve clause, in a lot of ways.",
        "Yeah, pretty similar, actually, yes, except I don't have much of a fastball or curve ball.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Kelly, Kelly calling us from Jacksonville in Florida.",
        "Hi.",
        "Listen, I just want to tell you that I love your character on \"\"Sex in the City,\"\" and I cannot wait to read your book.",
        "I was diagnosed a couple of years ago with ovarian cancer, and I just wanted to, hopefully, find out if part of the message in your book, because I haven't read it yet, was how you stay on normalcy when you were sick on a daily basis, exercise and working and getting up and just, you know, just keep on trucking without kind of letting the cancer take over your life.",
        "And on another note, I wasn't impressed at all, either, with the pain management with Memorial Sloane-Kettering.",
        "You know, this book doesn't deal with the nitty-gritty of the treatment.",
        "This is from years beyond.",
        "The first book, \"\"Time on Fire,\"\" has a lot of that information and stuff that I did, from dancing in my room, to putting notes on the door not to be disturbed, to insisting on the privacy to have sex with my girlfriend when I was, you know, institutionalized for months at a time.",
        "This book is really about the journey away.",
        "You know, it takes place from being cured on, and starts with me getting cast in the Broadway production of \"\"Six Degrees of Separation,\"\" which was my first real, big, comeback thing.",
        "So, the happy part of that is, you know, I know Neal wanted to concentrate on the misery, but it really does find its way to some great beauty and a fantastic marriage and relationship.",
        "And there are efforts for me to get in shape years after the illness, although they don't go too well either.",
        "There's a passage in the book where I talk about trying to run faster around Central Park's reservoir.",
        "There's a running track there, and trying to get myself in shape and realizing that I'm the slowest human being on the track, including the overweight and the elderly.",
        "But I suppose the good news there is, having a 15-month-old daughter, I've learned that I can beat toddlers in foot races.",
        "Well, I'm looking forward to reading the book."

        "Yeah, that was the first date with the woman who turned out to be my wife, and I was completely smitten, knew that this woman had qualities that I hadn't located before, and that I absolutely had, you know, something with really huge potential here, and I had the first experience of my life where women, young women, were calling out from across the avenue, Harry, we love you!",
        "We love you!",
        "And wanting to have their picture taken with me and wondering, was this really the moment to meet the woman that I wanted to settle down with?",
        "Luckily, I had achieved some degree of maturity and restraint by that point in my life, which is not saying much, because I was 41-years-old and realized that I was in the presence of something great.",
        "But that's been sort of the, you know, interesting, existential dilemma of this later part of my life, is having this popularity appear that I would have loved to have had earlier in my life.",
        "At the same time, what I've been searching for my whole life has appeared, which is a real, solid, steady partner that I can really make a comfortable life with, and I mean, I play up the comedy of the conflict, but it's really been a very, very easy trade off.",
        "I'm married to a beautiful biochemist from Bologna, Italy, which is a lot of alliteration, but it's all true.",

        "I mean, I wouldn't have written a book simply for that population or about that.",
        "To me, the experiences that I've had are simply, you know, they simply give a more heightened example of what everyone goes through.",

        "Everyone has to wrestle with the day-to-day issues of life and relationships and the search for love that sometimes can take too long.",
