        "What are your thoughts on an impeachment inquiry - proceed with caution or don't proceed at all?",

        "We do need to go in this direction because I have more information so I'm on board with this.",
        "And we're actually seeing more Democratic members calling for it because their constituents are becoming more aware of what has happened, and they're saying this is what we need for you to do.",
        "So gathering all the information, I think it is smart so we can proceed in a very smart way because this is very different than what we saw under Clinton.",
        "We're living in a different political time.",
        "So they definitely do need to make sure that they are going to do this right if they're going to do it.",

        "If the information is there, absolutely.",
        "Do it.",

        "You think Democrats should put all their efforts into concentrating on 2020 and winning the White House.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think it's OK to have the impeachment inquiry.",
        "I understand why that is something that has to happen - because for all intents and purposes, he is a criminal.",
        "Mueller even said when Congressman Ted Lieu asked him, would he be indicted if he were - would you indict him if he were not president?",

        "However, I do not want it to become a distraction or prioritized over state legislative races, flipping the U.S.",

        "- the House, I'm sorry - the U.S.",
        "House, and then the presidency, and I think in that order.",
        "We have the census coming up and redistricting in 2020.",
        "And if we don't have these state legislative houses on our side with Democrats, then that kills us for the next 10 years.",
        "Also, these - some of these abortion laws that we've seen being rolled back across the country - that is all state legislative chambers.",
        "So I just think - I just don't want it to dominate the conversation going into 2020."

        "Is this a dividing line?",
        "I don't think so because in 2020, like China said, there is so much to focus on.",

        "So while I think it will be a topic of conversation, at the end the day, as Democrats, we know that this has to be about us getting the presidency back, keeping control of Congress, getting ready for redistricting - because we know gerrymandering is just another form of voter suppression that impacts young people, people of color, the elderly.",
        "We do know what our priorities are, and we can keep all the balls in the air at the same time to get done what we need to get done.",
        "I do think, though, that media - because we saw this in the midterms - that the question around Pelosi staying in leadership, will you vote for Pelosi?",
        "So I do think this D.C.-New York type media will ask all of the candidates the question of impeachment.",
        "I just don't think folks on the ground - you know, regular, everyday John and Jane - are as interested as we are (laughter) as politicos.",

        "We as politicos might see it as more crazy, but the fact is, everyday Americans see all of us in D.C.",
        "the same.",
        "And so I think, for the debate, those folks need to, first of all, be relatable, distinguish themselves at someone who understands and can relate to what everyday Americans need.",
        "And then sort of distinguish themselves from the others because a lot of them are talking about the same thing - you know, removing student loan debt, housing, etc. So they really need to start distinguishing themselves."
