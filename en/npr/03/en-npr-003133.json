        "Rather than putting the oil in a pipeline, they are now putting the oil on trucks and railway cars.",
        "And trucks and trains actually use more fossil fuels themselves to get that crude oil to market than a pipeline.",
        "So it sounds like some, like Marcia McNutt, are convinced that it is in some ways an either-or - that if you don't have this pipeline, oil is going to be transported from the tar sands in ways that are maybe even riskier.",
        "I think that there's a misconception out there that somehow rail is already replacing tar sands pipelines, and it isn't.",
        "What we're seeing is that rail and truck are being used for things like oil from the Bakken deposits in North Dakota, but we're really not seeing them yet being used to replace pipelines for tar sands.",
        "She might be thinking more of other sources of oil that are newer types of oil, like oil shale.",
        "If the president allows this project to go forward, will that have an impact on his relationship with the environmental movement?",
        "You know, I actually can't imagine a scenario in which the president allows this project to go forward.",
        "It's clear that this pipeline is not in the national interest, and that's what this comes down to.",
        "But if - I mean, there are people like the editor of Science magazine, who we heard from, there some Democrats, there are some people who talk about really wanting to protect the environment who have still said that this project does not worry them that much and they could see it going forward.",
        "If the president sides with them, which is still an open question, what does that mean for this White House and the environmental movement?",
        "The president really stands at a point right now where he has made very strong commitments to fight climate change, and consistency with those commitments means rejecting Keystone XL.",
        "And so we're confident that he's going to do what's right, you know, for our communities and our health.",
        "Susan, thanks very much for coming in.",

        "Not yet - that's the call today by the Federal Reserve.",
        "Short-term interest rates are going to stay right where they are near zero at least until the Fed meets again next month.",
        "Part of the reason for staying put - questions facing the global economy, especially China's slowdown.",
        "For reaction to the Fed's inaction, we turn to Megan Greene.",
        "She's managing director and chief economist at Manulife Asset Management, and she joins us from Boston.",
        "Welcome to the program once again.",
        "Thanks.",
        "First, what do you think about the Fed leaving the rates untouched?",
        "I think it was absolutely the right call and for two of the reasons that Yellen actually cited.",
        "One was that there seems to be a lot of slack lesson left in the labor market.",
        "And secondly, she's concerned about events happening outside the U.S., and I think that's the right way to look at things.",
        "You mentioned the labor market.",
        "Three years ago, the Fed said it would hold rates near zero until unemployment fell below 6-and-a-half percent.",
        "It's now 5.1 percent.",
        "What makes the Fed so much more cautious than they thought they would be by this time?",
        "Well, technically, the Fed has ticked off one of its two mandates, which is the unemployment side of things.",
        "But it hasn't come anywhere close to achieving its target on the inflation side of its mandate.",
        "That's its second mandate.",
        "Inflation is around 0.2 percent.",
        "That's well below the Fed's target of 2 percent.",
        "And even if you strip out lower oil prices, it's still not quite at 2 percent.",
        "And I think that Yellen is afraid that as the U.S.",
        "dollar continues to get stronger, actually, the U.S.'s biggest import will be deflationary pressures.",
        "And also, you know, Yellen has said that she thinks that oil prices are transitory, but oil prices have been low for quite a while now.",
        "So at what point does transitory become actually the new normal?",
        "And I would say that his reputational capital has declined quite a bit over the course of this year, that when he was nominated, he had a significant amount of bipartisan support.",
        "That has evaporated in the course of the last few months during these hearings.",
        "And I would just also point out, just a few weeks ago, Barr himself was saying in testimony before Congress that we have to stop criminalizing - excuse me - we have to stop using the criminal justice process as a political weapon.",
        "This move on declassification comes after the president has accused the former team at the FBI of having committed treason against him.",
        "And it has to be seen in that context.",
        "I think that there are - there's a warring message.",
        "They say, we want to move on from the scandal - and then they won't let us move on from the scandal."

        "So I think that there's a political problem for them.",
        "And I think that it's something that we should view with a high degree of skepticism on substance.",
        "It also sounds as though you're arguing take the person out of it, take Bill Barr out of it personally.",
        "There's a precedent being set here in terms of the norms of separation of government.",
        "That sounds like it worries you both.",
        "Well, this administration - this president, in particular - doesn't just seem against the historical norms about how a president should interact with the justice system.",
        "He seems to be unaware of the existence of those norms or the reasons they were there in the first place.",
        "And so I think this just fits into that pattern.",
        "And look.",
        "The president could have appointed an independent commission to look into this matter.",
        "Instead, he's issued the directive to his attorney general, who, as Ramesh points out, has significant credibility problems in terms of the way that he disseminated aspects of the Mueller report, misleading the public in that initial letter on what, in fact, the contents of the report were and giving that press conference where he was essentially going to bat for the president.",
        "It also is curious that the president who has wanted, you know, the investigators to be investigated this whole time has made this announcement at the same time that the courts have ruled in favor of congressional Democrats to access, you know, documents relating to his finances and at a time when the White House's efforts to stonewall congressional investigators are essentially being rebuked by the courts.",
        "Let me turn you to the back-and-forth that dominated much of the week.",
        "This is the increasingly hostile back-and-forth between the president and the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi.",
        "Here's a little flavor of what that sounded like.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MONTAGE)",
        "Watched Nancy, and she was all crazy yesterday - with the hands...",

        "Well, I would not say that what's at stake is a robust legislative agenda because I don't think that was really ever in the cards.",

        "As we know, Nancy Pelosi's position all this year has been pretty constant - hold the line, that impeachment would be a waste of time.",
        "We saw some cracks among Democrats, where some are starting to put more pressure on her this week to maybe start thinking about moving toward impeachment proceedings.",
        "Do you see any real movement?",
        "I think the more the White House stonewalls on the subpoenas that have been issued by some of the Democratic chairs in Congress, the more pressure Nancy Pelosi faces to, at a minimum, open up an impeachment inquiry because that would give Congress more powers to access some of those witnesses and documents that they want.",
        "But I think that's part of why you saw her really escalate the rhetoric because she earns a bit of goodwill when she really goes toe-to-toe with the president and can sort of show the caucus that she is, in fact, trying to hold him in line.",
        "But I do think there is a question as to how long she can keep the caucus together, especially when she is on the one hand making the argument that he's unfit to serve and that he is obstructing justice at the same time that she's saying we're just not there yet on impeachment.",
        "Ramesh, I'll give you last word.",
        "If we've learned anything about President Trump, it's that he likes a fight.",
