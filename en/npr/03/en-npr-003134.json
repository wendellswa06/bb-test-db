        "That does not seem to be the case right now.",
        "The Colombian climber Nairo Quintana is kind of nipping at his heels, but Froome has this tremendous power, this tremendous cadence, his style of racing that's really hard to get any time on him - two more hard mountain stages and then the final stage in the Champs-Elysees.",
        "It's going to take a major disaster for Froome to lose this tour.",
        "Now, it does seem that Froome doesn't have to just win this race.",
        "He also has to prove himself in the court of public opinion about whether he's racing clean.",
        "Is there something in particular about his performance that's drawing scrutiny, or is this just overall general distrust and disgust with cycling?",
        "That's true.",
        "That's a good point.",
        "He's almost fighting a battle on two fronts, on the road and then after the stage when he has to answer questions from the media and from social media where there's a whole kind of core group of very vocal people on things like Twitter that are just convinced that Chris Froome cannot do what he does clean.",
        "Part of it is the way he races.",
        "He has this explosive kind of unique style and also just kind of the hangover of the Lance Armstrong doping scandals and really doping scandals that have haunted the sport for almost 20 years."
