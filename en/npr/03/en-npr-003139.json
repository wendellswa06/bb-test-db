        "He ran off about 15 copies at Office Depot, and he called it \"\"The Shack.",
        "Well, one of those copies caught the attention of two California-based pastors.",
        "They brought it to 26 publishers, all of whom rejected the manuscript.",
        "So the pastors set up their own publishing company and printed the book themselves.",
        "They started a whispering campaign among churches, and today, \"\"The Shack\"\" has sold more than 18 million copies.",
        "The story resonated so deep because the book gave people a language to have a conversation about God that was not a religious conversation but a relational conversation.",
        "Paul Young has just released his second novel.",
        "It's called \"\"Crossroads.\"\" And it tells the story of Anthony Spencer.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And from a different point of view, it's also about the question: how does God break in?",
        "If God really is good all the time and is a being who pursues us with relentless affection and yet is not a violator of our ability to choose, how does that God find a way into our resistances?"
