        "How did that compare to the reception that Secretary Gates got today?",
        "Well, you're right, Luke.",
        "Yesterday, senators were talking about the Bush plan as being the most dangerous foreign policy blunder since Vietnam, in the words of Senator Chuck Hagel.",
        "And he's a Republican.",
        "Today, there was more along the nature of polite skepticism.",
        "Senators wanted to know whether - how we're going to know, first of all, whether this plan is working.",
        "And Secretary Gates tried to assure them that we should know within a matter of months and that it wasn't an open-ended commitment.",
        "The only really pointed questions came from Senator Edward Kennedy, Democrat from Massachusetts, who is sponsoring a plan that would call for a cut-off of funding for this troop surge.",
        "Here's what the senator asked.",
        "Why not come back to the Congress?",
        "Why not come back and permit us to have a vote on this surge?",
        "Let the American people speak through their elected representatives to find out whether the American people would be - kind of took the president now two months to make this judgment.",
        "Let us have 10 days to try and make a judgment and a decision whether the American people are behind this.",
        "I guess it pays to be the new guy on the Hill, because Secretary Gates seems to be getting it a little more gently from these guys, and also there were fewer senators who plan to run for president, I guess.",
        "So maybe that's why the rhetoric was toned down a little bit."

        "So you've got most of the Democrats lined up against this idea.",
