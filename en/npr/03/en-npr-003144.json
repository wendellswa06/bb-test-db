        "They're a population that prides themselves on autonomous professions, working for themselves.",
        "So they were farmers back in Gujarat before they came to the U.S.",
        "So they were looking to own their own business.",
        "It didn't have to be motels.",
        "In fact, they knew nothing about motels.",
        "There are very few motels in India.",
        "Someone told me this, that there's more motels in Florida than all of India.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "So we're not talking about something indigenous that they were looking for.",
        "And they fell into the hospitality issue by accident.",
        "And this is at a time in the '40s and '50s when these residential hotels were seen as places that cater to a down-and-out population where there's going to be drugs and alcohol, whatever else going on.",
        "The European-Americans and the Japanese-Americans who ran those hotels were looking to get out.",
        "Japanese-Americans were interned, but even Frenchmen and other European-Americans who had been running them, it's not a lot of money to be made, and their kids didn't want to take them over.",
        "So no one else wanted to buy these.",
        "You write how once immigrants from India establish themselves with, you know, in this, sort of, the motel industry, they began to encourage and help family members come to the U.S.",
        "and do the same.",
        "I mean, as you say, in Gujarat, many people came from farming backgrounds, agricultural backgrounds to a completely different world.",
        "And also, many of these folks were willing to move to very rural places, places that were predominantly white, had probably never really ever met immigrants or people from, certainly from India.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And so what happens is, let's say, I own a motel in Maryland somewhere, and I bring my family in to help run it, all right?",
        "And they're happy to come over because they know that eventually, if not for themselves, at least for their children, they feel there's more opportunities in the U.S.",
        "than there is in India.",
        "And then I come in my - I come and I live inside my relatives' motel in Maryland.",
        "After five, six years, there's a place that opens up in Arizona or Oklahoma or in wherever else, I'll buy that place.",
        "I'm looking for the best deal.",
        "And I would ask people all the time, why would you want to move to, you know, the middle of nowhere someplace?",
        "Sort of move from anyone else you know, there's no other family members.",
        "There's no Indian restaurant around.",
        "There's no temple, there's nothing.",
        "And they'd say, in a sense, I didn't move from India to the U.S., all that way, to then not move under 1,000 miles to get a better deal, to get the motel I came here for.",
        "I want to ask you about the next generations, because you write about - allude to this in the book when you talk about other ethnic groups and immigrant groups - Greek-Americans and diners and Jewish-Americans and the textile industry, Korean-Americans and the convenience stores.",
        "More often than not, their children go on to do other things.",
        "And you write, in the case of motels, very often, the children of the Indian immigrants who were born in America decide to do it themselves, to run motels or to take over the motel."

        "Right.",

        "Wow.",
        "Why am I doing this?",
        "So unlike a lot of the other businesses that you mention, a diner or liquor store or grocery store, the motel industry has multiple levels.",
        "So there's independent places that are relatively inexpensive.",
        "There's franchise - low-level franchise places, and there's mid-level, high-level, even major hotel chains.",
        "So the children who grew up in the motels and go back in the industry, they typically enter at the hotel at a higher level than their parents were.",
        "So they feel like they're stepping up, not doing the same thing their parents did.",
        "They move forward, but they still have the same - all resources, all the knowledge that they can draw from because they're still in the same industry.",
        "So it's the best of both worlds for them.",
        "I'm speaking with Pawan Dhingra.",
        "He's written a new book.",
        "It's called \"\"Life Behind the Lobby.\"\" It tells the story of how Indian immigrants came to dominate the motel industry here in the United States.",
        "Pawan, you write about the issue of discrimination, racial discrimination, and about how, in some cases, you write, motel owners go quite far in trying to hide the fact that they own the hotel.",
        "You describe this idea of whitening the lobby of the hotel.",
        "What's that mean?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It happens - it's not universal, but it does happen.",
        "It's definitely a trend, which is to portray the motel to the customer as not being ethnically touched.",
        "So what they would do is oftentimes hire non-Indian desk clerks to work the afternoon shift when most people check in, people the customer would not look at and have any kind of negative reaction towards.",
        "So many of the motels - the family who runs the motel lives in the motel, and their home, actually, can be connected to the lobby.",
        "So behind the check-in desk of your motel is their apartment.",
        "You don't see it - it's behind a wall - but that's where they live.",
        "They come in through a side door into the lobby from their apartment behind the check-in desk.",
        "And so their kitchens are back there.",
        "And they had to be conscious of what time they cooked their Indian food so that it didn't create the scent of Indian food in the lobby during a time when customers may come in and smell it because that would just put people off."

        "But the local media in Indianapolis are reporting it also.",

        "But is this the kind of thing -and now we're seeing all these cases lined up - are we living in times where we just, Michael, we have to get used to this now?",
        "One of the good things that we have going for us in this country is that we have an excellent reporting system that's in part led by the Centers for Disease Control as well as the state and local health departments in detecting and following up on these cases.",
        "And our Food and Drug Administration and USDA are also very important in this process.",
        "So we have that going for us.",

        "Well in many cases are outbreaks - the true vehicle or source is not always identified.",
        "I think the Centers for Disease Control now has a pretty good lead based on some of their case control studies to link lettuce to this outbreak.",
        "And it's - frankly, lettuce is not a surprising source because we have had several outbreaks in the past associated with fresh lettuce.",

        "Mike Doyle, are there silver bullets, are there tech - you know, I'm looking for the technology solutions to all these problems, this laundry list that Bob was talking about?",
        "Great talking to you.",
        "That's really the difficult question.",
        "The answer is simply because we eat produce fresh.",
        "We like to eat it uncooked and so we don't have the traditional treatment that is applied to many foods before they're consumed, and that is heating, which is very effective in killing these harmful microorganisms.",
        "So we have to come up to come up with alternative approaches.",
        "Chlorinated water is typically used to wash the produce in processing plants, but we now learn that this is not a fully effective treatment for killing harmful bacteria, should they be present.",
        "So we're going to have to do a lot more in terms of developing methods that are truly effective to kill harmful bacteria.",
        "But as Dr. Gravani said, we need to go all the way back to the farm, and make sure that we can do the best we can on the farm, to prevent the contamination from occurring in the first place."
