        "Where would be the best spot on the farm and - to start, that will yield the greatest result?",
        "Well, from my perspective, it's not just one spot.",
        "Irrigation water is an important consideration.",
        "We have to think through where do these harmful bacteria originate.",
        "And for E.Coli 0157, it's largely carried by animals that are what we call ruminants - its include cattle, and goats, and sheep - deer.",
        "So the irrigation water comes off the farm and goes through the droppings and goes to the lettuce, let's say.",
        "Well, droppings somehow get into the irrigation water or get directly onto the soil through fertilizer or some other means.",
        "But somehow, the manure from these animals have to get into the field to cause this degree of contamination.",
        "Bob, do you agree?",
        "I agree totally.",
        "Prevention is the key.",
        "Our mantra in the Good Agriculture Practices Program is, food safety begins on the farm.",
        "And prevention is the strategy, because once these organisms attach, it's extremely difficult to remove them.",
        "We might reduce them by a few log cycles but you're never going to reduce all of them.",
        "And with organisms like E.",

        "So, you know, we've got a question that needs to be answered.",
        "We've talked many times on this program about eating local, instead of having it shipped across the country.",
        "Would eating locally possibly prevent you from getting sick, or is it just a big a risk, eating local?",
        "Well, that certainly has a lot of appeal, and we want to support sustainability and the local agricultural communities.",
        "But clearly, these issues can happen anywhere.",
        "I mean, we see cases were people are on smaller operations maybe using manure or maybe using compost.",
        "So large or small, the issues are the same.",

        "We do all things after it leaves the farm, after it leaves the garden, to protect our population.",

        "Mike?",
        "D.B.: Other than hysteria.",
        "That's a very good question and a very good point.",
        "And part of the reason is, first of all, the irradiation process has to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for specific applications.",
        "But even if it is the product that results after the food has been irradiated has to be desirable.",
        "One wants to eat it.",
        "It has to have good quality characteristics…",
        "D.B.: Much more desirable than canning, for instance?",
        "It makes almost no change to the food - much less than canning, much less than curing.",

        "Yeah, that's certainly part of it.",
        "I think some of that stigma has been removed by the fact that we have had irradiated ground beef on the market for quite a while, and then off for a little while, back on again.",
        "And those products seem to be selling very well with consumers who may want to have their ground beef cooked to a, let's say, a less intense temperature than what we would normally recommend if it were not irradiated.",
        "I think Mike is absolutely right…",
        "D.B.: All the hysteria about e-coli and other bacteria - that's not the only one, but e-coli gets much PR.",
        "Hang on, D.B.",
        "We're going to get an answer.",
        "Why don't we use more irradiation then?",
        "Because, first of all, I think we need to look at the capacity and get geared up if we're going to do that.",
        "And as Mike said earlier, each of these commodities have to go through an approval process.",
        "And I'm not sure, right now, what the quality issues are regarding, let's say, leafy greens in the irradiation process.",
        "I know they have lots of work going on in the USDA labs in Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania - on sprouts and a number of other leafy green commodities.",
        "And we would need to look at that, plus the cost factor, plus - do we have the capacity to, if it was approved, to irradiate this many pounds of, let's say, leafy greens.",

        "Hi, Kaye.",
        "Well, whatever additional processing treatments are applied will indeed add costs.",
        "But, you know, the meat industry has gone through major changes over the last decade, and have applied additional treatments that have not greatly increased the cost of ground beef and chicken.",
        "And so we can come up with treatments that are effective.",
        "I think that will work.",
        "But to your point about, hey, what's going wrong here?",
        "There's a variety of reasons that we're seeing more and more contamination.",
        "And produce in particular is a concern because we normally do not give it a heat treatment before we eat it.",
        "And so as we eat it fresh, we're at the mercy of the farmer in producing a safe product.",

        "That's a possibility.",
        "One of the things that's sort of a mantra is that you can't inspect-in quality or safety.",
        "You've got to really build it in.",
        "And the way to do that is to look at all those aspects that we talked about earlier: the potential sources and sites of contamination, and go back and tighten those up so you can reduce the likelihood that these passages are going to get from their reservoir to the crop."
