        "Well, you have to be very careful.",
        "You really need to assume that the chicken that you buy is contaminated, since eight out of ten packages that we tested had these disease-causing bacteria on them.",
        "Were you shocked at how much it almost doubled in three years?",
        "We were quite surprised.",
        "The most of the problem is due to the campylobacter bacteria, which is the one that's gotten very much worse.",
        "The salmonella had stayed about the same since our previous tests.",
        "But these were the worst results yet, since we started testing chicken in 1998.",
        "You know, the U.S.",
        "Department of Agriculture spokesman called the report junk science - criticized your methods.",
        "How do you respond to that?",
        "Well, I think this may have a defensive reaction on their part, because one of the things that we've called for is for USDA to do testing for campylobacter and to establish a standard for it.",
        "I think they maybe don't want to believe that there's a problem there.",
        "But we have a statistics department here that designs our testing.",
        "It's thoroughly designed to be a random sample and we have full confidence that our results are valid.",
        "Well, considering that they don't test at all for campylobacter, you're 500, they're zero - sample size.",
        "Yes.",
        "And in addition, our results agree with their results on salmonella where they do their own testing.",
        "It's only on campylobacter, where they have no testing, that they seem to think that there's something wrong with our methodology.",
        "Other studies have found a much lower incidence of contamination, around 25 percent.",
        "Why is that?",
        "Well, that's really only one study that found such a low level.",
        "Most other studies have found higher levels.",
        "For instance, some FDA testing in 2004 found 60 percent contamination.",
        "This particular study that found the 25 percent, looked only at chicken taken from processing facilities who volunteered to be in the study.",
        "So it's possible that it was the better facilities who volunteered.",
        "And also, if you know that the test is in progress, you really may put your best foot forward on that day."

        "Yeah.",
        "We're familiar with your testing methods.",
        "How does the chicken get contaminated and in such high quantity?",
        "Well, it can happen at any step in the process.",
        "And so the control methods, while they're not rocket science, they really require a lot of vigilance.",
        "It starts right at the chicken coop, where bacteria can come in with water or with food or with the workers going in and out.",
        "They have to be very careful there.",
        "And once in the chicken coop, it can spread rapidly among the chickens.",
        "And we have chickens being raised in mass production facilities where there's 20 or 30 thousand of them together.",
        "So it's doubly important to be very careful about the situation there.",
        "The other big place that contamination can occur is at the processing facility, because these bugs tend to occur in the digestive tract of the bird.",
        "So when they're slaughtered, there's the chance that fecal matter can get onto the chicken and even get spread around in the washing process.",
        "So that must also be handled be very carefully.",
        "Oh, I found that a very interesting observation you made about cleaning up and preparing - when people do this in their kitchen, let's say, and the people think they are doing something the right way and they're doing it exactly the wrong way - in that when they try to clean up an area with a sponge, they're actually spreading the bacteria around.",
        "Well, the best thing to do is to - well, you have to be careful all the way along.",
        "Make sure the chicken doesn't drip on the other things in the refrigerator and that you use a separate cutting board and knife for it, and then just put that in the sink and wash it right away.",
        "And make sure, when your chicken is cooked - and it must be thoroughly cooked, no pink parts - that when it's - when you are done cooking it, make sure you don't put it back on the plate that it came off of."

        "And I think one of the - if I were to design the study that was done by Consumer Union, would be that they would enumerate - determine how many cell numbers of campylobacter are present.",
        "And the data show that there has been a tremendous reduction in the number of campylobacter that are present on the chickens, which fits with what we call the infectious dose - how many does it take to cause illness.",
        "And so, there has been positive strides in the industry.",
        "Maybe the prevalence - there's still a large number of chickens contaminated - but not with the levels that would be needed to cause human illness."

        "And we think there should be some attention given to whether it can be reduced or even eliminated in cows, so that it's not - we're not having the problems of - problems with a pasture next to a field and the field becoming contaminated.",
        "Actually, the number as we even - as we speak has gone up to 250 people in the Indianapolis.",

        "But there are promising treatments, such as vaccines, and feeding friendly bacteria that will out-compete the E.coli, and, perhaps, even certain feeding practices, may be affective.",
        "So, we're learning more about it but we don't have a silver bullet yet.",
        "But I can tell you, that producers are looking at this very seriously, and also processors have done a lot of research to learn that contamination of the hide with manure is a very important way in which the E.coli 0157 gets on to the meat during processing.",
        "And so, they are taking gigantic steps in trying to remove E.coli from the surface or the hide before the animal gets into the processing plant.",
        "And that's having major impact.",
        "Over the last few years, we have seen major reductions in the incidence of human illness caused by E.coli 0157.",
        "And also, we have seen major reductions in the occurrence of 0157 in ground beef.",
        "So the beef industry is making great strides in fixing this problem, not entirely, but doing a great job minimizing it.",
        "The produce industry on the other hand, as we're seeing, has a problem."
