        "But how do they know it's cooked thoroughly?",
        "They really need to use an accurate thermometer to check for doneness, to make sure that it isn't pink inside.",

        "But it can go back one step farther.",
        "When you're buying chicken at the supermarket put it in a plastic bag so that the juices don't drip on other products that are put in the same grocery sack with the chicken.",
        "It's almost like you have to have a special processing area for the chicken itself, do the chicken.",
        "It's like being in a laboratory or in a hospital, you know.",

        "I'd like to make one other point in terms of the 0157 discussion, and the caller has suggested irradiation as a solution.",
        "You know Consumer Reports, a couple of years ago, did some tests on irradiated burger, and unfortunately, we found two things.",
        "One was our sensory panelists compared its taste to burnt hair.",
        "They found it less appealing in taste than the untreated burger.",
        "And the other thing was that even the radiation didn't completely eradicate bacteria in the meat, so we still advise people to cook their burgers, especially if they are immune compromised."
