        "That's opposition leader Alexei Navalny.",
        "On Monday, Navalny's registration to run for president was denied.",
        "And now his latest YouTube video appears to be blocked.",

        "Hi, Lucian.",

        "Well, Alexei Navalny is a lawyer and an anti-corruption activist.",
        "And what's interesting about him is he probably wouldn't exist without the Internet.",
        "He has really successfully harnessed the Internet to bypass state media.",
        "Now he has several YouTube channels, and he has used them very effectively to talk to his supporters, to build a nationwide campaign network and also to collect donations.",
        "Now as to the question if he's a threat, even independent opinion polls give him a pretty low ranking.",
        "One recent poll showed that 60 percent of Russians trust Putin, and only 2 percent say that about Navalny.",
        "And just, you know, anecdotally, I've met young Russians who haven't even heard of him and others, even who are quite liberal in their views, say they would never vote for him.",
        "I think the reason is because - not necessarily because they love Putin but because they really are afraid of whatever comes after him.",
        "Well, is the Kremlin worried at all about Navalny?",
        "And I guess another part of that question is - if they're not worried and if they look at these poll numbers and a lot of Russians don't know Navalny and don't seem to like him all that much on a big scale - why not just let him run?",
        "Couldn't this backfire if they kick him out of the race and let him draw more attention?",
        "Well (laughter) - as always, it's really hard to know what they're thinking in the Kremlin.",
        "What's interesting is they actually did let Navalny run for Moscow mayor back in 2013.",
        "And he surprised everyone by getting almost a third of the vote.",
        "The system here in Russia is called managed democracy.",
        "And Navalny is definitely not manageable.",
        "So you know, if they let him run, they allow a certain element of unpredictability.",
        "And they also give him some legitimacy as a real politician.",
        "So I think in the Kremlin, they'd prefer to have an election without any serious challengers.",
        "OK.",
        "So as you said, his real political power is through social media.",
        "What has happened to this YouTube video?",
        "Well, as you mentioned - I mean, he's been denied registration because of a conviction, which Navalny says is trumped up.",
        "And yesterday, he put out a YouTube video.",
        "I think we have some of that.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF YOUTUBE VIDEO)",
        "(Speaking Russian).",
        "So what he's saying is that everyone who believes he should be allowed to run should boycott the March election and attend nationwide rallies on January 28.",
        "Now, interestingly enough, this YouTube video is unavailable.",
        "And we're still not exactly sure why, on whose initiative.",
        "But Navalny, true to form, has already defiantly tweeted.",
        "He tweeted - the video is blocked, but you know what to do.",
        "So yeah, it looks like he's really heading for a clash with the authorities in the coming year."

        "And your stock and trade would be to probably ridicule this very situation.",
        "What might you have said?",
        "Well, I would have probably said that the Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf declared an emergency in Pakistan, but it's not known what the president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, thinks about this.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "…you know, sort of play on the fact that, you know, he's go these two roles, and he's one person.",
        "Because the interesting thing in Pakistan was the announcement of the emergency came from the chief the of army staff in Pakistan, and the person to address the nation would the president of Pakistan.",
        "So it was irony right there in itself in terms of official announcement.",
        "What is on the air?",
        "How much information are people there getting about what's happening?",

        "How much of a surprise was this declaration of emergency rule by Musharraf?",
        "It was a significant surprise because this move was considered three, four months ago, also, and there was pressure from the U.S., the West, not to go for this particular proclamation.",
        "But in Pakistan, quite honestly, people are extremely disappointed with the United States.",
