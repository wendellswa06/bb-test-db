        "Well, we learned from the neighbors that he had been taken from our home by a group of military people that put him in the back of a truck and took him into the national stadium.",
        "We - the case which was filed in the year 2000 after Pinochet was returned from house arrest - 18 months of it in London - we learned that - well, the investigation has been ongoing - but they have found out more information about who was involved in taking Charles to the national stadium.",
        "We learned, finally - Charlie's father came down to look for Charlie with me - bravely came into the midst of this coup - violent coup - and we learned after a few weeks of really trying everything, we learned from the Ford Foundation, not from our American officials, that Charles had been executed in the stadium.",
        "And you have - I know since then you have done more investigating.",
        "Six years ago President Clinton released some classified documents that suggest U.S.",
        "intelligence officers may have had links to the death of your husband.",
        "Have you uncovered any definitive evidence of that?",
        "The case that's being investigated is being investigated in Chile right now.",
        "When we came back, we actually did do a wrongful death suit against Kissinger, and we didn't get too far because most of those documents were classified and information was blacked out.",
        "And it wasn't until Clinton's declassification that we saw that the State Department did think that the intelligence agencies probably did have some role in Charles's death.",
        "And we haven't - we have just been in the case because the case against Kissinger was dismissed without prejudice in the late 70s.",
        "We have just had this case in Chile, where the judge is investigating on the ground there in Chile.",
        "And that, we hope, is going to come into court in March or April.",
        "Even though Pinochet has passed on, his crimes are still being investigated.",
        "So do you have a feel that justice will be served eventually, then?",
        "We're hearing some people saying justice - he escaped justice with his death.",
        "Well, Pinochet may have escaped going to jail, but he didn't escape the knowledge, the global knowledge, of his crimes.",
        "His 18 months in London under house arrest, and the investigations that were going on there and the treatment of sovereign immunity, was a very important step forward for all of victims of this kind of dictatorship.",

        "I sense that a great opportunity has been lost to bring this man to justice.",
        "So as much as I would like to celebrate and to join the many people in Chile who are celebrating, I feel that he did escape justice.",
        "His image didn't, though, and that's small consolation.",
        "Yeah, that was the point that I think we just heard Joyce Horman make, if you were listening, that there's a lot of information now about what happened under the Pinochet regime and people around the world know about it.",
        "And I'm assuming, Roberto - you didn't mention it - but I'm assuming that you are from Chile.",
        "And did you live in Chile at that time?",
        "I was living in Chile at the time of the coup.",
        "I lived there until 1979.",

        "Well, you know, my own - I was very young at the time of the Allende years.",
        "I had some time to experience the kind of exhilaration and the promise of the time.",
        "Chile was a very polarized society at that time, but the Allende revolution promised to change things in a very positive way, I thought at the time.",
        "So I was just beginning to find my own political ideas when the time of the coup came and sort of cut that short.",
        "And so all that great hope of change in Chile was cut short and replaced by some very dark years indeed.",

        "Thanks so much for calling in.",

        "Bye-bye.",

        "He was the Director of Latin American Affairs for the National Security Council from 1981 to 1983.",
        "He also interviewed Pinochet in 1987 for the Washington Times, and he is with us now in Studio 3A.",

        "Glad to be here.",
        "You have been hearing a great deal about the abuses of the Pinochet regime, yet you might argue that were also - some good also came out of it.",
        "Well, there was some good that came out of it.",
        "One was, eventually, the reconstruction of the Chilean economy.",
        "Not so much Pinochet's legacy but his willingness to allow people who knew what they were doing to take over and rebuild the Chilean economy.",
        "The general didn't know anything about economics, knew he didn't know anything about economics, and let the younger crowd - civilians - reconstruct the economy.",
        "The second thing he did was, although that probably wasn't his initial intention, was to set up a national referendum on his rule.",
        "The election was in 1989.",
        "If he lost it he promised to step down from power.",
        "He lost it and he did.",
        "Now, we were talking earlier with Tom Gjelten about the world at that time, embroiled in the Cold War, and obviously, that's the mindset that Augusto Pinochet came from.",
        "It certainly was.",
        "When you talk about Salvador Allende Ayunday, for example, he's an interesting man.",
        "He was a socialist but he was very radical.",
        "He was also close friends, it's been pointed out, to Fidel Castro.",
        "He was actually to the left of the Chilean Communist Party.",
        "The Chilean Communist Party's friends were in the Soviet Union and they were much more cautious about this, although not any more democratic than Allende turned out to be.",
        "The years were polarized.",
        "They were very difficult.",
        "The United States saw Allende as potential real trouble and did things, I think in retrospect, were a big mistake - let the Chileans work it out.",
        "We didn't do that anymore than we've done in other places in the world.",
        "And the result is we've paid for it and should to some degree pay for it.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Being involved in something we shouldn't have been involved in.",
        "Now, you interviewed Augusto Pinochet in 1987, I understand.",
        "Did he, at that time, acknowledge at all, the abuses of his government?",
        "Did you ask him about that?",
        "I certainly did ask him about it, and he - well, the short answer is no. The second thing I asked him was - and this is where I thought the interview would end.",
        "I said: Look, you're talking about having a national referendum, you're talking about it being open and honest, and if you lose, you'll actually step down from power.",
        "And I said, you know, a lot of people in Chile, including some of your supporters - who don't believe that.",
        "They just don't believe that.",
        "You're somehow going to worm your way out of the whole thing.",
        "And he got, I thought, very angry and he stood up and he - I thought the interview was over.",
        "But he went over to a bureau drawer, pulled out a big roll of something or other, got up showed it to me, and it was all the legislation decrees they were passing to set up this referendum.",
        "I said well, that looks great, but in fact, are you going to step down if you lose the referendum?",
        "He said absolutely I will - which is what I wrote.",
        "And of course it was in the Chilean newspapers for two weeks, and I think maybe - I'm not sure - I think maybe he boxed himself in with that and he did step down.",
        "But after all, he made a promise.",
        "He's a general.",
        "He's got to do what he says he'll do.",
        "Let me ask you, Tom Gjelten.",
        "NPR's Tom Gjelten is still with us here in Studio 3A as well.",
        "Tom, just not long ago on his 91st birthday, apparently Augusto Pinochet said that he took political responsibility - I think that was how he phrased it - for what happened.",
        "Yeah, but who knows that that means.",
        "I mean, that's a very vague phrase.",
        "Pinochet did step down from power in 1990, after the elections of 1989 in which he, of course, he and his people lost and there was a new Christian democratic government that came into power.",
        "He did however continue to be commander in chief of the Chilean armed forces.",
        "And he used that position as the military chief in Chile, which of course at that point in the immediate aftermath of 17 years of military rule he was still in a very powerful position.",
        "He basically used that position to shield himself and his allies from any prosecution and from being held accountable.",
        "I mean he never acknowledged having been responsible for human rights abuses in any sort of significant way.",
        "And the fact that he did it, you know, at the age of 91 - or took political responsibility for what had happened during his regime - at the age of 91 is, you know, is not a really impressive point, I would have to say."

        "Hi.",
        "I just want to make a quick comment about this supposed economical miracle that Pinochet brought to the country.",
        "I just wanted to say that mainly the people who benefited from his economic changes were the people in upper middle classes, and it was in fact after the democratic governments came back to the country - they are the ones who implemented the changes so everybody in the society will be benefiting from all of these economic changes - and they're still doing that.",
        "And very briefly, also, someone made the comment in which Pinochet accepted the referendum.",

        "I think Tom raises an interesting question.",
        "At 91 he accepts political responsibility.",
        "Two years later he was supposedly so sick and so unable to respond to anything that he had - when he was in Britain - that he wasn't fit for trial or anything like this.",

        "What were you surprised to learn of the millions of dollars that he had stashed away around the world?",
        "And he did lose many of those who had been supporting him for a long time as a result of that.",
        "That's right.",
        "In Chile - this is not done - Chile is a country, comparatively in the world, in Latin America, where corruption is taken very seriously.",
        "And the rule of law is taken seriously.",
        "So for a guy who is at the top, who had the opportunity to do so, to do so was something that nobody would support.",
        "Was I surprised?",
        "Yeah, I was, I think.",
        "I shouldn't have been.",
        "You know, Lynn, 45 percent of the Chilean people voted to continue Pinochet in office, in 1988, in that plebiscite.",
        "So as of 1988 he had the support of 45 percent of Chileans.",
        "But by now, by the time he died, that support was far, far less.",
        "The great majority of Chileans have turned against him in the subsequent years.",
        "And I think that this, as Roger pointed out, the revelations about his personal corruption really solidified the sort of the negative judgment on him in Chile.",
        "That's one reason.",
        "The other reason is, people back in '89 were still thinking about the years of Allende, the really bad years.",
        "And that they would say, Pinochet isn't very good and he's committed a lot of bad things, but at least we have some kind of stability.",
        "Since - and they didn't know about the future - since Allende, we've had democratically elected governments, we've had stability and we've had a both economic and social progress.",
        "So it's no wonder that Pinochet's reputation approval rating is down near zero."
