        "Yes.",
        "Well, you mean Pinochet?",
        "Yes, and the events that occurred in the 70s and 80s in Chile.",
        "Very strong feelings about them, still, you have.",
        "Well, yes, yes, because I could see from my window the fire coming out from La Manila, and I heard the bombings.",
        "And those things are in my hard disk.",
        "And then the rasping voice of Pinochet, that horrible voice he had, telling us that he was in charge of everything.",
        "And the horrible comments he did about Allende.",
        "Because he tried to put him in a plane.",
        "And he said, and the plane falls, you know, a very cynical way.",
        "So those things are very present in my mind.",
        "I don't - I'm telling you, I'm not celebrating.",
        "But I consider very necessary that the future generations have a clear picture of who Pinochet was.",
        "Because all these people that adore him and the right wing people that owns papers, have been putting in the mind of people that he was this fantastic ruler and that the economic benefits that we were able to get from him is what had (unintelligible) this moment in a better position, economically speaking.",
        "But those people forget completely that it was Allende, the one that nationalized the copper mining.",
        "And that is the money that is, in this moment, helping to exercise social justice in our present president, Ms. Michelle Bachelet, is able to give to the people many of the social benefits they have been waiting for.",

        "I just wanted to make a quick comment on the fact that - although I am not by any stretch of the imagination a Pinochet supporter, and I am, by the way, a Chilean citizen.",
        "Allende was not a hero, and I think that's important for people to know.",
        "Chile was far from stable when the coup occurred.",
        "And I mean I remember as a kid long lines of people, you know, my mom trying to buy flour or oil for their families.",
        "I mean people were pretty desperate.",
        "I don't know if that was part of the CIA's involvement, but I doubt it.",
        "On the other hand there was already talk - and I remember my parents and, you know, family mentioning this - that there were already talks - Allende acknowledging this and thinking about stepping down or calling for democratic elections before his term was over.",
        "So although the country was in a huge crisis - and make no mistake, it was.",
        "I mean something needed to be done - I don't believe that, you know, the military coup, of course, was the right answer.",
        "And the last thing I wanted to comment on was, I'm amazed by how little Americans know of their own involvement in this coup and so many others.",
        "That's all I wanted to say.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Isabel, thanks so much for calling us.",
        "And Tom Gjelten, I was trying to remember back - and it seems to me I remember that as things were coming to a head in Chile, there were women who were out in the street with pots and pans holding demonstrations.",
        "Was that going on in Chile?",
        "I know there was a lot of unrest leading up to the eventual overthrow of Allende.",
        "Yes.",
        "As Isabel says, there was a lot of discontent on the part of ordinary Chileans, just because life had become very hard.",
        "I mentioned before high inflation, shortages of basic goods.",
        "You know, banging pots and pans is kind of a traditional Latin American way of registering discontent and there was a lot of that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We have e-mail here too that I'd like you to respond to.",
        "This, from Keith.",
        "And he says I had the great fortune of living in Chile over a nine-year period starting just before the first elections to after Pinochet returned from arrest in Great Britain.",
        "My wife is Chilean and continues to dream of the coup, albeit infrequently.",
        "In spite of the remaining memories, my wife's family is very pro-Pinochet.",
        "I was surprised at how divided the country remains.",
        "I hope they can continue to find justice for the disparados.",
        "And I also hope they can put Pinochet behind them, heal the wounds, and enjoy their beautiful country."

        "But interesting to hear that those divisions remain.",
        "And is there a possibility that this death will in some way bring them back up to the surface?",
        "Or let's talk about that a little bit - what you know about the divisions within the Chilean society that he's referred to.",
        "Well, Lynn, I think that, you know, obviously it's been so much attention on the prosecution of Pinochet that that whole effort now will come to an end, although there are certainly many other allies of Pinochet that still are having to face justice in Chile.",
        "But I think one of the most remarkable stories about Chile in the last 10 or 15 years, has been the extent to which there really has been no - kind of an absence of recrimination.",

        "And the transfer of power, from the Pinochet period to the governments that came afterward, was very smooth.",

        "I'm not going to do that and no, I don't think I'm going to attend the funeral, and that - what an incredible drama that is.",
