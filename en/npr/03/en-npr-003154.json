        "Twenty years later, Newsweek has apologized this week with a cover story mea culpa.",
        "Still, says Stroebel-Simeka, with or without the story, there was pressure to be married at that age.",
        "Well, I would say, in my early to mid-30s I was probably as most focused on marriage as ever.",
        "But I also, at the same time, when I turned 30 I bought a condominium.",

        "That said, you know, you have to make choices in life.",
        "And right, now there are only two options for the United States Senate.",

        "You could write somebody in, but there is not a credible write-in candidate.",
        "And frankly, three years from now, when the seat goes up again, there's going to be a pro-life Republican in the seat almost certainly.",
        "And so that's why I'd say looking at these two options, despite, you know, my pro-life views, Doug Jones, while not my ideal candidate, is clearly better than somebody that has preyed on young women.",
        "And, you know, the last thing I'd add on that point is it's one vote right now.",
        "At least as it stands right now, there have not been any votes lately where one pro-choice candidate would have hinged the votes in the Senate.",
        "It would maybe be a more compelling argument if it was a governor's race or a presidential race, where it was a single person in charge.",
        "What do you make of the fact, though, that so many people who presumably have been allies of yours in the past or presumably you are aligned with them on so many other issues in the past really do believe that it's better to have somebody like Roy Moore in the Senate, that that particular stance is just more important than any other position.",
        "And I'm just wondering how you - what do you - how do you understand that?",
        "So, yes, I think that the reality is that there are going to be some people for who the abortion issue is so strong for them that they cannot bring themselves to support Doug Jones.",
        "But I don't see how they could bring themselves to support Roy Moore because of all his other positions as well.",
        "And I think really, Michel, the overwhelming response among my colleagues, you know, Republican consultants and Republican staffers in Washington, is they quietly agree with me, that they, you know, feel pressured by the times.",
        "Many of them didn't like Donald Trump either.",
        "And then, you know, the voters went for Donald Trump, and so they've been chastened to not step out against what they think Republican-base voters want.",

        "Different things could bring it on - a death or painful reminder of it - but then the feeling would go viral, spreading to everyone in the tribe.",
        "One way they expressed the feeling was to gather together and wail.",

        "Embassy and the Iraqi parliament are, the problem is mortars and rockets are notoriously inaccurate, and so there are great plumes of black smoke rising from areas around the Green Zone, not just inside.",
        "In fact, some American forward operating bases have also been hit.",
        "And as you said, the man at the center of all of this is Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, and he called a cease-fire seven months ago, but it's always been fragile.",

        "The concern now is that the latest fighting isn't going to be confined to these so-called rogue elements, but instead it might be the beginning and the end of this cease-fire more generally.",
        "For months now, the American officials have been saying the cease-fire was a major contributor to the reduction of all this violence in Iraq, and now it appears that might be fraying.",
        "I want to figure out something here.",
        "You just mentioned rogue elements.",
        "We should remember, I guess, that Moqtada al-Sadr is seen as the leader of a very large militia, one of the largest in Iraq.",

        "Which raises the question: When the U.S.",
        "military and its allies and the Iraqi military are battling these Sadrist militias, are they actually battling Sadr, or are they actually battling Sadr's enemies within his own ranks?",
        "Well, that's a huge gray area, which is what everybody is working in.",
        "You know, Sadr is walking a very fine line here.",
        "He's trying to balance the interests of these hard-core followers who say the Iraqi government and the Americans have used the cease-fire as an opportunity to crack down on them, while at the same time he's trying to seem like a leader who can actually control those who are loyal to him.",
        "He hasn't lifted any cease-fire officially.",
        "He's called on his followers instead to just observe a nationwide strike.",
        "He's ordered them not to go to work, not to go to school, not to open their shops.",
        "And we're hearing some reports that shopkeepers who have actually dared to defy him on this are getting shot.",
        "New again today was that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki has given the militias, whether they're rogue militias or Mehdi army, 72 hours to lay down their arms.",
        "And you know, already in Baghdad you can feel the tension.",
        "The streets are absolutely deserted.",
        "Most of the shops are padlocked shut.",
        "The only people who are out on the street seem to be women who are getting water and sort of supplies.",
        "And the government has told people that they have to show up for work or they'd get penalized.",
