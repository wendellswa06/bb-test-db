        "And now we know that we can actually use knobbly fruit and vegetables that we've kind of like missed and loved.",
        "So they're back.",
        "I think it's great.",
        "I'm just sorry that they've taken regulations away from 26 fruit and vegetables, but there are still 10 that are going to be very much scrutinized, and I would quite like it if they could all be kind of de-regged as well.",

        "You're right.",
        "It's kind of part of that thing I suppose, because when I do the cooking show, the vegetables and the fruit look perfect, that continues that kind of notion that that's the way they should look.",
        "But they will not necessarily be the ones that taste good.",
        "But without holding you to account for the thinking of the European commission, what was the idea behind banning the forked multi-rooted carrot?",
        "What was seen as the problem there?",
        "I just think in Brussels they're quite bored and just don't know what to do with their time.",
        "But I have to say that the problem in Britain with this is that we seem to me to be quite law-abiding.",
        "I go to France and I go to Portugal, and they don't care what shape their tomatoes are, and they don't care what shape their cucumbers are.",
        "They seem to think, well, it's just laws and we'll break them.",
        "That's quite the Mediterranean spirit, in a way.",
        "But in Britain, we tend to slavishly follow them.",
        "Well, Diana Henry, thank you very much for talking with us."
