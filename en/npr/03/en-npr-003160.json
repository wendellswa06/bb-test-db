        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "But because some of these folks with Nobel Prizes and PhDs were fooled, and they spoke out saying look, we believe it's genuine, I mean, who's going to question somebody with a Nobel Prize.",
        "But in fact what you needed was a - yeah, you needed a magician to say aha, this is what they're doing.",
        "What's also interesting, as you point out about the confluence of the age of electricity and the turn of the last century and the rise of all these séances and other kinds of parapsychology.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I was - I think that helps - for me, it made a little easier to understand how people could have accepted it.",
        "Because this was a period of time that was right after the invention of the wireless telegraph and, you know, electricity hadn't been around that long and the telephone.",
        "And people had had to accept, you know, this seeming witchery of voice flying through the ether across the country and coming out on the end of a receiver.",
        "And I think that they thought well, you know, it's not such a big leap to imagine that a medium could be sort of acting as a receiver from the beyond.",
        "And even Thomas Edison actually tried to make a receiver - actually an amplifier to amplify these little, little, teeny, tiny voices of people who had died.",

        "Basically, I share the same skepticism and scientific approach as Mary does, and my question for her was - because I did, myself, a non-life-threatening scientific experiment of going through past life regression therapy, you know, to kind of give myself a first hand experience, and I wonder, Mary, if you, yourself, have done anything - not anything dangerous, but anything like past life regression therapy or anything like that that was a little more spiritual in nature that might give you some personal evidence?",
        "You know, I did two things, actually.",
        "First of all, I enrolled, like a fool, in medium school in London at this venerable old spiritualist college, and I took a weekend course, thinking maybe I just don't understand how it works.",
        "I failed.",
        "Not a good medium, huh?",
        "Yeah, the chapter's called Soul in a Dunce Cap.",
        "The other thing I thought about doing but did not is in the chapter on near-death experience, there is a drug called ketamine, and people report that if you take this drug, you experience an ersatz near-death experience sometimes, depending on how you take it and how much you take.",
        "And I thought, you know, without knowing much about this drug, I though oh hey, that's an idea.",
        "I'll just try ketamine.",
        "And then I read a little bit more about it, and I decided that was probably a bad idea.",

        "You know, there is - if you go on the Web site - I personally didn't do any research on psychic detectives, but there's a really good article on that on the Web site of the CSICOP, the Committee for Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal.",
        "That's a mouthful.",

        "I was just thinking that if this is one of your endeavors, that that might be a compelling area to check out.",

        "Yes, they are.",
        "Well, I did spend some time in a lab where they had a few mediums coming in, but it wasn't specifically psychic detective work.",
        "I am a little bit more inclined toward the people trying to find proof or evidence in a laboratory setting, and the psychic detective work - I suppose if you had a case, yes, of somebody who had fingered - come up with the name of the murderer and the evidence, I mean, that would be pretty remarkable, but that's more of a psychic thing than a mediumship.",

        "I think the best - the most intriguing and the hardest to dismiss is some of the studies in the realm of near-death experience, and I'll try to explain one to you.",

        "But to actually set up a controlled experiment was more what I was interested in.",
        "There was one done by Michael Sabin, who's a cardiologist, and he got a group of people who'd had an out-of-body, near-death experience where they had seen themselves being resuscitated down below, and he had these people write down in as much detail as they could, what did you see exactly.",
        "And then he got a control group, and that was patients who had been in a resuscitation, they had been in emergency rooms, seen a crash cart, seen defibrillator paddles.",

        "And he said to them okay, describe in as much detail as you can what it would look like if you were being resuscitated.",
        "And then he looked at the two groups' descriptions, and the people who'd had the near-death experience who claim to have been watching didn't make medical errors and were surprisingly detailed.",
        "I mean, it was - I read a bunch of transcripts of those reports, and you know, they would - like, there would be a man saying well, then there was a machine - you know, the needle came up, not all at once.",
        "It was on, you know, and then he named another type of meter -but, you know, it partially is part way up and it came back down, then it came back up.",
