        "Then he started his own company and walked away from everything dance had been about - storytelling and lavish costumes, even the way dancers followed the music.",
        "With his life partner, experimental composer John Cage, he came up with a way to incorporate chance into the creative process.",
        "(Soundbite of Chinese music)",
        "He would use the Chinese method of divination - the I Ching - to decide the order in which dancers should move.",
        "Things come up that one could say were physically impossible.",
        "But I always try them, and in the act of doing, I find out something I didn't know.",

        "Yes.",
        "What could it have told you specifically about a piece of choreography, a gesture or a movement?",
        "Well, if you had three movements, a run, a jump and a fall, you would think, well, you run, you jump up, and then you fall.",
        "But what if you toss the coin and it comes up, you have to do the fall first, and then the jump, and then the run?",
        "It breaks down what anybody has - and dancers in particular have muscular memories of how things should go.",
        "But instead of saying that's impossible, you try it out.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "Merce Cunningham demands a lot of audiences, too.",
        "Often when he collaborated with John Cage, Cunningham would create a dance and Cage would compose the music separately.",
        "Cunningham made no attempt to fit the dancers' movements to the music.",
        "Sometimes the performance was the first time they heard the music.",
        "Given a certain length of time - let's say 10 minutes - I could make a dance which would take up 10 minutes, and John Cage could make a piece of music which occupied the same amount of time.",
        "And then we could put them together.",
        "Well, did you find yourself, as you might have as a dancer - wouldn't you somehow follow the music?",
        "It was exactly what - that's what we didn't do.",
        "And then when Cage would play the piece, there would be moments where I - in the other way of working I would have thought there should be a sound, but his sound would come perhaps just after what I had done.",
        "And it was like opening your mind again to another kind of possibility.",
        "As John Cage said once, he does what he does, and I do what I do, and for your convenience we put it together.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I thought that was a remarkable way of thinking about it."

        "Well, considering that even now, in 2006, it could be hard for someone to wrap their mind around or even maybe more to the point, get comfortable with - what about audiences?",
        "Was it difficult for them as well?",
        "Oh, greatly.",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "We would play for very small audiences anyway.",

        "In my dance work I very rarely saw dancers, except the people with whom I worked directly, naturally.",
        "But I don't think I ever had a conversation with someone, say, from the Graham Company, or from the New York City Ballet about dancing, because if I brought up my ideas, they were not shocked, they just didn't comprehend this as a possibility.",
        "You know, I guess back when your body did every single thing that you wanted it to do, and magnificently, did you ever think when you were leaping across the stage at 25, did you think you'd be dancing at 80?",
        "I maybe have hoped so, but I don't think I thought it would happen.",
        "I think what they decided is that they - if you had a government shutdown over DACA and that was the only issue on the table, they would be the people blamed for a Christmas government shutdown, and they decided it wasn't worth it.",
        "What you did note is that there were an awful lot more Democratic votes against this budget than there were the last time they did a short-term extension.",

        "Today a group of former U.S.",
        "attorneys on both sides of the aisle sent a letter urging Trump to allow Mueller to do his job.",

        "Any attempt by this president to remove special counsel Mueller from his position or to pardon key witnesses in any effort to shield them for - from accountability or shut down the investigation would be a gross abuse of power and a flagrant violation of executive branch responsibilities and authorities.",
        "So David, you were talking about this last week.",
        "This effort to discredit him doesn't seem to be going away.",
        "Has this just become kind of part of the political atmosphere here in Washington?",
        "Well, I mean, the reason it's going - it's still persisting, this talk that he may fire him, is that Donald Trump ran on the idea that there are no honest brokers in American life.",

        "And what Warner has said is that it gives a strong indication there's actually some fire here.",
        "And as he said, Bob Mueller has way more investigative tools than his committee does.",

        "They - president's people are scared that Mueller has done a lot of work looking at Trump's businesses, looking for a Russia connection.",
        "And so this escalation in attacks reflects the fact that they think Mueller is going to come up with something.",
        "And I think the warnings you're hearing from Democrats suggest that they're worried that the Republicans are going to throw Mueller under the bus.",
