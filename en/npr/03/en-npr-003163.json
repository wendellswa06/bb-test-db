        "And I had studied Indian music part-time along with school and university my whole life.",
        "And so one of the things I got along the way was an MBA in finance, which led me to trade bonds in Toronto on Bay Street, which is our Wall Street.",
        "And I just wasn't happy doing that.",
        "And so I left that and sort of fell into the life of being a full-time musician doing Indian music."
