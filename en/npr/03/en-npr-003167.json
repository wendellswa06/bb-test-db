        "The last 20 years saw a boom in big houses.",
        "They peaked in 2006, but since then the numbers have been falling.",
        "And the most expensive houses, those costing more than a million and a half are selling worse than the rest of the already lousy housing market.",
        "But that's okay with Bryan Ashbaugh.",
        "He says he never really understood the appeal of 10,000 square foot houses anyway.",
        "At the same time, he says, when you're talking Street of Dreams there is a limit to how much you can downsize.",
        "We tried to do a lower price \"\"Street of Dreams\"\" show about 10 years ago in Jacksonville.",
        "And the houses were 250 to 300,000.",
        "And they were beautiful houses and it was a nice show.",
        "But the reaction we got from the public was, we can see houses like this every day of the week.",
        "If we're going to pay admission, we want to see something a little more dreamy."

        "Carlotta, you paint a picture of an area that's eerily similar to parts of Afghanistan of the late 1990s.",
        "I think that's what we're looking at.",
        "This is a very small area compared to Afghanistan under the Taliban.",
        "But it's a mountainous, remote area where there's virtually no state control, and where militants are able to operate, train and recruit, and are literally running their own affairs.",

        "They agreed that they would not go over to Afghanistan, and they would actually stop attacks.",
        "Yes, and this was an agreement made in September.",
        "And what it has done is reduced immediate violence in the area, because the Pakistani military have agreed not to attack the militants.",
        "And the militants have agreed not to attack the Pakistani military.",
        "But that means they've got more time to regroup and organize and launch attacks across the border, which is what NATO is saying is happening.",
        "They've seen an increase of cross-border infiltration and attacks since September.",
        "So the militants are clearly not keeping fully to the agreement.",
