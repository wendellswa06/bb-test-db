        "It's really unclear.",
        "Right now most private experts say that fewer people would end up covered under this.",
        "But we don't have an official analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, and we won't before they vote on this bill if they do so next week.",
        "There were two big things that worried people in the last vote.",
        "One was people with Medicaid - what would happen to them?",
        "And the other was people with pre-existing conditions.",
        "Let's take Medicaid first.",
        "What would this bill do for people who get coverage under Medicaid?",
        "Yeah, and that's a big deal because Medicaid covers about 70 million people.",
        "Under the expansion, about 10 million people got insurance, and that's going to be rolled back.",
        "But the basic Medicaid program will change as well.",
        "It's similar to earlier versions where right now Medicaid pays for whatever health care that people in the program need.",
        "There's no limit.",
        "And Republicans see that as a huge problem because it's a growing part of the federal budget.",
        "But this bill caps Medicaid spending a specific amount per person in the program and then it grows it more slowly.",
        "Most people say that over time, the program's going to shrink by about 25 percent.",
        "And as to pre-existing conditions, let's listen to what Senator Cassidy said on CNN about coverage for people with ongoing health problems.",

        "Is this a guarantee for people with pre-existing conditions?",
        "It's not exactly a guarantee.",
