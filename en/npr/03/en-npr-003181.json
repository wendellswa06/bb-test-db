        "It doesn't provide a descriptive list of the symptoms and signs and historical course that the illness follows.",

        "And you said that patients with mental disorders deserve better.",
        "What did you mean by that?",
        "That's a way of saying that we now have a dictionary to describe the disorders, just as Jeff said, but what we're really lacking is a deeper understanding and a way to do for people with mental disorders what we do typically for people with other medical problems, that is to have biomarkers, have predictors of who will respond best to which treatment, and have guides based on the biology of the illness that helps to tell us where the best treatments might come from in the future.",
        "We're missing all that.",
        "So when I say they deserve better, what I mean is we've got to do more than just produce a dictionary.",
        "We've got to actually produce an encyclopedia, something that has much deeper information so that we can provide much better interventions, and ultimately get much better outcomes.",
        "Gary Greenberg, you're most critical.",

        "It certainly represents a sincere effort to understand mental illness.",
        "And if all it were was an attempt to create good clinician communication, then we wouldn't be sitting here and talking about it.",
        "The problem with the DSM is that while psychiatrists would be quick to say it's not really a bible in the sense that it shouldn't be taken literally, it is a bible in the sense that it underlies psychiatry's authority.",

        "What has happened is that psychiatry's gone - been led down the path by the DSM into a situation in which its disorders are constructs.",
        "They aren't real in the way that we generally expect diseases to be real.",
        "And this has - this is not just a philosophical problem.",
        "This is a real problem, because what happens is that research follows the DSM.",

        "So whatever uses the DSM...",
        "Well, when you say mythical, and let me get into a couple of those.",
        "So you have schizophrenia or bipolar, or - you're saying these are mythical?",
        "Well, in my book - I interviewed Dr. Insel for my book, and he's a very forthright man, and he said look, this is a problem.",
        "Psychiatrists come to think that schizophrenia is real.",
        "But schizophrenia is not real in the sense, again, that we normally expect diseases to be real, as he just said, with biomarkers and so on.",
        "What schizophrenia is is a label applied to a group of symptoms.",
        "But there may be many ways to get to those symptoms.",
        "And, in fact, to some extent, what we see is that the genetics especially, and with family history, show that a common genetic underpinning may lie underneath both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",
        "The most venerable distinction in the DSM is between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and yet it may be that they have a common pathway.",
        "So the - it's like, look, using the DSM to understand the terrain of mental illness is like using a map of the moon to get around Manhattan.",

        "This is Jeffrey Lieberman.",
        "First of all, I think when Tom, you know, says we have to better, what he's doing is he's exhorting the biomedical research community and the psychiatric research community to really try and redouble efforts and break new ground and out of the procrustean mold of historical methods of diagnosis.",
        "The truth is is that the progress that we've seen in psychiatric diagnosis has been less than we would have hoped for, and it's in large part because the brain is a tough organ, and the behavioral and mental functions of the brain represent the most highly evolved aspects of the human organism and in all of the animal kingdom.",
        "When Gary says - I mean, Gary's argument is so philosophical and abstruse and so really minimally relevant to clinical practice.",
        "The nature of the way science leads the evolution of medicine and the refinement of diagnosis is such that you begin with the syndromal description, and from there, you deconstruct it into more specific, biologically defined subtypes."
