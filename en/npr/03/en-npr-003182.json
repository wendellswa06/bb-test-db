        "That's what we're looking for.",

        "Well, we're not looking for a virus, per se, but we're looking for, you know, the genetic and the neurobiological bases for these disorders.",
        "When those are found, we may - it may lead to the deconstructing of psychotic disorders like schizophrenia into multiple subtypes, the same way that we see now with breast cancer being defined by its molecular signatures and its genetic profile.",

        "One way to think about this is DSM is really what we have, along with ICD, but those are really for the bedside.",
        "And I'm talking to an audience in the biomedical research community that's at the bench, not at the bedside, most of the time.",
        "And so, for the bench, we're looking for some way to do just what Jeff Lieberman said a moment ago: finding a way to deconstruct these classifiers and to say hey, yes this is what we currently call schizophrenia.",

        "Let's do the science with the assumption that we have to actually pull this apart and begin to understand the subtypes if we're going to get to more selective treatments.",

        "Let's just think about this, for now, as something that's clinically useful, but it needs to change.",
        "And the only way to change is through getting much better scientific information.",
        "But don't in-practice doctors rely on it as a bible so that they can prescribe medications that will be accepted at your drugstore?",
        "I don't think they rely on it as a bible.",
        "As I said before, it is a guide.",
        "You know, medicine is an art, as well as a science, and the descriptions of disease, whether it involves diseases that are known, there's known ideologies for or for which there's laboratory tests or X-rays, or which there's just symptomatic descriptions, the doctor uses this information, provided either in a textbook or in something like the DSM, to inform their clinical judgment."

        "The DSM doesn't have any disorders that can be specified biologically, and that's why you have antidepressants prescribed to treat anxiety disorders and anti-anxiety drugs used for antipsychotic disorders and antipsychotic drugs used for mood disorders, because there are no drug treatments targeted to these disorders.",
        "But Gary, let me just make two comments.",
        "First of all, there are some laboratory-based measures that have begun to be reflected in the DSM.",
        "It's reflecting kind of the first introduction of those in the history of mental illness and description in the DSM.",
        "So for Alzheimer's disease, there are genes that can inform the diagnosis that are described in the DSM for familial forms of Alzheimer's disease.",
        "And similarly, for narcolepsy, there's the measurement of hypocretin in the CSF that can be used to inform the diagnosis.",
        "And what we're seeing is the first introduction, you know, like a leading edge of medical research that is allowing for that.",
        "I think, you know, one of the things to consider here is we're dealing with the clinical reality of a need to be able to understand what people bring to us and to make clinical decisions.",
        "Some of us are old enough to remember what psychiatry was like or what clinical care was like for mental illness before we had a DSM-III, before there was a dictionary, and it was chaos.",
        "And I don't think anybody wants to go back to that.",
        "I don't think anybody right now has an alternative for clinical use beyond what the DSM is providing.",
        "Well, this is why I stay behind the camera.",
        "So it's easy to criticize this and to say it's not a perfect document.",
        "And I think everybody would probably endorse that sentiment.",
        "I haven't seen anything yet that could replace it for clinical use.",
        "So - but according to that document, then, binge eating is a mental illness.",

        "And each one of those disorders is given a code number, and those code numbers are like gold.",
        "That code number allows cash to flow, because with that number, you can fill in a claim form, and that causes insurance companies to pay.",
