        "Could I jump in here, Ira?",
        "Gary, go ahead.",
        "Yeah.",
        "First of all, I'm sure that Jeff will speak to the way the APA has made strides in distancing itself from the drug companies.",
        "But what I want to say is I'm the person who would be most motivated, I guess, to find conspiracies out there, since I'm a journalist, and there aren't conspiracies.",
        "There's no attempt to plant - you know, these industry ties or unseemly, and they reflect the entanglement of psychiatry with the drug industry.",
        "But there's nobody planting disorders in the DSM in order to get drug money.",
        "You know, you don't need conspiracies like that when you have capitalism.",
        "Every diagnosis is a market, whether the people who make the diagnosis up intend it to be that way or not.",
        "And that's a symptom of a health care system that's in trouble.",
        "So that's a much larger problem.",
        "But as to the specifics of it, the issue here is that the psychiatrists and the drug industry have a similar take on psychological suffering, which is that it is a medical problem that is, by and large, to be treated with drugs.",

        "Well, you know, I don't have a big animus against drugs.",
        "I just think that we need to be more transparent about the fact that we don't know much about their long-term effects, that we don't know exactly why they work, that they are treating symptoms and not underlying disorders.",
        "And I think with transparency, many of the problems that I bring up in my book can be resolved.",
        "I also think that with transparency, psychiatry would be answering to maybe more critics, but I think that might be a healthy thing.",
        "Ira, this is Jeffrey Lieberman.",
        "I think the issue is less transparency than it is lack of progress.",
        "You know, my - there's a saying that it's better to be lucky than to be smart.",
        "Psychiatry, even though it is, in many respects, kind of a stepchild of medicine, has been lucky in the sense that, serendipitously, in the 1950s, post-World War II, when the NIH was created, when the NIMH was one of the first institutes created in the NIH, we happened to stumble upon pharmacologic compounds that worked, for the first time in human history, to alleviate psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and antidepressants - or agents that work as antidepressants to alleviate the symptoms of severe, major depression, and then subsequently lithium and anticonvulsants as mood stabilizers.",
        "We didn't know what the cause of the illnesses were.",
        "We didn't know exactly why the drugs were effective, but we did know that they were dramatically therapeutic.",
        "And they have remained lifesavers for countless numbers of patients who otherwise would have been institutionalized or relegated to completely incapacitated lives.",
        "The problem is that we haven't moved beyond that very far.",
        "And, you know, we had the 1990s, which was the decade of the brain.",
        "Did we move far there?",
        "I mean - and then we just had President Obama saying we need the BRAIN Initiative, the $100 million jump-starting money on that.",
        "Are the - why aren't moving very far?",
        "There are bunch of reasons.",
        "This is Tom Insel.",
        "And part of it has been, I think, the science is focused much more on the treatment than on the disorders, but that's something we can change.",
        "And I think part of it is - these are complicated problems.",
        "We haven't had great tools.",
        "Part of the excitement of the BRAIN Initiative is that we're hoping to get much better tools.",
        "Can I just respond to Dave, though, because I think he's raised a couple - three, at least, interesting issues related to the economics?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I'm not sure we've really responded.",
        "As Gary Greenberg said, really, the conflict of interest conspiracy that he's worried about is probably not an issue for the DSM-V.",
        "The question about whether this is generating more and more disorders, I think, does need some factual clarification.",
        "And I know I'm brought on the show as the DSM critic, but let me be clear.",
        "From my count of what's in there, we've gone from 172 disorders down to 157.",
        "So this revision is reducing the number of disorders.",
        "They're not creating new ones.",
        "The other question about how this fits with reimbursement, I think, is also going to need a much deeper discussion because we're beginning to understand that in the new health care ecology that we're about to go into, it's not going to be your diagnosis that determines how people get paid or get reimbursed.",
        "It's going to be much more about the intervention that's used.",
        "And that's actually not at all relevant to what's in DSM-5.",
        "It doesn't specify treatments.",
        "So I think it's going to be - the actual impact on the reimbursement may be much smaller than we think.",

        "What Tom was referring to was a period just before DSM-3 when diagnosis was based on what are called prototypical descriptions and diagnosis wasn't of much interest in the - to psychiatrists or other mental health clinicians.",
        "And then there was a crisis in psychiatry in the early 1970s.",
        "And it was one of a number of crises that have occurred historically since about the time of Benjamin Rush since the founding of psychiatry based on the question of whether or not psychiatry was credible.",
        "And that question has always been tied to the diagnostic order.",
        "What happened in the 1970s was that there was an attempt to make psychiatry more scientific by - more credible, I'm sorry, by making the diagnoses more scientific.",
        "And that was the birth of the DSM-3, which was a book full of diagnoses with a criteria by which they could be known.",
        "And it definitely made it easier for psychiatrists to agree on what mental illness a particular patient had.",
        "What it didn't do was make it easier for us to know what's a mental disorder and what's just the normal suffering of a difficult life.",
        "And to get back to what Tom just said about the creation of disorder, it's a complicated issue, but, in fact, he's correct.",
        "Since DSM-3, the overall prevalence of mental disorder has not changed whether the number of diagnoses goes up or down.",
        "The issue that has occurred is that in DSM-3, there was a conscious attempt to make the DSM cover as much suffering as possible.",
        "That was partly in the hope of treating a lot of people, and it was also as a way to get professional support for the new approach to diagnosis.",
        "The only way to do that was to reassure the psychiatrists and the other mental health clinicians that their patients wouldn't be excluded from diagnosis at all, and that gets back to the reimbursement question we were talking about before.",

        "Let me add one comment about what Gary was just saying, which I pretty much agree with.",
        "With DSM-3, which was kind of a paradigm shift in terms of the nosology that was being used for psychiatric disorders, there were two notable changes that, I think, illustrate the way this works.",
        "One was the elimination of homosexuality, which had been classified as a disorder and, you know, clearly was mistakenly or uninformedly considered in that way.",
        "The other was the addition of PTSD.",
        "Now PTSD, which we're all familiar with now, describes the condition that occurs as a result of emotional trauma or stress historically been recognized in wars.",
        "Going back to the Civil War, soldiers had battle fatigue, combat fatigue, shellshock, et cetera, but it had not been specifically designated in a more clinical terminology or considered to be a bona fide disorder.",
        "And we still don't know the cause of it.",
        "We know that it's precipitated by trauma, but we don't know the underlying neurobiology of it.",
        "We don't have sort of a laboratory test for it.",
        "But nevertheless, nobody disputes the fact that it is a disorder.",
        "So the DSM does evolve in the context of knowledge and also, you know, our environment and cultural conditions.",
        "But in the aggregate, it is not expanding the pie of individuals in our society that would be diagnosed rather with carving the pie into what hopefully are more precise or more accurate slices.",
        "But let's add to that, Jeff, that under the current regime, 50 percent of the American people will suffer mental illness in their lifetime and 30 percent, close to 30 percent in any given year.",
        "Also, it's important to point out that those two moves which - the deletion of homosexuality and the addition of PTSD, both of which are great moves if you're going to have something like a DSM.",
        "Both took place by expert consensus on - basically on the basis of a vote.",
        "In fact, in the case of homosexuality, a referendum.",
        "And this is the problem of the DSM.",
        "It is that - it is presented to us as a scientific text, and yet in what other medical field are scientists voting on what a disease is?",
        "Oh, it's not a vote in that sense, Gary.",
        "This is basically an analysis of the literature and consideration in the context of public health needs.",

        "And if in the absence of having these objective measurable tests that needs to be done by some clinical consensus based on the extant scientific literature, that's the best way to they know to do it.",
        "Yes.",
        "And that can't be denied.",
        "I'd just say two things about that.",
