        "But as time went on, Strayhorn's name did get lost, and there were some major compositions credited to Ellington that Strayhorn had a major hand in, and that's part of the complex, very complex, and so tragic story about Strayhorn.",
        "He - Ellington was well-established when Strayhorn first approached him as a young man out of Pittsburgh.",
        "You bet.",
        "Ellington had already proven that he was a genius and didn't need Billy Strayhorn before they ever met, which was in December 1938.",
        "And Strayhorn was looking for a break.",
        "He had been working in Pittsburgh but was also a fully developed musical force already at this point, and that's something that not many people knew.",
        "In fact I didn't even know when I started my book, and that was in 1984.",
        "I finished it 11 years later.",
        "It was published in 1996.",
        "But when I started out, I had bought in to what I had read about Strayhorn, which is that he hadn't done much before Ellington found him and groomed him in his image.",
        "And I was shocked to find, after a few years of research and going back to Pittsburgh and interviewing people with whom Strayhorn had played and under whom Strayhorn had - they had worked, that, boy, got mangled.",
        "I sound like Reagan for a minute there.",
        "It was a mangled syntax.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But I was stunned to find out how much Strayhorn had done prior to 1938.",
        "That great tune \"\"Lush Life,\"\" he wrote that when he was 16."

        "And Strayhorn would bring music paper with him and sometimes a blank piece of paper that he would write music staff - a music staff on, and he was working on that tune for years.",
        "Originally he called it \"\"Life Is Lonely,\"\" and it was inspired by his images of what the sophisticated life would be, based mainly on stories that he read in The New Yorker.",
        "He bought a subscription to The New Yorker because he was horrifically poor.",
        "His family was born in kind of - he was raised in Dickensian poverty in an alley behind the street where the white people lived, in an area of Pittsburgh called Homewood.",
        "But bought his own piano, bought his own music, and was touched by the hand of God.",
        "And by the time he was a kid, he was already writing masterpieces.",

        "And I sat down with my wife, who is the smartest guy in the room at any time, and I said: What do you think?",
