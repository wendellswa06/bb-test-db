        "So dung beetles use the starry night, they use the Milky Way to navigate around?",
        "They do indeed.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's a surprising finding, but they do indeed.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We discovered it almost by chance, really, because we were studying their mechanisms of navigating with regards to the moon, which is slightly more visible and obvious stimulus during the night sky.",
        "But we discovered on most parts of the month when the moon came up extremely late after midnight, particularly that until midnight, we suddenly discovered that the beetles were still able to navigate even without the moon.",
        "So we were quite puzzled by this, a bit alarmed actually at first because we were worried that our previous work was wrong.",
        "But then after further contemplation, we sort of realized that, well, maybe they were using the stars.",
        "And it turned out to be the case.",
        "They can actually see the Milky Way at night time?",
        "They can, yes.",
        "They probably don't see that many individual stars because their eyes really aren't sensitive enough to discern many more than probably the 10 or so brightest stars.",
        "But they can actually see the very dim stripe of light, which is - which makes up the Milky Way, especially in the Southern Hemisphere.",
        "It's very, very obvious actually compared to the Northern Hemisphere.",
        "And it's this broad and rather dim stripe of light which they're able to detect and to orient with respect to.",
        "How do you craft an experiment to discover this?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, the first clue we got was that we covered their heads with little tiny cardboard hats, which we cut out of black card and then taped onto the back of their bodies so that they - the view of the night sky was removed.",
        "And when we did that, they were no longer able to orient.",
        "And the way they normally orient is that they roll balls of dung in straight lines directly away from the dung pad.",
        "They have to do this because if they don't do this, they end up rolling back into the dung pad.",
        "And there's a lot of beetles there, all competing for this very valuable resource, and it's very likely that they get their dung ball stolen after quite a fight often.",
        "So they must get away from the dung pad in a straight line.",
        "That's the quickest and the most efficient way of leaving the dung pad, and so it's critically important for them that they do this.",
        "And so the stripe of light in the sky helps them to do this.",
        "They can actually orient with respect to it and orient in straight line away.",
        "So what happens when it's a cloudy night and they can't see the sky?",
        "They just don't go out that night?",
        "No, they do but they roll in circles.",
        "So it's actually a very dangerous night indeed for dung beetles.",

        "So it was a beautiful, perfect, exquisite arrangement for a while.",
