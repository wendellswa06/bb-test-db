        "It was paramount to Ellington, paramount to Strayhorn, and they were intimate in that way.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And Ellington let Strayhorn in in his music in a way that he never let anybody else in.",
        "He worked more closely with Strayhorn than he ever worked - than he - he was closer to Strayhorn musically than he ever was to anyone else in any other way.",

        "Yeah, I think it was very important to have these people because Strayhorn, for whatever reason, didn't leave a whole lot of evidence behind.",
        "There were very few interviews with Billy, and the few that we found were not really very revealing or indicative of the kind of personality that he really had.",
