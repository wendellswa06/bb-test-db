        "On the issue of harmony, we - Strayhorn had some classical training.",
        "We hear in the pieces that he wrote before he met Duke, such as \"\"Something To Live For,\"\" \"\"Your Love Is Faded,\"\" \"\"Lush Life,\"\" and some of the score for \"\"Fantastic Rhythm,\"\" that he had a fully developed harmonic sense, and it was steeped not - in a general sense, in the European, classical traditional, but specifically in the Impressionists.",
        "Now Ellington could also do something in that vein, and he did before he ever met Duke, and so did many others.",
        "But Strayhorn's heart was in that Impressionistic sensibility.",
        "Ellington's heart was elsewhere.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks for the call, Greg.",
        "OK.",
        "I think it was well known.",
        "I mean I think David would probably agree, that he was not particularly closeted about that.",
        "He was basically somebody who was very honest at all times, that he let his preferences be known early on, that he didn't create any kind of subterfuge or try and camouflage what he was about, and I think he - and we see this in his music, too, that honesty was always a very important factor to Billy Strayhorn.",
        "The family of Billy Strayhorn has made it their mission to continue to sustain his musical legacy.",
        "Alyce Claerbout is his niece and vice president of Billy Strayhorn Songs, Incorporated.",
        "She also appears in tonight's documentary.",

        "I lived in New York City, just three blocks from him, so I got a chance to hang around the band, and I also knew Duke Ellington.",
        "I walked and talked with both Billy Strayhorn and Duke Ellington.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "He was a very gregarious person, and that would - that's to the surprise of a lot of people because his public persona is that he was shy and retiring, and in some ways he was.",
        "But the Billy Strayhorn I knew was very gregarious.",
        "I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before I moved to New York as a teenager.",
        "And as we were growing up, Uncle Billy used to come home and visit us for Christmas.",
        "This is an example of his gregariousness.",
        "Pittsburgh in that time, I lived in a little community, a very small community that was very self-contained.",
        "And it was one of those communities that if you left the door unlocked, you were pretty safe.",
        "You didn't have to worry about crime or anything like that.",
        "And in those days it was a four-hour flight from New York to Pittsburgh.",
        "So Billy would say - tell us his plane would come in sometimes at the Pittsburgh - what was the Pittsburg Airport - at about maybe after midnight or two o'clock in the morning or something.",
        "So we would not always be awake for him when he would come to the house, to greet him.",
        "So we would just leave the door unlocked, and he would just come in and start playing the piano and wake everybody up.",
        "And so we knew he was there.",
        "We'd all run down to meet him and start singing \"\"Merry Christmas.\"\" That was kind of a real humorous way he had of approaching, you know, when he would visit.",
        "I have those memories.",
        "And he was a wordsmith.",
        "He was very clever in his talk.",
        "He liked to sit around, chew the rag, talk about interesting things, and just have a good time - just kind of kick it around, so to speak.",
        "He had that quality about him.",
        "I remember that very, very clearly about him.",
        "Mm-hmm, and he, as you say, a gregarious person, but as you grew up later, did you understand his reticence?",
        "Was it reticence that prevented him from taking more of the spotlight?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I'm not even sure I was looking at him that way because, you know, this was my uncle who was a very gifted composer, and I wasn't thinking too much about whatever the politics was of his job.",
        "I knew he worked for a great person, Duke Ellington, and that was very exciting.",
        "I went to concerts, exciting concerts, great music and great times.",
        "But in terms of -what I was aware of is there was always a groundswell of curiosity from people that we knew about why he didn't get more credit for things that he wrote.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And that controversy has been a controversy for all - for my entire life, as I remember it.",
        "I don't ever remember a time when that was not a controversy.",
        "And to some degree the controversy continues."

        "Yes, so this film that's coming - going to be seen tonight is really kind of the - it caps years and years of those questions that have -it's not a new question.",
        "It's been kind of underground for a long time.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Robert Levi, let me ask you, did you encounter any sort of resistance when you set out to make this movie as its intentions became clear?",
        "Oh, yeah, there was tremendous resistance.",
        "I think that for the most part the people who were - or had been involved in this question were very reticent to come to the table and be put on the spot and discuss it.",
        "I think that the reviews that I've seen today really embody a lot of that same quality.",
        "There are people who have just adored the film and write about it effusively, and there are other people who've not written negatively, but you can sense a subtext of did this really need to come out, did this really - did there need to be this kind of film?",
        "In other words, they take it as criticism of Duke Ellington.",
        "I don't think it's necessarily criticism.",
        "I think it's an extension of something Mercer Ellington once said to me, is - when he was talking about his own feelings about his father and also, you know, feelings that Cab Callaway had, which there could really only be one Duke Ellington, which Mercer felt, I think, profoundly.",
        "And possibly some of that spilled over onto Ellington's feelings about Strayhorn, that these were certain questions that didn't really need to be asked.",
        "We don't need to go there.",
        "There's just a certain amount of perpetual opposition to dealing with that.",

        "And so they must have developed this over the millennia, this ability to do this?",

        "And I also wanted to ask a question that sort of was related to what his relative was saying just a moment ago.",
        "Excuse me.",
        "I'm wondering if - as a result of the biography, and now the PBS documentary -if there is going to be any reattribution of music that was formerly credited, you know, solely to Duke Ellington to expand the attribution to Billy Strayhorn.",
        "Alyce Claerbout?",
        "Well, you know, that's a very interesting question.",
        "One of the things - when I talk about Duke Ellington, I remind people that above all, he was a publisher.",
        "He owned a publishing company, and because he had a publishing company, he had an awful lot of power.",
        "So a lot of the impact of Billy's diminished legacy was a result of the power that Duke Ellington had.",
        "He could choose what got registered to be copyrighted.",
        "He had the publishing rights to Billy's music.",
        "Now once you copyright something and it's registered, you can't change that.",
        "It's always - the names that are registered are always going to be registered that way.",
        "And one of the difficulties in telling the story about Billy Strayhorn is it's very difficult to talk about his music and the credit he deserves without talking about Duke Ellington.",
        "And that's a very difficult thing.",
        "Any reassessment of Billy Strayhorn is automatically a reassessment of Duke Ellington for that reason.",
        "I just wanted to say a word about my family members.",
        "We formed a company in the year 2000 - Billy Strayhorn Songs, Incorporated.",
        "My brother, Gregory Morris, who was Billy's executor, and my cousins Leslie Demus, Galen Demus, Larry Strayhorn and my aunt Susan Strayhorn, we form the basic board of this company.",
        "The significance of that is there was a little known clause in the Sonny Bono amendment to the Copyright Term Extension Act that provided for original authors or their heirs to recapture the publishing rights from these big publishers.",
        "And we took the bold step to terminate former publishers and recapture those publishing rights and to license and be in the business of licensing Billy Strayhorn's music on our own.",
        "We do that with a co-publisher, Dimensional Music Publishing.",
        "And a lot of people don't realize that - see, we now own the publishing rights to \"\"Take the 'A' Train\"\" and \"\"Chelsea Bridge.\"\" It is no longer a Tempo - it is no longer owned by Tempo any more."

        "The cultural mediators of their day were white, and there was plenty of room for a great many major white composers, but for some reason they would only accept one major black composer.",
        "And the idea that there were two seemed unthinkable.",
        "And that the idea these two can work in a collaborative, companionable way which is linked to black culture and to the communal sense that's important in black culture could to not be processed by the white mediators of the day.",
