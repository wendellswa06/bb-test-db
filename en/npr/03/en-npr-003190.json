        "Well, let me ask you, though, did Ellington and Strayhorn test that thesis?",
        "Did they test the thesis?",
        "In other words, did he come - was he presenting himself as another great black composer along with Ellington to put the people to the test?",
        "I don't think that they thought they had a chance.",
        "I thought they were wise enough to know that that's the way the system worked.",
        "They were both very, very astute men who wanted an ear, wanted the public ear, and knew that there's a value in playing the game as it was played in those days to get that ear.",
        "Now, as to the point of how did Strayhorn pay for not only his piano but the music and his music lessons and - he worked as a soda jerker.",
        "He worked delivering newspapers.",
        "He saved every penny he could.",
        "He had the support of a mother who loved him dearly and encouraged him to play music, and Alyce could talk more about that.",
        "And he'd save up the money and paid for it.",
        "Now, he only went for a year, and then he left.",
        "He didn't finish his studies there.",
        "But he saved up enough money from just working like a dog as a soda jerker and a newspaper delivery boy.",

        "And one of the things, Alyce, that the film documents well is Billy Strayhorn's very difficult death.",
        "You were there with him at the time.",
        "Yes.",
        "That was a very painful part of the history.",
        "I remember attending his 25th anniversary at the New School of Social Work.",
        "He had that special concert, and his voice was very raspy.",
        "And I was just becoming aware of how ill he really was.",
        "And Billy Strayhorn was the first cancer death I had ever seen, so that was very, very difficult for me to see him suffering.",
        "And we, his family members, we would go and sit vigil with him during his illness.",
        "But he always had a strong spirit underneath that.",
        "As you know, he continued to write music up into his death.",
        "And as a person he, you know, he exhibited great character because he knew how ill he really was.",
        "But whenever physical strength would allow him to do it, he tried to participate in life as fully as he possibly could.",
        "The most heartbreaking memory I have is one day I was walking him - he wanted to go to Harlem.",
        "He loved to visit Harlem.",
        "He had friends in Harlem.",
        "And he needed to hail a cab, and he was a little weak, and he lived on Riverside Drive and I lived not too far from there and I came up to - and we were walking out to Broadway to catch a cab.",
        "And he was beginning to look very, very ill, and his clothes were hanging off of him because, you know, he had lost a lot of weight.",
        "And the cab driver, you know, wouldn't pick him up and told him he couldn't get into his cab, because he thought maybe he was a vagrant or something like that.",
        "I don't know.",
        "And that was very, very - that was very painful for me to see.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller in on the conversation.",
        "This is Jacque(ph).",
        "Jacque's calling us from Detroit.",
        "That is correct, and good afternoon everyone.",

        "OK.",
        "Again, I think as Luther Henderson - who was one of the most incredibly wonderful people I'd interviewed - said that Billy loved to share above all else.",
        "He loved to share his music with the world.",
        "He loved sharing the experience of writing music by himself, of being able to contribute in his work with Duke Ellington.",
        "I think there wasn't so much of a competition outside of the playful competitiveness that the two of them had, and I think that the film ultimately celebrates not only Billy's work, but it certainly doesn't do it at Duke's expense.",
