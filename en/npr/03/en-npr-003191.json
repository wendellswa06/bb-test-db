        "To better understand how we arrived at this political landmark, we looked back to the beginning of Obama's political life.",
        "It began to take shape when he was elected as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review in 1990.",
        "Charles Ogletree is a professor at Harvard Law and was Obama's mentor on campus.",
        "Barack Obama was actually always someone who would listen, and he didn't always agree with what I had to say, and I didn't always agree with what he had to say, but the important thing was that as a young man who came to Harvard Law School, whose father was not in his life, who only knew him in a passing way, it was important for him to see other mentors and role models.",
        "And I was very happy as an African-American faculty member, as a father, as a parent to spend time with him talking about some of his wishes and some of his dreams.",
        "Following Harvard, Obama returned to Chicago and his community-organizing roots, where Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page says Obama began to cultivate his political connections.",
        "After he came back to Chicago, after Harvard Law School, he put those contacts to good use and really worked his way up to - first, Chicago independent political circles, and then he worked his way into the inner circle of the old organization, what we always called The Machine back in those days, when it really operated like a machine.",
        "It was that machine that gave Obama his first crack at elected office.",
        "In 1996, Illinois state Senator Alice Palmer urged Obama to run for her seat because she was leaving it to run for Congress.",
        "But before Election Day arrived, the newcomer found himself in the uncomfortable position of challenging Palmer, as well.",
        "Here again is Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune.",
        "As it happened, she was defeated by Jesse Jackson Jr., who won that congressional seat.",
        "She turned around and asked Barack to step aside so she could run for her old seat again.",
        "Barack did not.",
        "In Chicago's traditional political etiquette, a lot of folks called it dirty pool.",
        "It would not be Obama's last clash with the Chicago machine.",
        "In 2000, as a state senator, he sought the congressional seat of longtime incumbent and former Black Panther Party member Bobby Rush.",
        "Obama was trounced.",
        "Congressman Rush.",
        "First of all, he was running against me.",
        "I was the incumbent, had been elected, I think, for three of four times prior to him running against me.",
        "Rush says Obama was viewed as someone who had not paid his dues.",
        "You know, his ambition kind of collided with my history and my involvement and my participation, not only in the civil rights movement but my tenure here in the Congress.",
        "And I think that's what collided, and he lost as a result of that."

        "Audie, President Trump also spoke about John McCain today.",
        "He described him appreciatively as being one of D.C.'s crusty voices, and he said he was hoping to get him back in Washington soon in particular because he needs his vote.",
        "Now, what we know about McCain according to the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix - as you said, he's recovering back at home.",
        "And the next step is they're waiting on the tests of a pathology report.",
        "And once they have that, they'll know if any additional care is necessary and if he could potentially be kept away from Washington for some time.",
        "Now, to talk more about that legislation, John McCain has been a critic, talking about how it was written in private by party leaders, also criticized the bill's Medicaid cuts and how that could affect his state of Arizona.",
        "So are Republican leaders actually confident that they could have counted on his vote?",
        "The one thing they know for sure is that they will lose without it.",
        "McCain has problems with the legislation.",
        "He's talked about that a lot.",
        "But he was expected to be a yes vote on that critical procedural vote they were planning to have this week that requires 50 votes just to let the Senate begin the debate on the bill.",
        "There are already two public noes on that vote, as we well know - Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine - which means McConnell has no votes to spare.",
        "Now, after they clear that hurdle and start debating the bill, McCain says he plans to offer a lot of amendments to the bill, particularly affecting Medicaid.",
        "And he hasn't promised to be a yes on final passage of the bill either.",
        "Now, of course this could all become moot if one more Republican senator in the meantime comes forward and says they're going to be a no on the bill.",
        "If they get three Republican noes, that means that the bill is over and the debate is over before but it even begins.",
        "And then the other Arizona senator, Republican Jeff Flake, is also in the news today for different reasons.",
        "Politico reported that the White House has met with potential Republican primary challengers to run against Flake next year.",
        "How unusual is this?",
        "It is highly unusual, and I can tell you Mitch McConnell does not support this kind of infighting.",
        "You know, a couple - earlier this year, a Trump-aligned super PAC also planned to target Nevada Republican Senator Dean Heller with an ad campaign.",
        "He's undecided on the health care bill.",
        "And that made Senate Republicans very unhappy.",
        "At a meeting at the White House last month, they personally appealed to the president not to use these kind of hardball tactics.",
        "The group eventually did announce they weren't going to run the ads.",
        "I think you can expect a similar pushback in Flake's defense.",
        "It is the official policy of the Senate Republican Campaign Committee to back incumbents in primaries.",
        "There are no exceptions to this rule.",
        "But I think with Flake, it's also a bit personal.",
        "It's not just about health care.",
        "As you recall, he was a very frequent critic of the president during the campaign.",
        "What else should we look forward this August recess?",
        "Well, you know, they had delayed the August recess by two weeks in order to try and get some work done, particularly this health care bill, so it's a little bit up in the air.",
        "The leader has said the Senate will also take up a defense bill and continue working their way through President Trump's nominations.",
        "This unexpected delay, though, also, it's important to remember, gives opponents to the health care bill more time to try and defeat it and in particular to keep pressure on Republican senators who are undecided.",
        "Every Democratic senator is opposed to the bill, and the delay has not stopped activists from rallying outside the Capitol all this week.",
        "That's NPR's Susan Davis at the Capitol."

        "Judith Miller spent 85 days in prison after she refused to tell the grand jury the name of a confidential source.",
        "Last month, that source released her from her promise and she walked out of jail on September 29th.",
        "Miller has since testified twice before the grand jury, on the day after she was released and again last Wednesday.",
        "Also last Wednesday, a federal judge lifted a contempt order against Miller.",

        "The second article recounted how The New York Times handled Miller's defense and the conflicts that defense created inside its newsroom.",
        "Though both articles lift the veil on some aspects of the case and on Miller's personal story, there are still many unanswered questions about the leak, Judith Miller, The New York Times and about the White House where at least two senior officials could face charges.",
