        "Judith Miller was the primary reporter at The New York Times who was covering whether or not there were weapons of mass destruction, what the basis was for that paper.",
        "And she was a controversial figure inside The Times because she was basing a lot of her reporting on Mr. Chalabi and other supporters of the administration who were avid, ardent believers in this.",
        "There were people at The Times who disagreed with it--with her coverage, thought it wasn't well-reported.",
        "And ultimately after more information was revealed, The Times published a fairly extraordinary editor's note in which it apologized for its coverage and for a series of stories, almost all of which--all but one--were either written by or co-written by Judith Miller.",
        "Subsequently, as we learned this weekend, Bill Keller, then the editor of The Times, who had not been the editor during all of the time that she was doing this reporting, ordered her not to continue any more reporting on Iraq and weapons.",
        "She continued to do so, however, despite these instructions and some of that reporting, which she never actually got into the paper, involved the same material that Bob Novak wrote about, the administration arguing that Wilson's work was biased or somehow suspect because he was sent--his wife worked for the CIA, had been involved in perhaps selecting him for this trip.",
        "Whether or not that's true or not is a little murky in the end.",
        "And what is less clear, also, is whether the people who were talking to Judith Miller actually named Valerie Plame by name or whether or not they just mentioned that Wilson's wife was at the CIA.",
        "Well, if you managed to keep all of that straight, prepare to take notes because it does get confusing.",
        "David Folkenflik, there is a law that says under some circumstances it is a felony to reveal the identity of an undercover CIA agent and that was where this investigation really began.",
        "That's where this investigation began.",
        "It's not at all clear that that's where this investigation is after almost two years.",
        "Special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was appointed in part because Karl Rove was suspected publicly by Mr. Wilson from the outset and he had been a consultant for the then attorney general, you know, John Ashcroft.",

        "That's right, the so-called architect of his election strategy.",
        "Mr. Rove had been suspected; others had been questioned.",
        "They brought in a special prosecutor to handle this so that it would be free of special influence.",
        "In this time, it appears that--if you look, for example, at Judy Miller's account in yesterday's New York Times, that she was questioned on a number of things that would suggest that the special prosecutor may be looking at other kinds of possible violations.",
        "There's certain kinds of espionage law that deals with the handling of classified information.",
        "Mr. Fitzgerald, the prosecutor, seemed very interested in how Lewis Libby, the White House--excuse me, the vice president's chief of staff, who turned out to be Ms. Miller's confidential source, how he handled classified information in his three interviews with her over the summer of 2003 about Mr. Wilson.",
        "In addition, he seems to be asking certain kinds of questions designed to determine if in any way she felt that Mr. Libby had tried to discourage her from testifying or tried to influence her testimony, which seems to suggest an interest in was he trying to obstruct justice in any way.",

        "Yes.",
        "There's a variety of, as you say, complicated issues.",
        "The Times account yesterday was remarkable, the part that was written by its reporters, in its candor in revealing divisions within the paper, anger within the paper about how the paper was handling this case once Judy Miller became an object of the special prosecutor's demand that she testify.",
        "What the story also revealed are--and doesn't fully explain because the reporters themselves cannot explain it, are two things.",
        "First, why did--what was motivating Judy Miller?",
        "She claims that she was defending a high principle of protecting confidential sources.",
        "But then in her own words, she contradicts herself and says that she decided to get out of jail because she owed it to herself, not that there was any high principle that she had now been released from or anything like that.",
        "Well, she did request a letter and then a phone call with the source to make sure that he was OK with her--the fact of her testifying."
