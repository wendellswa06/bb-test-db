        "Although, a year earlier, the same source says that he had released her and she inferred that other things that were communicated at that time might have indicated that he didn't really want to release her, but she decided she never wanted to check with him to find out.",
        "So it was after she got fed up with being in jail that she decided to seek him out now, subsequently.",
        "The second problem with The Times--or the second question that's unanswered and raised by The Times' candor--and I think they deserve an enormous amount of praise for how candid the story was--was why is it that the management of The Times would take a reporter who they didn't trust to cover this subject?",
        "When she continued to cover it and then this coverage got them into this legal jam, they decided to basically hand over the legal strategy entirely to her discretion.",
        "The publisher of the paper, Arthur Sulzberger, is quoted in the story as saying, \"\"Her hands were on the wheel of this car.\"\" And remarkably the editor of the paper, Bill Keller, even said that he didn't even know what was in her notes, because as long as we were defending the high principle of source confidentiality, all the details were unimportant.",
        "Well, then she subsequently hires another--a second lawyer, different from the lawyer that The Times had originally retained, who says to her, according to The Times' own reporting, `I don't defend principles, I defend clients.",
        "Let's get you'--in effect, `Let's get you out of jail.'",
        "Hmm.",
        "So The Times' management of her as a source or as a news object in this case comes under real question, even though The Times coverage yesterday, I think, deserves a lot of praise.",
        "Then her story explaining herself, I think, in the 24 hours since it appeared or somewhat more--36 hours--has brought great wrath on Judy Miller.",
        "Her attempts to defend herself have cast more doubt over her than I think she ever intended.",

        "And the answer is that Bob Novak won't say.",

        "His home base is the Chicago Sun-Times and they have not felt compelled to make him come out and say to the public what he knows.",
        "And was--well, I was going to say, he was also political commentator on CNN but not so much lately.",
        "Well, and that status really isn't resolved.",
        "He sort of stormed off after being told that he would likely be questioned about that and that certainly estranged him from that cable network.",
        "And before we go too much further, Tom Rosenstiel, Robert Novak and Judith Miller are hardly the only journalists who've been caught up in this.",
        "Well, these are terribly distracting days, and not only because of what's going on in the special counsel's office.",
        "The thing to keep in mind here and what makes the case riveting, I think, is that the aides are not just any two aides; they're the two most important aides in the whole, you know, 18 acres, as they call it.",
        "You know, it's the top aide to the vice president, a guy who handles both the national security and the domestic policy roles for the vice president.",

        "All of those people at different times eventually decided to testify before Mr. Fitzgerald after receiving some indication that the waivers that the government asked everyone in the Bush administration to sign were legitimate.",
        "One of the issues here that is important to understand is that Mr. Fitzgerald did something that a lot of journalists find very coercive.",
        "He asked everybody who might be a source in this or part of the investigation to--who works for the government to sign a kind of universal waiver that says if any--`If I ever talk to any journalists, I free them from any promise of confidentiality that they ever made to me.'",
        "And many journalists said, `This is inherently coercive.",
        "These people didn't do this willingly.",
        "That does not absolve me from my promise.'"

        "The article that The Times published yesterday I didn't feel was completely thorough and candid in that there were things--a lot of things left unanswered and unspoken to, but certainly it conveyed the full sense that the reporting ranks were very dismayed by the way in which the news coverage was very much flavored and driven by Miller's own decisions on her legal defense.",
