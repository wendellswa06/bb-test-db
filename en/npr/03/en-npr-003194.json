        "A wonderful program, as usual.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I have a couple of things that concern me.",
        "The--my understanding is that part of the deal for her getting out was that she would not have to disclose any other sources other than talk about what Libby told her.",
        "The second thing that concerns me is that apparently there were other information in her notebooks that she can't say what the source was because she can't remember.",
        "Putting the two pieces together, it makes me wonder whether or not there might have been some kind of a deal struck to get her out of prison so--and I don't mean with the prosecutors now or the special prosecutor, but in releasing her from her confidentiality, to protect somebody higher up the chain.",
        "Well, Tom Rosenstiel, there was a deal that the special prosecutor would only ask her about Lewis Libby--Scooter Libby, the chief of staff of the vice president.",
        "That's correct.",
        "Which, you know, until yesterday didn't necessarily raise a lot of eyebrows.",
        "But now that we know that there are things in the same notebook that pertain to Valerie Plame, who was actually described as `Valerie Flame,' it does raise a question of whether she's protecting other sources.",
        "Now let's not forget that this is a woman who is being applauded for her sacrifice in trying to protect confidential sources.",
        "We also have no idea whether these additional sources are inside the administration, outside the administration, higher than Karl Rove or Lewis Libby or not.",
        "It's hard to get too much higher than Karl Rove or Lewis Libby.",
        "Yes, David?",
        "I mean, you know, I will say that there are those media figures and even some people inside The New York Times who grudgingly acknowledge doubts whether there was a second source.",
        "You know, people were very struck in the same article in The New York Times yesterday--not her account but I believe the account by the team of reporters trying to sort of say The Times' own role in this, that at one point Miller said, `Listen, I was too reporting on this.",
        "I suggested to my editor, directly, that I write a story about Valerie Plame and Joe Wilson.",
        "And the managing editor of the newspaper, Jill Abramson, who was at that time the Washington bureau chief and would likely have been involved in that, said that Miller never made any such story pitch.",
        "And Miller would not identify the...",
        "And Miller would not identify who the editor was, if not Abramson.",
        "So it--you know, it is--if this were not a journalist, journalists would sort of at times test and question the credibility of somebody who has some key memory losses.",

        "There's clearly some dissembling it appears going on by Judith Miller on this.",
        "However, the only problem is that if Lewis Libby is the source of `Valerie Flame' in the notebook and she's lying about it, then she's perjuring herself in bringing--you know, which seems like after 85 days in jail, she wouldn't be very likely to do.",
        "Well, I mean, it's a very fair point.",
        "There's no evidence that she has done that.",
        "It's just very hard to know preci--you know, it's one of these things Mr. Rumsfeld might called a knowable unknowable.",
        "We don't know precisely what happened there, and in fact, you know, she had this arrangement with the special prosecutor that she would only testify about the one source because, as her attorney swore, there was only one source in the case to testify about.",
        "What is more awkward is that she then came back and said there was actually this other person, which would to most people constitute a second source.",
        "And the bottom line here is that she was trying to come clean, and she hasn't come clean, and that's why we're here today with this great frustration.",
        "Thank you very much for the call, Richard.",
        "Sure.",
        "We're talking about the effect on Judith Miller and The New York Times.",
        "Of course, there is pressure on at the White House as well, and joining us now is Michael Duffy, Time magazine's Washington bureau chief.",
        "He's with us by phone from his office.",
        "Michael, always nice to have you on the program.",
        "Nice to be here, Neal.",
        "Today again President Bush declined to comment on what action the White House may take, if any, if its top aides were to be indicted in the Valerie Plame investigation.",
        "At one point the president said anyone in his administration involved in the leak would be fired; then he modified that to say anyone convicted of a crime would be fired.",
        "What is this like at the White House now?",
        "There have been suggestions, Michael Duffy, that the uncharacteristically stumbling start to the Harriet Miers nomination is in some respects attributable to the distraction of Karl Rove."

        "People have written that.",
        "There have been people who said it.",
        "I think you can find other antecedents for the president picking Harriet Miers, as I think since he took over the second term he's leaned most heavily on the people who peopled his first term in the White House.",
        "You know, he sent his national security adviser out to be secretary of State.",
        "He sent his White House counsel out to be attorney general.",
        "Now he's sending his second White House counsel out to be--he really has taken his closest aides and given them the most important jobs in the second term.",
        "What's different about this one is that so many people in his political coalition were vested, heavily invested in this choice in a way that they weren't in the others, and that really has caused a firestorm.",
        "It's hard to see the upside for the president in the Miers choice.",
        "It only looks like downside to me, and that raises the question, I think, of how long she will remain his choice.",
        "I wonder whether she won't begin to think withdrawal is a more likely outcome here than confirmation.",
        "But it's--that too is--it's a moving picture, Neal.",
        "It is all a moving picture, yet is there beginning to be an impression of a White House under siege?",
        "You've got not just the Miers who's in political trouble and certainly no criminal trouble of any sort, but Rove and Scooter, the vice president's chief of staff; you've got the indictments of Tom DeLay--again, that's in the House of Representatives, nothing to do with the White House.",
        "But there is a perception of--you know, an administration that began saying, `We will certainly make a clean break with the moral problems that afflicted the previous administration.",
        "Things aren't so different.",
        "I think we're past the beginning of a problem.",
        "I think they're in their seventh or eighth week of this now, and it's gotten to the point where they're getting so accustomed to this story.",
        "I think they're really braced for something bad to come out of the special prosecutor this week or next.",
        "I'm not sure they know what it is or they have any idea, but you get to a point--all White Houses do--where they just sort of expect the worst thing to happen, and I think that's kind of where they are now.",
        "It may not turn out that way, but it really has a way of being terribly distracting and very difficult, as we saw during the Clinton years, to get started, to get restarted, I guess that's--all these presidencies try to start and restart themselves from time to time, and the more problems you have the harder it is to pull off one of those restarts.",
        "And how hard is it to maintain the idea of staying on message when all of the questions at the White House briefing every day, for example, all of the questions shouted at the president are not on message?",
        "The difficult thing, I think, particularly is at moments like this any president needs his or her base, needs the people who are always consistently for him no--through good news and bad to be there, to be on the team.",
        "And at this moment, chiefly because of the Miers situation but not only, the base among conservatives just really isn't there.",
        "It isn't saluting smartly and going forth.",
        "That really has got--tends to get presidents through in tough moments when you can count on some aspect of your coalition just to be there no matter what, and this isn't true in this case now.",
        "So that's--also makes it hard to restart.",
