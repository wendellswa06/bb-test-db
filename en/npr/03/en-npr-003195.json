        "Thank you.",
        "And, Tom Rosenstiel, let me ask you one final question before we move on to other stories, and that is after all of this, this was a case where Judith Miller spent 85 days in jail on the basis of protecting a confidential source.",
        "As you say, other reporters on the basis of waivers that some might regard as not legit did testify--where's the promise of confidentiality now?",
        "Well, it's been--damage has been done.",
        "First of all, you know, the press here has claimed high principle and when the details are revealed it turns out that there's a lot of personal agenda; it's not all high principle.",
        "Her motives are contradictory.",
        "I think where we're left--with here is that the public is probably left thinking that the press is--when it claims high principle it's not so clear.",
        "I think the chance of our getting a national shield law may actually be enhanced because that would have taken care of this.",
        "I also do believe that legitimate sources who are reluctant to talk to the press and who need to be coaxed--real whistle-blowers--are probably going to feel that they cannot be protected as much as they once were.",
        "I think there is a chilling effect for the most valuable sources of all.",
        "And, David Folkenflik, do we now expect that this is going to be resolved with indictments or not in the next 10 days?",
        "Well, we don't know whether the special prosecutor will conclude that criminal acts were involved in the leaking.",
        "We don't know whether or not he'll feel that ancillary obstruction of justice or perjured testimony--we really don't know.",
        "We do know that this grand jury expires on October 28th, that if he wants to continue the investigation he'd have to get impaneled the second round.",
        "Certainly the administration is girding for the possibility of indictments and perhaps of people as central to their governing, as Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby.",
        "But it's just not clear.",
        "One of the amazing things about this investigation is how tightly Mr. Fitzgerald has kept his cards to his vest.",
        "David Folkenflik, NPR media reporter, thanks very much for being with us.",
        "Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, thank you as always.",

        "Some big city restaurants can't find enough kitchen staff.",
        "Restaurant owners say that's because of low wages and a gap in pay between employees who get tips and those that don't.",
        "To bridge that gap and raise wages, some restaurants are experimenting with pay structure.",

        "To address the problem, Mamaleh's Deli is one of at least a dozen restaurants in the Boston area to adopt what they call revenue sharing.",
        "It varies from restaurant to restaurant, but the mechanics of revenue sharing are simple.",
        "Take a percentage of sales and funnel it to kitchen workers.",
        "At Keith Harmon's three Boston restaurants, a 3 percent fee on all sales goes directly to the kitchen.",
