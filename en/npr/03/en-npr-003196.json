        "A comma.",
        "OK.",
        "I was feeling a semicolon.",
        "I think there are many lessons.",
        "Let me say first that I left Congress because I had a fantastic opportunity to succeed Lee Hamilton as president and CEO of the Wilson Center.",
        "Our chairman, Joe Gildenhorn, is sitting in the audience right here, and it is a marvelous opportunity to be bipartisan in Washington.",
        "Now, I know that sounds like an oxymoron",
        "What have I learned?",
        "Here are a few things.",
        "I was in Congress on 9/11, headed toward the dome of the Capitol where the intelligence rooms were then housed.",
        "They've since moved underground to a bunker that's called the National Visitors Center.",
        "But at the time we had no evacuation plan.",
        "The fourth plane, which passengers heroically crashed in Pennsylvania, we now believe was headed for the dome of the Capitol.",
        "So I was at the second Ground Zero at the time.",
        "Here are a few of the things I think we've learned.",
        "One, calling this a war on terror was a misnomer.",
        "Terror is a tactic.",
        "It is not an enemy, and playing whack-a-mole just to take out people is not a narrative that will ever win the argument with folks who could become suicide bombers, and sadly many are, or who could join the ranks of the educated and hopefully those with opportunity in countries all over the world.",
        "So I think we misnamed what we did.",
        "Secondly, I think that we viewed al-Qaeda as a monolithic organization, a top-down organization, and we thought we could take out the top, and then the rest would crumble.",
        "Well, it's morphed into a horizontal organization with affiliates all over the world, and I think it's more lethal than ever.",
        "So I think that was the second mistake.",
        "Third, we had failed to connect the dots on 9/11.",
        "So we did a very good job, I think - of course I'm one of the co-authors of the intelligence reforms, so I'm totally objective - of connecting the dots horizontally across our government.",
        "I think John Negroponte would agree with this.",
        "But we still haven't done an adequate job of connecting the dots vertically to first responders and law enforcement in our communities, and they're the ones who miraculously have unraveled most of the plots that are still going on in the United States.",
        "And finally, we thought we had fixed the lack of interoperable communications.",
        "You'll all remember the NYPD helicopters were circling overhead, and the Trade Towers were glowing red, but they couldn't communicate with the firefighters who were climbing up the stairs, so tragically.",
        "We fixed that problem in regions and cities, but we still don't have a national interoperable capability 10 years later, and there are new warnings from TTP, one of the terror groups in Pakistan just today, that they are planning to attack us, possibly as many as 10 times in response for the Osama bin Laden takedown."

        "So I think we've learned some lessons.",
        "We have a lot more to learn.",
        "Let me turn next to you, John Negroponte.",
        "What have you learned since 9/11?",
        "Well, I think, first of all, taking this abroad for a second, and our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, I think - and relating back to my own personal experience, having served almost 10 years working on the Vietnam issue way back when, the whole question of time - we are an impatient country.",
        "We engage ourselves in operations and activities of this kind, and we tend to think that they're going to be over in just a matter of months, or certainly not, not - we don't tend to measure these things in terms of years.",
        "And yet the lesson we've learned repeatedly - and I'm afraid we learned it again in the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, just as we did in Vietnam, what started out as what we thought was going to be quite a short-term operation has dragged on, persisted for a long, long time.",
        "So I think that's one takeaway from what we've been through in the past decade.",
        "The second, and it's related, I felt in Vietnam that we didn't focus on Vietnamization - handing over and building up Vietnamese capabilities in the area of security and policing, soon enough, and I think that was true in Iraq.",
        "And I think it was true in Afghanistan.",
        "So that would be my second takeaway: You do have to focus on building the capabilities, particularly the security capabilities, of your local partners so that you can contemplate and plan for a reasonably early withdrawal of our own forces, which turns out to be really the most politically sensitive and neuralgic aspect of our engagement in these foreign situations.",
        "And then lastly, I would say to Jane's point, we have really improved our intelligence and counterterrorist capabilities, and there's a lot of events to confirm that: the demise of Zarqawi in Iraq, which was a brilliant operation, which integrated all the different modes of intelligence collection; bin Laden and so forth.",
        "So I think as we go forward, I look to an American engagement abroad, if these kinds of situations arise, more based on counterterrorism and drawing on our great special operations and intelligence capabilities.",
        "Then going to counterterrorism, the former secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff.",
        "I'd focus on three things.",
        "First, to follow on a point that Jane and John made, it's difficult to overestimate the significance of how we have improved in integrating intelligence in the broadest sense, in operational behavior.",
        "You know, we're simply much better now in not only collecting information, including open-source information, but in integrating it and making use of it in decision-making in real time.",
        "And that yields benefits, whether it's the bin Laden killing earlier this year or whether it's our better ability to detect who's coming to the United States through the airports and things of that sort.",
        "I'd say the second lesson we've learned is that key ultimately is perseverance.",
        "It's not about technical capability or money, although those are important, but in the end, if we don't have the perseverance and the focus to carry through and execute on our strategies, we will fail, and I think that's true whether you look at what we do at home or what we do overseas.",
        "And it's frankly a big challenge for this country, is to maintain that sense of focus and perseverance."

        "Finally, here's something I don't think that we have learned, and that is what makes people become suicide bombers.",
        "The preconceptions we have, which is that it's a long process of people becoming brainwashed and then finally at the end of that process, when they become fervent fanatics, they become willing to become suicide bombers, turns out not to be right.",
        "In many cases, the distance between what we would consider to be a normal Westerner and somebody who's willing to blow themselves and their children up in an airplane is a matter of weeks, and we don't fully understand that.",
        "We don't understand the mechanism of that.",
        "Semicolon?",
        "OK.",
        "Do you...",
        "Yeah, that'll work.",
        "It may be there are many mechanisms, but I think we don't often pay enough attention to trying to unpack what it is that motivates people and produces a pool within which fanatics and extremists are still quite capable of recruiting.",
        "Turn next to Thomas Friedman, the New York Times columnist and a Pulitzer Prize winner.",
        "His new book, \"\"That Used to Be Us,\"\" which he wrote with Michael Mandelbaum, comes out in September.",
        "Tom Friedman, what have you learned since September the 11th?",
        "Well, Neal, I by accident was in Israel on September 11.",
        "I was there covering the latest Israeli-Palestinian fighting.",
        "And I actually learned the most important lesson on the morning of September 12, that has really guided my thinking ever since.",
        "That morning, I called friends of mine in the Israeli defense establishment and said you guys have dealt with suicide bombing a lot.",
        "I really want to know everything you've learned from that experience.",
        "And they brought a group together, and we had a conversation very early on the morning of September 12, and what they said was - this is not verbatim, but the basic message was this.",
        "They said: Tom, we're really good.",
        "Our intel is really good.",

        "Until and unless the Arab Muslim community fundamentally delegitimizes these kinds of attacks, they're not going to go away.",
