        "Hi.",
        "I have been - I'm a practicing Muslim, and I had been living in a small town in Michigan for three years.",
        "And we moved to the next town, and a few months later, 9/11 happened.",
        "And I was struck by the kindness of my former neighbors, who phoned me to make sure that I was all right and offered to go to the grocery store for me in case I would feel intimidated.",
        "And I also must say that the police in Ann Arbor guarded the mosque to make sure that no one would be prevented from attending the mosque.",
        "And at the University of Michigan, girls who were not Muslim put on scarves, and they said: We have solidarity with the Muslim students here, and we recognize that there are many Muslims living in the United States, but they, too, do not approve of these measures.",
        "And I was very happy to see that the rule of law and the following of law and protection of individual rights did not diminish in the United States, and it was preserved.",
        "Maria, has that been your experience in the years intervening?",
        "Yes, it has.",
        "And I'm very pleased with the American system and laws that people, of course, are very upset and Muslims are very upset about this horrible event.",
        "I mean, this is an abomination.",
        "But I'm very pleased to see that the American system is not shaken and that investigations are made properly.",
        "If there are innocent people, normal Muslims living in the United States, they are not being attacked or wrongly persecuted for something that they do not believe in and that they do not condone themselves.",
        "In general, I found it wonderful and remarkable that the law was preserved here.",
        "Maria, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Appreciate it.",

        "Well, you know, we all know that there are incidents because when there are incidents of discrimination against Muslims, they're rightly reported in the newspaper.",

        "And I think that's something we should be proud of.",
        "And I would give President Bush credit for having sort of immediately made that point.",
        "At the same time, you know, in our earnest desire not to, you know, make this a, you know, sort of pan-Muslim issue, we also ended up actually not identifying the problem.",

        "The Patriot Act was narrowed by Congress because the first version wasn't as protective as it should have been, and there's still work to do there.",

        "And in Yemen, I would - I think we have to have a robust debate about the War Powers Act, which is a flawed statute, and when Congress needs to declare war.",
        "But Congress should be fully and completely informed under the terms of the National Security Act, and I think that has been a problem for all the years since 9/11.",
        "It's getting better, but it's not fully fixed.",
        "And Congress should do a better job of organizing itself to do effective oversight over the Executive Branch, as it's supposed to, as an independent branch of government."

        "I study Muslim public opinion around the world.",

        "But I think that if they think they can feed the crocodile as they're trying to get across the river, I think they've got two thoughts coming.",
        "And I think in the case of Saudi Arabia, that became very apparent to them back in 2003 when they had some very severe terrorist attacks in their own country.",
        "And I've noticed a shift in their approach to these kinds of issues since that time, and in Pakistan, it's the same thing.",
        "There was a time when a lot of this terrorist activity was confined to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and into the cross-border activities over into Afghanistan.",
        "But in recent years, this activity has now spread into what the Pakistanis call the settled areas.",
        "Even Mrs. Bhutto, the prime minister of the country, was killed by these terrorists.",
        "So I think sooner or later, they're going to have to come to terms with these issues.",
        "I think, in the case of Pakistan, it's a reflection of the weakness of their security institutions that they have not been able to adequately confront this threat.",
        "But I think deep in their hearts, they know they are threatened by this, and sooner or later, they've got to do something about it.",

        "I think the last questioner made a very important point about where the majority of Muslims are, and they're really victims of this rather than perpetrators.",
        "But there is a minority - and in absolute numbers, it's not a trivial number - that have enlisted in this extremism, that part of the challenge here is, first we have to recognize that it is an ideology of extremism, and we've got to confront it as such and not merely as a tactic.",
        "And secondly, we have to make the point that you cannot make a pact with the devil.",
        "As John Negroponte pointed out, in 2003, the Saudis suffered a series of attacks, and they turned into a phenomenal cooperator with the United States in terms of intelligence sharing and joint activity.",
        "In Pakistan, as we've seen just in recent weeks, there's a fundamental ambivalence, and they have been times that - and we see elements of the Pakistani establishment that appears to support groups that are terrorists.",
        "They may be focused on India rather than the U.S., but the problem is you can't tame the tiger.",
        "Once you feed the tiger and you get on the tiger's back, it's going to take you to eating up places that you didn't think.",
