        "We're talking about lessons learned from 9/11, almost 10 years on.",
        "And we're talking with some of the people who worked to put those lessons into practice in the months and years after the attacks: Michael Chertoff, former secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Ambassador John Negroponte, first director of National Intelligence, former Representative Jane Harman, longtime member and sometime chair of the House Intelligence Committee.",
        "Also with us: author and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman.",
        "What have you learned since 9/11?",
        "800-989-8255.",

        "We went to war in Iraq, at least in part, to create a dynamic, democratic, capitalist state in the Middle East that would serve as a model to help that region transform itself.",
        "Things did not turn out as planned.",
        "Should one of the things that we have learned since 9/11 is the limits of U.S.",
        "ambition?",
        "Well, it was a point I was trying to figure out how I was going to weave into this conversation this afternoon, the whole question about the limitations on our ability to engage in nation-building.",
        "And I've really had an opportunity to watch that over a 50-year period in Vietnam and Iraq and elsewhere.",
        "And I think it's just very, very hard to do.",
        "I think that if you look at America's experience going all the way back to our occupation of the Philippines, back at the turn of the last century, our efforts in Central America in the 1910s and 1920s, where we sent these expeditions there that governed these countries, and then immediately their political systems lapsed back into disrepair once we left.",
        "So I think we just need to approach that side of things with a little bit of humility as to the limits as to what we can accomplish.",
        "And I think that we - when we go into these kinds of situations, I think we should focus on enhancing local security capabilities, and perhaps some of the macro economic issues, help them set those things up.",
        "But the idea that we can start helping them devise their political system in some kind of a detail, I think, is very hard indeed.",
        "And I think it's something that we just haven't quite gotten right yet.",
        "It's a lesson we haven't yet learned, how to go about nation building.",
        "Having said all of that, I looked at what's happened in Iraq with a reasonable degree of optimism as to the political system there.",
        "And I think they're doing a darn sight better than things looked to us back in the dire days of 2006 when the country was on the verge of a sectarian civil war.",
        "I've got to say, that's a pretty low bar, you know.",
        "It was a low bar, but I think things are looking better than we have reason to expect."

        "That intelligence, obviously, was flat wrong, and I did not and I would not authorize action in a country for the purpose of nation-building.",

        "But the difficulty of doing it there, and certainly, the enormous difficulties of doing it in Afghanistan - I applaud the president for changing our strategy a few days ago, because I think it's - we're moving to a better place - should show us that there are limits to our power.",
        "And at some point, this is a zero-sum game.",
        "There aren't anymore troops to send anywhere and there isn't any money - more money to pay for this, and so we better choose wisely.",

        "Frankly, Congress funded a lot of things, including basic research.",
        "And when we were - when I was at the DHS, we allocated among our budget for science and technology a certain percentage that was used for - we used to call it a Hail Mary pass, transformative research that was maybe low probability but could be really a game-changer.",
