        "I think, more likely, it will be in some other part of the world, outside the United States, perhaps against some kind of United States interests in Europe or in the Middle East or Asia or elsewhere.",
        "But, no, I don't think we should be more concerned or even as concerned as we were after September 12th.",
        "Jane Harman.",

        "I think that we have done many things right, but I think that al-Qaida is a very different organization, as I said earlier, from what it was on 9/11.",
        "It's no longer a top-down, highly centralized organization.",
        "It has morphed into a loose affiliation of groups, not all of them called al-Qaida, around the world.",
        "And I think we can worry less about al-Qaida central in Pakistan than we ought to worry about al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, headquartered in Yemen by this cleric, Awlaki.",
        "I think that what's going on in the boonies of Yemen directly affects homegrown radicals in the United States.",
        "And I do fear, not massive 9/11-style attacks, but a series of conventional attacks which we can't protect 100 percent against.",
        "Let's understand that.",
        "We can manage risks very well, but things will happen and have happened in our country.",
        "And it's false security to tell people to go back to their jobs.",
        "What's important is to tell people what to look for and what to do.",

        "Most of it totally law-abiding and much of it integrated in our country in a way it is not in Western Europe and that will help us keep the country safe.",

        "We'll end with a couple of emails.",
        "This is from Robert in Bexley, Ohio.",

        "His friend Harry Belafonte was there; so were writer James Baldwin, playwright Lorraine Hansberry and singer Lena Horne.",

        "They came there, they thought, to tell Bobby what the situation was in American civil rights and what he ought to be doing.",
        "Bobby saw the meeting, instead, as his explaining all the things he and his brother had been trying to do.",

        "Tye, author of \"\"Bobby Kennedy: The Making Of A Liberal Icon,\"\" says the group told Kennedy he was moving way too slowly.",
        "Stung, Kennedy wrapped up the meeting and fumed for the next couple of days.",
        "Then, says Larry Tye, Robert Kennedy did what he always did.",
        "He started out with a narrow view.",
        "And he ended up not long after being able to put himself in the shoes of the people that he was supposedly facing off against and deciding that they were right and, more importantly, that he was going to try to do something about that.",
        "For a rich kid from Boston who'd had virtually no exposure to the black struggle, that was pretty surprising.",
        "In his book, \"\"The Promise And The Dream,\"\" David Margolick describes the cautious relationship between Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. Margolick says King was a controversial figure for much of white America, but he also had the power of turning out the black vote - a critical demographic."

        "The race of murder victims is also an issue.",

        "Thanks so much for joining us, Paul.",
        "It's great to be here, Farai.",
        "Well, let me talk to you, first of all, about prosecutors.",
        "I think that something like 98 percent of DAs, district attorneys, are white.",
        "Does that have an influence on these issues?",
        "And tell us more about what you did as a federal prosecutor.",
        "Well, I never prosecuted anybody for death penalty cases, in part because I'm against the death penalty, but in part because I was a prosecutor of white collar criminals and the reality, Farai, is that virtually everybody on death row is a poor person.",
        "They're charged with crimes where often they have ineffective lawyers and the reason that they get the death penalty isn't so much based on the crime they committed but based on factors that really shouldn't be relevant, like the quality of their lawyer, and like whether the person they killed was white or black.",
        "If you're--kill a white person, you're much more likely to get the death penalty than if you kill a black person.",
        "And if you're an African-American who kills a white person, that's the most common category of people who get the death penalty.",
        "But, in fact, there was a Supreme Court case, McCleskey vs. Kemp, in 1987, that basically said, `Well, hey, there's discrepancies, but we can't do anything about it.",
        "So what influence has that had on the whole debate over the color of punishment?",
        "Well, a lot of people think that that's a worse case than the Plessy vs. Ferguson case, because in Plessy vs. Ferguson, the court at least required equality.",
        "The court said separate but equal is the law of the land, and, of course, that was overturned.",
        "In the McCleskey case, the courts said, `There is a risk that some people are being sentenced to death on the basis of race.",
        "But it's not an unconstitutionally acceptable risk.",
        "That is, it's a constitutionally acceptable risk because the court said prosecutors need this discretion and there's always a risk that when white people exercise discretion they're going to use race to make decisions about who gets the death penalty; prosecutors, about whether they should seek it; and judges and juries, about whether they should impose it.",
        "According to some studies, race is just about the most important factor, except for torture.",
        "If victims were tortured, that's extremely likely to help juries decide for the death penalty, but next to that it's race.",
        "It's not necessarily how many people were killed or, you know, the manner in which they were killed.",
        "So race definitely influences juries.",
        "And in 1998 Kentucky was the first state that had the death penalty to pass something called the Racial Justice Act.",
        "Now what is that act and why hasn't it gone to more states?",
        "Well, what these acts do is allow statistics about how race matters with who gets the death penalty to be used as a reason for juries not to impose death in particular cases.",
        "But what we see, Farai, is that there are some cases in which virtually everybody gets the death penalty, some cases in which nobody gets the death penalty.",
        "So a classic case where everybody gets it is a mass murderer.",
        "Classic case in which virtually nobody gets it is a man who kills his wife.",
        "Now that shows you other--how arbitrary the penalty is, but usually those men don't get it.",
        "There's this middle range of cases, and an example there is someone who kills during an armed robbery, where race matters.",
        "If you are a black person who kills a white person in that kind of crime, you're most likely to get the death penalty.",
        "And actually, in the McCleskey case, the court said it's really an issue for legislatures, not judges, to decide, and so what Racial Justice Acts do is to allow juries to consider discrimination and racism in making the decision about whether to impose the death penalty.",
        "In the case of Tookie Williams, he was someone who was convicted for killing white and Asian victims, not black victims.",
        "Do you believe, given what we've just talked about, that this is making a difference in his case?"

        "So he made that point.",
        "Internationally, however, he made a point less appropriate for a mayor or a governor or senator in saying that the United States not simply recognizes Islam as one of the faiths of our own people, but recognizes around the world the vitality and the importance of the Islamic faith to a billion of the world's people.",
        "And here, he was following the lead of President George W.",
