        "Well, we've done a bunch of six-word memoir projects as you've mentioned.",

        "So we look at somebody like Mr. Williams, who's been on death row for decades; he's reformed his life.",
        "He's rehabilitated.",
        "And so the issue is whether, based on the worst day of his life, he should be condemned or whether--again, not that he shouldn't be punished, but just whether he should be allowed to live.",
        "Well, when you look at Governor Schwarzenegger's position on this, you've got a situation where you have a governor that's been bruised, absolutely politically bruised, by a special election that he himself called for.",
        "Some people are saying that that means that clemency would be a good move for him.",
        "But even though support for the death penalty in America has ebbed, it's still well over 50 percent.",
        "So once the courts have exhausted all of the appeals, or prisoners have exhausted all their appeals with the courts, it's up to politicians in office, like governors, to make these decisions.",
        "Is that a good method?",
        "I mean, it's simply the way it is, but from a legal point of view, is it smart for governors ultimately to have that discretion?",
        "Well, there is still a role for mercy and redemption in our justice system, so to the extent that the governor and the president has the last word, then, yes, that role is appropriate.",
        "The problem, Farai, as you suggest, is when it gets political.",
        "Well, one of the last governors to commute sentences in California--actually, the last one--was Ronald Reagan.",
        "Before that, again, politics has always impacted the process.",
        "There was a case in which a governor believed that another prisoner's sentence should be commuted.",
        "But he also had to get a minimum-wage bill passed and so he made a deal with the Republicans: `OK, we'll execute this guy if you-all agree to vote for the minimum-wage bill.",
        "So that shows you how, when politics infects the system of who gets to live and who gets to die, it's just fundamentally unfair, some would say barbaric."

        "Is that going to be a factor here?",
        "Well, it certainly will be a factor, but the point is that Mr. Williams has really lived a remarkable life.",
        "He's impacted thousands, if not millions, of children and teen-agers who say that they won't live a life of crime, based on Mr. Williams' example, so, hopefully, the governor will consider the whole picture, and, again, not just what Mr. Williams is accused of doing on the worst day of his life.",
