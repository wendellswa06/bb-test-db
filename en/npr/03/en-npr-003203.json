        "I think what's amazing about his story is the slice of American show business that it tells.",
        "I mean, he had the roughest existence in those early years.",

        "I mean, that was really what pulled him through in many situations.",
        "he would carry a jewelry kit - by jewelry kit, what I mean is he had a beautiful watch that was well-made and then he had a number of duplicate watches that had very cheap works inside of them.",
        "Very often, he would skip out on a hotel bill by offering the proprietor his watch.",
        "And, of course, it took the skills of a magician.",
        "The man would open up the watch and check the works and decide it was a good watch, and a few seconds later it would be switched for the cheaper watch and Thurston would be on to the next town.",
        "It's interesting that in the 1920s, having left all of that behind and becoming an upstanding man of the theater..."
