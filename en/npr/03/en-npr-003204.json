        "...he did a show for Calvin Coolidge in the White House, a Christmas show, and one of the features was supposedly smashing Calvin Coolidge's watch and putting it back together again.",
        "We know that was exactly the skill that he used in the mining towns (unintelligible).",
        "Wow.",
        "As we mentioned earlier, the other great magician of the era was Harry Houdini.",
        "He and Thurston were fierce, fierce rivals.",
        "But they obviously knew each other.",
        "They also had a friendship.",
        "What was that relationship like?",
        "They were contemporaries.",
        "Thurston was a few years older, and they met in 1893 at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago where they were both doing side show exhibits.",
        "I mean, they really were at the bottom.",
        "And even then, they were a little bit in competition.",
        "And Houdini always aspired to be a great magician.",
        "He always wanted a big, acceptable magic show in the great tradition.",
        "But he just was never cut out for it.",
        "And so he became famous as an escape artist, getting out of tanks of water and getting out of handcuffs.",
        "And that's really how we remember him today, and that's how audiences recognized in the teens and the '20s.",
        "Thurston was the one who pioneered the big magic show and then who toured across America as a great magician.",
        "In his day, he was more famous than Houdini, but he - was he also jealous of him?",
        "I think everyone was always jealous of the attention that Houdini got.",
        "Houdini was a great publicist.",
        "A writer that I knew who used to work with Houdini said that he was both his own Barnum and his own freak.",
        "At the same time, it went both ways, because Houdini was fiercely jealous of Thurston's success as a magician, that he could do traditional magic and attract an audience, which was something Houdini had never quite learned to do.",
        "But ultimately, of course, it's Houdini who everybody remembers and not Howard Thurston.",
        "That's like the story of America here on Labor Day, isn't it?",
        "On Labor Day, you can - you can see that sweaty 1930s poster coming to life."

        "We have to remember, you know, Houdini was probably the first celebrity who had a publicist hired for him after he died to keep his name in the papers.",
        "He always had a sense that he wanted his name to live, and his name did live.",
        "And as a writer told me who knew both men, he said, you know, all of Thurston's publicity was about getting you into the theater.",
        "And all of Houdini's publicity was about creating a legend.",

        "One might expect that having doctors do house calls nights and evenings and weekends for everyone would be something no country could afford, but not so.",
        "OK.",
        "So how do they do it?",
        "Well, it turns out that getting sick and being treated by a primary care doctor, even after-hours, is a cost saver.",
        "The important word here is primary care doctor.",
        "In the U.S., some of these doctors do house calls, but the main place where people go to get care after-hours and on the weekends is often the hospital emergency room.",
        "Now, that's partly because many people are uninsured and they don't even have a family doctor.",
        "But the emergency room is an expensive place to get medical care.",
        "So in the Netherlands, every neighborhood has what they call an after-hours clinic or a post.",
