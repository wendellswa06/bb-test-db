        "I mean, does this satisfy their demands or will there be further demands to come?",
        "I think there are further demands to come, but the important distinction is this wasn't the opposition's movement - the opposition here meaning Nawaz Sharif tagged onto it, leashed onto this movement, but this was never really his movement.",
        "This was a movement that actually goes back two years to General Musharraf.",
        "General Musharraf is the one who had removed this particular chief justice.",
        "This was a truly grass root, truly civil society, truly democratic movement of the liberal, educated, progressive forces in the country.",
        "And what the opposition found was that it wasn't that they were leading the movement, they were actually following that movement.",
        "And therefore part of the tension that is going to be seen now is, is the opposition going to try to, sort of, latch onto this victory, or is it going to remain a victory of civil society at large.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you mentioned the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif who had been exiled, returned to Pakistan.",
        "He told supporters this weekend, from here, God willing, the fate of this nation will change.",
        "From here a revolution will come.",
        "What kind of revolution do you think he is talking about there?",
        "And change is coming, and they're not going to like it.",
        "We have not used it to pay compensation, nor do we use it to pay any dividends or lobbying costs.",
        "At Morgan Stanley the most senior members of the firm, including myself, did not receive any year-end bonus in 2008.",
        "While no bonuses were the rule for the eight CEOs, Vikram Pandit of Citigroup wants them one better."

        "Ackerman said there are calm assurances that they were using the TARP funds to increase lending, didn't square with what he was hearing in the real world.",
        "Where people can't get loans, where people can't refinance their homes, where people can't buy automobiles, can't send their children to college, it seems to me and to some of us, that this money hasn't reached the street, that you're not loaning it out.",
        "How do you explain that?",
        "Can I take a crack at that, Mr. Congressmen?",

        "Finance companies, car finance companies, mortgage companies, money funds, bond funds that did withdrew money from the system and make it much harder in the system.",
        "That created some of this crisis we have.",
        "Can you…",
        "So, according to Dimon, it's other financial intuitions, not the group assembled today, withholding credit from Main Street.",
        "In the end, the bankers survived the day without many bruises.",
