        "I told him, fairly confident, I would leave after the end of his first term.",
        "And secondly, at no time was anybody able - because of the system we designed and approved by President Bush, the system we created in order to raise the threat level meant one, that no one individual could raise it, and two, that the security would be always at the center.",

        "Here's why.",
        "It's well-funded at about $7500 per child; there's one teacher for every 10 children; teachers are paid about $42,000 a year on average; they must be fully certified in early childhood education and have at least a bachelor's degree."

        "Within approximately six months, that amount went up to 3,000 people a day.",
