        "Doctors Without Borders, the global humanitarian aid organization, has compiled its annual list of the 10 most under-reported humanitarian stories.",
        "It's the 10th year the group has done this.",
        "We've invited in the executive director of Doctors Without Borders, Nicholas de Torrente, to find out what we should have paid more attention to.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Yeah, we've been looking at your list and I see a number of countries that have made it into the headlines - Somalia, Burma, Colombia.",
        "Are you suggesting that the human cost of these conflicts don't capture our attention?",
        "That's our perspective and our angle as a medical humanitarian organization with, you know, teams on the ground trying to deal with the consequences in terms of, you know, what happens to the population.",
        "I think you're right that there has been quite a bit of coverage on some of these crises but not sufficiently we feel on the consequence of the human cost of what is occurring.",
        "So point to something on this list and tell me where maybe we had the political story but not the consequential human cost story.",
        "Burma is a good example of that.",
        "I mean, there has been a lot of focus and rightfully so on the political situation, the repressive nature of the regime, the pro-democracy demonstrations and the crackdown.",
        "What is less known the - government is at the same time repressive, and also, very neglectful of the health needs of its population.",
        "There's a very large HIV/AIDS epidemic there.",
        "There is a lot of malaria.",
        "There are a lot of cases like that.",
        "And the government is really doing very little about it.",
        "Take for instance, Rakhine State, which is in the western part of the country.",
        "The Muslim population there is not even considered to be Burmese citizens who subjected to all forms, all kinds of abuse.",
        "That is not being reported on very much.",
        "It's difficult, of course, to get access, for journalists to cover the story, which is a common thread throughout, in fact, these crises and these under-reported stories that it is actually difficult not just for aid organizations to provide assistance but also for journalists to report.",
        "You also mentioned the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis.",
        "Now, disease wasn't really in the headlines this year as it has been in the past.",
        "For example, we didn't hear as much about AIDS maybe because a lot of have been done to combat it.",

        "In the case of TB, it's really the neglected of the major killer diseases.",
        "It's been actually on the rise because of the co-infection with HIV/AIDS that is driving the epidemic particularly in Southern Africa.",
        "But also, the failure and the ineffectiveness of the approach to prevent and treats TB that is leading to much higher rates now of multi drug-resistant TB, about half a million people last year was thought to have been infected by it.",
        "And really the treatment options that we have are very, very insufficient, inadequate, highly toxic, and ineffective.",
        "And there was this much greater effort than this to be paid to research and development and to new tools, new approaches to be able to deal with this problem.",
        "It's a really a runaway threat in some sort of global health.",
        "The fourth item on your list, I thought, might have been a good news story - expanded use of nutrient dense ready-to-use foods crucial for reducing childhood malnutrition.",
        "Could you explain what you mean by that?",
        "There is really hope on the horizon for tackling acute childhood malnutrition, which is the leading cost of deaths of children under 5, about half of all deaths of children under 5-years-old are associated with malnutrition.",
        "And now, there are these new products which are ready-to-use nutrient dense foods that don't need cooking, don't need preparations.",
        "And they are specially formulated really to deal with acute episodes of malnutrition.",
        "And so kids can be treated at home.",
        "So it's a whole new field that is opened now, a new approach.",
        "And it's much more effective and can really - we have a prospect of making a major, major turn, not just in sub-Saharan(ph) Africa but also in Southeast Asia, the malnutrition hotspots of the world.",
        "You don't say that these are the 10 worst crises in the world that Doctor Without Borders is talking about.",
        "You say they're the most under-reported.",
        "How crucial is the media to getting?",
        "And I don't mean to pat my colleagues on the back or thump them in the nose here.",
        "But how important is it?",
        "The sheer fact that you have media attention does not necessarily lead to, you know, appropriate solutions.",
        "We've had lot of attention to the situation in, of course, in Iraq and in Sudan and Darfur, in particular.",
        "And those are not on our list, not because they're - as you point out - they're not serious in terms of the humanitarian issues but because they are getting quite a bit of attention.",
        "Are they shifts that you volunteer for or is this something that you do sort of as a favor to other people?",
        "During the course of that discussion, it was very similar to discussions we probably had at least, I think, probably eight to 10 other times during my tenure as secretary.",
        "The interesting thing is you don't know that we had them until I just told you because more often than not, as a result of the discussion and the honest exchange of opinions among the members, we chose not to raise the threat level.",
        "So at the end of this, it's a dramatic - listen, it's a dramatic weekend.",
        "It's the weekend before the election.",
        "People really charged - some people feel very strongly we ought to raise it in the aftermath of what happened in Spain earlier that year, when a terrorist event changed the outcome of the election.",
        "I'm using, in this book, we don't think we ought to go up.",
        "So I say to myself in the book: Is it politics?",
        "Is it security?",
        "People have interpreted that as me second-guessing my colleagues.",
        "As I said before, we had this discussion eight or 10 times, and nobody, during the course of any of those discussions, do I believe - one, you couldn't pressure anybody else because it was designed for people to vent their opinion, but no one felt anything other than to make an honest judgment, a tough call based on security, not politics."

        "So the recommendations of Secretary Rumsfeld and Attorney General Ashcroft, you think, were based on their honest assessments, and not based on politics.",
        "Correct.",
        "Correct.",
        "I mean, and again, the drama, when you think about it for a moment - I mean, you can define politics in a lot of different ways, but the drama - we are a couple of days out from a national election.",
        "I'm thinking in my own mind in - you know, earlier that year, the Spanish national election was affected by a terrorist attack.",
        "We've got to do the right thing here.",
        "We've got to protect our ability to go to the polls, but we can't overreact to the intelligence.",
        "Look, we had, I think, 18 or 20 either audio or videotapes that we listened to from time to time, either from bin Laden or al-Zawahiri, his number two, and you know, we did not raise the threat level 18 or 20 times during my tenure.",
        "I mean, you look at those and you look at other intelligence, and you make a hard, difficult, tough call.",
        "That's what Secretary Rumsfeld did.",
        "That's what Attorney General Ashcroft did, Secretary Powell, Director Mueller, etc., etc. But we did that eight or 10 times.",
        "The process worked, and politics was not involved.",
        "Let me ask you a question about another instance, and the Department of Homeland Security did raise the alert level in August, 2004 for the financial industry.",
        "This was only in parts of the country.",
        "Even though you acknowledge in your book the information about that threat was years old, you perceived the threat level was warranted to be elevated.",
        "It was then lowered exactly one week after the election.",
        "People look at that timing and say, wait a minute.",
        "That wasn't political?",
        "Well, you know, it's - I'm glad you raise that, because people have asked me do I have any regrets during the course of my tenure as secretary, and on that one I do.",
        "Again, we had a similar discussion in August, once the Pakistani intelligence service found a hard drive, and they had surveyed the New York Stock Exchange and a couple corporate buildings here and in northern New Jersey and I think the World Bank down in D.C.",
        "And again, the same group got together.",
        "We all expressed our opinions, and there was a consensus, and Fran Townsend went in and said to the president, Mr. President, the consensus is we raise the threat level, but not nationally, just in these three communities.",
        "So we did.",
        "On my way out to hold the press conference, because I was assigned the responsibility of making that announcement, it was suggested that I laud the president's leadership in the effort to combat terrorism.",
        "Now, I had raised the threat level a couple of times before, and I never mentioned the president's name because it shouldn't have been mentioned.",
        "We were talking about raising the threat level.",
        "So at the last minute, hurried, I got the press corps waiting.",
        "All right, I'm going to put it in.",
        "I regret using - while I wanted to the laud the president and in the political world, during an election cycle you would do that, it wasn't my place to do so.",
        "And in doing so, I created a sideshow that created an impression that truly didn't exist.",
        "We had made our decision, made our decision about raising the threat level after the same kind of honest discussion, and no one was responsible for creating that problem other than yours truly."
