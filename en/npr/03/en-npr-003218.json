        "Listen, I think the challenge with the TSA is that until, as a country, we are prepared to manage the risk rather than treating everybody as potentially a risk, we're going to see that.",
        "And that calls for a political decision that the screeners would say to a five-year-old boy or an 80-year-old woman, the prospects of the boy or the older woman being terrorists are pretty remote, run them through the metal detector, but no secondary screening.",
        "But we don't have that mindset yet.",
        "I talk about that very specifically in the book.",
        "We shouldn't be breathless about this risk.",

        "We'll be able to manage it.",
        "Every day we should be better prepared for it, but we also need to accept the notion we can never totally eliminate it, and in that process, think about managing it more carefully.",
        "TSA is a classic example, and there's not a TSA screener in the world, or any TSA leader that wants to be called in front of a congressional committee because the young child - that something happened on their watch.",
        "But I do think we ought to give them greater flexibility and greater discretion.",
        "Until we are able to manage the risk, they'll never have that discretion.",

        "Well, and I think at the end of the day, one of the challenges - he did get through, and I think that's one of the challenges we still have.",
        "And it's a great point that you raise, Neal, in this country, is the technology of detection is still at a stage where we probably won't be able to manage the risk like I want to.",
        "But in time, our ability to detect explosives and bio-agents and radiological materials, we'll get that.",
        "I mean, I know there's a lot of companies small and large working on it, but we've got a lot of great people out there.",
        "We just have to get them better technology to help them do their jobs.",
        "We're speaking with former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge about the decisions he made after 9/11 and the ongoing push and pull between security and civil rights.",

        "What was - Secretary Ridge, what was your opinion of peeling off the Coast Guard legacy missions, like icebreaking and Aids to Navigation into a private or separate government agency like NOAA?",
        "It seems like the Coast Guard is going in the direction of a more police-like or military security force mission profile.",
        "There are many in the service who would prefer the traditional, more benevolent missions of search and rescue, icebreaking, buoy tending and environmental response remain the service's primary focus.",
        "I, for one, lament the more aggressive stance my former service has taken, such as permanently mounting automatic weapons on small response boats."

        "And I hope one of these days a couple members of Congress, Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate become their champions and give them far more money and resources that they need to do their jobs.",

        "We were the new agency, and this is - we're almost on the football season, so pardon the analogy for you non-football fans.",
        "But if the NFL said next year you're allowed to have 12 men on offense and 12 men on defense, think about what happens in terms of shared responsibility, communication, etc., etc. Well, we already had a group of very capable Cabinet agencies and capable Cabinet leaders.",
        "And if you took a private poll, I daresay I'll be at least half of them thought that the new department was a bad idea.",
        "They weren't opposed to Tom Ridge, but obviously, when President Bush says we're going to build the department, we build it, and they all salute and move on.",

        "Actually, I think they did a marvelous job because homeland security was the mission of all of us, but at the federal government, we try to protect the tangible things: people, places and things.",
        "And we try to protect to the intangible: privacy, civil rights and our brand, our value system.",
        "And in the scheme of things, we admit to stubbing our toe from time to time, but the verdict, I think, is a very positive one.",
