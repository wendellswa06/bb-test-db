        "Here's an email from Desmond in San Antonio.",
        "I recently graduated from a novice Homeland Security program at UT San Antonio.",
        "And after the program ended, most students were still asking: Does the increase in global terrorism illustrate a failure of a responsible U.S.",
        "foreign policy?",
        "If so, what could be done to reverse the surge in international terrorism?",
        "You know, I think the increase in international terror means we need more allies, because, frankly, if you take a look at - the United States has been one of the few - the leading country, but there have been very few other countries that have committed the resources - both military, intelligence, law enforcement and the like - to combat the scourge of international terrorism.",
        "It is an international scourge, which means it requires an international response.",
        "And to that end, there haven't been enough countries that have been terribly responsive.",
        "In your book, you described the drinking from the fire hose of information shortly after you're appointed to be director of Homeland Security in the White House at that point.",
        "And, you know, again, you were put into a very difficult position.",
        "But anyway, you talk about learning about Sayyid Qutb, an Egyptian scholar and activist and how he was tortured in an Egyptian prison.",
        "Right.",
        "And how the same happened to Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, who is now the number two in al-Qaida.",
        "And the result of these - of the torture in those Egyptian dungeons was, I think you write, predictable, a rage for revenge.",
        "And then you'd go on to say…",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's a point I think about whenever I'm engaged in discussions about the effects of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, it's - make no mistake about it, Abu Ghraib - I'm saying this as a former soldier.",
        "I know the kind of training the men and women in the military in this country get.",
        "And I also believe in my heart, in my mind, that the treatment that was chronicled there was an aberration.",
        "That's not normally how we do things.",
        "And for that - but for that reason, I think it's regrettable - simply because it could be used as a recruiting tool.",
        "It's not how we operate in the military.",
        "We're trained differently.",
        "As a matter of fact, I know of my own personal experience, some of my men in Vietnam were publicly exposed to their own peril because they refuse to engage an enemy because they thought there were civilians in the way.",
        "So, I don't do that as a standard operating procedure.",
        "But even though it was an occasion where we should - and we should have corrected it, and we did, and everybody did, it was a good recruiting tool."

        "I have one official say, I know it's not your criminal justice system, and it's probably not a uniform code of military justice.",

        "Do you agree with him?",
        "Well, I've said before, I disagreed with the vice president, because I do think waterboarding is an extreme form of torture.",

        "And more importantly, or at least as importantly, is that the manner we use them to interrogate prisoners three, four, five years ago should potentially be subject to criminal penalties.",

        "And frankly, if I am looking for a job with the CIA or the FBI, I guess I'd try to avoid being interrogated because some future attorney general might say I did something criminal as I try to protect my country.",
