        "This is the culmination of probably a decade of work since companies first had access to technology that would allow them to see through these sheets of salt that are thousands of feet thick that lie in various layers and protrusions known as domes.",

        "The question is how long will prices stay at a level that will support drilling these kinds of projects.",
        "That's another reason you're seeing them being drilled right now.",
        "Prices are high enough to support the initial economics.",
        "Once you get the well on production, prices could drop even $25, $30-a-barrel, and projects still would be economic to operate.",
        "It just might not be economic to drill another one like it.",
        "So companies are taking advantage of high prices.",
