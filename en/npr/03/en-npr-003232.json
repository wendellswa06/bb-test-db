        "And McCain, who entered 2007 as the ostensible frontrunner for 2008, obviously finds himself trailing among many Republican voters not because of the war so much.",
        "I think more of his problems are the fact that he dissed the Republican establishment, the conservative establishment back when he ran for president in 2000.",

        "Well, without putting too much emphasis on the fundraising horserace, he did have sort of disappointing numbers from the first quarter results.",
        "Do you think this is enough, his sort of ongoing appeal to people who continue to support the war in Iraq is enough to make up some difference in that electorate?",
        "Well, clearly - there's obviously a problem that many conservatives have with McCain, as they probably do with Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor as well.",
        "They're not sufficiently conservative enough for some of these Republican voters.",
        "But McCain has said, look, you know, I've been with the president on this war.",
        "I think the war may not be handled exactly correctly, but victory is far more - it's the better thing to support than a pull out when you have to come back in months later and, you know, more American lives would be lost.",
        "So McCain feels that the Democrats are really letting the American people down, even though it's politically popular to pull out, you know, to have a timetable in legislation, but ultimately it would be self-defeating for the country.",
        "Well, speaking about that showdown about fundraising for the - funding the war, and whether or not a bill will include a timetable, we've got e-mail from David(ph) in Miami Beach.",

        "And Chief Illiniwek bursts out like a bird and performs a fancy dance - a very celebratory dance down the field that includes arm movements, leg kicks, and eagle spread kicks.",
        "And for that three minutes, just excites the crowd in a passionate, exciting way.",
        "He solemnly finishes it up, walks off the field, and he's not seen until the next performance.",

        "It did.",
        "It's one of those things where anytime I see it, I see myself in the outfit, and I see the expressions of people who are watching.",

        "But I must tell you, in the final analysis I get the sense that this is almost a matter of national pride as anything else and if they were able to get from the West, most especially the United States, what they want in other areas, this will not be the be all and end all.",
        "But in terms of consequences, do the Iranians think that they could actually be facing sanctions or even military action if they continue to defy the international community on this?",
        "Well, they have been facing sanctions as you know for a very long time, and interestingly enough I was talking to someone who was a major figure here in the oil industry for many years and he was pointing out that yes, initially the sanctions were very harmful to the Iranian economy but that bit by bit they have been replacing American technology with Chinese technology, Japanese technology, European technology.",

        "I mean, it was absolute madness, but it is also sort of symbolically a sense of what goes on here and what even the religious authorities are prepared to tolerate as long as people don't want too much political freedom.",
