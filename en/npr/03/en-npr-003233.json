        "I think it will be incumbent on the U.S.",
        "to make sure that that doesn't happen.",
        "And knowing what you know about the potential al-Qaida threat among the Libyan rebels, where do you come down, then, on the question of should the United States or other countries arm the rebels?",

        "Is that about your impression?",
        "I concur with them for the most part.",

        "This is a very, very monumental change in Baghdad.",
        "Are you saying that's a brutal truth because what has happened over the last - more than a year now, is that Shia militias have gone out and displaced Sunnis and killed Sunnis by the thousands?",
        "Well, I don't want to say this because I think this just sort of takes the story and, you know, it tells it right in the middle.",
        "What happened is that there was a steady and relentless attack on the Shia, daily bombings of the Shia.",
        "They came back to retaliate against the violence inflicted on their people, and certain things happened.",

        "Remember, the Sunni middleclass in Baghdad was the one with the money.",
        "If you take a look at the numbers, we understand there are a million Iraqis in Syria; there is 700,000 Iraqis in Jordan; there are tens of thousands of Iraqis in the United Arab Emirates, in Egypt, etc. Those tend to be, for the most part, Sunnis because they were the ones who were able to leave.",

        "It's the dilemma that the Sunni Arabs have placed themselves in.",
        "They placed their faith in the insurgency, and now they have to turn to leaders who are in the mainstream, who are in the political process, who have pledged themselves to the political process.",
        "So when Shia leaders, who you see is legitimate, and Kurdish leaders, who you see is legitimate, sit down and gather around whatever Sunnis are in the government at the time, are there any Sunnis in the room who could actually, in effect, deliver peace or deliver anything from the Sunni Arab community at large?",
        "Well ultimately it was - I mean, it was yesterday, and of course it was celebrating, and this is - seems like the most bizarre thing to celebrate, the 100 days of the second term.",
        "Usually when we think about a president's 100 days, we think about the first term.",
