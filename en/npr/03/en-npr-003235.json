        "Tim Baghdad-is-like-Detroit Walberg, and I was asking him, and he told - he said that he was working for tax cuts.",
        "I asked him what kind, and he went on to say that - and I brought up the war and the expense of that - but he went on to say that all tax cuts increase revenue historically, and I find that awfully hard to believe, and I'd like to know whether that's true or not.",
        "I'm not exactly sure of your question.",
        "Repeat that question?",
        "I'm sorry, I just let him go on the line.",
        "Do all tax cuts increase revenue as a policy point, according to his congressman?",
        "Well, some - you can make the argument either way, that either it helps the economy or it actually hurts the taxpayer, but ultimately I think what's interesting is what the Democrats plan to do with this.",
        "Taxes used to be - for years, for decades - was a clear Republican issue.",
        "Republicans were winning on it.",
        "Ronald Reagan clearly made it a prime issue of his elections in 1980 and 1984.",
        "The Democrats may feel that the issue has rebounded, that there are deficits, that there are things that need to be paid for, and perhaps the Democrats feel they have an issue they can win with.",
        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "We have e-mail from David in Maple Shade, who says Hillary Clinton has a database of 250,000 donors.",
        "Then why was she able to tap only 50,000 of those in the first quarter?",
        "Was it by design, or are the donors just tired of giving to the Clintons?",
        "Well, there is Clinton weariness.",
        "You know, they've been giving money throughout the 1990s to Bill Clinton, and - but I think - look, Hillary Clinton still raise $26 million.",
        "She raised more than anybody else in history in the first quarter.",
        "Perhaps she didn't expect Barack Obama to do as well as he did.",
        "He raised just slightly less than she did.",
        "But again, you know, look, given the fact that the Republican Party used to be the party of money, the big money recipients used to be the Republican candidates - not this time.",
        "There's a feeling in the country that this is the Democrat's term - turn, and I think Democrats did really well.",
        "I'm not convinced that there is a Clinton - Hillary fatigue.",
        "Certainly, she did very well, but it'll be interesting to see how much of that money can be used in the primaries as opposed to just a general election campaign."

        "Barack Obama apparently had 100,000 donors, a lot of them perhaps giving maybe a couple hundred dollars each, but there may be more of a grass-roots effort on the - Obama, and perhaps other candidates, as well, more so than Hillary Clinton.",
        "If there is Hillary Clinton fatigue, there's still an awfully long way to go in this campaign.",
        "Well you know, I say this all the time, but 10 days before the Iowa caucuses - we're talking about polls right now, talking about front-runners, which is so ludicrous.",
        "Ten days before the Iowa caucuses, Howard Dean had a big lead.",
        "Dick Gephardt was in second place, and they finished third and fourth respectively in Iowa in 2004.",
        "So to talk about polls is nonsense.",
        "That's why it's very important that we hear what the candidates have to say before we start worrying about money and viability.",
        "So let's talk about debates.",
        "Several of the Democratic candidates have refused to participate in a debate sponsored by Fox News.",
        "Well, the Democratic Party, and certainly the Democratic activists on the left, have this antipathy - deservedly perhaps - for Fox News.",
        "They feel it's not fair, they feel it's not sufficiently willing to listen to the liberal point of view, and they've kind of bullied, in a sense, the Congressional Black Caucus, which was sponsoring a debate with Fox News in August - in September, I believe in Detroit.",
        "A few days ago, John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina, says he will not participate in any event sponsored by Fox News.",
        "The other day, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama joined suit, and it's likely that that debate will fall through, as well.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "I mean, there are some who feel that given the fact that Fox News has such a large viewership, that getting the Democrats to talk on Fox News would be good for the Democratic Party, but others feel that - why reward a network that just looks down on the Democratic Party, and it looks like the Democrats activists are winning.",

        "I'm a 36-year-old African-American male, and I'm not really party-affiliated, but you know, in talking to a lot of other African-American males in regard to voting, Senator McCain was someone that we would've considered voting for, one of the very few Republicans that could've probably pulled that off, aside from Colin Powell, I guess.",
        "But nonetheless, you know, with the stuff that went on in Baghdad, and that kind of went down real bad as far as my respect for Senator McCain, but him agreeing to appear on the Imus show, that kind of just did it.",
        "I mean, that kind of just to me just said that's how the Republican Party, or more so, Senator McCain, feel about the African-American community.",
        "Richard, who's your alternative, do you think?",
        "Right now, I don't see anybody that I'm really trusting to vote for.",
        "I mean, I feel like I can't vote for any of the Republicans, so I'm going to have to vote for a Democrat.",
        "Right now, that's looking like Hillary or Barack Obama, and Barack, even though he himself is an African-American, my concern with him is he hasn't said anything about anything really to the point of what he is going to do if he is elected.",
        "None of them have, really, but at least I would go with Hillary because she has some political experience.",
        "Richard, thanks for your call.",
        "Let me just say something about the Imus show.",
        "Imus has been saying things about black and Jews and women, offensive things, for years.",
