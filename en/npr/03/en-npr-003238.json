        "That's the group that oversees the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
        "But there's some talk that the Republicans may block that nomination.",

        "Well, it's just that it's no longer - it just seems like it's just all the - it's about Hollywood and stargazing and glitter, and it's - once upon a time it used to be about the journalists who make politics interesting and government reporting interesting, and now it has nothing to do with journalism, and it's just who could invite a crazier star.",
        "It's actually also a fundraiser.",
        "I mean, scholarships are raised by the whole dinner, and there are scholarship award winners who come up and get them.",
