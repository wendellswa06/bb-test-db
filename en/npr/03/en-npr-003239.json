        "Kathy, welcome to the program.",
        "Hey, glad to be here.",
        "So you were there Monday at the debate.",
        "Tell us about it.",
        "What was Colbert Busch's approach?",
        "You know, she was a little bit nervous at first, but, you know, the approach was just I think to hit back at whatever Sanford would say or whatever attacks were made at her.",
        "Originally four debates were planned, and Colbert Busch declined all but this one.",
        "So this was the one big shot.",
        "So of course she alluded to Sanford's 2009 affair when he was governor.",
        "You mentioned he said he was hiking the Appalachian Trial, which followers of South Carolina politics would know this story well.",
        "But actually he had left the country and was visiting his mistress in Argentina.",
        "Ultimately it came out, and during the debate, Colbert Busch did question Sanford about using state money to make some of these trips to Argentina and other places.",
        "Let's listen to what she had to say.",
        "It doesn't mean you take that money we saved and leave the country for a personal purpose.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF BOOING)",

        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Kathy, were you surprised that she went there, or was that totally expected?",
        "I think that we - everybody thought she had to go there, even though she hasn't been running ads until the last couple of days that even talk about the personal side of this.",
        "But interestingly enough, you heard Sanford say I couldn't hear what she said.",
        "He never even responded to the remark.",
        "Ken?",
        "Kathy, obviously Elizabeth Colbert Busch is talking about creating jobs and improving the economy and things like this, but really this has nothing to do with her, does it?",
        "No, it's - this whole race is really about whether people like Mark Sanford or whether they don't.",
        "I mean really - and the other issue that's played into the race, which we might hear more about later, is the outside money that's coming in from national Democrats to support her.",
        "There's almost a routine, a cycle we know from these all-too-numerous and tragic events.",
        "The president addresses a grieving nation.",
        "And, of course, it's only three months since the Parkland, Fla., shooting.",
        "What did you notice in President Trump's remarks?",
        "You know, Sanford of course has been walking around with a cardboard cutout of Nancy Pelosi, but it almost hurts - I would think it almost hurts Mark Sanford attacking Nancy Pelosi, running against Elizabeth Colbert Busch, while at the same time all the voters are thinking of is another woman, Jenny Sanford.",
        "And it just seems like his problems is a lot with women.",
        "Well, and, you know, they multiplied even a couple of weeks ago.",
        "We found out that there were some court documents where Sanford's ex-wife Jenny accused him of trespassing at her home several times.",
        "And that's played into the election.",
        "And then the national Republicans said they would not back Sanford anymore.",
        "He has to appear in court two days after the election is over."

        "So that's played into it, although that's died down a little bit, but what happened is that's brought the affair up again and this issue of, you know, is he really electable, and why is he the candidate, actually.",

        "It's just not believable to me.",

        "He was talking about the outside money that's been coming in in support of Colbert Busch.",

        "He's trying to tie her to all the kind of big-government, liberal issues.",
        "And really the whole strategy is if it is on the issues, then Sanford wins because he's - really his views are consonant very much with those in the district in terms of, you know, less government, low taxes, so that if it's focused on issues, he'll win the election.",
        "If it's focused on personality and who do you trust, then it's a very close contest.",
        "Robert, a lot has to do with money, too.",
        "We also - we alluded to the fact that the Democratic-leaning groups and PACs have poured in about a million dollars to help Colbert Busch.",
        "And the NRCC, the Republican financial wing of the Republican Party, has withdrawn its support of Mark Sanford.",
        "But I see - I notice that first of all tonight, Governor Nikki Haley is hosting a fundraiser for Mark Sanford.",
        "Both Ron Paul and Rand Paul have endorsed him.",
        "Are the Republicans starting to come back and saying we still - with all the blemishes, we'd still rather have Mark Sanford?",
        "Well, there are certainly those people that are more closely associated with the Tea Party wing of the party that support him and just the people that you mentioned that are - feel that he has the right values.",
        "If you saw Rand Paul's statement when he endorsed him, it's kind of the less government, we really need people in Washington who will not - who will vote to limit the size of government so that I think there is some division in the Republican Party., not everybody's coming back.",
        "But the people that are the more conservative, smaller government wing, are - certainly would like to see him win it and are coming out here in the final days of the campaign in terms of raising money and helping to push him over the top in that regard.",
        "Kathy Lohr, I'm curious.",
        "Given that this is a special election, does that affect who will actually come out to vote, and does that fact - does that factor actually play into the prospects for each of the candidates?",
        "Well very much so.",
        "I mean, even in a regular election, it's, you know, low turnout.",
        "But in this election, you know, they're saying that a lot of people are just tired of hearing about it.",
        "There are a lot of, you know, dyed-in-the-wool Republicans that are very unhappy with Sanford as a candidate, and so they're not - they may just stay home.",
        "I think that Democrats are hoping to get women voters out because they vote at a higher rate and may - could be the key.",
        "And more ads have been released that are targeting to women and to bringing up Sanford's affair.",
        "Robert, this is kind of a strange question because I don't even know the answer to this myself, but what could Mark - what could Mark Sanford possibly do that could change minds between now and next Tuesday?",
        "It's not really a matter of changing minds.",
        "It really is can he get people thinking about the issues when they step into the ballot booth.",
        "The - his image, what people know about him, can he kind of be reformed, no, people in that district pretty much know who Mark Sanford is.",
        "But it is a highly Republican district."

        "In terms of the issues, when he represented that district from '95 to 2000, he was very consistent with what the people in that district want.",
        "And I think that also during his two terms as governor, he really reflected the values of the 1st District.",
        "So - and he survived a primary with 16 candidates, a lot by name recognition, but those candidates in the primary really tried to out-Sanford Sanford in terms of the issues, in terms of we really are - have this, you know, smaller government.",
        "So that when it comes down to next Tuesday, do they go into the ballot booth thinking about the issues or the personality?",
        "And the other part that was mentioned about turnout, you know, this is, in our minds, a pretty high-profile race.",
        "We're paying a lot of attention to it.",
        "We're talking about.",
        "But there's - the turnout may be, in terms of dollars spent per vote, is maybe very low because a lot of Republicans are not going to vote for Sanford just because of the problems with the ethical issues.",
        "And Colbert Busch's campaign really has not done a lot to excite the base, particularly trying to find out what is it that she's - her appeal to the African-American community, which is, you know, central to the Democratic vote in that district.",
        "So...",
        "(Soundbite of crowd ovation)",
        "And I - yeah.",
        "I was at an NAACP forum last night.",
        "where all the candidates spoke, and, you know, none of it - nobody seemed very excited.",
        "I will have to say, though, that some of the NAACP chapter members said they would be out this weekend holding signs for Colbert Busch.",
        "And they didn't - they said they were trying to get people to the polls.",
        "So it will be very interesting.",
        "I also heard from a couple of different people that there are Republicans who may not say they will vote for Colbert Busch out in public, but on Election Day, they would vote for her, or perhaps not vote at all.",
        "Kathy, I noticed that during the debate, or, at least, you know, in the last few days of the campaign, Colbert Busch has talked about that she supports same-sex marriage.",
        "She supports abortion rights.",
        "I wonder if those kind of positions might help Mark Sanford in the campaign.",
        "It's not really clear, because most - what I'm understanding and - you know, I'd like to get some more opinions on this from what - but what I'm understanding is that a lot of people are - they're fiscally conservative, and they don't really care that much about social issues here.",
        "And that's how they voted in the past.",
        "So it will be interesting to see if that makes a difference.",
        "Now, I think that's her - that is Colbert Busch, you know, playing to her Democratic followers.",
        "Robert, how does Sanford possibly explain to voters why the national party, the national Republican Party will not support him?",
        "How does he present that fact?",
        "Well, the way he's tried to spin it is to say, you know, that they weren't responsible for his elections back in - from '94 to 2000, and they weren't responsible for his election for governor.",
        "So we have won without them before.",
        "We'll win without them now.",
        "It's kind of taking it and appealing to the people.",
        "I mean, you can't deny the fact that it's a, you know, it really is the people of South Carolina who are going to determine this, not the National Republican Committee.",
        "So he's trying to, again, turn it and focus it on the state and the district.",
        "Of course, when he ran for the House and when he ran for governor, he may not have had the organizational Republican support, but he did have the long support of Jenny Sanford, and I suspect he doesn't have that this time."
