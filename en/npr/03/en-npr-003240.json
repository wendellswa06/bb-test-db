        "We touched a little bit on the correspondents' meeting and how your feeling is that the nerd prom is a little bit short on nerds these days.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "But we were also, before the program, discussing the whole issue of gun legislation and developments this week.",
        "Well, the big news, I guess - I mean, there's no new to the week.",
        "Of course, both Joe Manchin, the Democratic senator from West Virginia, and Pat Toomey, the Republican senator from Pennsylvania, both very pro-gun, who tried to have this universal gun registration background checks bill passed, and, of course, it failed.",
        "They say they are going to try again.",
        "They're going to try to tinker with the language, but we've seen - this week, at least - that the emotions are still very raw.",
        "We saw a town hall meeting held by Kelly Ayotte in - the Republican in New Hampshire.",
        "Now, she's not up for re-election again until 2016, but she's the only senator in the whole Northeast, I think, the only senator in the East north of Virginia that voted against the background checks.",
        "And she's been bombarded.",
        "Her office has been bombarded with phone calls and telegrams of angry responses.",
        "And she got a lot of heat at a town hall meeting this week.",
        "What's your take on the fact that we had serious problems with air traffic controllers due to the sequester layoffs, and suddenly, it was solved coincidently around the same time that a lot of congressmen needed to go fly on airplanes?",
        "Well, you know something, I think people are justifiably calling this a defeat for President Obama, and I kind of agree with it, saying here it is.",
        "The president saying that the sequester is bad.",
        "Congress is responsible.",
        "We can't allow this to happen.",
        "And then - and, of course, you know, there are kids who are being thrown off Head Start, and there are cutbacks in Indian reservations, and all those things.",
        "But because there are flight delays - and, of course, we never had flight delays before the sequestration.",
        "But because of these flight delays and a lot of members of Congress are having difficulty leaving on vacation, suddenly, this is a national calamity, and they immediately - the Senate and the House - rush to legislation.",
        "They passed it overwhelmingly, and the president signs it, saying that we're going to put money back for the air traffic controllers, and everything will be fine.",
        "Surely, it was a coincidence that they needed to use planes themselves.",
        "But isn't it something?",
        "All the other things that people have been crying out for, how the sequestration is affecting people, that was not a dire emergency.",
        "But the fact that some people were inconvenienced by long lines at airports, that was unacceptable."

        "But WMUR and University of New Hampshire has a new poll out that shows that Hillary Clinton, if the New Hampshire poll - if the New Hampshire primary were held today and, of course, if it were, then we'd be talking about something else, but Hillary Clinton would have 61 percent, and Joe Biden will only have 7 percent among the Democrats.",

        "So if on the day of the primary we can't - you know, the polling doesn't show it to be accurate.",

        "But what it does say is that, at least as of now, the Republican race is wide, wide open.",
        "And, of course, you know, it's very rare for a vice president to be denied the nomination if he or she would want it.",
