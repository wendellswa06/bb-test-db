        "He immediately put this shooting in a longer time frame, Scott.",
        "Not Parkland earlier this year, as you just said, but shootings stretching back over many years, as he said, many decades, holding it at arm's length as it were.",
        "There was neither the tone nor the kind of action-oriented rhetoric we heard from the governor of Texas, for example, Greg Abbott, who is, after all, a very conservative Republican and a Second Amendment supporter who said, we need to do more than just pray for the victims and their families.",

        "Back in 2016, this informant, whose name has been withheld - but we do know that he is described as an academic, well-known in policy circles.",
        "He's worked for past Republican administrations and for the CIA.",
        "He was sent to check out reports that these folks had been involved in both the Trump camp and were potentially Russian intelligence assets.",
        "Now, it is part of the FBI's job to catch or at least monitor foreign agents.",
        "This may look to some as the FBI just trying to do its job.",

        "And, Ron, President Trump introduced new regulations on federal family planning funds this week.",
        "Is this just a concession to his base?",
        "It surely pleases that portion of the base that opposes abortion.",
        "The regulations here are actually rather old regulations first imposed during the Reagan administration 30 years ago and rescinded by the Obama administration.",
        "They said you can't get Title X health care funds - this is a huge source of money for various kinds of health provision - you can't get those funds for a clinic or a counseling center such as Planned Parenthood that receive this family planning fund money and also may in some other place have or in some facility the availability of abortions.",
        "So it was sometimes called a gag rule because some people felt that it was keeping people from even telling you what an abortion was or where you might be able to get one.",
        "The exact language of this particular renewal of these regulations is still being formulated.",

        "It sunk the farm bill, but it had almost nothing to do with the farm bill.",
        "It was over immigration.",
        "What happened?",
        "The House Freedom Caucus, which we've talked about quite a bit - several dozen members on the conservative side in the House on the Republican Party's side voted against the bill and demonstrated that they really do hold the balance of power in the House these days, not the House leadership.",
        "The caucus, the House Freedom Caucus, did this because they first want to have a vote, before the vote on the farm bill, on a hard-line immigration bill.",
        "And some moderate Republicans also voted against this particular farm bill because it contains tougher work rules for food stamps.",
        "And the Democrats were voting against it largely on the same basis."

        "economy shrank slightly in the last three months of 2012.",
        "Even that unexpectedly weak GDP report offers something of a mixed picture, Krueger says, since consumer spending and business investment held up pretty well.",
        "GDP was dragged down because we saw the biggest decline in federal defense spending in 40 years.",
        "I think that's a sign of what could happen if the sequester were to take effect.",
        "The sequester is the big, automatic cut in government spending that's supposed to begin next month.",
        "Neither the president nor the Congress really wants that cut, which would affect nearly all government programs, including defense.",
