        "McCain blames the nation's economic woes on personal character flaws - corrupt politicians or greedy bankers - not failures of policy, like Barack Obama does.",
        "That's why the solution McCain proposes is a kind of moral housecleaning rather than a more progressive tax code or big government investments like Obama wants.",
        "And that's the difference between myself and Senator Obama, is he wants higher taxes, more government, higher spending.",
        "And frankly, that record is not something which has been good for America, and we won't let it happen.",
        "McCain says the rescue plan approved yesterday will help stop the bleeding in the financial system and free up badly needed credit.",
        "But he says it will take more to get the nation's economy moving.",
        "He called for extending President Bush's tax cuts, reducing other taxes, and for deep cuts in federal spending.",
        "McCain will spend part of this weekend honing those arguments for his second debate with Obama on Tuesday.",
        "Scott Horsley, NPR News, Flagstaff, Arizona.",
        "And I'm Audie Cornish traveling with the Barack Obama campaign in Pennsylvania.",
        "Obama opened the day with a rally at a suburban Philadelphia high school praising his running mate, Joe Biden, on his debate performance.",
        "The Illinois senator immediately followed that up with an attack on the Republican ticket.",
        "When Senator McCain and his running mate talk about job killing, that's something they know a thing or two about, because the policies they've supported and are supporting are killing jobs in America every single day.",
        "And Abington, I am here to tell you that we can't afford four more years of this.",
        "(Soundbite of crowd cheering)",
        "Then Obama went on to defend his tax proposal, which took the most heat from Governor Sarah Palin in the vice presidential debate Thursday night.",
        "Under my plan, tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan.",
        "We give three times the amount of tax relief than John McCain does to middle-class families.",
        "That's what will work.",
        "And that's the kind of change that Joe Biden and I are going to bring to Washington.",
        "But soon after, the senator had to put politics aside, at least for the night.",
        "The campaign bus pulled over at Penny's Flowers in the town of Glenside so Obama could pick up a gift for his wife Michelle for their 16th wedding anniversary."

        "For almost 290 years, the remains, a leg bone, a silk stocking, and a shoe, lay amid the wreckage of the Whydah, a pirate ship that came to a watery end off the coast of Cape Cod in the 18th century.",
        "They were discovered along with hundreds of thousands of other artifacts brought ashore, and now anthropologists have determined that the remains belong to one John King, a 10 or 11-year-old boy believed to have been a pirate who went down with the Whydah.",
        "Here to tell us more about it is Barry Clifford, an explorer with the Whydah Sea-lab and Learning Center in Provincetown.",
        "Clifford located the ship in 1984 on the bottom and brought ashore many of the artifacts that he found, including King's remains.",

        "Not very long ago, within the last several months.",
        "We actually stumbled across some documents from a captain of a ship that the Whydah pirates robbed.",
        "And he, in a deposition in Antigua, testified that when the pirates captured his ship, a boy by the name of John King, who was traveling with his mother, threatened his mother and threatened to destroy himself if he couldn't join the pirates and subsequently joined the pirates.",
        "And, you know, almost 300 years later we found the remains crushed under a cannon.",
        "And it was concreted to a cannon in sort of a large mass of material.",
        "And we took it apart and we thought, well, gee, these pirates were very small.",
        "But it never really sat right with us.",
        "I mean, the ball of the shoe that we found, there was a leg bone, a fibula, a silk stocking, and they were both inside of this shoe that was about size, a size 5 shoe and no wider than two inches at the ball of the foot.",
        "And then when we found this document, it all sort of came together that, indeed, this was not a, you know - well, it was a small pirate but he was between 9 and 11 years old."

        "It is viewed as a long-term solution on the order of 100 years, conservatively.",
        "So it buys us some time as we move into the future to find a better solution.",

        "He used to be a nerdy kid who fiddled and built things.",
        "When he was 13, he even called Goodyear to find out what it took to become a blimp pilot.",
        "That dream came back to him during a long flight in a small plane.",
        "The noise in the aircraft was really horrible, but the view was really terrific.",
        "And so I needed to come up with some way to make it possible to get the view without the noise.",

        "You can build them at the factory and then transfer them by barge fairly close to where they want to go.",
        "But getting them that last few miles, you can't do it because they don't fit down the road.",
        "For Mike Kuehlmuss, solving such problems is like playing in the sandbox.",

        "Kuehlmuss is blasting hot air inside the blimp and straps himself in, ready for takeoff.",
        "At first, he flies just a few feet off the ground, low enough to converse."
