        "Well, Gates really didn't tip his hand about what his thinking might be, but given that he seems to have talked with the same players as former secretary Rumsfeld and other administration officials, it's really hard to imagine the president is going to hear anything very radically new today.",

        "Gates also stressed that the Iraqi leaders told him that they want American support, but they want to take the lead in security operations, especially in regaining control of Baghdad.",
        "So that's very much in keeping with what the administration's been saying about moving U.S.",
