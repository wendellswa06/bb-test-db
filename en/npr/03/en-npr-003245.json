        "Well, they looked at older papers and the literature, and they looked at several things.",
        "First of all, they looked at papers which tracked HIV discordant couples - that is couples in which one member of the couple was HIV positive, the other one was negative - on highly active antiretroviral therapy.",
        "And in those groups, which had no measurable virus in their blood - where the level had dropped so low it was undetectable - there was no transmission.",
        "They looked for evidence of the virus in genital secretions, and again it declined towards zero and un-measurable levels on these patients, who had been very actively and carefully treated.",
        "So is the idea then that these people who are showing no signs in their blood of the infection can just go out and have sex freely?",
        "If these conditions are met, then the risk of transmission of a couple where a condom isn't used, for example, is less than one in hundred thousand.",
        "That number is very low.",
        "It's very rare.",
        "But nobody could argue that it's zero.",
        "The question is: what do you do with very low probabilities.",
