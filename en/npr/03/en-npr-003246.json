        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now one of the - some of the excitement about this is that scientists have been saying, gee, we found this so quickly, it took us only 11 years.",
        "Well, and that was - that's basically my takeaway message from the thing, is not that it's the first.",
        "Somebody will always be the first.",
        "The point is that when I look at this discovery and I began to think about what it means, what it really means is we found this way too soon, way too nearby, which means we're either just incredibly lucky and we won't find another one again for a long, long time, if you believe that, or if you're like myself and you don't believe in luck, you realize the statistics are telling you that there's probably a lot of these things out there.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah, you know, there have been - there's been debate over the years about whether the Earth is such a privileged position and that we're not going to find all those planets with possible life on it that the Drake equation says we might.",
        "But now you're - you seem to be saying that it might be more abundant than we thought, at least finding those planets.",
        "That's right.",
        "I think the - what this is telling us is that these kinds of places, stable orbits, stable planets and stable orbits that are about the right size and the right temperature to have liquid water for these kinds of things to occur are probably a lot more common than we had dared hope.",
        "And so that's the message of this...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...particular discovery.",

        "Well, we have a target list of about 1,500 stars that we've been monitoring for some 15 years.",
        "In the last four years or so, as we've begun to realize, largely based on results from a competing Swiss group, that the number of planets is really quiet high.",
        "The incidence of planets is high around stars.",
        "We began to focus our search mainly on the nearest stars, and particularly on N-type stars, stars that are smaller than the sun, knowing that that's where we'd probably likely find habitable planets.",
        "So we've been focusing on about 400 stars with great detail and just trying to get enough observations to be able to see these really weak signals.",
        "Can you actually see the planet itself or do you look for evidence that the planets are there?",
        "No, we don't ever see the planets themselves.",
        "I mean, we have now gotten some direct images of planets through various techniques.",
        "They're giant planets, very young in their evolutionary scenario.",
        "But most of the planets, the 500 planets that have been detected out there have no images.",
        "They simply are sensed by watching the effect that they have on the star that they orbit.",
        "They cause the star to move on - in its own little orbit.",
        "And we can sense that.",
        "And how many - this is a little planetary, sort of a little solar system of itself that you found.",
        "There's more than this one planet in it, correct?",
        "Right.",
        "The Swiss had already found four planets in the system, and what we added were two more basically.",
        "And if you look at this system, it's kind of - it's eerily reminiscent of our own solar system in several ways: One, the orbits all very nearly circular, which is like our own solar system.",
        "There's an inner clutch, kind of a tight inner clutch, a group of sort of like four or five planets in pretty close and then kind of loner, much farther out.",
        "So this solar system looks kind of the same way.",
        "It would have like sort of like a Jupiter farther out.",
        "But the whole thing fits within the orbit of our Earth, basically.",
        "If you could put our own solar system on top of it, it would all be within the orbit of our Earth.",
        "So it's a scaled down version of our own solar system in some ways.",
        "You made a statement and you've been quoted that you think the chances of life on this planet are 100 percent.",
        "Yes.",
        "I've been roundly criticized for that, and I'm taking a lot of flak for that.",
        "You know, I guess I should have taken the Zeno's paradox answer, which is if you take a half a step towards a wall each time, you'll never get there.",
        "And so maybe I should have used something like 99.999 or whatever.",
        "But I tried to qualify that.",
        "Basically, that is my personal opinion.",
        "It's no better or worse than anyone else's and someone asked me for my personal opinion, so I gave it.",
        "But I feel quite certain that the chances are very, very high that there - that life could take a foothold here.",
        "In fact, many of my colleagues are saying it's much easier for a life to take a foothold on this planet than it was on the Earth.",
        "Because?",
        "Well, there's a lot of reasons for that.",
        "One of the reasons is that it's slightly more - it has slightly more gravity than the Earth.",
        "So it would probably hold on to its atmosphere better.",
        "Another reason is that it probably has a little more internal heat from tidal heating and from just having more mass.",
        "So that would make its plate tectonics more efficient.",
        "And that's important in maintaining the carbon-dioxide cycle or carbonate-silicate cycle.",
        "So there's a number of things like that that go into it - have to do not only with the size of the orbit but also the mass of the planet."

        "It's an interview to determine whether that person has a significant possibility of eventually succeeding on their claim for asylum.",
        "So that would take place.",

        "He also passes as credible fear interview.",
        "Notwithstanding the fact that he passed that interview and he gets asylum, the government doesn't let him out of detention in Ohio.",
        "And so they keep him there.",
        "So then, he goes and gets asylum a second time.",
        "And the government again - that was in January of 2018 - the government still has not let him out of detention.",
        "So what did the judge say in response to this case that you brought?",
        "The judge is saying, United States government, you have to follow that directive that you put in place in December of 2009.",
        "What the Government's been doing is just these sort of blanket denials, and the judge is saying you can't do it, right?",
        "So going forward, starting on when the ruling was issued on July 2, the government has to go back and give each of these people an individualized determination.",
        "They have to look at person by person as to why they can't give parole."
