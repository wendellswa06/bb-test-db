        "So Emmanuel Macron was elected as a disruptor - I guess in that way, you could say like President Trump would describe himself.",
        "But they have differences.",
        "Macron has followed through with a lot of these changes at home, but strikes, protests - what are the French angry about?",
        "Macron knew that he was going to encounter resistance to his - you know, he's been pushing reforms at a really dizzying pace since he set foot in the Elysee Palace exactly almost a year ago.",
        "Actually, yesterday was the first anniversary of the first round of the presidential election.",
        "And he had it easy in a way at the beginning.",
        "He pushed the reform of the labor law first, which was very important.",
        "And I think people were still stunned by the result of the election, and there was no resistance that was done over the summer.",
        "But now he's on several front.",
        "He's really fighting on several fronts.",
        "He's pushing a reform of the national railway company, and that's where we are having quite a big strike.",
        "He's - there's a reform of the justice system, of the pension system, of admission system to universities.",
        "You know, he's really going on several fronts at the same times, hoping probably...",
        "A lot of reshaping all at once.",
        "Yeah - so hoping probably that the opposition would also be scattered, but in fact, it's now - I think he's meeting his moment of truth now.",
        "He's meeting all this resistance.",
        "But he's - as he said on Fox News in this interview the other - on Sunday, that he's standing firm.",
        "He doesn't want to give in.",
        "And, you know, he had this expression, no chance, which sounded a little bit like there is no alternative of Margaret Thatcher.",
        "Maybe some echoes there.",
        "Well, it - what about this moment with President Trump?",
        "I mean, he - Macron seems to really pride himself as being the only European leader with this easy rapport with the U.S.",

        "That's why psychiatric disorders are diagnosed by how the patient behaves.",
        "But recent advances in genetics have allowed the scientists to pinpoint the patterns of gene expression in the brain that are linked to these disorders.",
        "They measured RNA in 700 tissue samples from the brains of people with autism, schizophrenia, bipolar, major depression and alcoholism.",
        "RNA can show which genes are turned on and off and the tissue.",
        "The findings were published in Science.",
        "With these new genomic molecular measurements, we're actually able to understand what is shared and what is distinct.",
        "The researchers found that the way genes express themselves in patients with autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar have a lot in common - fewer genes involved in signalling between neurons, and more genes related to neuroinflammatory cells.",
        "Major depression was very distinct, he says.",
        "And alcoholism didn't overlap with any of them at all.",
        "Geschwind says that understanding the molecular signature of these disorders could help with curing them someday.",
        "And so it gives us hope that perhaps we can use these signatures or hallmarks of the disorder to screen for drugs that would reverse them.",
        "Then we can test whether those drugs actually work on the symptoms in patients."

        "The topic that's on everybody's mind is the war in Iraq.",

        "Well, let me just point out to you that Republican--before I even get to the Democratic side of the ledger--that Republicans, like Chuck Hagel, John McCain, Trent Lott, are saying that there is a need right now to put in place a strong exit strategy, if not withdraw troops.",
        "In fact, Chuck Hagel said it's time to get out.",
        "Our strategy can be summed up this way: As the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down.",
        "Listen, you've heard that argument over and over and over again that, if we yield to the terrorists or the insurgents over in Iraq in terms of setting a timetable, that does nothing but fuel the fire, if you will, in terms of having them say, `Listen, OK, we'll just wait them out.'",
        "Donna Brazile, when you hear this now--the retort comes from people like Gary Hart, a former Democratic presidential nominee, who says, you know, `When is somebody, especially in the Democratic Party, going to stand up and form a strong opposition that says no more, enough's enough?'.",
        "Former Senator Gary Hart is absolutely right.",
        "He also stated in a column recently in The Washington Post that it's time that the Democrats admit--those who supported the war--that we made a mistake and it's time that we asked the administration to answer `Why are we in Iraq?",
        "and `When can our troops come home?'.",
        "So it's a natural segue then to talk about the delays in the constitution, the writing of the constitution and, particularly, the hurdle presented by whether or not Islam would be a part of the constitution and a part of the way that Iraq is governed in the future and the impact that would have on Iraqi women in terms of their rights.",
        "Robert Traynham, some people are saying there would even be less rights for women under the current constitution than there were under Saddam Hussein's reign.",
        "As Americans watch the constitutional process unfold we've got to remember our own history, Juan.",
        "And that is, is that we had trouble at our own conventions over 250 years ago.",
        "We had trouble in terms of trying to figure out exactly if black Americans would have rights or women would have rights.",
        "And so, listen, this is a very painful process.",
        "If you take a look at the constitution, at least the draft constitution, no less than 25 percent of the seats will be guaranteed towards women.",
        "And also, too, keep in mind that we have to be sensitive to the religious undertones in the Middle East as well.",
