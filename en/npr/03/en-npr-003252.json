        "And while we're in the Senate, let's focus on a couple of other interesting developments there, including a bill that was up today which would've provided gun owners the right, if they had a concealed weapons permit from one state, to carry that weapon concealed in another state.",
        "This was opposed by some people who said this is a violation of states' rights.",
        "Right, and this is an amendment pushed by John Thune, the Republican of South Dakota.",
        "Dick Durbin, the majority whip, has been pushing hard to get this amendment defeated, but of course, many Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, supported it.",
        "Ultimately, it needed 60 votes for passage.",
        "It only got 58.",
        "The vote was 58 to 39.",
        "So the defeat of this bill was a victory for the gun control forces.",

        "This dystopian drama about a world where women are made into second-class citizens by a theocratic government forcing fertile women to act as breeders for the ruling class - Elisabeth Moss became the queen of quality TV.",

        "So many things are forbidden now.",
        "That's dramatic.",

        "Exactly.",
        "It's a nightmare in which toxic masculinity has taken control of the entire country, and it mirrors, in some ways, the issues that we're talking about right now.",
