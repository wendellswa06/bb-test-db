        "It may be more Des Moines than Waterloo, or maybe Dubuque, actually - that's another city in Iowa.",

        "But it is a crucial moment for Barack Obama, because most people feel that this health care debate and his push for health care overhaul will define his presidency.",

        "And he's got to assure not only the American people but also wavering Blue Dog Democrats, for example, folks, senators up in 2010, that this is the right way to go.",
        "And indeed, the timing will be critical.",
        "He has said all along he wants the Senate and the House to pass their versions of the bill by the August recess, by the summer recess.",
        "Lately, he seems to be wavering on that a little bit.",
        "Well, only because of reality.",
        "I mean, I think the biggest thing that everybody's watching is what comes out of the Senate Finance Committee, and both the chairman, Max Baucus, the Democrat of Montana, and Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican from Iowa, are trying to come out with something.",

        "I mean, given all the things that are - the enormity of what's involved in this health care bill, to pass it by a certain - by August 7th or by July 31st, seems a little strange to me.",
        "But of course, we are approaching the 2010 elections, and the sooner we get it out of committee and into the full House and Senate floor, and then it has to come back for a committee vote because of differences between the two chambers, we may be rushing against that 2010 deadline.",
        "Interestingly, the president tonight will be able to boast about passing the stimulus package, which a lot of critics say has not done enough to ease unemployment.",
        "He can point to a bunch of other legislative victories, and it looks like his Supreme Court nominee will be sailing through very shortly, but this, as you say, will be a big moment for him.",
        "Obviously, we'll be watching this very quickly.",
        "We're going to go to a break very shortly, be we do want to note that Robert Byrd, the dean of the Senate, returned to vote, well, for the Raptor yesterday and was, of course, on the losing side of that vote.",

        "Oh, and by the way, two weeks before that, when I was in the State House, Republican leaders were assuring me that Obama would never come to New Jersey because he wouldn't risk his prestige on Jon Corzine, which I thought was a crazy analysis.",

        "You know, he says these things are decided in the swing suburbs, and Christie's ignoring them and going into the cities, which Doug Forrester made the same mistake in '05.",
        "And there's - really the inner suburbs are really where these turn, and Christie so far shows no strategy for that.",
        "And obviously, Jon Corzine, the incumbent Democrat, would like to nationalize this campaign and accept the embrace of the president of the United States.",
        "Is the Republican campaign trying to nationalize it, saying this is our opportunity to send a message to Washington?",
