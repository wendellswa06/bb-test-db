        "And it's different when the dogs are barking and the snow is flying and there's a guard in the tower with a machine gun looking down at you and you're wondering why you're walking in that particular direction.",
        "Neal, I feel bit like Zelig(ph) because in 1989, in November, I was in London, and as soon as I heard about the wall I went over there and got to Berlin about midnight and walked along this wall.",

        "It would be wherever the historical institution is.",
        "Say, the Smithsonian.",
        "It might wind up in Washington, D.C., which would certainly help to give a sense of the place.",
        "But it would never be the same ground, the same atmosphere.",
        "And that's what I am sorry that we have lost in this opportunity.",
        "You can recreate it and say, this is a piece of the actual wall.",
        "This is the ice machine.",
        "But as we heard earlier, it's like moving Gettysburg to Montana and saying, well, this is what it looked like, but it's not the actual place.",
        "Almost the theme-parking of it.",
        "I would hate for it to turn into that, like you said, the theme-parkiness of it.",
        "But it would be better, I believe, than just getting the pieces and just laying them out like the other person said, like the Berlin Wall.",
        "Better than nothing."
