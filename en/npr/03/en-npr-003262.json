        "Well, one of the things that the Bush administration did was look at that question that you just posed, but look at it globally, which is - where should we be present in the world in various ways with bases or through exercises or though relationships?",
        "And we did a global review of our defense posture.",
        "And the reason that we are present in places like Europe and in Japan, South Korea and elsewhere is because we have common interests with those countries.",
        "We're only present in countries where people want us, and we're there in cooperation with them to serve - to promote security and the capabilities that serve the interests of both ourselves and our hosts.",
        "Let's put this same question to Joseph Nye.",
        "He served as assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs in the Clinton administration.",
        "He now teaches at Harvard and with us from a studio in there.",
        "And nice to have you back on the program.",
        "It's great to be back with you.",
        "And what are some of the reactions that you have to the question we got from Berlin?",
        "Well, I think that we should welcome a greater European capacity to help in defense and create conditions for its own defense.",
        "That's not the problem.",
        "The question is, is there still a role for NATO?",
        "And is there still a role for American troops positioned overseas?",
        "And I think the answer to that is yes.",
        "I think Doug Feith gave the right answer on that.",
        "What American troops do is they provide reassurance.",
        "For example, look at East Asia, where Americans have troops in Korea and Japan - they're welcome there.",
        "They're welcome because it means that there's going to be stability in the balance of power in East Asia.",
        "And that in fact means that you can have prosperity and economic growth, which depends upon a stable security framework.",
        "So, I think it's - the questioner sort of assuming it's either/or, gets it wrong.",
        "There's a role for having an American presence.",
        "There's also a role for a greater European capacity.",

        "Africa, the place that you specialized in - I think, with the exception of some American forces in Djibouti, there are no American forces on the continent of Africa.",
        "Would the place be better off if there were?",
        "Well, I think that clearly, United States has a role to play in using all of its instruments of power in Africa - economic, political and certainly, security and military.",
        "That's why we developed, under the Bush administration, the African Command, which will, in fact, have positions.",
        "It'll take over the base that's in Djibouti.",
        "And we're looking at the possible location of a forward deployed base some place else in Africa - or offices, I should say, not really a major base.",
        "But yes, I think that the United States certainly can contribute to stability in Africa through increased engagement of our military.",

        "should probably, in partnership with NATO, go into Zimbabwe.",
        "With the partnership of whom?",
        "Probably, a NATO partnership or in partnership with the WEU, should go into Zimbabwe.",
        "So, let's put that again to you, Jendayi Frazer.",
        "Should a NATO force led by the United States go in to overthrow Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe, where I think at the moment, 2,500 people have died in a cholera epidemic that's been called a man-made disaster?",
        "Well, we still hold out hope that the situation in Zimbabwe can be resolved through diplomacy and not through the use of military force.",
        "But if that were to happen, it would more likely be a regional force or one that involves the United Nations but not NATO.",
        "The one area where we looked at a NATO option to go into Africa was actually in Darfur.",
        "And it wasn't one that was very welcomed, surprisingly, by the African Union.",
        "And so I don't expect that the African Union would ask for a NATO presence to go into Zimbabwe.",
        "They would actually probably oppose that."

        "So, even to prevent a humanitarian disaster, the United States and its allies in NATO should not intervene in Zimbabwe, if not welcomed by others?",
        "I think that we really need to work in coordination and cooperation and partnership with the region.",
        "And that's how we - President Bush conducted his diplomacy in Africa throughout the eight years was to work in partnership with the African Union, the sub-regional organizations.",
        "And I just wouldn't expect them to welcome a NATO presence, given that the situation in Darfur has led to many more deaths than what we've seen in Zimbabwe.",
        "Zimbabwe is unacceptable, but the situation in Darfur was one in which the government was militarily attacking its population, leading to massive humanitarian disaster and IDPs - internally displaced persons, refugees - and yet, the African Union did not welcome a NATO role.",
        "Joseph Nye, let me ask you.",
        "During the Clinton administration, there was of course, the genocide in Rwanda.",
        "The United States did not act, and since then, President Clinton has said, this is the greatest regret of his time in office.",
        "Presented with similar circumstances, as Astrid mentioned, in Zimbabwe or as Jendayi Frazer mentioned, in Sudan's Darfur, should the United States act alone or with European partners, if necessary?",
        "Well, I think it's generally agreed that in the case of Rwanda, we could have done more.",
        "We couldn't have stopped the whole genocide, but we could have saved a lot of lives.",
        "And there are many options between sending in the 82nd Airborne, and in fact providing logistics, intelligence.",
        "We could have supported the peacekeeping troops that were already there.",
        "But those are mistakes of the past.",
        "I think my friend and former colleague, Jendayi, is correct, that if you're going to go into Darfur or into Zimbabwe, you have to have a legitimacy.",
        "And legitimacy comes when you're not doing it alone or not doing it from Europe, which is seen in Africa, for example, as many of the NATO countries, as former colonial powers.",
        "It requires the acquiescence and support of countries in the region.",
        "So, we have to work a lot more with the African Union and we ought to be trying to use a number of means to try to bolster the South Africans to take a stronger position.",
        "They, in fact, could make a big difference.",
        "Douglas Feith, let me bring you into the conversation and add this point.",
        "Some people would say, none of these areas are in America's vital interest.",
        "The United States should not be spending resources in places like Sudan and Zimbabwe, or for that matter, in Rwanda.",
        "Well, it's - there's a great debate about what U.S.",
        "policy should be toward major humanitarian disasters, and whether we should intervene in the event of genocide - militarily in the event of genocide somewhere or not.",
        "And the reason there's such a great debate is that it's extremely hard to formulate standards.",
        "And so, there's no broad agreement on standards, and what you really have is a case-by-case examination of the issue.",
        "And sometimes you get exactly the kind of situation you described, where President Clinton, when he examined it at the time, decided that he wasn't going to commit U.S.",
        "troops and then later can say that, you know, he has regret for it.",
        "These are extremely hard problems.",
        "I mean, we - what we found is there are some cases where you have the combination of a major humanitarian disaster and an American national security interest.",
        "And then, when we intervene, some of those interventions are extremely controversial, such as Iraq.",
        "I mean, everybody understands that's - it was a major humanitarian disaster in Iraq under the Saddam Hussein regime.",
        "But there was a lot of opposition to our intervention, despite the fact that we were serving humanitarian purposes, because we also were serving what the Bush administration said were important national security purposes in going in.",

        "We're coming from around the world on this position, but I think America and obviously Obama as the new president, and there's a lot of hope with what he might do, but I think it has to start by respecting human rights internationally.",
        "It has to start - and I think it really must respect democratically-elected governments, such as those of Venezuela, such as - even those which is considered controversial, but it was democratically-elected by it's people, as Hamas.",
        "I think it has to start seeing itself, not as a policeman of the world, not being governed by fear of terrorism or fear of being, you know, of other powers but actually start respecting human rights, respecting other nations.",
        "And I think stop intervening in other countries on the basis of what it sees as, you know, power games of other countries, in terms of looking for resources like oil, as ultimately what people have said is behind - was behind the invasion in Iraq, and start respecting other cultures and other nations, because the reality of its policies, such as supporting Israel - you know, it used the - it refused to support the vote that went to the U.N.",
        "recently condemning Israel - is actually creating more people who hate what America is, who hate American foreign policy.",
        "And America really needs to, I think, open up to the truth - open up to the truth of what is the result of its policies.",
        "And from what I can see in Ireland and see what's happening in America is that there's a great change now, a great mood for change with the election of Obama.",
        "And I think Obama really has to try to deliver on this and really - it's seeing America as not a country under threat but a country that can do good things.",
        "But militarily, and I think on foreign policy, it has to apologize and it has to take a completely new direction that stops supporting regimes such as Saudi Arabia, which is one of the, you know, is one of the most biggest human rights, stop invading countries which are, you know, seen as in terms of its power.",
        "And I think we really need to promote human rights and human value as the key cornerstone of American foreign policy.",

        "Well, on the Hamas per se, there's question of how it treats Israel and whether it will recognize the right of Israel to exist.",
        "But I think the caller, Rory, raised a larger issue, which is the role of human rights in foreign policy.",
        "I think it's extremely important, and I think President Obama made that clear in his inaugural address, that we are going to pay a lot of attention to human rights.",
        "But I also think you have to realize that a foreign policy is more than just a human rights policy.",
        "For example, should we say that we will not work with Saudi Arabia because we don't like the way they treat women?",
        "That raises a lot of difficult questions, such as stability in the Persian Gulf, such as trying to get the Saudis to play a significant role in the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel.",
        "So, yes, human rights has to have a higher priority than it's had, but it's not - human rights policy and a foreign policy are not exactly the same.",
        "A foreign policy, you try to get as much of as many values as you can, and if all you do is human rights, you'll find that you're interfering with a lot of other values that you care about, such as for example, stability in the Persian Gulf or peace between Israel and Palestinians.",
        "Joseph Nye, just to follow up on that, Rory, and perhaps some others, might say that United States' policy on Saudi Arabia, vis-a-vis women, might be much more aggressive, should - if Saudi Arabia were not the largest export of oil in the world.",
        "Well, we definitely have an interest in making sure that there's stability in the Persian Gulf because of oil, but it's not the only interest.",
        "I mentioned also that we're interested in seeing if we can get peace between Israel-Palestinians.",
        "In a peace process, Saudis will play a significant role.",
        "Douglas Feith, let's go to you.",
        "Well, I think that Joe Nye is quite right, that people who actually have responsibility for formulating policy understand that there are - there's always a long list of considerations that you try to balance, and lot of these considerations are in tension with each other.",
        "And so - and also, there are trade-offs between short-term and longer-terms considerations.",
        "So, sometimes for example, working with countries that are not democratic may be the best way to ultimately promote stability, democracy and greater human rights down the road, rather than undermining an existing government or attacking an existing government that doesn't have as good a human rights record as you want, and then creating enormous instability and you could create war and refugees and a lot of misery.",
        "So, these calculations are extremely complex.",
        "I think that the caller, though made it - was using the term human rights in a funny way, because to say that in the name of human rights we should be supporting Hamas but distancing ourselves from Israel shows, I think, a really perverse understanding of human rights.",
        "Israel is a country that respects the human rights of its people, and with all the problems that it has, it's fundamentally a democratic country committed to human rights and dealing with extremely difficult tradeoffs between human rights and security, and Hamas is an organization that not only attacks Israel and is trying to destroy but is horribly oppressive toward the Palestinian people.",
        "Some people would look at the recent conflict in Gaza and say, Israel, reportedly for self-defense, killed 1,300 Palestinians, half of them women and children, non-combatants, while suffering 13 casualties of its own and destroying a heavily-populated civilian area.",
        "But in another way and I think, a more serious way of looking at it is that Hamas is an organization that is committed in its ideology to sacrificing individuals - ordinary people - for its ideological purposes, and it's wiling to sacrifice ordinary Israelis, and it's willing to sacrifice ordinary Palestinians.",
        "And the reason that those casualties were what they were was that Hamas, as part of its operational tactics, hid among civilians to maximize Palestinian casualties."
