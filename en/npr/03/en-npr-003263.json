        "And certainly Somaliland can be a island of stability in the broader Horn of Africa.",
        "Unfortunately, we didn't move to fully recognize Somaliland as an independent country.",
        "We've tried to look at this issue, and I think it's going to be one that's going to be - that will have to be taken up.",
        "We worked with the African Union and we said - the United States under the Bush administration said that we would follow the lead of the African Union, in terms of recognizing Somaliland as an independent country.",
        "The African Union deferred that decision, given the outbreak of continued violence in Somalia, especially after 2006 and 2007.",
        "So, it's an issue that is on the table.",
        "Not all of the neighboring countries agree that Somaliland should be independent immediately.",
        "Many feel that it will lead to further violence in the Horn of Africa especially with - to the south with Somalia.",
        "So, we didn't get there, but you're quite right that Somaliland deserves some recognition certainly and some consideration of recognition as an independent state.",
        "We love it here.",
        "It's close to everything.",
        "We can walk everywhere.",
        "So walking around, you see a lot of students like yourself?",
        "In the broader situation of Somaliland and Somalia, if you have a part of a country that wants to break away and is functioning pretty well, compared with the chaos that I think we can all agree on is going on in Somalia - an ineffectual government that's controlling very little, in fact, of Somalia and a growing Islamist movement - in fact, why wait for the African Union?",
        "The United States could takes steps on its own.",
        "The United States certainly could takes steps on its own.",
        "It could make that decision on its own.",
        "But the way we worked in the Bush administration was to try to work very much in partnership with the African Union and with African countries.",
        "And so, we were moving - rather forward-leaning in this question of independence of Somaliland.",
        "And we thought the African Union was there with us.",
        "But again, as I said, as dynamics developed in 2000 and 2007 - 2006 and 2007, the African Union pulled back and so did we.",

        "Who we going to blame if United States don't go first and help them?",
        "Well, Jendayi?",
        "Well, Ali, what I would suggest to the Somaliland authorities that they look at a half-step, and that they - first, currently, the United States does provide assistance to the Somaliland government.",
        "We engaged them just as we would other governments.",
        "But they may want to try a half-step of getting a seat in international for a, so that, while they're not fully recognized as a independent state, they can have an observer status.",
