        "There are five members of the United Nations - permanent members of the Security Council: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China and Russia.",
        "Each can veto, with a no vote, any resolution of the Security Council.",
        "They are always there.",
        "Ten other members rotate on a regional basis.",
        "Douglas Feith, should the United Nation be a more democratic organization?",
        "Well, the United Nations was never set up to be a world government and to operate on the basis of just, you know, democratic vote of, you know, one country, one vote.",
        "The United Nations was set up by a treaty.",
        "It's an international organization that's supposed to serve the purposes of its members.",
        "The United States and the other major powers at the time made it a condition to join the treaty that they would have (unintelligible) Security Council.",
        "And I think that the suggestion that the U.N.",
        "should operate as a world government, you know, based on these democratic principles of each state getting a vote, would be a complete transformation of the idea of the United Nations, and I doubt that it would be accepted by the great - you know, by the leading powers.",
        "Douglas, let's go to Joseph Nye on that point.",
        "I think it's also worth noticing that there's nothing democratic about one country, one vote.",
        "We usually think of democratic theory as one person, one vote.",
        "If you had one country, one vote - for example, if we were bound simply by general assembly votes, you would find that the Maldives Islands, with 100,000 people, would have - each Maldivian citizen would have about 10,000 times the voting power of an Indian or a Chinese citizen.",
        "So, one country, one vote is not a democratic principle.",
        "Well, one person, one vote is.",
        "And the world is not yet in a position to be one person, one vote.",
        "I don't think you'd find very many people in very many countries who would be willing to accept rule on the basis of one person, one vote.",
        "But is it time to expand the Security Council permanent membership to include, for example, Brazil, South Africa, India?",
        "Yes, I do agree with that.",
        "I think what need to have is less focus on the veto and more focus on representation, so that countries like India, China - well, China's already on the Security Council, but India, Japan, Brazil, South Africa.",
        "We could add another set of countries, which would give better representation, whether they had a veto or not.",
        "And there could also be policies in which the veto powers could say that they would not use their veto, except in extreme circumstances.",
        "So, there are reforms that could be made, but the idea that one country, one vote is reform, which is either good, in the sense of democratic, or feasible, in the sense of acceptable, is not the answer.",
        "Bob, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "On Talk of the World today, we're getting callers from around the globe to speak with three people who have helped to exercise American power in the past - Douglas Feith, who served in the Defense Department under George W.",
        "Bush, Joseph Nye, who worked in the Defense Department under Bill Clinton, and Jendayi Frazer, who worked in the State Department as assistant secretary of state for African affairs under George W.",
        "Bush.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the World from NPR News.",
        "And we may have left the thorniest issue for last.",
        "This is from Mohammad in Iran.",
        "How is the new government trying to show it is different when talking with Iran's regime, which has no respect for human rights and the world's demands for a nuclear plan?",
        "This is what we Iranians really worry about.",
        "Does Obama want to have relations with the people or with the regime in Iran?",
        "These two things are different.",
        "And, Joseph Nye, why don't we start with you?",
        "Well, I think what President Obama has said is that he is willing to enter into negotiations without pre-conditions and have negotiations on a broad range of subjects.",
        "And in that sense, I think the problem with some of the negotiations or efforts at negotiations in the past is that they were limited by the preconditions that had been set.",
        "I think Obama is correct to say that we will explore diplomatically a whole range of issues.",
        "We don't know a lot of our neighbors in the area 'cause we're always in and out, so..."

        "We just walk by each other.",
        "We don't know each other.",

        "So it's just like, we're - they're invisible, and we're invisible.",
        "And that means we have to deal with the regime that's there.",
        "It may be that we don't particularly like the regime, but in a world in which half the governments are not democratically elected, we often have to deal in foreign policy with regimes which we may not prefer.",
        "But if we're dealing with serious issues, like how to dissuade the Iranians from developing a nuclear weapon, how to get their help against the Taliban resurgence in Afghanistan, how to deal with energy security questions in the future, you have to deal with who's there.",
        "And it's up to the Iranian people to try to change the nature of who represents them, not for the United States.",
        "Douglas Feith?",
        "I think that the questioner raised a really important question.",
        "He said, do you want to deal with the people or do you want to deal with the regime, because there is tension between the people and the regime in Iran.",
        "The Iranian regime is basically a very corrupt, unpopular regime that's pretty oppressive, and there are a lot of groups within the society - students and women and others - that would be very happy if that regime left in favor of a regime that was much more respectful of their rights.",
        "Now, the question of how we deal with the Iranians, I think, is not a matter of whether we want to say - it's not a moral issue.",
        "It's not the Iranian regime is evil and therefore, one shouldn't talk to it or - nor do I agree with what Joe Nye suggested, which is that you necessarily have to deal with the regime in place.",
        "What - the key question is, what are our goals with respect to Iran?",
        "What do we want to accomplish?",
        "If we want to accomplish, for example, the termination of their nuclear program, so that they don't have nuclear weapons, there's a pragmatic question - what is the most effective way to bring about the change of that policy of the Iranian government pursuing nuclear weapons?",
        "If the most effective way is talking with them, then I would be in favor of talking with them.",
        "If the most effective way is pressuring them and isolating them and not talking with them but seeing if you can bring various types of pressure to bear, including isolation, then we're better off isolating them.",
        "And, you know, history knows examples of sometimes you're better off talking to people, sometimes you're better off isolating them.",
        "In the case of South Africa, it was a major international isolation campaign that led to very important domestic political changes that the world welcomed.",
        "That really, I think, is the essential practical question on whether we should be dealing with the Iranian government.",
        "Jendayi Frazer, I understand this is not your area of expertise, but I didn't want to leave you out of this.",
        "This is a crucial issue that affects us all, and we're going to give you (Laughing) 45 seconds to wrap it up, if you would.",
        "Well, I think that we, in some sense, between the Bush administration and this new era of an Obama administration, are really creating a false debate, because what the Bush administration did in Iran was to develop a coalition - the five party talks - to work with France and the U.K.",
        "and others to try to bring the pressure to bear on Iran to give up its nuclear weapons.",
        "And so, it's never a case of just unilateralism or multilateralism.",
        "Nor is it a case of using soft diplomacy versus - or soft power versus hard power.",
        "We've been doing all of that simultaneously over the last eight years.",
        "It's very complex.",
        "It's very difficult and you have to work in partnership with other countries to have an effective foreign policy.",
        "Jendayi Frazer, we thank you for your time today, appreciate you coming in.",
        "Our thanks as well to Douglas Feith, also with us here in the studio in Washington, D.C., and to Joseph Nye, who joined us from a studio at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.",
        "And thanks to you all.",
        "We'd also like to thank all the broadcasters who carried today's program overseas and here in the United States.",
