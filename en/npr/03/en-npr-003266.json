        "Will consumers still be able to get, I mean, just Internet service at a reasonable price?",
        "Yes.",
        "One of the conditions actually of the deal is that, you know, Comcast has to sell its Internet service to consumers who just want that and maybe don't want a cable box.",
        "You know, all of that will be in place.",
        "The interest part for consumers - and we won't know until a few years down the road - is just how effective these conditions will be in not limiting the development of online video.",
        "One of the great concerns of the cable industry is consumers dropping their cable subscription and just keeping a broadband connection, figuring they can get all their entertainment that way.",
        "And, you know, that's something that we'll see play out in the next three to five years, whether these conditions were tough enough to encourage growth of the online video marketplace.",

        "That's right, it's Christmas Bird Count time.",
        "The 108th count is in full swing across the western hemisphere.",
        "We're going to check in with the Count's director to see how things are going to - are going so far, and whether the recent ice storms in the middle of the country and snow in the northeast have slowed down the counting at all or maybe affected the birds as they hang around this season.",
        "We're also going to talk about a new report from the National Audubon Society.",
        "It's a watch list of the country's most at-risk birds.",

        "But interestingly, I think maybe the snow that we've had and the cold weather actually seems to be pushing some of the birds that might be out sort of having a good time looking for food out in the farther regions of town circles into where people are actually able to find them.",
        "And on the count that I did on Saturday down in Rhode Island, we actually had an absolutely wonderful day.",
        "Wow.",
        "The fact that you have a white background, does that actually helped counting or hinder it?",
        "Well, it can help it.",
        "I mean, it kind of depends on exactly how much and how long it's been all white.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Up here, what happened I think is - at least in New England, it appears that for that snow that we had, it sort of pushed some of the birds that were lingering around down to the areas like roadsides and, you know, strip(ph) places that were still open, so - to where birds - we were actually able to find them.",

        "The value of their homes plummeted and they couldn't do that.",
        "So this deal would give them a bit of a breather and keep their interest rates from going up as they're scheduled to do.",

        "What's not to like?",
        "Well, some economists are worried this would just sort of delay the inevitable, and they want to be sure we're not keeping people in their homes longer who are frankly going to be foreclosed upon anyway."
