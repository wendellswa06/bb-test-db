        "Well, Les Moonves said, this was a sexist remark, and got at Dan Rather that way.",

        "And it's not necessarily evident - evidently clear at all that he didn't mean it in a gendered sense.",

        "And in some ways, it may well turn out to be that the reason that Charlie Gibson - himself an avuncular, comfortable presence who took over at ABC News -the reason that he has become clearly the top rated anchor according to Nielsen Ratings estimates is that he is this avuncular and possibly familiar and male presence.",
        "And that would reflect less of sexism of, say, Dan Rather criticizing his former employers, but more a question of, sort of, what the American public's taste is.",
        "Dan Rather, of course, also came in a criticism, not merely for being sexist, but about being a bitter old man.",

        "That's not to say that his criticism lacks merit.",
        "I mean, one of the things CBS and other networks have spent a lot of money to cover Iraq, but, you know, if you look at foreign coverage on the commercial news networks, the big three, they've cut way back from where they were a generation ago, in the early '80s.",
        "And much of that took place under three of the most famous anchors for all time, Dan Rather and his counterparts, Tom Brokaw at NBC, and even Peter Jennings at ABC who had the fondness for foreign news.",
        "It's just - they decided these were profit centers instead of merely prestige centers.",

        "Again, I would say yes.",
