        "Sure.",
        "I think Mr. Folkenflik hit it right on the head with his analysis, and in particular, the self-pitying aspect of Blair's comments.",
        "And you can lump Dan Rather right into that too, I think.",
        "And it seems to me to be not a coincidence that they're both on their way out and wanting to kind of shape the way they're defined.",
        "But you brought something else up that I think was interesting, too, in the way that Blair expressed himself in that he looked at the attacks and the media using personal attacks against himself and his administration.",
        "And I think we're in, correct me if I'm wrong here, but we're in kind of a topsy-turvy point these days where if policy is attacked, like the Downing Street Memos, for example, or Iraq, it really doesn't stir up the attention among the public or even the rest of the media as much as scandals and…",
        "Your talking about the hot inquiry where - effectively, to make a long story short, somebody was hounded by the media, and believed he had no choice but to commit suicide?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I think, you know, that's obviously very serious situation.",
        "But as an example, the really horrific policy, I think that I, you know, in my opinion, that we have in Iraq is something that should have brought, you know, a massive amount of attention.",
        "It seemed like it just continued on as, you know, old news.",
        "So could it be that the media looks for other ways or other angles to try to bring down a politician, rather than just going after…",
        "Now and more than ours, Mike is right, David Folkenflik.",
        "British newspapers and media outlets tend to campaign, not merely endorse.",
        "Well, they tend to go for the jugular.",
        "There's less of the notion of a strict wall separating an editorial page where people give, you know -editorials are essentially advocating specific policies in news pages, which are, in our country, tend to be fairly straight up whatever the shortcomings of the papers involved.",
        "I think it is true that in Britain, there's both the question of papers that tend out point of view.",
        "You know, the Guardian, the Observer, the Independent, tend to be generally left to center; you know that the Times, the Telegraph tend to be on the right.",
        "But there's also the question of just much bit more blood sport in British media.",
        "It's a different game.",
        "And, you know, Blair hasn't liked it very much when he's been unpopular.",
        "He enjoyed it very much when he was able to sort of orchestrate coverage (unintelligible).",

        "Interestingly, that's occurred at the time when the CBS primetime and the rest of the network has been healthier than ever.",
