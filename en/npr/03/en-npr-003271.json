        "I wish I could shed more, to be honest with you.",
        "There - the data's really kind of cloudy.",
        "In the Phoenix area, for instance, the claims are that illegal immigrants are responsible for twice the crime rate as the general population, around 16 percent.",
        "But, you know, if you include illegal immigration as a crime, your numbers are going to be affected.",
        "So I think what most people probably care about is violent crime, and the data is really mixed.",
        "One study by a nonpartisan research group said that immigrants, legal and illegal, were 10 times less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans, in the case that, you know, that immigrants do not raise the crime rate.",
        "On the other hand, children of some immigrant groups are much more likely to be arrested and incarcerated because they're susceptible to gang influences.",
        "And the numbers of gang members across the U.S.",
        "is up - been up sharply this last decade.",
        "So I - you know, just to sum up here...",
        "Right.",
        "...I mean, you know, meanwhile, you've got highly publicized cases -like the shooting of the rancher, down near the border, in March - which tend to skew public perception.",
        "Well, that case and others, as you say, that get a lot of publicity, are drug-related.",
        "Is that - is the whole sort of debate over drug policy part of this debate?",
        "Well, you know, and - is it part of the debate?",
        "I think it is, but I think it's - it is not an explicit part of the debate.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I - many in the immigrant community and, in fact, folks along the border, will separate illegal immigration from drug smuggling and the increasingly violent people-smuggling that's going on.",
        "And I think they will do that, and the general public tends to put it all together in their minds.",
        "Another point that supporters of laws like Arizona's make is that illegal immigration is overwhelming social services, that hospitals and schools can't possibly keep up with an influx of this size.",
        "What sort of data is there to support that?"

        "Well, in Arizona, you can't get social services if you are an illegal immigrant because of a law a few years ago.",
        "On the other hand, you can get public education, because schools do not ask immigration status.",
        "They cannot ask.",
        "And of course, children born here, whether their parents are legal or illegal, are citizens.",
        "Hospitals are really just beginning to ask the status.",
        "I know of one in Tucson that asks and is collecting data.",
        "Most hospitals don't, and all hospitals are required to treat folks who come into the emergency room.",
        "And they're losing money but, you know, is that because of illegal immigrants?",
        "Or is that because people don't have health care?",
        "So there's an impact, to be sure.",
        "Advocates say it's not as great as it would be if we were to ignore public education or public health.",

        "side of the border, but one of the things we've been trying to understand about this area is that, you know, Mexico's right there.",
        "What sort of perspective can you give us about the effects of this same phenomenon, the illegal immigration, from the Mexican side of the border?",
        "Yeah, I'm really glad you asked that because the border implies - the term border implies that there are two sides.",
        "For instance, all the illegal immigrants who are picked up are taken and dropped off at the border.",
        "And in this case - in the case of the twin cities of Nogales, Sonora, and Nogales, Arizona - they're dropped off, and they have been overwhelming the other - the social services on the other side.",
        "They just cross the border, and there they are.",
        "And most of these folks are not from the north of Mexico these days.",
        "They're from the south, from Chiapas or from central Zacatecas, and they're poor.",
        "That's why they're coming.",
        "And they get dropped off.",
        "It's as though a New Yorker were dropped off in the middle of, you know, Nebraska.",
        "And you know, where do you go?",
        "And you seek out social services.",
        "So I think that that's a very astute point, that the services are being overwhelmed on the other side.",
        "And in terms of immigrants being dropped off, as you say, just over the border, how much does that happen?",
        "How has the, sort of curve of enforcement been looking over the last couple of years?",
        "Happens every day, many times a day.",
        "Busloads of - busloads, literally busloads are dropped off, you know, almost every hour, at points all across the border.",
        "Enforcement has gone up.",
        "I mean, you've got about 20,000 Border Patrol agents here, and that's along the entire border.",
        "But you've got huge, you know, places that are in between ports of entry that don't have much enforcement still.",
        "Those are the harsher places.",
        "The places where it's harder to cross.",
        "Where it's - exactly.",
        "And they've been pushed into those areas on purpose by - away from places like San Diego, for instance.",
        "And I just want to make one point, that the government estimates - our government estimates that up to - perhaps more - but 40 to 60 percent of all of those people in this country illegally came in legally through ports of entry on visas, and they overstayed their visas.",
        "So those are not people who are climbing fences.",
        "Those are not people who are crossing through the desert.",
        "You know, many of them are, but we have to keep that in mind - that no fencing, nothing is going to keep those people out.",
        "And those could be of any nationality.",
        "Well, it's interesting, Ted Robbins, when you look at the New York Times-CBS poll.",
        "One of the things that Americans do seem to agree on, when there's not a lot of consensus around this issue, is that more needs to be done in terms of enforcing current laws.",
        "And if what you're describing - of, you know, busloads of people being deported every day - where is the disconnect?",
        "Is it in a lack of information?",
        "Is it that enforcement seems like a nice thing to rally behind?"
