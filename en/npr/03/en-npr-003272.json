        "We are also 70 percent secured between the ports, and only 30 percent secured at the ports.",
        "We need more manpower and more resources directed at our ports of entry immediately.",

        "The hard part is that a lot of our departments are based off of user fees and you know, that derives a lot of the stuff - so security cost, and that cost comes from user fees, which we need to be able to account for.",
        "So at this point, in order to help those shoppers come over, we would like to be able to facilitate the ones that are coming.",
        "Mexican nationals used to come over maybe four to five times during the season to do their shopping, and we're trying to get them to come over at least one or two times, which - some of them are just staying at home right now.",
        "You know, our wait times at our ports, even despite the decrease of people coming over, is ridiculous.",

        "Our economy is tied to the one in Mexico, and we have created a program called Vamos A Tucson, with offices in Mexico, to better serve the Mexico visitor.",
        "We hope that federal and state laws will help us bring more tourists rather than scare them away in the U.S.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Is there a similar program in Texas?",
        "Yeah, there's similar programs, and we do, we actually bring a lot of people over.",
        "But as long as right now, until the drug violence is over on the in Mexico right now, the Mexicans are still afraid to leave their homes to be able to cross the border.",
        "And you know, our trade depends on both sides.",
        "Americans, a lot of time, go to Mexico for health care, for their medications, for actually eating, for shopping and everything else.",
