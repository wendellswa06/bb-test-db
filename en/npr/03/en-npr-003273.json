        "Well, I wouldnt characterize all of it.",

        "Much of what you've heard is accurate.",
        "In fact, right now, I just received a report from Stratburg Information Agency(ph) describing numerous violent incidents throughout Mexico.",
        "So no, that's not a distortion.",
        "A lot of people on this side are afraid to go Nuevo Laredo, for example, crossing to the border - I mean, to cross in to Mexico to - you know, they normally - for example, my wife went - many years ago, we would - my wife and I would cross into Nuevo Laredo regularly in the evening.",
        "And now, hardly anybody wants to go over there.",
        "I get reports - in fact, I got a report just the other day from another family who had had a business in Nuevo Laredo, who moved to - on this side because he had been kidnapped - him and members of his family had been kidnapped by members of one of the drug cartels.",
        "So no, the violence is not exaggerated.",
        "That is correct.",
        "But there's another side to all of this, and that is that a friend of mine, John Stevenson(ph), who lives in San Miguel de Allende, visited with me recently and said to me - he's originally from New York, by the way.",
        "And he says that the Mexican government is being forced to fight a war that in fact is - pertains - is the United States.",

        "Now earlier, a gentleman commented about the smuggling of arms north into the United States.",
        "Well, as you well know, there are numerous reports coming out saying that many of those arms, in fact, are originating in the United States and certainly, Laredo has been one place where - I mean, many, many, many weapons have been sold to - through third parties to Mexican - I mean, to the drug gangs.",

        "Well, let me touch on something that we were talking about earlier, which is this idea of the border being very fluid, that people who live on the border go back and forth - or had, before people were scared of violence, that the culture of living in a place where you can see another country is - there's not just sort of a hard-and-fast line between them.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And is that still true where you see it, in Laredo?",
        "Well, I think that - I dont know that that's changed significantly because I mean, for example, I have - we have relatives on both sides of the border.",
        "And so it's very difficult, you know, to not to cross on a regular basis.",
        "I have students that cross every day.",
