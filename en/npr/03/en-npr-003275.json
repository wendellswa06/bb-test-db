        "We've been kind of on the surface of the Earth for, oh, a few thousand years calmly watching the stars and that sort of thing.",
        "Somewhere along the line somebody thought, `Gee, we ought to be able to record when we see things happen in the sky.",
        "So they began to look for natural rhythms that would allow them to develop time scales.",
        "So things like the rising and the setting of the sun, the coming and the going of the moon, the waxing and waning of the seasons--these all became the things that today we kind of take for granted as days, months, years and so on.",
        "Basically, all of these time systems are dependent on what the Earth is doing as opposed to what a sort of neutral arbiter might say.",
        "And the problem is physicists sooner or later came along, and physicists don't like defining things that are fundamental physical constants in terms of systems that are inherently variable.",
        "So they said, `OK, we have to find a better way to define this thing called the second.",
        "And eventually they hit on the idea of using a natural vibration in a particular kind of chemical element that oscillates about nine billion and change times per second, and they use that to define the duration of the second.",
        "And...",
        "Which element?",
        "It--well, the formal definition of one second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of the hyperfine state of cesium-133 in a vacuum in the absence of external magnetic fields.",
        "I'll keep that in mind.",
        "Good, 'cause it takes a lot longer to say it than it does to actually make the thing go by.",
        "It's a lot longer than a second, yeah.",
        "That is midnight.",
        "That is when January 1 starts, where they start counting.",
        "OK."

        "Odd.",
        "She could remember the thin pink scar that cut through his upper lip and puckered when he spoke, but not the sound of his voice or his words.",
        "She lowered her body into a chair, perspiration gathered in the folds of her neck.",
        "What did he say?",
        "Sonya rubbed her wedding band.",
        "It had belonged to her grandmother, passed onto her mother, and now, it was embedded in Sonia's finger.",
        "Funny.",
        "She could picture the man as he walked toward her, his gait smooth, his expression blank, and she could see him as he took his leave, erect, businesslike, not a wrinkle in his dark blue slacks.",
        "But other than that scar, everything that happened in between the coming and going was blank.",
        "The car was a speck when it turned onto the highway.",
        "Roiling storm clouds were moving across the plain.",
        "The rain pattering on the roof would make for good sleeping.",
        "That's what her Tom would say.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "(Reading) When the woman fell from the sky, she survived long enough to utter one word: crane.",
        "Later, we debated what she'd meant.",
        "The bird?",
        "The machine?",
        "The verb?",
        "A name?",
        "Someone even suggested that she'd gasped out a different word entirely, that maybe we'd misheard, that maybe it was just the sound of her last breath rushing out of her body.",
        "We quickly dismissed this.",
        "We knew.",
        "Our lives were invaded for three weeks - newspaper reporters, policemen, curious neighbors sauntered up to our front door as if we had won one of those sweepstakes with the big checks and all those flashing camera bulbs.",
        "Congratulations.",
        "You have just won the grand prize.",
        "How does it feel?",
        "We never told them about \"\"crane.\"\" It tasted like smoke and bile on the tips of our tongues, and letting it out seemed to poison us like we were spilling her most intimate secret.",
        "Her skirt had been shredded about her body, for God sake.",
        "We needed to spare her at least one shame.",

        "There's a new poll out by ABC News and the Washington Post that shows the president has a 15-point lead over Republicans in Congress in terms of who they trust to create jobs.",
        "David, what has changed for the president and for the GOP here?",
        "Well, I think what we just heard in that report, which is that most people in the country see this as a very long, deep problem.",
        "After you have financial crises, you usually get six or seven years of really terrible economics, multiple problems, as we just heard, low consumer demand, low business investment, people don't know what their houses are worth, political risks in Europe - one thing after another.",
        "And I don't think too many people have faith that a temporary payroll tax cut or a few small things in the jobs bill are gonna make that fundamental a difference.",
        "And so what we should be working on is the fundamental things - the big tax reform, the big fiscal reform, that sort of thing.",
        "People understand that this is a really deep fundamental problem that probably can't be solved by something relatively small.",
        "E.J., where do you think the president can go from here?",
        "Well, I think the country is in a different place than David does on this.",
        "Yes, they think there are long-term problems here, and there are, but I think they look at what's happened over the last six months and say, we need to give the economy a jolt now.",
        "And I think that's why the president has finally been on the offensive against the Congress.",
        "I think calling out Eric Cantor by name shows he's got real confidence that what's actually in his jobs bill, including the payroll tax cuts, but also the investments in schools and teachers and roads are all very popular things.",

        "Well, if we go back to 2009, the main power in American politics was on the right with the Tea Party.",
        "Americans are deeply skeptical of concentrated power.",
        "It's one of the good things about us.",
        "But the Tea Party was able to identify the concentrated power we needed to be afraid of as the power of government.",
        "But when you look at what happened, the economy is in this fix because a lot of people on Wall Street and in the financial community invented these very strange and, I think, irresponsible financial instruments that blew up."
