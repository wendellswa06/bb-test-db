        "After months of debate, the White House won its battle with the Democratic leadership in Congress.",
        "Last week the House and Senate approved a bill to fund the war in Iraq that has no deadline for troop withdrawals, but it's far from clear that President Bush can prevail in the next round, which comes in September.",
        "Last week the president spoke in very general terms about having new post-surge configuration in Iraq, which is interpreted as fewer combat troops who would focus on al-Qaida while the bulk of U.S.",
        "forces train the Iraqi army.",
        "It could also be interpreted as the beginning of a withdrawal.",
        "And two Democratic presidential candidates have called on the Pentagon to prepare plans for the pullout that many now regard as inevitable.",
        "But with nearly 160,000 troops currently dispersed throughout Iraq, what would that departure look like?",
        "How quickly could it happen?",
        "How dangerous might it be?",
        "Today we focus on the how of an Iraq exit plan.",
        "Later on the hour, class of 2007, I am honored to be with you here today - Jay Parini on what makes a good commencement speaker.",
        "But first an Iraq exit plan.",
        "What choices need to be made?",
        "What would you do with the equipment and the bases and the embassy and the many Iraqis who have worked for us?",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",
        "That's 800-989-TALK.",
        "The email address is talk@npr.org.",
        "You can also join the conversation on our blog at npr.org/blogofthenation.",
        "And we begin here in Studio 3A with NPR senior foreign editor Loren Jenkins.",
        "Nice to have you back on the program, Loren.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "And to begin with, just as a matter of policy, given this president and the current situation, even if this is going to happen, it's not going to happen anytime soon.",
        "Well, who knows?",
        "Clearly not immediately.",
        "We certainly know that the current policy is going to go on at least until September, when General Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker in Baghdad are supposed to provide a joint report to Congress and the president on assessing the results of the surge.",

        "After that, depending on what their conclusions are, one has to think of what happens after the surge and what are the prospects?",
        "If it's working, obviously no one is going to talk about an exit strategy.",
        "If, as many think, it's not particularly working; today is - this month's casualties are the third highest in the war so far.",
        "If it's not working at some point one has to start thinking about plan B or C, and one of those is going to be an exit strategy.",
        "And as you look ahead towards that exit strategy - well, first of all, the commanders on the ground, you mentioned General Petraeus, General Ray Odierno is the other - the commander - the land commander in Iraq.",
        "They're now talking about extending this surge capacity into 2008.",
        "Some politicians in Washington aren't thinking that far ahead.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "General Petraeus has said there are two timelines.",
        "There's an Iraqi timeline and a Washington timeline, and they don't coincide.",
        "From an Iraqi - if you're sitting in Baghdad, the perspective of conducting this war, it's much slower.",
        "They see a much larger timeline before one could judge any real progress, but there's a recognition there that the timeline in Washington is much shorter for political reasons.",
        "To extend this into 2008, it's going to have a lot of political implications for the elections.",
        "And that is something that a lot of Republican candidates want to avoid and feel that it's going to be difficult enough to support continued funding come September, unless things improve dramatically on the ground, then - much less in 2008",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And anyway, joining us now is retired Army General Robert Scales.",
        "He served over 30 years in the Army, former commandant of the U.S.",
        "Army War College, and he's with us from his home in Maryland.",
        "And General, very good of you to be with us today.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Good to be here, thank you.",
        "And as you contemplate a pullout, obviously it would greatly depend on what the situation is then, but presuming the situation is more or less as it is now - not total chaos and certainly not totally secure either - even so, retreat is historically a very difficult operation.",
        "Well, of course there's a difference between disengagement with an enemy unit while in contact and pulling back from a - from what in essence is a very slow-burning counterinsurgency.",
        "But I mean disengagement is inevitable.",
        "I would argue regardless of what the situation on the ground is in Iraq and in Afghanistan; principally because the number of soldiers that are available to sustain a presence of 160,000 simply won't be there in 2008.",
        "I mean if you do the math, right now the requirement or the present is about 26 brigade equivalents; the normal rotation scheme for a brigade is three brigades - one coming back, one preparing and one in the theater."

        "And in all of the U.S.",
        "military, there are only 48, so if you do the math, clearly what it tells you is that the deployment scheme and the available number of brigades to perform these missions simply can't keep up with a troop strength that large.",
        "So some form of disengagement, regardless of the condition on the ground, is bound to happen beginning in 2008.",
        "Doesn't it get more difficult as more U.S.",
        "troops withdraw and then those are left become more vulnerable, no?",
        "In Congress and on the presidential campaign trail pressure grows to come up with an exit plan for U.S.",

        "Putting politics aside, a pullout would not be easy.",
        "Today our focus is on the how of any exit strategy.",

        "That's right.",
        "But the physicists had their sort of--they were happy with that definition of the second.",
        "The astronomers were perfectly happy going on with the second that was defined by the rotation of the Earth.",
        "Somewhere along the line somebody had to kind of get the two sides together and sort of make them play nice together.",
        "So in 1972, an international conference was convened, and it was decided that rather than try to knock everybody's heads together and make them agree on one time scale, that they would actually have two parallel time scales, each based on atomic time.",
        "But the one that we use for civil timing purposes and that sort of thing, which is Coordinated Universal Time, would essentially mirror what the Earth is doing.",
        "It would be a time scale based on the atomic second, which is constant, but it would be adjusted periodically for the gradual slowing in the rotation rate of the Earth.",
        "So that's what we're doing?",
        "That's basically what we're doing.",
        "In essence, what we're doing is we are stopping the atomic clocks around the world for one second to let the Earth catch up because, when you think about it, it's a lot easier to do it that way than it is to, you know, get Superman out of retirement and have him come do his thing on the Earth itself.",
        "Quickly, Jeff Chester, give me an idea of who cares about this.",
        "I mean, air traffic control, power grids--who cares?",
        "Air traffic control, power grids.",
        "In 1972--we have to kind of jump back in the time machine and put ourselves back, those of us that can remember it--put ourselves back in that situation, where if somebody had told you that there was going to be a computer on your desktop that would literally be networked to computers everywhere around the world, you would have said, `Ha!",
        "Yeah, right.",
        "That's the case.",
        "We have to synchronize everything today very precisely in order to make everything talk to each other.",
        "So global positioning system satellites, we have an error of one second, that's an error that's two-thirds of the distance to the moon.",
