        "(Soundbite of space sounds)",
        "The radio emission from Saturn is controlled by its rotation.",
        "And so every time the planet rotates once, you get a burst of radio emission.",

        "Yes and no. It depends on two things.",
        "It depends on, number one, the pace of withdrawal.",
        "I mean will this be a gradual withdrawal with a redeployment within Iraq?",
        "And secondly, where the troops go once they're withdrawn.",
        "If the troops are withdrawn, say, to regional states - to places like the Gulf states or Kuwait and other areas in the region, that would have a different effect than simply withdrawing them back to the United States.",

        "What would be their mission?",
        "Would it be to continue this close combat function and direct action against al-Qaida?",

        "My question is: It seems to me that we should, you know, we didn't want to give our quote-unquote \"\"enemies\"\" any advance warning that we were leaving because they thought that would be bad, so why not just without notice withdraw everybody all at once?",
        "I mean we have a rapid deployment force; why not make it a rapid redeployment?",
        "We got the huge C5A Galaxies, we got C118s.",
        "We got lots of ships in the Gulf.",
        "We could get all those people out of there in a couple of days.",
        "And until we get our infidel boots off of their hollowed ground, I don't think things are going to calm down there.",
        "General Scales, is that doable?",
        "No, it's not.",
        "Remember now, most of the forces that are in Iraq right now are not a rapid deployment forces.",

        "M1 tanks weigh 70 tons; Bradley Fighting Vehicles weigh 40 tons.",

        "It would take a long, long time to pull all that up and move it all out.",
        "One option, of course, would be to leave the material behind for the Iraqis; but the Iraqis don't have the technical expertise or the infrastructure to be able to keep machines - very complex machines like this running.",

        "I say, going full tilt, the most the U.S.",

        "So the idea that you could dismantle and pull an army of 160,000 troops out of Iraq quickly overnight is just not on.",
        "I mean, it couldn't be done.",
        "And General Scales, some people have talked about an invasion in reverse.",
        "So you start with the troops furthest north and you start pulling them back and start pulling everybody back.",
        "Well, I mean, again, remember now, all of Iraq is not aflame.",
        "The troops that are in the northern part of Iraq, particularly in what's commonly referred to as Kurdistan, are living in a fairly benign environment.",
        "And so a lot of it would depend on how any type of withdrawal would be conducted in those regions of Iraq that are most dangerous, and that of course is western al-Anbar province and Baghdad and the cities immediately in the periphery of Baghdad.",

        "Oh my gracious, Neal.",
        "The Army plans for everything.",
        "I mean, we have legions of military scribes constantly cranking out plans to everything you could possibly imagine.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I don't think you could ever admit what your plans are ahead of time.",
        "But as General Scales says, the Army would be remiss if it didn't have plans, contingency plans, for any scenario that one could imagine.",
        "And certainly an exit strategy has to be one they have to be thinking about.",

        "It's going to be difficult to get them all out through Kuwait.",
        "Well, there are two issues.",
        "Number one is withdrawing the logistics, the infrastructure, as well as the people.",
        "But it's also important to consider what needs to be left behind, because, sadly, the Iraqi army right now is an army that is not only, you know, uniquely Iraqi in how its trained in its culture and so forth, but also in how it's equipped.",
        "So if the U.S.",
        "command is going to prevent absolute, total anarchy and a societal meltdown to occur, then the Iraqis have to be left behind with something, and that would include such things as, obviously, fighting vehicles, communications, logistics, aviation, transportation, administration and all those technical functions and technical bits of equipment that are necessary to allow the Iraqi army to stand a chance of being able to hold on once the American withdrawal begins.",

        "At the moment, the Iraqi army does not have a lot of those capabilities, including aviation, communications, logistics.",
        "That's correct, partly because to certain extent the United States hasn't been willing to provide them.",
        "They don't think they're ready for it.",
        "They're still being trained.",
        "The whole training of this army is still a big question - at what point they're going to be trained enough to take care of their own security.",
        "Right now, the general judgment is they're not ready.",
        "A lot of the American military that's been training them think it may take two to five or three more years to get to that stage, which means whenever you start talking about an exit strategy - can this be done relying on the Iraqis to step up and take over where the Americans are now?",
        "I think this is the big question.",

        "Oh, it would be a huge concern.",

        "Tens of thousands were left behind, mostly because it all came so fast.",
        "The final collapse of the many - the 7,000 or so that were evacuated, a lot of those were Vietnamese who had worked with the American forces.",
        "And many were taken out, but tens of thousands never got out.",
        "Some took out on boats.",
        "We had the whole wave of boat people fleeing Vietnam, South Vietnam.",

        "There are proposals ranging from, you know, camps next to the border with Kuwait.",
        "Maybe they can go to Jordan or to Syria.",
        "Jordan and Syria are already overburdened with Iraqi refugees, and I would think the idea of supplying camps in the deserts of Iraq would be difficult.",
        "There are two million refugees already in Jordan and Syria, and both those governments are overwhelmed trying to cope with those.",
        "They couldn't take another wave of refugees very easily.",
