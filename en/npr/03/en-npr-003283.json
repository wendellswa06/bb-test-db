        "And more fundamentally, what is their function?",
        "Loren Jenkins, this comes, I guess, under the question of policy.",

        "We would abandon these four bases.",

        "The intention was to transform the Middle East by changing Iraq, overthrowing a government, supposedly setting a democracy at work there that would flower and change the whole nature of the Middle East, spill over borders, change authoritarian governments, create an ideal - this is the Neo-con vision.",
        "Now, it obviously was distorted and impractical and unreal.",
        "I think the bases were part of that grander vision, that the U.S.",
        "was going to have a presence there.",
        "I think what we're seeing in Iraq today is that we can't have a presence there over the long term.",
        "They don't want us, and they'll fight us until we get out of there.",
        "I think that's the message of the insurgency.",
        "And at one point, it's going to become too costly to us politically, too costly economically, to stay there.",
        "And at that point, there will be a withdrawal.",
        "General Scales, as you look at those bases, again, you think of the enormous facilities.",

        "Most of the expense of those bases is in the highly technical material and the fighting systems that are maintained there.",
        "And I would suspect - then again, I don't know this for sure - but I would suspect as these bases are emptied, they would be turned over to the Iraq military to be used principally for those very same functions - things like command and control and billeting, logistics, administration - all those functions that I mentioned to you earlier that we do so well that the Iraqis don't do so well.",

        "Number one is the insurgency is not that intense.",
        "Remember now, the American's withdrawal in Vietnam in 1975 occurred because there were 19 North Vietnamese divisions, some of them armored mechanizing - mechanized, rushing down Highway 1 toward Saigon.",
        "That's not going to happen in Iraq.",
        "Iraq, as I said, is a fairly low-level insurgency, and so the pace of withdrawal would be measured.",
        "And secondly, the United States has bases in the periphery of Iraq and could continue to even have a presence in Iraq for some period of time, particularly with - focused on the function of trying to stand up and get the Iraqi military capable of taking on the insurgency.",
