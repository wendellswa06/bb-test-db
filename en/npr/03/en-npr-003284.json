        "The enemy is different.",
        "However, I think policy wise, we got into Iraq with making some of the same mistakes, misconceptions, a lack of planning, a lack of understanding of what we were doing in Vietnam as we did in Iraq.",
        "There are huge parallels there about what we knew when we started this thing and what we knew when we started Vietnam.",
        "Right.",
        "We didn't know much when we started the war in Vietnam, and we clearly ignored all the information and evidence of what Iraq would be all about.",
        "And that we have, you know, intelligence reports have - didn't know that, it was - the evidence was here.",
        "There was - the government was informed.",
        "It chose to ignore a lot of information that really pointed that if we went into Iraq, we'd be in the mess we are now, and the same thing with Vietnam.",
        "And some of the problems of the withdrawal of Vietnam were sort of an unwillingness to comprehend it could end so quickly.",
        "Are we in the same situation now in Iraq?",
        "Well, you know, as I say, I think General Scales is right.",
        "I mean, Vietnam was totally - first, we'd already withdrawn the American - the basic American forces were withdrawn from Vietnam way before the evacuation of Saigon.",
        "The last couple of years, the war was fought mostly by South Vietnamese with, you know, U.S.",

        "But the main forces were already gone.",
        "What was left there was civilians, contractors, some military technicians, reporters and CIA, people like that.",
        "That last evacuation was small, relatively small, the people you had to get out.",
        "This is totally different.",
        "I mean, you have a full army in place with all of its equipment in Iraq fighting.",
        "It's not a huge, conventional army, but a guerilla war.",

        "war in Iraq was unnecessary, has cost thousands of lives among U.S.",
        "and Iraqis and has tied down and depleted U.S.",
        "forces at a time when they might be needed elsewhere.",

        "It's like saying we lost too many people on D-Day because the plan to attack the beaches wasn't adequately well thought out.",
        "The reality is we're there, and the question is what do we do about it to focus on what we need to do now to ensure that we can leave Iraq in a stable situation and continue our effort to defeat the terrorists worldwide.",
        "Well, before I follow up on that, senator, let me backtrack, again, myself 'cause as I don't have to tell you, in a political year the decision to go to war gets cited constantly because there are people on the other side of the aisle who say, look, why vote for any Republican candidate because these are the people who essentially designed the edsel(ph) of foreign policy?",
        "Well, it's an unfair charge given the fact that all of the Democratic leaders, including Hillary Clinton and their previous presidential candidate, John Kerry, supported the same resolution to authorize military action based on the same intelligence that caused all of our leaders, as well as leaders abroad, to conclude that there was a problem with Iraq that had to be dealt with.",
        "It was multifaceted.",
        "But, again, it's a false political game that these folks are playing to turn attention away from the fact that it turns out that our effort in Iraq is working now.",
        "Senator Kyl, are you worried that the U.S.",
        "effort to remain in Iraq in some areas almost block-by-block ties down U.S.",
        "forces who might be needed elsewhere in the world?",
        "Well, you always worry about our forces being stretched too thin.",
        "Part of that is because during the Clinton years our military was decimated in terms of the amount of money spent on it, in terms of the drawdown in the number of troops, the number of ships, the number of planes and all the rest of it.",
        "Hmm, that's quite interesting.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "And almost everybody now on a nonpartisan basis believes that we have to enhance our military capability because we have responsibilities around the world.",
        "So, yes, it would be nice if we didn't have as many people tied down in Iraq as we do, but the reality is we do.",
        "And the Gallup Poll just came out that reveals that by a two-to-one margin, 65-32, that Americans believe that the United States should establish a reasonable level of stability and security in Iraq before that we fully withdraw our troops."

        "And part of the blame lies with us, I think or more precisely, the U.N.",

        "But it is also, and it should be said in the last two or three months, that their parliament and leaders have stepped up and made some tough decisions.",

        "I did.",
        "John McCain came back saying if we don't have some kind of a surge in troops, we're not going to be able to turn this thing around.",
        "Well, his advice was taken.",
        "He knew that that could jeopardize his candidacy for president.",
        "Well, time has demonstrated that his thoughts on that, backed up later by President Bush and General Petraeus, turned out to be correct.",

        "I won my election by 10 points over a guy that put about $13 million of his own money into the race.",
        "No, it's not tough defending what you believe in, defending what you believe is right.",

        "But this year, you know, really, it's pretty much hoping to have business as usual, you know, that's really what the whole Christmas Count is all about - keeping things going in the way they have been done for so long, which is why it makes it such a good yardstick to measure how the birds are doing.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This year, you put out a watch list for those birds at greatest risk.",
        "Tell us about them.",
        "Yes, the 2007 watch list was actually published in American Birds, which is the publication that results from each year's Christmas bird count.",
        "The watch list is basically, as you said, it's - this was a joint publication of Audubon and the American Bird Conservancy as well as many other authors.",
        "And what it does is it allows us to sort of publicize which birds are most at risk.",
        "There are basically three levels on the watch list at this point, which is the red watch list, which are the birds that are most severely declining, and then two different levels on the yellow watch list, which means - which are birds that are either declining but not as severely or have potential threats or very limited range or population size.",
