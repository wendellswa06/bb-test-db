        "Trump really is the glue that binds and is keeping this conservative movement together.",
        "He tried to say that they'd be unstoppable as long as there's no split, of course.",

        "What were his takeaways?",
        "Yeah, that's definitely true.",
        "You know, clearly this is a guy who's been the inspirational leader for Trump.",

        "Priebus is much more of the tactician.",
        "Bannon - much more into that world view.",
        "And that's something that is driving the Trump White House.",
        "He has very different views than traditional conservatism, which is usually what drives CPAC here, the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
        "You know, Bannon called for the deconstruction of the administrative state (laughter), which has to do with breaking down government and regulations.",
        "He cavalierly talked about the idea of America first and, quote, \"\"sovereignty,\"\" which is something that's - really used to be a fringe in the conservative movement, but that Trump and Bannon have made front and center of what's driving it.",
        "You know, that includes things like being against free trade, more of a protectionist foreign policy.",
        "And he talked about national culture, which is interesting.",
        "You know, Trump has really complicated a relationship with this group here at CPAC.",
        "This group had been behind Ted Cruz, behind the Pauls for years.",
        "But when Priebus and Bannon weren't speaking, there were chants of Trump, Trump, Trump, and it does seem the takeover is complete.",
        "Back on the program, there was another high-profile visit from the White House administration - Betsy DeVos, secretary of education.",
        "And she's showing up there basically a day after the Trump administration withdrew guidance from the Obama era on the rights of transgender students.",
        "And that's a move that frankly felt like a victory for those in the room at CPAC - right?",
        "- but there were reports that DeVos wasn't on board.",

        "Yeah, this was really interesting because she came here and had some brief remarks and then was interviewed afterward by a Trump supporter and a CNN political commentator.",

        "She hit the education establishment and the media, but she tried to walk a fine line when it came to transgender rights.",
        "Let's listen to what she had to say.",

        "This issue was a very huge example of the Obama administration's overreach - to suggest a one-size-fits-all federal government approach - top-down approach - to issues that are best dealt with and solved at a personal level and a local level.",
        "You know, it's interesting 'cause you noted going in that there was lots of interest in DeVos here today because there were these reported tensions between her and the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on the language rescinding that Obama Administration guidance on transgender rights.",
        "She wound up putting out her own statements - separate from the joint statement that she and Sessions put out - echoing some of what she said today and noting that the education department and schools also needed to protect transgender students from bullying.",

        "Some turn to cooling caps to help prevent baldness, but they haven't been studied extensively in the U.S., and they don't always work.",
        "Now researchers say a new kind of cooling cap system used before and during chemo could help prevent baldness.",

        "When Shawna Mayberry was 58 years old and diagnosed with breast cancer, she expected to lose her hair during chemotherapy, but she didn't.",
        "She was part of a study looking at the effectiveness of a cooling cap system that covers the scalp and delivers liquid coolant before, during and after chemo.",

        "I used to live in Indiana, and in the summer, we had an outdoor pool.",

        "This was the same thing.",
        "Even comforting, she says.",

        "Some experience discomfort or headaches.",
        "Others dropped out of a study because the cold was too much to bear.",
        "But for patients like Mayberry who used the cap during every session of chemo hair loss was reduced by at least half."

        "Oncologist Julie Nangia headed the study.",

        "Thank you, Ron.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Physical activity is a very important part of the equation, but it's only one of two parts; the first is how many calories you expend, physical activity; the second is how many calories you consume, nutrition.",
        "And both of those things have gotten worse.",
        "But, actually, the more important part of that equation has been the rise in calorie consumption in the US, and that's a reflection of food being cheaper and calories being cheaper.",
        "It's also true that physical activity appears to be less than it was in the past, and it's important to increase physical activity.",
        "People, even if they're overweight--if you get regular physical activity, at least 30 minutes four days a week, even of a brisk walk, that is enough, even if you don't lose weight, to help you avoid diabetes or, if you've got it, control it better and improve your health in many other ways as well.",
        "So physical activity is very important.",
        "In terms of the obesity epidemic, it's the increase in calories that's probably the bigger part of the equation.",
        "Now we've come to think of public health problems in terms of infectious disease, things that can from one person to another.",
        "Why is diabetes, in your mind, a public health problem?",
        "Well, if you go back a little farther, it's quite clear that public health started with safe food and safe water and safe things to drink.",
        "And, in fact, that's what we're talking about again: how our society and how the context of our society has changed to force us, really, to address some basic issues of what's happening."

        "Well, tell us a little bit about how this tracking program is going to work.",
        "What we'll do is no doctors will have to report anything, and any person living with diabetes who doesn't ever want to be contacted will never be contacted.",
        "What we'll do is work with laboratories that do the tests to have them electronically report it to us.",
        "Once we have that information, we will be able to track on a citywide basis what--the number of people and the risk factors for having diabetes that's severely out of control.",
        "We'll be able to reach out to doctors' offices, hospitals, health centers and clinics and offer additional support for the doctors, administrators and their patients to provide them with better care, whether it's for diabetes or hypertension, which so many diabetics have, or assistance quitting smoking because that's particularly toxic to everyone and even more so to people with diabetes.",
        "If I'm a diabetic in New York, how do you know about that?",

        "The laboratory will report to us.",
        "We've been keeping confidential medical information for 100 years; we have not had a breach in confidentiality.",
        "And in this case, in fact, our board of health approved the proposal which has even tighter confidentiality controls than it does in the case of communicable disease.",
        "So there is no way an insurance company or even another doctor, other than the one who is caring for you, will get access to this information if you're a diabetic in New York City.",
        "In fact, because we're so concerned about people--you know, might be asked to sign many forms when they sign up for insurance or some other reason, we don't even allow information to go out--we won't allow the information to go out to other parties, even if the patient asked.",
        "We'll send it to a patient anytime they want, and they can send it to wherever they want, but we're very, very carefully protecting confidentiality so that no one, other than the patient and the doctor who's caring for that patient, has access to it.",

        "Well, our data would suggest, particularly since the late '90s when tribal leaderships themselves got actively involved in this and began to share with their communities that the only way this would be solved is by their active change in lifestyle--beginning in that time period, we have seen very active compliance, a real decline in hemoglobin A1cs, which is sort of a blood measure of how well their blood sugar is being controlled.",
        "And, in fact, it's begun to show a slight downturn in the mortality rate associated with diabetes and end-stage renal disease, which is a very common secondary disease that occurs in diabetes."
