        "I had a grandmother on my father's side who had diabetes, and also I have a cousin on my mother's side who has diabetes; he got it as a child.",
        "But, obviously, diet is just, I think, the major--it plays a major role.",
        "And I grew up on an organic farm in California, worked with Whole Foods for many years and had a lot of folks that shop there.",
        "And I think eating a pure diet, or pure as it can be, really helps control diabetes.",
        "And I think that, like you mentioned on the program, you have a lot of Latinos and it's a lot of the poverty in New York where you're seeing the issue.",
        "And I think it's a lack of either information on healthy diet or healthy eating or maybe not being able to afford those types of foods.",
        "And I'm not saying it has to be organic, but choosing whole grains vs. white or choosing, you know, fresh vegetables vs. canned, that type of thing.",
        "I do think that that makes a big different.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks, Robby.",

        "Nutrition is clearly very important.",
        "Some of the things that we know make a difference are having smaller portions.",
        "Portion size has increased enormously in this country and kind of proliferation of value meals and all you can eat and free refills on sodas.",
        "This is clearly a contributing factor.",
        "Similarly, if you look at the food industry in this country, I think nationally we need to look at the incentives that are in place.",
        "We continue to subsidize sugar-sweetened foods in the middle of an obesity epidemic, and we continue to allow food companies to aggressively market junk food to young children when it's been shown quite clearly that kids at a very young age have no concept of the difference...",

        "Thank you, Frank.",
        "To what extent does diabetes affect Native Americans?",
        "Well, diabetes has affected Native Americans about three times what it affects the general US population.",
        "And we've seen it make a march, if you will, from the Southwest up into Alaska.",
        "Twenty years ago Alaskan Natives didn't really perceive diabetes as a problem, but now the rates up there also are two- and three-fold what it is in the general population.",
        "And what's going on?",
        "Well, our belief--and NIH, our colleagues in the Department of Health and Human Services, have worked with us closely on this for a number of years.",
        "And we don't have any good genetic data that would suggest that there's a genetic difference.",
        "But certainly the change in diet and the decline in exercise as a daily phenomenon has clearly been associated with a change in the rate of diabetes in the population we serve.",
        "So--but is that any different, do you think, than the population at large?"

        "Well, I think not.",
        "I think that the issues that have made it unique in Indian country probably have been that because of the rates of poverty and so on, access to the kind of more balanced diet that we think of as being most healthful has been something difficult for Indian people to acquire, both in terms of what's available from stores and that sort of thing as well as the fact that in many communities, commodities foods historically were a mainstay of their diet.",
        "And up until the last 10 years or so, those commodities foods were extremely high in carbohydrates and fats.",
        "What about treatment?",
        "Is that hard to come by as well?",
        "Well, no. Frank, this is a success story, and we feel very positive about it, and that is Congress has provided us some additional funds to take a very aggressive approach to managing diabetes.",
        "And in the mid-1980s, because of the frequency of the problem, with consultation with the American Diabetes Association, NIH and others, we established standards at that point and began a very aggressive process of both primary prevention and very active treatment.",
        "And because we have an electronic medical record, we've been able to use that record to follow the course of the disease in our population and guide and support our providers in assuring that they are using the best practices for treatment and management of the disease.",
        "Is there any better compliance among the Native population than there is at--the nation, you know, as a whole?",

        "I was curious as to the physiological mechanism between the obesity and the increase in Type II diabetes, if it's just the body's inability to deal with the extra sugar that people are bringing in or if it's more complicated than that--I'm sure it is...",

        "Frank, I think that that mechanism is pretty well understood in the sense that as extra carbohydrates are deposited as fat cells, the resistance to insulin, which is the secretion that your body produces to help you use glucose to the best effect--resistance to that naturally occurring helper becomes higher because those fat cells actually may be binding the insulin, so that as you develop more fat cells, in effect, in most people you begin to see a greater increase in resistance to the body's own natural use of glucose.",
        "And as far as children go, the same phenomenon occurs there.",
        "And one of the things that we've been encouraging very strongly in Indian country is breast feeding in early life because the scientific data shows that children who are breast fed up to six months of age--longer would be nice but up to six months of age--have a lower risk of diabetes Type II later in life.",
        "And we're not sure exactly why, although a strongly suggested mechanism is that they develop less early fat cell development in that early stage of life, and therefore they develop less insulin resistance as they grow older.",
        "Any indication that the effort to promote breast feeding is working?",
        "Well, we believe that slowly and incrementally our younger moms in particular are seeing this as something that they really want to do to protect their children in the future.",
        "And we are seeing small increases, although we don't have a broad database at the moment on that particular question.",

        "Just a quick comment.",
        "I was at my doctor's within the past year for an annual physical, and he was debating with me on getting on the cholesterol-lowering drug.",
        "And then he showed me a study that indicated that if you took all of the risk factors for having a fatal heart attack combined--this study indicated that being diabetic was actually--presented a larger risk of having a fatal heart attack than all of the other normal risk factors that we associate with smoking, obesity, hypertension, family history and so on.",
        "I was shocked.",
        "I'm not diabetic, but I will do everything that I can to make sure that I try to avoid it.",
        "I thought that it was an amazing statistic.",
        "Thank you, Greg.",
        "Let's get a response.",
        "Have you seen that, Dr. Vanderwagen?",
        "Well, yeah, it's interesting because in diabetes, it's not infrequent for lipids to go up and heart disease to develop, so that you end up with a multisystem problem that's not just limited to the fact that your blood sugar is elevated; that change in blood sugar management leads frequently to these other secondary effects in the target organs if you will: the heart, the kidneys, the blood vessels.",
        "And one of the standards that we hold our people accountable to--and I think the American Diabetic Association is also supportive of--is monitoring a wide variety of these kinds of things: lipids, hypertension and kidney function as you manage the diabetes because it's not just a matter of the blood sugar.",
        "It's the secondary organ involvements that ultimately are going to lead to multisystem failure.",
        "And not only is the diabetes impact on the organs, but talk about the difficulty of treating patients for anything that they come to the hospital for to see a doctor for if they have diabetes as well as whatever they came to see the doctor about.",
        "Well, diabetes, of course--because your blood sugar is elevated, what that indicates is that your cells are not getting all the sugar they need to function properly.",
        "And that leads to a wide variety of problems, everything from your white cells not being able to react as effectively to infections to, as I've suggested, your kidneys not functioning properly; the blood supply to the retina of your eye can be problematic, and you have problems with vision and so on.",
        "Every cell in your body, in effect, becomes starved because the proper levels of glucose are not entering into the cell and, therefore, not available for the cell to do its business."
