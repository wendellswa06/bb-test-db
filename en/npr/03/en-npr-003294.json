        "Well, medication I--and, you know, I'm on a little bit of shaky ground here, but I think the last numbers that I saw were that average diabetics could expect as much as $9,000 a year in costs for the management of that disease.",
        "And that's not inconsequential if you're living on an average sort of income.",
        "And for elders who end up on fixed income, that amount on an annual basis for costs, including pharmaceuticals and laboratory and the gas to get to and from the doctor and so on--all those things add up and can be a significant financial burden on individuals, particularly on fixed income.",
        "A burden on the individual.",
        "And you heard in New York City they're looking at it as a public health problem.",
        "To what extent is the--should the public take this seriously?",
        "In other words, what is the cost to the public in letting this go untreated?",
        "Well, it--in our system in Indian country--and we are obviously relatively small; we have about 1,600,000 or so patients that we see on a routine base.",
        "The cost in terms of end-of-life care alone becomes extremely huge when you consider renal failure.",
        "I mean, dialysis on average can run 35 to $40,000 a year, and that's covered by Medicare, but that's a cost that we absorb as a society.",
        "And it's those kind of end organ changes, amputations leading to disability leading to the inability to work and, therefore, those people have to be sustained through other community assets and resources, the cost of this disease is huge.",
        "We're talking today about diabetes, a disease that is rapidly increasing, owing in large part to the increase in obesity in the United States.",
        "Diet has a huge role to play in the increased incidence of this disease.",
        "In New York City, it's become a public health problem.",
        "The city will begin to monitor its diabetics to see how well-controlled they are.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "I'm Frank Stasio, and I'm talking with Craig Vanderwagen right now.",
        "He's an MD and chief medical officer with the Indian Health Service.",
        "You talked earlier about management improving, and when we say management, we're talking about both compliance in using the medicines and using them on a regular basis and, also, those lifestyle changes.",
        "Are you seeing compliance in both areas?",
        "People are using their medicine and changing their lifestyle?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think, Frank, that one of the things that impressed people in the Indian country was a research project that was funded by NIH in the '90s.",
        "It was called the Diabetes Prevention Project, and they looked at the effectiveness of medical treatment vs. diet and exercise.",
        "And a part of the folks who were involved in the study were out in Navajo country, so there was a significant Indian cohort to this study.",
        "And what that study demonstrated was that individuals who had a personal coach and participated in active exercise and changed their diet has as good an outcome as individuals who were treated with the usual medications that we provide for diabetes.",
        "This information went through Indian country pretty dramatically, in part because there were Indian people involved in the study and, in part, because community leadership recognized immediately that there was a real potential there for a more natural approach to the care and prevention of the disease.",
        "So, yeah, we have seen a rising acceptance and participation in those kind of prevention strategies.",
        "And for folks who are interested in seeing what some of this looks like, on our Web site there is documentation of not only the treatment from the medical perspective but, also, some of their prevention programs and the levels of participation that we've seen rising over the last 10 years or so.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm a medical student in Ohio, and I was just wondering how important you think it is to identify people with metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance before they get diabetes?",
        "And do you think that doctors are educated enough to deal with that kind of thing?",
        "Thanks, Adrian.",
        "Well, Adrian raises a critical question, and one--our approach to that is that we are changing the way we deliver health services and focusing more on the community and patients, which is where New York is headed, in a way that does these kind of risk assessments.",
        "And then the whole team of providers and health professionals--nutrition, optometrists, exercise physiologists, nurses and so on--engage the community and individuals in programs that will mitigate the risk factors that we identified, including sort of the pre-diabetes, where they may have some slight elevation in their blood sugar or where they may appear to have the beginnings of insulin resistance.",
        "And, yes, we believe that if you focus properly and you think about your service delivery program as focused on those patients in a community, that you have a much greater chance of being able to intervene successful in mitigating those risk factors, even though there's physiology that suggests a problem.",
        "Very briefly, we have an e-mail from Gary in Cincinnati, who wants to know something about the glycemic index and whether it can provide early warning.",
        "Did I get that right?",

        "And we use that as a primary indicator rather than simply relying on a random sample of their blood sugar.",
        "Now patients on a day-to-day basis may monitor their glucose throughout the course of the day and adjust medications, exercise and diet based on that kind of information.",
