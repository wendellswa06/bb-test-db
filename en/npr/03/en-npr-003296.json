        "Is that your impression?",
        "It's been a quiet visit, and everybody thinks it's a quiet visit because they tend to compare it with the visit 20 years ago of Diana, which was a much more glitzy and glamorous affair.",
        "You will remember that the Reagans invited all Diana's favorite Hollywood stars, and she got to dance with John Travolta.",

        "Royal trips like this are basically diplomatic missions; they're not show business.",
        "It seems to me also that one of the most interesting things about seeing them together--the prince and Camilla--is that they do seem to like each other rather more than Prince Charles and Diana did.",
        "Yes, I think you can tell by the body language that they are very much at ease with each other.",
        "I have seen comments during the last few days as to if they're so much in love and husband and wife, why don't they touch each other in public?",
        "I think that's a misunderstanding.",
        "When they're in public, they're working.",
        "They're meeting and greeting, and of course, they are British so they're a bit reserved, so their intimacies they will reserve for a time they are in private and not in public view.",
        "I wonder if you find in covering the family that Diana's son, Prince William, generates the kind of rock star excitement that we've seen in the past.",

        "Vets make up about 8 percent of the incarcerated population, and that's much lower than the percentage of the population at large that are veterans.",

        "If you look at their age brackets in the prisons, they are a much smaller percentage of the overall prison population.",

        "That did happen after Vietnam.",

        "That didn't happen this time.",

        "The study didn't go into explanations, but the most obvious answer would be the draft.",
        "Through Vietnam, there was a conscript drafted military.",
        "And once the Pentagon shifted to an all-volunteer force, these numbers started dropping.",
        "And it's dropped every time they measured since 1978.",

        "And prison is a really terrible place to try and deal with PTSD, as we've reported.",
        "Most of the treatments for PTSD involve trying to wind down from that combat mindset, that sort of hypervigilance, but that's something you kind of need to keep with you in prison.",

        "By slowing down those cells, whatever the mechanism may be - by starving their blood flow or slowing them down straightforwardly - has the net benefit of causing the hair not to fall out."
