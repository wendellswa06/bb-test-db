        "The outcome of this spring's presidential election in Iran is anything but certain.",
        "That's the view of many ordinary citizens in Iran and many of the analysts and activists watching the maneuvering of various candidates that is even now under way.",
        "There are many serious objections to the deeds of Ahmadinejad, even among the very fundamental conservatives who are backing him.",
        "Therefore, his future is a little bit shaky.",
        "Ibrahim Yazdi is a longtime reformist politician in Iran, who was Iran's foreign minister for a short period right after the 1979 Islamic revolution.",
        "And for Yazdi, like everyone in the reformist camp, the one big question is: Will former President Mohammad Khatami run again?",
        "Khatami was the popular reformer who was president from 1997 to 2005.",
        "Khatami's presidency galvanized the movement for political reform in Iran, but he was frequently stymied by the conservative clerical institutions that hold great power in Iran.",
        "When Khatami left office four years ago, he left behind a strong feeling of disappointment and disillusion, and the reform movement has been wounded and weak since then.",
        "Now, says editor Issa Saharkhiz, four years of Ahmadinejad have convinced the highly splintered reform movement to coalesce around anyone who could defeat the conservative president.",
        "Most of the people and most of the reformists are pragmatists.",
        "The best situation for Iran is putting away Mr. Ahmadinejad.",
        "Most reformers agree that the candidate who stands the best chance of doing that is former President Khatami.",
        "Khatami is seriously considering joining the race.",
        "He meets nearly every day with advisers to discuss the pros and cons.",
        "He is known to believe that Ahmadinejad's economic and foreign policies have been bad for the country.",
        "He believes Iran had more respect internationally during his administration.",
        "It is widely believed that Khatami would pose a serious challenge to Ahmadinejad and, says Issa Saharkhiz, that has caused concern among top clerics, including Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
        "There are a lot of pressure on Mr. Khatami.",
        "It's coming from the high-level person in the country, military and special groups.",
        "There is also the question of whether Khatami would even be permitted to run.",
        "The Guardian Council here, dominated by conservative jurists and religious figures, has the final say over who can run for office and has often disqualified reformist candidates."

        "Those who know Khatami say he believes the council wouldn't dare disqualify him.",
        "Still, the mood of the voters is hard to read.",
        "Reliable polling is not available, so there are just educated guesses, often tainted by wishful thinking.",
        "One big issue is city versus village in Iran - city voters being better educated and tending toward the liberal side - village voters more conservative.",
        "Mohammed Atrianfar, a reform journalist, believes that the chaotic economic policies of Ahmadinejad, which have pushed inflation above 25 percent and seen unemployment grow, have cost him much support.",
        "(Through translator) Even in the suburbs, and in the villages and in the poor areas, he had a lot of supporters.",
        "We think that he has lost a lot of them.",
        "And it's not just the reformers who see Ahmadinejad's vulnerability.",
        "Many conservatives, too, have come to be critical of the controversial Iranian president.",
        "Iran's presidential election has two rounds.",
        "There could be as many as half a dozen or more candidates in the first round.",
        "The top two vote-getters advance to the second round.",
        "If the top two include Ahmadinejad and another conservative, Ahmadinejad will have trouble, says conservative analyst Amir Mohebian.",
        "All of the persons who wants to give the votes knew Ahmadinejad, will give the votes to the rival of Mr. Ahmadinejad.",
        "And in addition, the votes of the reformists, they don't want to give the votes to Mr. Ahmadinejad.",
        "It helps to rival Mr. Ahmadinejad to be winner.",
        "So, the political dynamic in Iran is in flux and could take a dramatic and unexpected turn when Iranians go to the polls on June 12th.",

        "Well, it's a tremendous victory for California in our many year-long struggle to establish standards that will force the automakers to produce and sell us cars that we know they can make because they're already selling them in some parts of the world that are cleaner and more efficient.",
        "But it's also important I think for the future because it really sets our country on a path to begin working, hopefully, with the auto industry to transform our domestic auto manufacturing into something that is more in keeping with the needs of the 21st century.",
        "Now as we heard in Elizabeth Shogren's piece, the automakers are not very happy about this.",
        "They're still fighting the proposed standards.",
        "They say that this whole process is somewhat chaotic and confusing with a patchwork of laws to apply to some states and not to others.",
        "I don't think it's a patchwork.",
        "There is one standard which has been adopted by California, and because of the Federal Clean Air Act, now 16 states are joining with us to adopt our standards.",
        "So, states that represent a majority of the consumers in the United States will, in fact, be using the exact same standards for cars and light trucks.",

        "The U.S.",

        "And I'm afraid it looks exactly like that now.",
        "The killings in Cairo are moral horror, but also, I think, a political mistake that will heighten polarization quickly to something like a civil war.",
        "The difficulty is the Obama administration's policy is basically democratic realism.",
        "You know, the first priority of American foreign policy is to protect the country and its interests.",
        "But we also recognize that the spread of democracy and freedom is both a good and it's something, in the long run, helpful to the United States.",
        "And in here, where we value the alliance with Egypt, it's a lynchpin of our policy in the Middle East, but we're stuck with a government here that we disapprove of.",
        "And I think that explains - it's not paralysis, but the caution of the Obama administration.",
        "David, what do you think about this?",

        "First, let me say, on Egypt, though, my colleague Kareem Fahim did a great piece on a working-class neighborhood in Cairo where they were all for it.",
