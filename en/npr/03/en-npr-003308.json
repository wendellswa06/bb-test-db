        "In fact, the very warmest temperatures of any time in the last 65 million years occurred within this range of 50 to 55 million.",
        "We call this the thermal maximum for the Cenozoic for the last 65 million years.",
        "And the way to think about this just in metaphorical terms, it's as if you took the climate of a place like Texas and moved it 20 degrees north to where Minnesota is.",

        "You just stick them in the freezer?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It takes - you know, we leave them in there for 24 to 48 hours to make sure that they're thoroughly frozen.",
        "But that's sort of a kinder, gentler way to get rid of them.",
        "What can people, particularly people listening in South Florida, what can they do to defend themselves?",
        "Well, they just need to be on the lookout for these snails.",
        "And we have a toll free helpline.",
        "Like I said, it's kind of us against the snails.",
        "And the residents that have had hundreds of these in their yard right on the block where they were likely established, they're quick to tell you anything you can do to get rid of them.",
        "Richard Gaskalla is the director of plant industry at Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.",

        "That's right.",
        "Los Angeles has not gone to Washington, D.C., with its hand out.",
        "We've gone with our arm out to extend a partnership with the federal government to get people back to work.",
        "The other thing we're saying is, invest directly in cities and municipalities.",
        "When you think about it, some 84 percent of the population lives in metropolitan areas.",
        "So when you give money directly to the states, take off the top and then give back to the cities, you're not getting the best bang for the buck, and you're not moving these projects as quickly as possible."

        "Well, this is one of the areas where I think the auto companies have been shooting themselves in the foot because they continually argue that this new program is somehow going to add thousands of additional dollars to the price of a vehicle.",
        "That's just not true.",
        "We think that, on average, the additional cost of compliance, which get us to a 30 percent improvement in fuel economy by the year 2016, the cost of that is going to be less than $400 on the price of the vehicle.",
