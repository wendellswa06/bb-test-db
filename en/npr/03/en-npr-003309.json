        "But here's the interesting thing, a lot of paleontologists - in fact, evolutionary biologists in general - would really have no problem anymore with mammals of the sort that we are having arisen between 85 and 100 million years ago.",
        "There's a lot of favorable molecular evidence in particular that supports that idea.",
        "The fossils, however, from this time period - and now I'm going to go from, say, 75 million up to about 55 million - the fossil mammal record at this point is dominated by these weird groups that have very little to do with us, although if they're (unintelligible) by formal definition mammals, they didn't have anything to do with us.",

        "And then at 50 to 55 million the graphs sort of switch."
