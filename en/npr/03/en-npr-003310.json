        "No, this is something - I'm now going to stand up for traditional paleontology.",
        "This is something paleontologists have known for at least a hundred years.",
        "We knew about these non-thereons.",
        "We knew about the rise of modern groups.",
        "The way it was traditionally interpreted, however, was that our ancestors really didn't get the spark until sometime after the disappearance of the dinosaurs.",
        "There was an explosion - a very short fuse, as we call it.",
        "And what's changed now is all of this molecular evidence that suggests the fuse was very much longer, at least, as I say, 85 to 100 million years ago for the initial diversification of mammals like us.",
        "And that's put a lot of pressure on traditional paleontology to explain.",
        "If it is the case that we go back that far, then why haven't paleontologists been able to identify ancestors?",
        "And I think what our study may suggest in an indirect way is that not only weren't there very many of them for a long period of time but they were persistently primitive.",
        "And as I'm sure you know, the story of the evolution of mammals and really of any vertebrate group is really teeth succeeding one another through time.",

        "Go ahead.",
        "So, now, I'm pouring in some heavy whipping cream.",
        "It's got to be at least 30 percent cream.",
        "See, I've got a question, but it may not have a whole lot to do with what you're talking about.",
        "But has anybody done any studies having to do with when the magnetic poles shift on the Earth, if that has anything to do with the evolution of mammals and dinosaurs and the changes that occurred that there.",
        "I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You got Dr. MacPhee to at least raise an eyebrow on that one.",
        "Scott, that's an interesting question.",
        "Lot's of people have asked that.",
        "In fact, going well back into the 1960s, when there was the first assembly of a decent record for pole switching.",
        "The thing is - and just in a nutshell - the switches don't most of the time, and especially in the time that we're talking about, seem to be correlated with anything particularly important in terms of rapid evolution and diversification.",
        "It sort of makes sense, doesn't it, that a change on that scale should have had some kind of effect.",
        "But when you begin to parse it, it probably didn't because even if there was no polarity on the Earth for a while, it wouldn't have been for very long, which means that the solar storms and so forth that might provoke increased mutation and perhaps evolution wouldn't have had a very long time scale in which to operate.",
        "So it's a very interesting question, but nobody has actually pinned diversification of mammals to a change in the position of poles."

        "If this longer fuse had been seen earlier, instead of anticipating there was a short fuse you knew years ago that it was a much longer fuse as you do now, would the dinosaur extinction still have played into your thinking, or the previously accepted thing that in that their dying out led to the mammals?",

        "Now, your question is whether this is a repeating phenomenon.",
        "Well, some paleontologists take the position that probably most, if not all, of dramatic changes in flora and fauna were prompted by catastrophes on this scale.",
        "Maybe not in every case of bolide impact, but perhaps that's the likeliest.",
        "The other really big extinction in Earth history, which is much earlier than the one that we're talking about right now, was at the Permo-Triassic boundary around 250 millions years ago.",
        "And in many ways it was probably the worst extinction of all time or at least in sort of more recent times in Earth history.",
        "Maybe somewhere upward of 95 percent of all marine organisms, for example, died out in that extinction and was equally bad on land.",
        "People have long looked for a single kind of cause or a believable catastrophe that might have affected it, and there is some evidence and some actually fairly good evidence that there was an impact at roughly that time which, again, changed the world.",
        "Going into Cenozoic times in the last 65 million years, there have certainly been impactors of much smaller size probably by and large, and some of them could have had an affect although none on scale of either the K-T(ph) or Permo-Triassic."
