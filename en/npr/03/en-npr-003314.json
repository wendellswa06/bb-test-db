        "There's going to be congressional commissions and study groups to figure out what to do with rating agencies, what to do about the size of the largest six banks in the country, how to handle risk sharing among secured creditors, all sorts of things where Congress doesn't even leave it to the regulators.",
        "It just says we're going to get a bunch of experts together, and they're going to figure it out.",
        "Well, what are you hearing from experts, Adam?",
        "Is this a case of letting regulators regulate, which after all is what they do, or would it be better to have a bill that's much, much more specific and more managerial?",

        "It's going to take years for economists and finance people to figure out what caused this crisis and how to prevent the next one.",
        "So it's great that Congress built the flexibility into the system to respond to new ideas.",
        "The cynical idea, one economist told me that he calls this bill the Permanent Contributions to Congress Bill because we have seen a huge uptick in contributions to congresspeople on the key committees from financial services firms.",
        "If this resolved all the key issues, they wouldn't get any more donations.",
        "Now with so many issues open for so many more years, they're very likely to get really healthy donations from lots and lots of banks and other financial institutions.",

        "So I think he's tried to make sure that despite the fact that he's no longer in uniform, he will have people of his way of thinking in position in the top brass.",
        "So you have three people here jockeying for position: President Musharraf, getting ready for another term, and two former prime ministers - Benazir Bhutto has been in the country for a number of weeks now and Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister who has just arrived in recent days.",
        "Can you give me an idea of what is at stake for Pakistan and in fact what's at stake for the world at large as these three people contest for position and for power?",
        "Well, first and foremost, let me remind you that both Benazir and Nawaz Sharif, who tried to come back once earlier, was deported to Saudi Arabia, it is obvious that both have come under the umbrella of some sort of understanding with the Musharraf regime.",
        "Otherwise, you know, this will not have been possible.",
        "Well, now, let me ask you a question, Mr. Rahman.",
        "You just suggested that you don't see how Nawaz Sharif could get back in the country unless he had some kind of understanding with President Musharraf.",
        "Nawaz Sharif has said he's made no deal with Musharraf, he's not going to make a deal with Musharraf, he's not going to serve as prime minister under Musharraf, he's not going to work with Musharraf.",
        "How could he have made a deal with Musharraf?",
