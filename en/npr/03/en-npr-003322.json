        "How easy would it be for a pilot to think that he is on one runway when in fact he's on another?",
        "Well, with the benefit of hindsight and looking at it on a taxi diagram or a map from up above, it's perfectly obvious what runway is what.",

        "Well, we carry taxi diagrams that show us the layout, and so one person will be following along on a taxi diagram as the other person does the taxiing, and so it's a two person process and, you know, both pilots are trying to follow along with where they are.",
        "They're looking at markings that show fairly clearly what runway is what, and one of the things the investigators will be looking at is were those markings present, were they lit and were they correct?",
        "We know there was some construction going on just prior to the accident, and they'll be looking into whether the construction disrupted the signage and the lighting.",
        "The numbers of the runways, in this case 22 and 26, those stand for something.",
        "What do they stand for?",
        "Sure.",
        "Those are magnetic headings.",
        "Two-two is 220, or southwest.",
        "Two-six is 260, or just about west.",
        "And so those are very meaningful to pilots, and one of the things we do is look at our compass when we line up on a runway and see if it matches approximately with the heading that's - or with the runway number.",
        "And so you could look down at your compass and see 220 if you're on Runway 22.",
        "You should do that as an airmanship item before every takeoff, and pilots often do.",
        "But you know, a funny thing happens when you're sure you're going to the right place.",

        "And so possibly on that day you don't check your compass heading.",
        "In this case, this plane was taking off at 6:00 in the morning.",
        "The sun wasn't up, so it would've been dark outside.",
        "How much does that complicate the task of figuring out where you are?",
        "Everything's harder in the dark.",
        "It's harder to see the taxi diagram that's in front of you, especially if you're like me and you're over 40 and you have to take your glasses off to do that.",
        "It's harder to see the markings and pavement.",
        "And when you get onto the wrong runway instead of the right one, it probably makes the cues about that more subtle.",
        "You've been an NTSB investigator yourself.",
        "What happens now?",
        "What steps does the NTSB take at this point?",
        "Well, they're still in very much of a fact gathering phase here.",
        "This is the first full day of work on the accident.",
        "Some of the most significant activity is happening in Washington, where the cockpit voice recorder is being read out.",
        "When I was in a management position at the NTSB, I was often assigned to be the first person to listen to a cockpit voice recorder when it first came in from the wreckage, and that's pretty powerful information, and very sad information when you listen to it.",
        "And what they'll be listening for today as they try and make a transcript of what was said and done is to see what the pilots' understanding of their position was on their runway that they were going to be taking, whether there was any confusion or discussion or opportunity for discussion and then what their state of mind was as they rolled down the runway."

        "The euro's still there.",

        "Germany came into that leadership role basically by default.",
        "And now in the migration crisis, Germany moved early, saying, we will take in many more migrants than we were expecting and we encourage all others to do the same.",
        "That was a definite change of policy from Berlin, and it put a lot of pressure on the others to do the same thing.",
        "The challenge forced from Germany in Europe is and that has been - that was very visible over the last few weeks, really, on the migration issue.",
        "It's very important to coordinate with the others because if you take them by surprise, that can result, in fact, in a political backlash.",
        "And Germany currently is seen in a very divided way.",
        "Some admire its openness and the solidarity that Germans showed towards the immigrants, but others actually criticize the Germany just, you know, defines European policy out of Berlin and should be much more open to consultation with other member states of the European Union.",
        "When the emergency summit takes place next week - the emergency European summit dealing with the migrant issue - what's at stake for Europe?",
        "The European Union shows that it's able in such a pressing crisis situation to actually reach far-reaching decisions and manage the crisis on the ground.",
        "There's a huge opportunity for it, A, to deepen its policies and institutions in fields where it hasn't been able to reach a compromise and actually integrating in the past and hence to really strengthen the European Union.",
        "But on the other hand, if it doesn't manage to cope with the influx of migrants - and really, thousands are crossing the border every day and night - this will make citizens believe that this is a dysfunctional system, and not only the European Union but also their own governments.",
        "And this can actually lead to further political polarization and a strengthening of the political fringes.",
        "And countries which have strong left or right-wing extremist or populist parties traditionally are not strong players on European questions, so this will eventually weaken the European Union."
