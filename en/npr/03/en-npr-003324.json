        "She says she once stayed with them at this very same beachside hotel.",
        "And Christa wanted me to help her find a little shelf that had the little holes that were already in the tips of the shelves because their daughter Carolyn, who was at the time five years old, loved to make shell necklaces.",

        "Then the biggest lucky break of all: He got one of the very few college scholarships.",
