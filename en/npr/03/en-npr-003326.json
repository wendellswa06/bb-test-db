        "So those were the three different provisions of Proposition 200."

        "I think in Arizona there's a broad realization that folks are coming here illegally to work.",
        "And I think the evidence of that from my perspective is the fact that the majority of voters in Arizona support a guest worker program, and on top of that, they support initiatives directed at employers that would require employers to verify, you know, the identification of folks that are working for them, and they would penalize employers for employing undocumented immigrants.",
        "So I think that there's a broad realization that Arizona is a magnet for undocumented immigrants, or at least the labor market is.",

        "Well, the shorter answer - short answer is that rate cuts should help, but not as much as you would expect under normal circumstances.",
        "And that's because the credit freeze has been about banks being afraid to lend because they're afraid they aren't going to get paid back.",
        "It hasn't been about the level of interest rates.",
        "These rates cuts aren't likely to ease the fears of not paying back, but they will help struggling businesses and consumers, and that's because the federal funds rate dictates the prime rate.",
        "So businesses with existing credit lines and consumers with mortgages or credit card rates tied to the prime rate, they'll get a half a point rate cut too.",

        "And actually, yesterday the Fed instituted a program that should help make that happen much more than today's rate cut.",
        "It began the program that it had announced earlier in the month and started buying commercial paper, basically making short-term loans to large businesses for their daily operations or making payroll, that kind of thing.",

        "And when the Federal Reserve did its latest calculations, they say that the net worth of the average homeowner is $185,000, but the net worth of the average renter is only $4,000.",
        "Wow.",
        "So, a huge amount of net worth in the house, there.",
        "And we should mention that, in recent years, a lot of those Americans have been feeling rather wealthy, haven't they, because home prices have gone up and up and up.",
