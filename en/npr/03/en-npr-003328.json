        "Well, the two men were alone for the better part of an hour.",
        "And the whole point of it was that Eisenhower, the outgoing president, would give the incoming president all of the secrets of the office.",
        "And one of the things he said at that time was Laos - small country in Indochina, Southeast Asia.",
        "Laos, we have to be very careful that the communists don't take over Laos.",
        "Or else, he said, we're going to have to go in and do it, if necessary, on our own.",
        "Kennedy, when he took over, did not want to send American forces into Laos.",
        "But he decided that he would draw the line in Vietnam.",
        "When Kennedy came in, he felt sort of imprisoned by the words of a former president.",
        "When Kennedy was killed and Johnson came in, the first thing he said - one of the first things - I will not be the first president to lose a war.",
        "So for reasons really having nothing to do with the reality of South Vietnam, we were in it, we were committed, that's the big word in American diplomatic lexicon.",
        "When we get committed, we're committed.",
        "And then...",
        "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets South Korean president Moon Jae-in in the DMZ on Friday.",
        "The population in Arizona has exploded over the last 10 to 15 years to where today, about 10 percent of the people that live in the state of Arizona are undocumented immigrants and 97 percent of them are from Mexico.",
        "So I don't think folks in the state are resigned to the idea that there is no solution.",
        "And, in fact, I think Proposition 200 was a message to government--in fact, people told us that they were sending a message to government that if government doesn't do something about it, then the voters are willing to take it into their own hands.",
        "Is it an issue that cuts differently among different ethnic groups in Arizona?",
        "Intuitively, I would think yes, but the numbers in the survey that we did illustrate that Proposition 200 won across every ethnic group, including Hispanics.",
        "So, you know, it appears that people are uniformly frustrated with the issue.",
        "One argument against programs that legalize the presence of people who are here illegally is that they will be perceived south of the border as another instance of Americans huffing and puffing a lot, but in the end, they'll make you legal.",
        "If you keep on getting in and you stay here, eventually you'll become legal.",
        "And that's something you commonly hear from Mexicans."

        "I think it was a third of voters in our sample supported an amnesty program.",
        "And I think some of that is really born from the fact that, you know, we saw this amnesty program not so many years ago in 1986, and you can see the problem with illegal immigration today, so it's going to be hard to convince folks that that's a solution.",

        "So far in the 2020 primary contest, polling has indicated not just which candidates voters prefer, it also shows high levels of interest and engagement on the part of Democratic voters, which is exactly what NPR's Don Gonyea found at a watch party in Milwaukee in the very important electoral state of Wisconsin.",

        "We think that, on average, the additional cost of compliance, which get us to a 30 percent improvement in fuel economy by the year 2016, the cost of that is going to be less than $400 on the price of the vehicle.",
        "And even with low gasoline prices which, frankly, we and every body else think is not going to last all that long, this is going to be paid back in a matter of a couple of years.",
