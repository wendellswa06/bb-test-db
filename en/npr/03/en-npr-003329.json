        "Well, I think the first thing that it signals is that this is a president who intends to make good on the big commitments that he made in the course of his campaign.",
        "He's done a number of things in his first week or two in office to signal that he means to reverse bad decisions from the previous administration and set us on a different course.",
        "This one is from our perspective, of course, a no brainer, but really it is a very significant move.",
        "And I think...",
        "Can I just jump in here, though?",
        "Is it a signal of the direction that he intends to follow, or could it possibly be interpreted as a poke in the eye to Republicans?",
        "Oh, I don't think so.",
        "I think that there were many Republicans, including former administrators of EPA, who agreed with California - not to mention my boss, Governor Schwarzenegger, who's also a Republican in good standing.",
        "The Bush administration's position was opposed by their entire career staff, and I think it's a signal that he intends to honor the technical and scientific advice that he's hearing from all of his staff that this is something that needs to be done.",
        "Even more significant, I think in some ways, is the fact that he's also ordered the Department of Transportation to take another look at their fuel economy standards and to take a more aggressive stance on those, as well.",
        "So, this is not just a one shot deal or a political move in my opinion.",

        "Well, the thinking was that these cases were ready to be filed and that this administration would take a different view and not wish to file them.",
        "So between January 1st and January 19th, 2001, five cases were filed.",
