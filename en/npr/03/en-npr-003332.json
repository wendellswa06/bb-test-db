        "You had no idea that she does this every single day.",
        "Yes, there's a period in the morning when Hanna's upstairs, you know, I assume getting dressed.",

        "But - OK.",
        "No, but it was - no, but I - I'm not - sorry - I'm not really criticizing you, Hanna.",
        "I'm just saying it was a surprise, even after we've been married for 11 years, to discover your morning routine, because I've just never tune into it.",
        "There was no need to pay attention to it.",
        "Right, right.",
        "So, then after you guys - you get dressed and go through all your morning rituals, you then go to David's office at Slate and, Hanna, you discover a little secret of your own about David.",
        "Yes, the minute we get - the first thing David does when he gets to the office is head for the refrigerator and make sure that there's a cold Fresca in the refrigerator.",
        "Now, there are so many levels on which this (Laughing) was surprising to me, like, A, David's like a food snob, you know, he's - you know, food - the natural and the farmer's market.",
        "So, the idea that's not even 10 a.m., and he's having a cold soda is sort of a surprise to me.",
        "So, I'm happy to learn that.",
        "And B, David, like, has a prima donna fit because somebody's forgotten to put the col - and he's like - he's like heat coming off of his body.",

        "Well, there was one moment I thought of shared consciousness, which was that Hanna - when we came into the office at Slate, Hanna got into conversation with a colleague of mine who has children at the same school as our daughter.",

        "Hanna, were you thinking, I need to have this conversation, or were you thinking about David standing there kind of tapping his foot and wanting to get away?",

        "I think that there was a part of me that was doing it a little bit on purpose.",
        "I mean, he could clearly tell that he really wanted to get to his cubicle and do his thing, and so, I was doing it a little bit on purpose, just a little bit.",
        "David, there actually comes a moment - she kind of goes behind a cubicle and you're - there's a wall between you.",
        "You're both working away there, but it's the first moment in the day when she's actually disappeared for some period of time, and suddenly, what?"
