        "Democrat Charles Schumer pushed the nominee aggressively about a letter Alito wrote in 1985 when he applied for a high-ranking job in the Reagan Justice Department.",

        "If the issue were to come before me as a judge, the first question that would have to be addressed is the question of stare decisis.",
        "Stare decisis is the Supreme Court doctrine of respecting past court rulings, but while Alito said there is a general presumption in favor of not disturbing past decisions, it's not an inexorable rule.",
        "Senator Schumer came back at the nominee again."

        "Alito pointed to his record as an appeals court judge, a record in which he has not always upheld restrictions on abortion.",
        "If I had had an agenda to uphold any abortion regulation that came along, I would not have voted as I did in my 3rd Circuit cases.",
        "But Schumer was unappeased, noting that as a lower court judge, Alito had to follow Supreme Court decisions.",
        "For his part, the senator from New York said he had concluded that Alito would likely vote to reverse Roe vs. Wade if he ever gets the chance on the Supreme Court."

        "Also clearly on the minds of some committee members yesterday was the so-called torture memo, the secret memo that authorized severe coercive tactics against detainees for several years.",
        "The memo was repudiated by the Bush administration after it was leaked to the press, but last week, the president, in signing Senator John McCain's anti-torture provision into law, put into the signing statement an assertion that the president can authorize measures outlawed by Congress.",
