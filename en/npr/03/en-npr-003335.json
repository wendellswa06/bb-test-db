        "Yeah.",
        "And people tend not to like it when their government shuts down and they can't do the things they want to do.",

        "I was talking to someone in the governor's press office, they actually had to change their phone number today because a talk radio station out of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - they wanted to do an interview with the governor and when they we're unable to get that interview, gave out the number to the governor's press office on the air.",
        "And apparently, people from the western part of the state were just calling and cursing at them.",
        "They are completely bombarded with phone calls.",
        "So now, they've had to give out another number for the press to use so that the press can actually get through to the press office.",

        "It's just a very thoroughly written report and I think in that way it's Israel at its finest.",

        "But, as I understand it those findings confirmed what the people of Israel already knew or at least felt about the war last year against Hezbollah.",
        "Yes, the public had a, kind of, a gut feeling about some of these players that they weren't up to par, but when people read the report they see there's a very explicitly and painfully so, and that has to hurt very much.",
        "The defense minister who was up to be replaced on May 28th in a Labor Party primary, it could be with, you know, two key players who have military experience.",
        "And the question will be: Will this government stay together.",

        "That he seems to be living on borrowed time and his coalition is in trouble even though the politicians aren't excited about new elections.",

        "Before this report, he looked like a lame duck.",
        "After this report, he looks like a dead duck.",
        "And I think that it's very unlikely that someone who's pulling single digits before the Winograd report can take these monumentous decisions.",
        "If you look at the polls, the Israeli public wants to end this conflict, but it's hard to see under the configuration of this government, as it currently exists, with yet another Winograd report still ahead of us, this is just on first five days of the war."
