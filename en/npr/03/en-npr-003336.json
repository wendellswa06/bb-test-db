        "You know, you've just solicited people to call in about the stories that shape their view of the media.",
        "Invariably, people will call in on any story that they have had a part in because that's when they see the seamy underbelly of inaccuracy that follows so many news stories.",
        "And accuracy seems to be, you argue, one of the things that people care most about.",
        "Well, this is one of the things that people say they care most about, but if you actually track the popularity of the media through good times and bad, what you'll find is that accuracy tends to take second place or third place to basically the gestalt of the story.",
        "In other words, the public wasn't very happy when the media were reporting critically on the run-up to the war, and they were so unhappy that no one then said anything critical about the run-up to the war, at least in the mainstream press.",
        "Are there echoes in the two faiths now in the way the two holidays are celebrated?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There's been a lot of corruption that has swirled around Olmert, which is unrelated to Lebanon, which doesn't figure in this report, but that clearly lends a tone.",
        "But the judiciary in Israel is viewed as fiercely independent and in all polls it scores the highest of all institutions.",
        "So if the commissions of the past - Agranat after '73, Kahn after '82 - after those two wars, I think this will enter that, sort of, pantheon.",

        "At issue is whether the government can withhold federal funds from schools that refuse to assist military recruiters.",
        "The schools want to cut out the recruiters to protest the military's `don't ask, don't tell' policy for dealing with gays.",
        "For Yale University, the stakes are especially high.",
        "The Bush administration has threatened to cut off $350 million in federal aid unless Yale Law School provides full access to the military to recruit its students.",

        "It is probably true that some in academia despise what the military stands for, but it should be acknowledged that the bad feeling runs both ways.",
        "A generation ago, Yale and other elite schools banished ROTC, and many in uniform still cannot forget that.",

        "A cease-fire is long overdue.",

        "Yale certainly doesn't endorse every practice of those organizations, but it understands that by working with them it is much more likely to influence their policies for the better.",

        "The difference here is the complexity of the malware in this case.",
        "It does some of the same things that other malware does, you know, stealing passwords, taking screenshots, that kind of thing.",
        "But the motivation is obviously different, and it comes with just a multitude of functions, much more than something that cybercriminals would use.",
        "Cybercriminals, usually their malware is very compact in the sense that it's doing only the precise thing that they want to do, which is often just stealing your banking credentials or credit card numbers.",
        "So Flame has - so far they've found about 20 modules that can be swapped in and out, and they do everything from turning on the internal microphone and webcam on your computer, this way that they could record conversations that you have over Skype or conversations that you have in the room, in the vicinity of the computer.",
