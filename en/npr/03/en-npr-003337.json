        "We'll start with Eddie(ph), and Eddie's on the line from New London.",
        "Hey, how are you doing?",
        "I just wanted to say that the election in 2000, the coverage of that is really what shaped me.",
        "I mean, you had different agencies calling different election - or the election for different people.",
        "It was just - it's atrocious.",
        "And nowadays it seems like the only place that I really am interested in getting political news from is, like you said earlier, Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart.",
        "So just people who pretty much agree with you.",
        "Well, I wouldn't say pretty much agree with me, but who can say that there's wrong on both sides, and everybody's biased, you know?",
        "All right, but the 2000 election, and Brooke Gladstone, of course we had people calling the Florida count for Al Gore at one point, then pulling that back and then calling it for the other side and then pulling that back.",
        "That's right, and that was basically a problem of trying to jump the gun and of misinterpreting the numbers they got in.",
        "And also there was a problem with various counties being held back.",
        "That was a real learning experience, and they won't be making that mistake ever again.",
        "There were even congressional hearings about it.",
        "So I don't think that the TV - I mean, we saw it in the last election.",
        "Even though everybody knew Obama had won by about 7:00, they waited until the polls closed in order to finally make that decision official on the air, and it was a very, very important moment, and even - and it was so funny to see Wolf Blitzer and everybody else dancing around the obvious.",
        "We're about to make what we think may be an historic announcement.",
        "Nobody will ever jump the gun like that again.",
        "So it's interesting that that's the one that this particular caller really set upon.",
        "I do think also it's interesting that he mentioned Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, because they have, over the years, become increasingly influential, increasingly a source of news and information for people, and also their audiences tend to be among the best informed.",
        "They tend to understand stories extremely well.",
        "And part of the reason is that, first of all, they're becoming somewhat more responsible, even though they claim they're just comedians and they have no responsibility for being responsible.",
        "They understand the impact they're having on the culture."

        "And I can remember back when Clinton was president, Rush Limbaugh came out and supported NAFTA.",
        "And for a whole week all of his callers just called him up and took him to task because nobody that listens to that program wanted to support NAFTA.",
        "By the end of the week, I am sure Rush Limbaugh said we're never going to defend that sort of thing again.",
        "And he really hasn't.",
        "He'll go on the attack no matter what the issue is of the day.",
        "But to defend anything, forget about it.",
        "So that's the one story that shaped your perception of the media?",
        "Yeah, I'm afraid so, that end of the media, that attack talk show end of the media."
