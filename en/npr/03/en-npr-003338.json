        "Yeah, I think that's very interesting.",
        "I think that you'll find that there was a tremendous amount of disaffection between the press and the military during the first - at least 15 years after Vietnam.",
        "And I think that you have - you probably saw it right at its height, when there was so much suspicion about government that the press were not inclined to believe anything they saw.",
        "That's no excuse.",
        "I think that that is probably unusual, though generally, if you look at the history of war reporting, you'll find that the press has generally stood very staunchly with what the American government and its allies tend to say when it comes to American wars.",
        "They do tend to part company more when it comes to wars in which America is not a big participant.",
        "Well, the bias went beyond just what the Americans were doing, obviously.",
        "Any of these journalists could have used the opportunity to learn more about the military or even sort of embedded themselves in a manner that I did.",
        "But obviously the El Salvadorians realized that having been a former soldier myself, I would see what - you know, I would know what was going on with some experience, where these guys, they're all coming out of college and with great ideas in their head of being Woodward or whoever else and being there on the day the guerrillas triumph, of course.",
        "And many of them, many of them, were extremely near left-wing.",
        "I mean, they were obvious about it.",
        "I didn't even like to stay at the hotel that the press had set up.",
        "They had a nasty pool.",
        "And I stayed where the military was, you know, where I could find out information.",
        "And nobody seemed to do that.",
        "There were, if anything, distancing themselves from that entirely without any comprehension of what they were doing to the actual final story.",
        "Well, war reporters tend to like to be in the field though.",
        "That's why they are war reporters.",
        "Again, if you look through the history of war reporting, these are people, regardless of their politics, who are not hesitant to get their boots dirty and to be where the action is.",
        "You know, I can't comment, I certainly won't argue with the experience that you had there.",
        "I have no doubt that there were plenty of people like that there.",
        "But I don't know whether you can generalize to all war reporting from that particular experience, though clearly it shaped your perception.",
        "Obviously not, obviously you can't generalize on that basis.",
        "And I think what we're seeing now is a little more in line with reality.",
        "But during that period of time, it was just unbelievably biased.",
        "You know, they were (unintelligible)...",
        "Dewan...",
        "And as a result, we end up with a situation like in Guatemala.",
        "When the Carter administration cut Guatemala loose, they just became more brutal.",
        "And to, you know, get the situation in line.",
        "And El Salvador constantly reminded the U.S.",
        "of that: If you cut us loose, we're just going to have to fall back to the Guatemala model."

        "My perception of the media reporting was changed during the Howard Dean scream, because I had had a background in broadcasting, and it was immediately apparent how manipulated that was.",
        "And the fact that it was played over and over and over on every medium.",
        "It didn't matter what their political - and it single-handedly, I believe, sunk that candidacy.",

        "But a moment like that can - well, Brooke, you talk about the ability to define a candidate, and that's one of the things the media does.",
        "Yes, I mean, it's all part of creating a narrative.",
        "And I guess they wanted to create a narrative of Dean as slightly unhinged.",
        "I mean, that scream was rather decontextualized.",
        "It was a bit of a rebel yell in the middle of a rally.",
        "It was too hot for television, which of course we all know is supposedly a very cool medium.",
        "And - but I have to say, I'd love to say it at this point, that most of the time, when I'm out in public, and people are complaining about the media, they're almost always complaining about cable news.",
        "And that's not the only place where you have to get your media these days.",
        "I mean, it's wonderful fodder for Colbert and Stewart, for sure.",
        "It's just the very worst, the silliest stuff that you can see because it's on wall to wall to wall.",
        "And God knows, they certainly did use that scream a lot, just like every three minutes on Fox they showed the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square, and even seven minutes on CNN."

        "I don't remember, at least I don't remember on NPR it being aired over and over and over again.",
