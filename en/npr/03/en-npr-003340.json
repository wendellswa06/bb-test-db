        "And if this was done in coordination with the Trump campaign - and I think in the case of Stormy Daniels, it almost certainly was - then this would've been an illegal in kind campaign contribution.",
        "Oh.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You can't enforce a contract for an illegal purpose.",
        "That's against public policy.",
        "And the courts will just throw an agreement like that out.",
        "So an NDA used to keep something quiet during a campaign might be illegal because it's a type of campaign contribution.",
        "Depending on the circumstances and how exactly that occurred, that's exactly correct.",
        "That's so interesting.",
        "Well, there's another question here, which is - I mean, Stormy Daniels' argument is that Donald Trump himself did not sign this agreement.",
        "Is that an argument that might hold up for her?",
        "Because she's going on - we think she's going to be on - in an interview on \"\"60 Minutes\"\" this weekend.",
        "So, I mean, you know, this could be a moment where her legal reality could really be seen.",
        "Well, yeah, that's quite true.",
        "And certainly, I mean, in terms of contract law, it is a little suspicious when you've got a contract, and one of the parties appears not to have signed it.",
        "But Stormy Daniels actually raised an interesting point.",
        "Once the sort of cat is out of the bag, the cat is out of the bag.",
        "And trying to enforce a nondisclosure agreement after people have filed lawsuits about it and everybody can hold the complaint in their hand and read exactly what happened, it's a little bit - it's - the horse is long gone, and you're trying to slam the barn door.",
        "So I - the longer these - the longer the White House tries to pursue these nondisclosure agreements, just - they sort of keep the story going.",
        "So in that sense, the nondisclosure agreement has completely failed.",
        "And just lastly, what about these nondisclosure agreements that The Washington Post is reporting the president asked people who work for him to sign?",
        "Because a lot is at stake here.",
        "There are people who have been talking to the special counsel, for example, who might want to share their story at some point.",
        "Do those hold up to legal scrutiny?",
        "Well, no nondisclosure agreement can prevent you from talking to the police.",
        "That's just course (inaudible), though.",
        "That violates public policy.",
        "These two agreements are probably unenforceable for at least two reasons.",
        "If you work for the White House, you work for the federal government, not the president personally.",
        "And therefore, you're bound by the First Amendment.",
        "I see.",
        "So if a president is asking his employees to sign an NDA, I mean, those are things that if it became a legal fight at some point, if people wanted to share information about the president or about their jobs, might not hold up in court.",
        "This is..."
