        "He's desperately trying to save himself one last time.",
        "But the theme of the play is universal.",
        "And I think it says: Why do we put up so many roadblocks to real love, real intimacy, real caring?",
        "Why do we search out things that only give us temporary satisfaction and rewards when something quite pure and beautiful might be standing there wanting our love and we go to something else?",
        "You know, we go to a cigarette or a drink or rampant sex or making lots of money or possessions.",

        "I think that's a good sign.",
