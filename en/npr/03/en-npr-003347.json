        "It was so cold that the annual parade was canceled.",
        "Camels apparently can't take below zero temperatures, and the grass is covered in snow.",
        "There's no grass to cut.",
        "It's cold, and the kids are not used to the cold on Three Kings Day.",
        "But inside a city recreation center, a 20-year tradition of giving out donated gifts to local children continued.",
        "Dozens of families lined up to receive unwrapped presents stored in black trash bags so they'd stay a surprise for the kids.",
        "Joel Cruz helped organize the event.",
        "He says more people than usual registered to receive gifts.",
        "And he thinks that's because of the new families who moved here post-Maria.",
        "You know, they come to the U.S.",
        "And we don't mind celebrating having Santa Claus.",
        "But we don't want to lose the tradition that we have of having the three kings because, really, this - January 6 is a day that we truly celebrate as a day to give.",
        "Later in the day, there was a smaller gathering at a hurricane relief center across town - this one specifically for families who relocated after the storm.",
        "Cruz Cruz was there with his fiance whose grandchildren moved here with their mom from the island after the hurricane.",
        "This is their first time they were in the United States.",
        "And they didn't know anything about the snow.",
        "And they, you know, they have some concern about how the three kings are going to get here.",
        "And, you know, we have to explain, but they're having a good time.",
        "Cruz says they celebrated the holiday with the kids to make them feel like they were back in a familiar place.",
        "And they had to do a bit of improvising.",
        "Remember the grass they weren't able to cut and put under the beds?",
        "No problem.",

        "Sound complicated?",
        "Well, that's the point.",
        "We live in such an interconnected world, my next guest says, that we have a hard time foreseeing how a catastrophe in one place could trigger a sort of domino effect.",
        "Or take an example from the headlines this week: The cost of corn is skyrocketing again, up about 50 percent in the last six weeks, thanks to the worst drought in decades."

        "Is there a way to make ourselves more resilient to these kinds of catastrophes?",
        "That's the question my next guest asks in his new book, \"\"Resilience.\"\" Andrew Zolli says that by studying why some communities, businesses and people break down and others bounce back, we can learn how to survive the unforeseeable disturbances, big and small, that life brings.",
        "Andrew Zolli is executive director and curator of PopTech, which he describes as a global innovation network.",

        "It seems like good resilience test case.",
        "And not to put you on the spot, but, you know, what do we do?",
        "How do we become more resilient in the face of this current catastrophe?",
        "Yeah, it's a great question.",
        "With the largest declaration of a national emergency across a thousand counties in the U.S., what we're seeing is lots more of disruptive weather events and disruptions of all different kinds.",
        "And because we are - these systems are all connected to each other - the economic system is connected to the agricultural system, which is connected to the ecological system, which is connected back to the social system.",
        "In an environment like that, it's incredibly difficult to forecast.",
        "But the good news is there are lots of places to introduce modularity and fail-safes and various kinds of structures so that a disruption in one place doesn't cascade through a system and create all of those unforeseeable knock-on effects.",
        "Andrew, let's take this case.",
        "What do you mean by that, modularity and fail-safes?",
        "Give me a specific example.",
        "Not to put you on a...",
        "Well, you know, I think there's a couple of different things.",
        "You have to think about something like the agricultural system as a system, at a very large scale.",
        "We tend, over time, to make systems much more efficient and more efficient and more efficient and more efficient as we tie them to things like the global financial markets.",
        "The margin of error - as we get more and more efficient - narrows.",
        "And so if we introduce fail-safes into a system, what we're talking about are introducing firebreaks, introducing smaller-scale systems, more regional and local systems so that - that are backups, creating redundancy in systems, creating systems that are more, in the agricultural sense, more drought-tolerant.",
        "Forms of corn, for instance, is a way to do that.",
        "If you think about the connections between the Mexican tortilla riots and Katrina, or between the drought that's happened in the U.S.",
        "and what will inevitably be the increased size of an Egg McMuffin next year in a McDonald's, there are actually thousands of places to intervene, including more local agriculture, more smaller-scale agriculture - not to replace the big dominant, vertically oriented stuff, but to compliment it."

        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "You know, one of the stories that we tell in this book is actually about the global financial crisis.",
        "And we particularly tell the story of a group of systems ecologists from Scripps University - Scripps Oceanographic Institute and others, other places - who went and at the behest of the Federal Reserve, before the financial crisis, did a study using systems ecological principles, an analysis of the flow of payments between banks in the federal system.",
        "They studied something called the Fedwire system, which is how banks back each other up on a nightly basis.",
        "And what they discovered was a massive, dense overconcentration in the center of the financial system.",
        "There were 25 banks in particular that were completely connected to one another in a mass that was so over-connected, that there was no such idea of a firebreak.",
        "There was nothing separating one institution - they were like skiers all connected on a rope line, so that if one of them went over, they were going to pull everybody over.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Now, they wrote this paper for Nature - George Sugihara and a number of others wrote this paper called \"\"Ecology for Bankers,\"\" and began to look at how we apply ecological principles to understanding complex systems like the financial system.",
        "Now, at the same time that this is going on, on the other side of the world, a group of pioneering ecosystem scientists studying the coral reefs - and the Great Barrier Reef, in particular - discovered something really amazing.",
        "They discovered a species of fish - which is called the pinnate batfish - which, under normal circumstances, is a kind of a boring fish.",
        "It doesn't do very much.",
        "And, you know, this is not the subject of an international symposium.",
        "This is just one animal among many in this very complex system.",
        "And in normal, healthy reef systems, there's a parrotfish which normally eats algae, and it sort of mows the lawn.",
        "They're called, like, the cows of the reef.",
        "They basically keep the system in check.",
        "And as this group of - this researcher's name is Bellwood.",
        "And as David Bellwood and his colleagues discovered, when the system gets close - when the coral reef gets close to a threshold, when it gets close to a moment when it's going to shift from a coral-dominated state to an algae-dominated state, the pinna batfish changes its behavior.",
        "And the ecologists didn't see this for ages, because they normally study healthy reefs.",
        "Are able to not only change their world view and increase their hopefulness and their sense of optimism about their ability to make change, connecting to those belief systems, but also to actually reduce inflammation in the body.",
        "There's a particular protein that's a good indicator of overall cellular inflammation, which is connected with type 2 diabetes and to all kinds of other illnesses later in life, including cancer and all kinds of things."

        "What wow.",
        "They never actually saw this behavior until just a few years ago.",
        "And as soon as the system begins to flip into transition, the fish changes its behavior and begins to cut down a particular form of over-dominate algae to tip the system back into health.",
        "And now there are global financial regulators in the United Kingdom and here in the United States who are beginning to look for the financial equivalents of the batfish to embed within the financial system so that when the financial system, like the coral reef, begins to tip into disaster, that these species of regulations and species of organizations will be released to tip the system back into health.",
        "They're sort of embedded counter-mechanisms.",
        "Like an indicator, and also a self-regulation measure.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "When you can begin to take a very complex system like a coral reef or a financial system or a complex social system or even something like the Internet and strip it away from its particulars and look at how it works as a network system, you can begin to analyze whether strategies from one domain might have application in another.",

        "Your physical health, the quality of your social network and your access to social resources, the quality of your intimate relationships matter enormously.",
        "Your genes and in particular there's good indication that genetic factors interacting with environmental factors are correlated with personal resilience at scale.",
        "And it's important to note that personal psychological resilience is actually much more widespread than our kind of doom and gloom pop literature might suggest.",
        "Right here in New York, there's a wonderful researcher named George Bonanno at Columbia who studied how whole populations of people who had the same traumatic event responded.",
        "And, you know, this is everyone from older folks who'd lost a spouse to folks who were in the towers on 9/11.",
        "And what he discovered was that invariably somewhere between one-third and two-thirds of the whole population of people who had the experience were not disrupted.",
        "They weren't permanently impaired.",
        "But for those people who do have a vulnerability, who can fall apart in the face of real trauma, understandably so, the good news is that there are things that we can change about ourselves."

        "If you believe that the world is a meaningful place, if you believe if your actions have agency - that you have agency and that your actions have consequences and that successes and failures are placed in your life to teach you something, then you have a greater likelihood of being resilient in the face of potentially traumatic events.",
        "Now, what's intriguing about this is that these are the kinds of beliefs that you have to hold to hold a religious or a spiritual personal cosmological world view.",
        "And one of the things that hardiness researchers and social scientists have found is that people on average who have this spiritual world view, have a greater preponderance of psychological resilience.",
