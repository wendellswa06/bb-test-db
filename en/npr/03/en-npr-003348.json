        "They confer advantage to us in moments of crisis.",

        "And I'm Flora Lichtman.",
        "We're talking with Andrew Zolli about his new book, \"\"Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back.\"\" And when we left, we talked about that there were two ways to sort of increase your resilience, or two things that were correlated with personal resilience.",
        "What's the second thing?",
        "So the first is belief.",
        "The second is habits of mind.",
        "And here there's some really extraordinary and intriguing new lines of research.",
        "A group of pioneering neuroscientists have been studying the brains of actively meditating Buddhist monks and looking at the effects, both on neuroplasicity and again in among non-monk populations, among ordinary civilians like you and me, looking at the psychological resilience and the effects that are conferred by mindfulness meditation and mindfulness practices.",
        "And here, what we see is an extraordinary set of outcomes.",
        "Teaching people to better regulate their emotions during high stress encounters, during periods of peak stress, giving them the tools when they're not in peak stress environments to handle stressful situations helps them dramatically reduce the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "That's why some of these tools are now being used by the military, by hospitals and emergency room physicians, by fire fighters.",
        "In fact, just a couple of days ago, a group of researchers at Emory University found that cognitive-based compassion training, training foster children, adolescent foster children, who come automatically out of very difficult circumstances and who, by the way, the Journal of Pediatrics recently found are massively overmedicated.",
        "They're getting huge amounts of drugs to help them deal with the stressful environment.",
        "And so there isn't just a psychological benefit to dealing with stress, but there's a deep physiological connection.",
        "And these are tools that are free.",
        "They literally can't be purchased.",
        "And for all of the people - think about the, literally, millions of people who are in places like IDP camps and who are dealing with post conflict situations.",
        "They don't have access to the mental health system.",
        "These are tools that could be deployed at scale to transform the way we think about disaster recovery and resilience in communities.",
        "Hmm.",
        "What about a genetic component to resilience?",
        "You'd think this would be the type of thing you might select, that might be selected for in natural selection.",
        "Have people looked at selection in other organisms (unintelligible)?",
        "Well, they have and, you know, here I just want to put a big boundaries around what we're going to say here.",
        "Whenever we're talking about genes, you have to, first of all, be sure to say we're talking about correlation, not causation.",
        "And we're talking about something that's - so there is no such thing as a resilience gene.",

        "Moreover, we're talking about interactions between your genes and the environment.",
        "So interestingly over the course of the last decade, there's been a lot of work on a particular gene called the 5-HTT gene, which has been shown to be correlated with all kinds of psychological responses to potential trauma at scale.",
        "In particular, there was a breakthrough paper a few years ago by two researchers named Moffitt and Caspi who looked at a population scale responses to potentially traumatic events where - in New Zealand, they got access to almost a thousand people's genetic material and could correlate it with how they - whether they experienced a difficult loss in their lives.",
        "And what they found is that this particular gene has two alleles; it has two versions.",
        "And that people who had one version of this particular gene who experienced a traumatic event were much more likely to experience long term depressive and stress reactive post-traumatic kinds of experiences.",
        "Now, the subsequent studies and meta studies have shown that the actual affect may be smaller than originally studied.",
        "But the important thing to say about it is that there does seem to be some good indication that there are some genetic correlates only when people with the right gene base have the right kind of life experiences.",
        "So they're really connected.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Can you learn something about how systems, like the economic system or big systems, can be more resilient from studying individuals and how they're resilient?",
        "Yeah.",
        "In particular, you see this at - one of the things that cuts across so we see, first of all, folks - there's a group of people who study resilience in systems, like complex adaptive systems like environments and economies and ecologies.",
        "There's another group of people who study resilience in people and communities and teams and organizations.",
        "And then, there's a few things that cut across those domains.",
        "One of them is the power of diversity.",
        "You know, systems abhor monocultures.",
        "When we become overly reliant on a single mode of value creation or we become, you know, just ask the Irish after the Potato Famine, right?",
        "When we don't allow for healthy failures in systems, just think about the wildfires that have ravaged Colorado and California and other parts out West.",
        "Those are largely byproducts of our not allowing natural cyclical processes of failure to occur.",
        "Now, interestingly on the human side, the same kind of monoculture can occur.",
        "Cognitive lock-in can occur.",
        "And we see organizations like the U.S.",
        "military and even scientific research teams studying the impact of what's called cognitive diversity in teams; that if you get the right moderately diverse people who think - we're not talking about thinking different things about the world, but thinking in different ways about the world - to think about the same problem.",
        "In particular, there's a researcher named Kevin Dunbar who's a kind of sociologist of scientists.",
        "He's like a Diane Fosse.",
        "He goes into the labs and he kind of sits quietly recording field notes.",
        "And one of the things that is true about science is that when scientists do research, they're constantly encountering ambiguity.",
        "You know, I did this experiment and something weird happened.",
        "And I don't know if it's me, the equipment or a genuinely new thing.",
        "Am I getting a Nobel Prize or am I getting laughed out of the academy?",
        "They bring those results back to their lab mates and when everybody in the lab is, let's say, an e coli researcher, what they discovered is that all of the metaphors and analogies that are used to interpret the ambiguity are e coli metaphors.",
        "When you have people who are physicists and doctors and chemists on the same team, the analogical reasoning field is expanded and those teams tend to make progress much faster."

        "Yeah, that was interesting, that these interdisciplinary labs to better.",
        "And, you know, I think we've seen more and more interdisciplinary work going on, at least on Science Friday, so that's hopeful.",
        "For the monoculture question, you know, this idea has been proposed in the past, that there's a danger to this.",

        "Sure.",
        "I think a big part of it is about incentives.",
        "And, you know, in the run-up to the global financial crisis, for instance, one of the things that the securitization mechanism by which big banks made money - they turned - pooled groups of mortgage assets into virtual complex derivatives that they could then sell to each other.",
        "It was so intoxicating that banks and hedge funds and insurance companies and little brokerages all got into the same business.",
        "The appeal - it was like the crack cocaine of the financial system and nobody could say no. It was just too rewarding.",
        "This is why people famously said, you know, I know that eventually the music is going to stop, but as long as it's playing, I have to keep playing musical chairs.",
        "And so what we begin to see is, if you can get rid of the incentives for monocultures, then, you know, in the run-up to the crisis, at the very tail end of the crisis, all of those very different kinds of institutions, which should have very different kinds of returns and very different kinds of experiences, they're all growing at exactly the same rate.",
        "They were all locked in.",
        "And so diversity is expensive.",
        "That's the really important thing.",
        "Diversity means that we're going to have winners and losers and people in the middle.",
        "We're not all going to go up together and we're not all going to go down together.",
