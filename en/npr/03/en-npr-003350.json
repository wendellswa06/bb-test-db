        "And I think that when we talk about representation and showing a family that hasn't been seen before, representation isn't three lines in a scene.",
        "Representation is actually when the character doesn't have lines, but the camera is lingering on them in their thoughts after something happened.",

        "That's right.",
        "They don't always overlap for reasons that have to do with oddities in astronomical calculations than anything else because they actually share a common history.",
        "And I think that it is special when they overlap because Christians are certainly able to see more readily how the roots of their Easter celebrations are intimately connected with the celebration of Passover.",
        "And perhaps Jews also see the sense of affinity that they have with their Christian neighbors and perhaps find other ways in which their own celebrations are illuminated.",
        "You know, one of the things that is said every year at the Seder that I go to is that the last supper was a seder.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "We can't be sure that it was a seder quite like those that are more familiar from recent times because, in fact, strange as it may seem, the stories of the Last Supper are among the oldest evidence we have for anybody celebrating a seder.",
        "And yet they don't include some of those lovely details that are familiar to so many - the series of cups of wine or all the special foods or the questions that are asked.",
        "But it's absolutely true that the bulk of the earliest Christian material identifies the Last Supper as a meal celebrated at Passover by Jesus with His disciples, even though they're a bit short on the ritual detail."
