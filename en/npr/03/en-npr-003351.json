        "I think so.",
        "There are some similarities still, and there are some ironic differences.",
        "I mean, there are many parts of the world where Christians will traditionally eat lamb, for instance, at Easter.",
        "And they might think of that as something to do with Jesus as the Lamb of God, but, of course, that's also an echo of Passover, in particular, even though, ironically, lamb is not so likely to feature at a Seder table because of the fact that the sacrifice of the Passover lambs ended when the Jewish temple was destroyed in the first century.",
        "So the symbolism of the lamb, however, is still common in both holidays, and that is a real genuine connection.",
        "A Jewish friend once commented to me it was ironic that as their households are getting rid of leaven, off of hametz in the form of, you know, various flours and so forth that Christians are baking up a storm...",
        "(Laughter).",
        "...And make hot cross buns every Easter, for instance.",
        "And that's a pretty yeasty, you know, leaven-y (ph) kind of exercise.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "But still, I would beg still to point to the affinity between wanting to bake and the significance of bread and grain and its significance as something that supports life as a kind of basic food.",
        "And, of course, Christians use unleavened bread - some Christians, at least, in the Western Christian tradition tend to use unleavened bread for every Eucharistic celebration.",
        "And that in itself is understood to be an echo of that last supper.",
        "So Christians are sort of using a form of matzah throughout the year and celebrating a little Passover every Sunday, in one sense.",
        "What about the journey from slavery to freedom which is part of the Passover celebration?",
        "The way that Christians celebrate the journey from death to life which is part of the resurrection of Christ - I mean, are those all parallels that we should pay attention to?",
        "Well, the Easter Vigil itself is really a kind of mini Passover for Christians, I think.",
        "Much of its symbolism is specifically about mapping Jesus' narrative - the story of Jesus' connection and his movement from death to life - as a kind of image that parallels that of the Exodus experience so that Jesus becomes Israel itself and his passage from death to life is like the passage through the Red Sea.",
        "And so Christians themselves, especially in the first thousand years of Christian history, saw the whole of the Jesus experience very much as a new kind of Passover, a new kind of deliverance from slavery to freedom and the creation of a people who had a special relationship with God.",
        "But, of course, they allegorized the Exodus story and made it part of their own story.",
        "And the Easter Vigil still retains that basic language and symbolism of a journey from slavery to freedom, a journey from oppression to liberation.",
        "That's Andrew McGowan.",
        "He's dean of Yale's Berkeley Divinity School.",
        "Thank you very much for talking to us."

        "But it's a remarkable moment.",

        "Let's talk about that photograph, Ambra, with you because for people who are not aware, this is just circulating today, and it is a photograph taken in 2006 in Barack's home - in Kenya, and it shows Barack in Somali elder garb.",

        "What is your take, Ambra, on this photograph?",
        "Well, you know, I think the thing that's really interesting about this particular picture, and in general about this election, is the amount of distance that Obama has attempted to keep between himself and his Islamic heritage.",
        "And I think given, you know, the state of our country right now, I feel like one of the - you know, I think what this image evokes in people as far as the emotion is concerned, and I think it brings sort of to light, that attachment that he does have, you know, a heritage that he has tried to pretty much avoid during this election.",

        "Now, the Clinton campaign and their new manager, Maggie Williams, issued a statement in response to the criticism from the Obama camp about the photograph, and without reading the entire statement, it basically says, enough - that's a quote, actually - and it talks about the fact that this is - that if Barack Obama's campaign wants to suggest that a photo of him wearing a traditional Somali clothing is divisive, they should be ashamed.",

        "It is not correct to call this a costume.",

        "I think the people - the people who support Barack Obama, I think, are willing to overlook this kind of thing as a vicious attack, and he needs to be particularly careful with how he fields this attack.",
        "I think that there are a fair number of people who do believe the inaccurate reports that he has, you know, this very strong Islamic background, and you know, it's very, it's poli-tricks as usual.",
        "It's very interesting that they are releasing this photo at this time, especially in a state like Texas.",
        "It will be real interesting to see how it goes down.",
