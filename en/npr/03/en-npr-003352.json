        "I always love it when Nader gets in the race.",
        "It kind of makes things a little bit more interesting.",
        "But I mean I think the biggest implications that, you know, that we are looking at here is for the Democratic Party, because generally that's where he tends to shake things up a bit.",
        "So I'm kind of interested to see, you know, where the Clinton and the Obama people fall on the Nader issue.",
        "You know, he was considered to be a spoiler in the race in 2000.",
        "Do you think, Robert, that he can play that role again this time around?",
        "Yes, I think that he can play the spoiler, and you know, Barack is in a Catch-22 here because he was asked what do you think about Nader getting in earlier this weekend, and basically the camp said that, you know what, we are not concerned about him because of course, duh, they have a race in front of them they have to win first before they even get to that race.",
        "In short, I would say about Ralph Nader is most of the - 50 percent of the people that are in the Green Party are black, and this is a very big blow to Cynthia McKinney, who would have locked up this nomination.",
        "If he intends to run as a Green Party person, more likely than not he's going to win this nomination now, and I'm sure that infuriates a lot of people.",

        "I mean, I agree with Ambra.",
        "It's very - I love when Ralph Nader gets involved.",

        "I think people kind of are so afraid of that right now.",
        "But the topics that he brings to the table and the kind of debate that he brings to politics, I think it's important.",
        "I'm very, very interested to see how Clinton and Obama address him when the opportunity comes.",
        "One of his arguments, Ambra, was that he speaks for the independents who are not being spoken to, in his view, either by the two Democratic challengers or by the Republican candidate, and that he feels that legitimizes - he being Nader - his attempt to get into the race to have those issues brought to the fore.",
        "Legitimate or not legitimate?",
        "Probably.",
        "In my opinion I would say not legitimate.",
        "I mean I'm an independent and I don't feel like Nader speaks for me.",
        "Nonetheless, I think he does speak for a large, you know, a certain percentage of Americans who are disgruntled in a lot of ways and don't, you know, aren't happy with either party.",
        "So I don't know.",
        "For me, I don't think he speaks for me, but I do think he is a valid, you know, player in this race.",

        "Barack's wife, Michelle Obama, made headlines with a statement about patriotism recently, and it's been back and forth and back and forth, and just recently to that, we had Bill O'Reilly talking about her.",
        "Now, Bill O'Reilly of Fox News is not someone that is traditionally identified with supporting black causes necessarily, but in this case he came to the defense, or it could be construed that he came to the defense, of Michelle Obama, who made the comment about feeling really proud to be an American for the first time as an adult.",

        "I don't.",
        "I don't think he meant it in the conventional sense.",
        "I think that it is a slip of the tongue because what's interesting about - before that, right before that, right before that part where he said what he said, was people have been seizing on all of these crazy things that people have been saying and kind of taking them out of context, and I don't think that's fair to them.",
        "And then he's turned around, and he's taken out of context on his lynch remark.",

        "I don't think we're overly sensitive.",
        "I think it's a pretty racially charged word, and I think people who use it are either (a) you know, not being wise, or they're very calculated.",
        "In O'Reilly's case, I think he's very calculated.",
        "He's a - in some sense of the word, he's a shock jock.",

        "I completely agree.",
        "You know, even if you do want to give him the benefit of the doubt that he was defending Michelle Obama, you would think he would've learned from the recent Golf Channel incident with Tiger Woods, and you know, I mean, I can't imagine somebody who paints himself as the pulse, of being on the pulse of the news cycle, is completely unaware of the weight of that particular word.",
        "I think at best, he was courting controversy, and at worst, he was revealing an aspect of his character that might be sadly unsurprising.",
        "I don't know.",
        "Well, he certainly said that he wanted to get to the bottom of it, and I suppose the proof would be in the pudding if in fact they do get to the bottom of that.",
        "It all began with a woman who called in and said that she knew what was in Michelle Obama's heart and called her a militant, etcetera, etcetera, and that prompted O'Reilly to respond in the fashion that he did.",
        "All right, we'll wait and see what happens with that.",
        "We're going to move on to Hollywood because although the Oscars are over, Hollywood is now involved with a new film, a biopic about none other than Etta James, and this is a person, in case there's anyone out there who is not familiar with the great Etta James, this is her.",
