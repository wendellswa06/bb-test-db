        "Well, there's a couple of reasons.",
        "One is if scientists can create cows, pigs and sheep that are partially human, that have partially human brains or other body parts, they could use them for medical research and maybe learn a lot about new ways to treat diseases like Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's or diabetes.",

        "Well, that sounds mostly positive.",
        "Are people concerned about this one, too?",
        "Well, yes, they are because the concern here is that if you do it for medical research, what's to stop other scientists to try to do it for other reasons, like, for example, to try to create designer babies that are taller or smarter or better athletes?",
        "Now, we're nowhere near being able to do anything like that.",
        "But the concern is that this could open the door to someday creating genetic haves and have-nots.",

        "And the idea there is to try to wipe out this disease that kills hundreds of thousands of people every year, most of them children.",
        "Now, the fear here is that they're using CRISPR to modify these insects with something known as a gene drive.",
        "And a gene drive spreads a genetic modification through an entire species really quickly.",
        "So something could go wrong.",
        "You know, it could wipe out an entire species of mosquito.",
        "And that could upset the delicate balance of an ecosystem some way that could maybe unleash some new epidemic or cause the ecosystem to collapse and cause famine.",
        "So how close are we to these technologies actually doing something that would touch our lives?",
        "So the application that probably is the closest is scientists are using CRISPR to try to genetically modify human immune system cells to attack certain cancer cells.",
