        "Okay.",
        "There's Senator Obama campaigning this week.",
        "And John, you write in your piece about this that's up on Slate, after this appearance a journalist colleague of yours turns to you and says, why isn't he killing her, meaning, not literally killing, but why isn't he doing much better than Senator Clinton?",
        "That's right.",
        "This colleague of mine, we'd been at some Clinton events the previous two days, and it was nothing like the kind of energy you got at the Obama event.",
        "Now, I've seen the act before.",
        "So it wasn't a surprise.",
        "It was just the energy at the end when he leaves, the entire room is on its feet and chanting with him.",
        "What is Senator Clinton like when she campaigns?",
        "She must be doing something right.",
        "She is.",
        "She's very, very methodical.",
        "She is - speaks with no notes.",
        "There aren't a lot of jokes, but it is a thoroughly competent performance.",
        "And as I say, you talk to the audience afterwards - I interviewed quite a lot of people in Iowa over the last three days - and they are a kind of moderately excited about her, and the Obama crowds are quite excited.",
        "But then this question - so why isn't he doing much better than she is?",
        "I don't think you really answer that in your piece.",
        "You do raise the question.",
        "Well, the answer may be in this one question that an Obama supporter who is warming up the crowd in Cedar Rapids asked before he arrived, and she said how many of you have never attended a caucus before?",
        "And it felt like about half the room raised their hands.",
        "And this is the challenge for Obama."
