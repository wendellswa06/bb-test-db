        "He spoke much more generally about a proposal Tehran had brought to the table today.",
        "That package involves a much broader discussion of issues involving the whole Middle East: Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, and Solano told reports okay, we can all talk about that later but only after Iran agrees to freeze uranium enrichment.",

        "Williams Burns was the lead American diplomat here, but he wasn't actively negotiating with the Iranians.",
        "What role did he play?",
        "Well, we don't know because he kept a very low profile with the media, but Solano said his presence was very important because it showed unity of the six negotiating, the world powers, and certainly that showed that it'll be harder for Tehran to play the Europeans against the United States or count on its closer relations with China and Russia, and in fact today after the meeting, the head of the Chinese delegation told reporters that a solution must be found sooner rather than later and that he wants to see a positive response from our Iranian colleague, words that sound like China now could also be on board for further sanctions if Iran does not deliver.",
        "Was there reaction from Iranians?",
        "Well, you know, there were sort of mixed signals.",
        "Before the talks began, one member of the delegation said Tehran will never suspend its nuclear program, but the negotiator, Jalili, was much more evasive.",
        "He compared the negotiating process to the slow and precise work of weaving a Persian carpet.",
        "So the dilemma involving Iran is, as always, who will have the upper hand, the hard-liners or the moderates, and whether they're just playing for time.",

        "If you're among the many millions of people who take drugs to lower cholesterol, you may well be confused by the results of a study of the drugs Zetia and Vytorin.",
        "The manufacturers of those drugs have just released data showing that while they do significantly lower the level of bad cholesterol, or LDL, they do not prevent the buildup of plaque in the arteries.",
        "In fact, the drugs might increase that buildup.",
        "So what's a patient to do?",
        "Well, we've asked Dr. Stuart Seides to help sort through this.",
        "He's associate director of cardiology at the Washington Hospital Center.",
        "Dr.",
        "Seides, are you getting a lot of calls from your patients today?",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "The way the press has picked up this information has created a lot of angst on the part of our patients who are taking either these drugs.",
        "And we've gotten a lot of calls today.",
        "What are you telling your patients who call in?",
        "Well, we're telling our patients, at least for the time being, to continue on the drugs that have been prescribed for them and that there is no reason for them to discontinue either Vytorin or Zetia.",
        "Now, why use that?",
        "These new findings say that, yeah, the drugs do lower cholesterol but its benefit of reducing plaque in the arteries is not holding up.",
        "So why wouldn't you take something that might do both?",
        "Well, I think it's important to remember that what we really care about when we use these drugs or any drugs that influence cholesterol or other risk factors is whether we are preventing heart attacks or strokes.",
        "What was looked at here was the thickness of the interior part of the carotid artery, which is a big artery in the neck.",
        "The study attempted to show that the use of Vytorin or Zetia as opposed to a statin drug, like Zocor, alone reduced the thickening of the arterial wall over a period of two years.",
        "That was not shown.",
        "And so it is an interesting finding and suggests that simply by lowering cholesterol, you may not reduce the thickening of the walls on the carotid arteries, but it doesn't answer the issue of whether reducing the cholesterol further with Vytorin or Zetia compared to a statin alone will reduce events."

        "We wanted to get a sense of what these contradicting statements might mean for President Trump's legal strategy, so we called Josh Gerstein.",

        "Great to talk to you.",
        "So first, for those who haven't been following this story closely, could you just bring us up to speed?",
        "How exactly did Rudy Giuliani's comments contradict what we had previously been told by President Trump and others on his legal team?",
        "Well, President Trump had said previously in an interview early in April on Air Force One that he didn't know anything about the $130,000 payment that you just mentioned that went to this porn star right before the election in 2016.",
        "He also said that he didn't know where the funds for it had come from.",
        "And so it was quite a shock to many people to hear Rudy Giuliani suddenly, in the middle of an interview on Fox News on the Hannity program earlier this week, blurt out basically halfway through the interview that, in fact, the president had known about it and that he had reimbursed this money and had sent the money to his lawyer and so that he did, in fact, have involvement in arranging this payment with the porn star, or at least paying for it after the fact.",
        "So Giuliani said he'd cleared these talking points before and after his interview with Fox News personality Sean Hannity.",
        "But, as we said, the president said that Giuliani needs to get his facts straight.",
        "Do we have any sense of why Rudy Giuliani might have made these statements?",
        "Was this - you know, what was the purpose of this?",
        "Well, you know, we know that there were some conversations between the president and Giuliani, and they seem to have decided on their own that it was important to get some information out there.",
        "Although whether it was exactly what Giuliani said, we're not entirely sure.",
        "It sounds like the president was unhappy with some of the things that Giuliani said.",
        "There may have been a need to clarify the president's earlier denial because remember, people may be aware that there's a court proceeding going on in New York where a bunch of records were taken from the president's personal attorney, Michael Cohen.",
        "And prosecutors and other lawyers are beginning to go through those seized records.",
        "And it seems quite possible that there's paperwork in there - emails, other kinds of documents - that would indicate that the president had reimbursed this $130,000 payment and then some, according to Mr. Giuliani.",
        "So they may have wanted to get on the right side of those facts.",
        "But Giuliani made a bunch of other sort of very strange statements during the interviews.",
        "You know, took a shot at Jared Kushner, for example, said that the president had only learned these facts in the last couple of weeks and other statements along those lines, including a suggestion, after saying that it wasn't having anything to do with the campaign, he then suggested, well, it would have been a terrible thing if this came out right before the election.",
        "So it was not a very sort of controlled initial appearance by Mr. Giuliani.",
        "Well, as you might imagine, there's been a lot of conversation about this, particularly from legal experts over the past week about why this might matter.",
        "Could you summarize what the arguments are from different legal camps about what the significance of this might be?"

        "Well, I think sort of the worst case scenario for the president is, it does appear to tie him more closely to this payment, which we know that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating as a potential campaign finance violation.",
        "Before these comments by Mr. Giuliani, it seemed plausible that maybe Michael Cohen had somehow gone and done this on his own, and the president didn't know anything about it.",
