        "It was when I was in the hospital.",

        "And I thought the dressing must be transparent.",
        "But of course the eye was covered, but there was a strange persistence of vision.",

        "And then he mentioned that other things happened, other senses - we talked about this perception that you see when your eyes were closed, that you actually still see.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I think when the brain isn't getting its usual input, it starts to generate things, and I...",
        "Could that explain other things in life that we have wondered about, about memories and creating memories and things like that, do you think?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think something like this certainly explains some other sorts of hallucinations, so that deaf people tend to get musical hallucinations and blind or partly blind people get visual ones, and people who've lost their sense of smell get smell hallucinations, and people who have had an amputation get phantom limbs.",
        "So you were able to experience this for yourself without having to ask your patients?",
        "Yes, the hallucinations weren't too flamboyant.",
