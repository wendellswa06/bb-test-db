        "But I don't think (unintelligible) when we talk to you and we read your books, it's not survivorship, it's the journey in that survivorship.",
        "It's what's happening to keep you as a survivor and to keep and how you cope with these things in life that strike you.",

        "Right.",
        "How come I can see everything clearly but not make sense of it?",

        "And since he was a novelist, he wondered how could he revise the book.",
