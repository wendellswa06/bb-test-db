        "Oh, absolutely not.",
        "No, that's - the real-estate agents will tell you that they're working harder for a lot less because they've seen their commissions diminish and stuff like that, plus the challenges of dealing with foreclosures and short sales, which, three or four years ago, nobody in our community knew what a short sale was.",

        "And I guess it makes a bit more sense that President Trump would want to pay out hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle this kind of an allegation than that some person associated with him that, you know, would pay it out of their own pocket.",
        "Maybe that makes it more likely that it is mostly personal in nature."

        "North Koreans, as you've indicated it, first detonated a nuclear device of some sort in October of 2006, and this past May 25th detonated a second one that seems to have been a little bit more successful than the first.",
