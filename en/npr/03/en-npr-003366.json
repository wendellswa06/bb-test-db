        "To what extent what - could that actually precipitate a war and is it legal?",
        "Well, let me just start by saying the United Nations Security Council just passed, this past Friday, on June 12, a new and - a new U.N.",
        "Security Council Resolution 1874 that gave the authority to intercept, if you will, under reasonable grounds if North Korean ships or others that are going to North Korea, if we believe that there is illicit cargo, in this case anything above small arms, to include weapons of mass destruction, have the authority to ask the flag nation if we can board it and look around and if necessary search and seize that material.",
        "What we don't have the authorization for - this council resolution denied, give the authorization for is to do that by force.",
        "So...",
        "Chapter 7, it would be.",
        "Well, it's all under Chapter 7.",
        "It's Article 42 that gives you the authorization to use force.",
        "This was done under Article 41 as everything but force.",
        "So we are not at that point where we could actually employ a blockade.",
        "We can't force the - a vessel to stop on the high seas.",
        "And we just saw a news statement today from Russia and China expressing their alarm with what North Korea has been doing.",
        "If North Korea continues to launch missiles, if it sets off another test atomic weapon, as some people believe it's preparing to do, might Chapter 7 be next?",
        "Well, the answer is probably not.",
        "And that goes to the perspective, particularly from the Chinese.",
        "And from the Chinese point of view, their national security interest evolve first and foremost about stability - peace and stability along their border.",
        "And so the potential for chaos, a collapse of North Korea that could be precipitated by the use of force, is something that they are not at all moving toward.",

        "When - you know - when are we going to start holding people accountable to the treaty they signed for nonproliferation?",
        "I mean, they - most of the world has signed this treaty, you know, saying we're not going to create nuclear weapons, and then all of a sudden, you know, they come up, well, we've done it anyways.",

        "You know, oh, by the way, if you do try to do anything to us, we're going to nuke you.",

        "Yes.",
        "But let me give you a little bit of a quick history on that.",
        "The North Koreans were really arm-twisted by the Russians in 1985 to join in the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, something they probably didn't want to do.",
        "They stayed part of that until about 1993.",
        "And under the threat of special inspections by the International Atomic Energy Association - Agency, excuse me - they began a process of withdrawing from the NPT in 1993.",
        "That was suspended.",
        "And then, there was an agreement with the United States in 1994.",
        "Well, the second most recent nuclear crisis which began, as I have mentioned, in October of 2002.",
        "And in January of 2003, the North Koreans said, we're un-suspending our withdrawal from the NPT.",
        "Now, they went - they're supposed to give 90 days notice.",
        "They went 89 days and some number of hours.",
        "So, about 11 hours later, they said, we have finished the withdrawal process and we are now no longer a member of the NPT.",
        "That didn't sound quite kosher, but nonetheless they did it.",
        "And they are no longer a member of the NPT, and thus part of the problem we have."

        "When his father died in 1994, there was a question even then, whether that individual, some 50 years old at the time, was going to be able to survive with all of that preparation.",
        "Now, the prospects of Kim Jong Il's third son, his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, aged 26, with no experience, anytime in the near term being prepared to do that - I just can't buy in to that.",
        "So the best guess at this point is there would be a consortium that would involve the military to a large extent.",
        "But perhaps, at this point, Kim Jong Il's brother-in-law, Jang Seong Taek, is now part of the highest National Defense Commission and could be seen as part of that coalition trying to rule until this young son is both mature enough and has enough support to actually make it.",

        "Well, this is, in fact, a regime that has, as its first priority, survival.",
        "And so as you take a look over the last number of years where you would see the population - in fact, as you mentioned, starving to death - they do - I look at this as concentric circles.",
        "They - the centermost circle is those that are in power and the normal everyday people are that last circle out to the edges are the pond, and they don't get a whole lot of attention.",
