        "Well, I think one should.",
        "I think with the exception of those people who cannot tolerate those drugs, the first line of treatment should be, and in my mind always has been, the prescription of a statin drug like Lipitor, Zocor, Crestor, Pravachol, Lescol - I think I hit all the ones that are marketed in the United States, and clearly that should be the first line of treatment."
