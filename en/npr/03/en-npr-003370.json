        "But one of the things I wanted to bring up was pilot fatigue and also flight attendant fatigue.",
        "Little do many people know, pilots and flight attendants can actually go for 16 hours straight in one day and then only be given about eight hours of sleep.",
        "And then they start up right the next day, able to go up to 16 hours.",
        "And so, I wanted to hear what your panelist had to say on that and to bring that issue up.",
        "Well, Matthew, we're talking about the crashes today.",
        "It sounds like you weren't in any.",

        "It's what we're trying to get at here, Matthew.",
        "Would you tell us your story?",
        "The flaps failed.",
        "One of them was stuck up, one of them was stuck down.",
        "It was quite windy, and actually, we turned around to go back to, I believe it was JFK, and the controllers told us, you know, they would rather have us go to another airport because they didn't necessarily want to deal with our emergency at the time.",
        "So, we actually had, in an emergency situation, to go to a different airport and we had to land there with quite a windy situation.",
        "And it was a really hard landing.",
        "Everybody got out all right?",
        "Everyone did get out all right.",
        "Everyone was safe.",
        "But it was just surprising, you know, how it was handled, both from the controller aspect and also from the point that our pilots, you know, couldn't act as well as they probably should have been able to because they had not been able to get very much rest."

        "Yeah, yeah.",

        "It might have been safer for them to land at Laguardia.",
        "I don't know the details of that, but I do think that Matt makes an interesting point, which is that not only pilot and crew fatigue can affect your performance, but also passenger fatigue.",
        "Some of the worst plane crashes - actually the deadliest plane accident in history happened after the passengers had been delayed for seven hours or something, and they were waiting all day and they were exhausted.",
        "And that affects all of us.",

        "When we landed in Los Angeles, as soon as we touched down, all of the tires on the main gear caught fire and the fire was obviously underneath the wings.",

        "There was a Chinese man next to me who did not speak any English, and he must have been an architect because he was carrying a number of long tubes like they carry plans in.",
        "And he - you could tell he desperately wanted to save them, but as we were ushered out of the airplane down the aisle, the people around him were knocking those out of his hands because he was trying to hold onto them and still get down the aisle.",
