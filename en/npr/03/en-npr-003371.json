        "I was on Singapore Airlines and I was flying in to Kathmandu in Nepal.",
        "And it wasn't until after this happened that I discovered - I was told that Kathmandu airport, apparently, is one of the most dangerous airports to land in because Kathmandu sits in a bowl surrounded by the Himalayas.",
        "And we were coming down to the single runway at Tribhuvan Airport and we were approaching the runway and we hit a wind shear and the plane just literally dropped out of the sky and slammed down to the tarmac and bounced several times.",
        "The plane - the landing gear was totally demolished.",
        "We were forced to evacuate via the emergency exits and the slides.",
        "And I've got to say, if it wasn't for the great work of the Singapore flight attendants, that it could have turned into a much greater disaster than it actually was.",
        "No one ended up - to my knowledge - no one ended up getting injured.",
        "But the plane was totally taken out of commission.",
        "Wind shear - that, Amanda, one of the more terrifying scenario of - your plane is flying along then it's smacked down into the ground by a tremendous force of wind.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's interesting because what Bruce was saying reminds me of the fact that, you know, the training of the flight attendants is so key here.",
        "And we didn't understand this until in the '70s - there was a streak of terrible crashes in which passengers did nothing.",
        "They didn't move very quickly, if they moved at all.",
        "And they learned that flight attendants need to be trained to literally shriek at you in order to get people to move.",
        "And then people move.",
        "Oh, they were shrieking.",
        "I can guarantee you that they were shrieking at us to move.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, it's really remarkable.",
        "They've actually done research on this and if flight attendants are polite and friendly at that moment and quiet, it's the same effect as them not being there at all.",
        "So the shrieking is jarring, as you probably experienced, and I've only heard it in simulations and it's a little frightening, but it does have the desired effect.",
        "It was interesting, too, because, for whatever reason, as I recall, not a single person on the plane even thought about getting their baggage or their belongings.",
        "Everybody was just really interested in getting out of that plane as quickly as possible.",
        "Well, that's great.",
        "And that's probably a testament to the passengers' preparation and also the leadership of the crew.",
        "You know, if people have some information and some warning and they're given very aggressive orders, they tend to move really quickly.",
        "It's quite remarkable how obedient people are in crises like this.",
        "Bruce, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you."

        "We were doing about 110 knots and had to abort the takeoff and went off the runway at that speed and just barely missed the triple-7, but we went airborne as soon as we left the runway.",
        "And fortunately, it was real muddy.",
        "We came back down, traveled about a thousand feet through the mud, tore off the two inboard engines a little bit, bent back a landing gear and managed to walk away from it.",

        "I've never been in a crash, but since opening the emergency door is so important and vital, why not have an area in the airport where you can practice opening such a door so people can give it a try?",
        "Sounds like good advice.",
        "It's an excellent idea.",
        "Interestingly enough, that very idea was proposed in the U.K.",
        "and - in the government after a terrible crash, and it disappeared from the radar.",
        "What we find often is that airlines and airports are not particularly excited about the idea of talking about plane crashes, which is unfortunate, because I agree, people would be very eager and interested to experiment with it.",

        "They've long claimed that the Islamic State was pursuing the wrong model - that despite the excitement generated by its caliphate, it was rushing much too quickly and that, as a result, it was going to lose its territory and jihadists would be killed or would not be able to achieve their goals.",
        "Al-Qaida has been trying to be more patient, has been playing a long game.",
