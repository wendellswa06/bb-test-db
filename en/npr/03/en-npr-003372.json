        "Because our financial system is such that when one thing happens with a big institution, it affects many other institutions, because all of these banks lend to each other overnight, many of these banks - the shareholders of these banks get nervous.",
        "So one shareholder of another bank, maybe a larger bank, looks at IndyMac and says, oh my God, I'm worried about this, that bank is in the same business that my company is in.",
        "So they start selling shares, market value plunges.",
        "I mean, you get to a point where so many things are tied together that any one failure could topple conceivably the entire system, if it is big enough.",
        "That didn't happen in this case, but it is significant.",
        "What about federal insurance?",
        "What kind of protection does the federal government offer to the people who are invested in this bank?",
        "Well, to investors in the bank, it doesn't really offer any protection.",
        "If you are a depositor, of course, there is the FDIC insurance, you see that big sticker when you walk into any bank branch, it says your deposits are ensured up to a 100,000 dollars by the Federal Government.",
        "That's the federal - what the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.",
        "does for banks.",
        "But if you are an investor, you are stuck, I mean, if you have shares in a company, that's the risk that you take, this is the downside of investing.",
        "You put your money into a company.",
        "Those shares are worth 20 bucks when you buy them, if they drop to five, you are out.",
        "If they go up to 25 dollars a share, then you made a five dollar a share profit.",
        "But if the company fails, there is no protection for you, at least not from the federal government.",
        "Do you think that a company like this, shares might end up in, say, 401(k)s and people's retirement plans?",
        "It is possible.",
        "I mean, it would all, you would have to really look closely at what you are, what's in your 401(k).",
        "Many people in their 401(k)s have funds, or even funds of funds, you know, there are companies who would put together a portfolio, and many times you'll go and look at your 401(k), and they say, OK, choose this portfolio if you are going to retire in 20 to 30, choose this portfolio if you are going to retire 10 years from now.",
        "And what you really have to do is look at the prospectus for those funds that you have in your 401(k), to be able to figure out what your 401(k)'s holdings are.",
        "If you are in a 401 - my guess is that most 401(k)s tend to be so diversified that one company, one bank's failure is not going to be too heavily weighted in your own personal account that it is going to affect your retirement.",
        "So nobody should worry there.",
        "The bigger problem, again, comes in if this becomes a broader issue for financial stocks, and your 401(k) is holding a good deal of those.",
        "It might be a good time to check, but I don't think an individual holder of a 401(k) retirement account really has anything to worry about from this.",
        "So let's go back to the issue of people who are depositing.",
        "Remind us again how much the limit is for full coverage from the Federal Government.",
        "And then, what happens when you reach that limit?",
        "It is a hundred grand, and after a hundred grand it is a good idea for you to be diversified in where you have your money.",
        "I mean, in most cases you are not going to have somebody with 100,000 dollars cash, or more than 100,000 dollars cash sitting in one particular checking account.",
        "And many banks, most financial institutions are going to have different options for you beyond just those deposits.",
        "But for the federal insurance limit, it is up to 100,000 dollars, and then, after that, the insurance is gone, and you are not necessarily covered.",
        "Which is why one of the reasons why you are told that if you have a large amount of cash, you want to look at diversifying, doing different things with the money, as opposed to keeping it all sitting in one place."

        "Tell me about that.",
        "Well, I mean, I think one of the significant things there, similar to the folks, the family I profiled, a number of the families that I interviewed down in Atlanta, is there is this, there is a lot of shame.",
        "You know, there is this belief that, you know, you have done something wrong, and now you are in this position.",
        "And so what that means is that folks end up waiting too long, beating their heads against brick walls for too long, before they get around to asking for help from either other family members, or from the variety of sort of nonprofits that are out there trying to help them, or even trying to engage the lender to say, hey listen, this is a bad deal I got, what are we going to do about it before it gets to be too late?",
        "So it is not until it gets to be too late that folks are talking about.",
        "That was the same thing that happened with my mom, that's the same thing that happened with the family I profiled.",

        "We got first-time buyers in, but a very small percentage of the sub-prime loans since '98 actually went to first-time home buyers.",
        "He is an example of what more than half of them were refinances.",
        "He had his house since 1968, and it became a very important part of the family, both for their financial security, but then also just for a wide range of stability.",
        "And they owned it, and borrowed responsibly against it for, you know, for 30-some-odd years, and then 2003, I believe it was, they got a 68,000 dollar refinance for to put up some new siding.",
        "And in the course of four years, they flipped through four more refinances that landed him owing 125,000 dollars on a house that is, at an outside, worth 100,000 dollars.",
        "And through a whole host of questionable practices to get him into that loan, and one of the most strike - he had an IndyMac loan and, you know, they did a lot of these no-documentation loans, that's part of the problem they ran against.",
        "And he had one of these, where, you know, here is a guy who is living on a Postal Service pension and Social Security, and the loan application said he makes 5,000 dollars a month.",
        "Indymac told me they didn't think that was a red flag, but it seems to me anybody interested in actually underwriting these loans would have said wait a minute here.",
        "Keith, is that illegal, overstating income?",
        "Is there a law against it?",
        "There is a new regulation that was just passed today that would have required the bank, Indymac in that case, to have proof of the lender's income before making that loan.",
        "Up until now, that was completely legal, it was unregulated and you could - you could do it.",
        "It is unethical, banks have been sued for doing that and in some cases they've been prosecuted, but you have to do a very careful prosecution because in many cases and in many states this wasn't - these mortgage lenders weren't regulated.",
        "One of the differences between Indymac and banks in general and many of the bigger sub-prime players was that mortgage companies and banks are different.",
        "In other words, if you're a bank and you have that federal insurance in a charter, as a bank you have to follow federal lending regulations.",
        "If you're a mortgage lender and you're not technically a bank, you are immune - you had been immune for, you know, until now, from many of the regulations.",
        "The states didn't regulate them.",
        "The federal government didn't regulate them.",
        "And there was the flip in the percentage of mortgages that were done, it used to be that most of mortgages were done by banks, most mortgage lending was done by banks.",
        "And now, or at least in the last five or seven years, the majority of that lending shifted over to mortgage companies.",
        "And so you had far more lending happening on a level where it was not regulated than you did by a bank or an institution that had federal oversight at all."

        "I don't think many people ever expected them to have to reach out for the kind of backing they're now getting.",
        "But essentially what they do is they will go out and they will back or they will underwrite many of the mortgages that happen.",
        "So that if you're a bank and you go out and someone wants to - or lend and someone wants to borrow money from you, it becomes easier for that bank to lend money because they know that Fannie and Freddie will purchase the mortgage from the bank.",
        "And so if you've got somebody who maybe would have been on the bubble, maybe wouldn't have qualified for the best rate, maybe he wouldn't have been able to borrow the money for the house.",
