        "We come up to the debate, and the real question we're all looking for is whether this fracas will continue on the debate stage.",

        "On the other hand, McCain is in a tough spot tonight.",
        "The polls are very much turning against him.",
        "He's got to do something to change the dynamic of the race, and the debate is one place he can do that.",

        "Oh I don't know that I could read one because I'm not in position where I have it, but basically what I encourage my congregation to do is to vote for John McCain because he is the most Biblically accurate candidate that has a chance of winning this November.",
        "And obviously an endorsement, some people would say you crossed the line.",
        "The IRS would have that opinion, that's for sure.",
        "But I would essentially say that the First Amendment gives me the right to say whatever I want to say.",
        "The IRS shouldn't be in the business of censoring the pulpits of the United States.",
        "Are they - they don't want to sensor what you have to say.",
        "They're just concerned about your tax-exempt status.",
        "If you want to say that, at least according to the law, then you're not tax exempted.",
        "Well, churches are by nature, not taxable, so we don't have to be a 501(c)(3) in order to not be taxed.",
        "And the Constitution gives us the freedom of speech right before the IRS even existed for goodness sake.",

        "Did you make an endorsement four years ago?",
        "I don't remember if I did or not, I think I probably crossed the line, but the difference between four years ago and today is that I alerted the IRS to my infraction.",
        "So you're inviting some sort of action.",
        "Yes.",
        "And you did this in concert with a group of other people presumably to make the action so large that the IRS couldn't ignore it.",
        "Well, I did it by myself way back in May 18th, but then I essentially redid it and preached a different message, but I crossed the line according to the IRS just yesterday."
