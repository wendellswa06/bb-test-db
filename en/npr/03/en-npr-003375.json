        "I believe that's the right way to do it.",
        "And Neil, you're not concerned about what Reverend Gaddy was talking about just a moment ago that this could lead people to say, well, you know, this is not a political dispute, it's a religious dispute, and wars have been fought about religious disputes.",
        "Yeah, that's true to some extent, but I believe in our everyday life we go to church to teach us how to act as a spiritual and moral human being.",

        "And I would stand with you in total support in defending a priest in the Catholic Church or a minister anywhere else, interpreting an issue from the perspective of your scriptures and your church's tradition, and staying with that.",
        "But when that person steps out of that scriptural and church tradition, to endorse a candidate for public office, the person assumes a political authority that is not given to religious leaders, and begins to tell people a personal opinion from behind a sacred desk or a communion mass that ought to remain sacred, not opinionated and secular.",
        "Well, when a candidate is definitely for or against, and one of the planks in their platform is markedly against what we teach as moral law, the sanctity of human life, if a candidate allows life to be snatched from the womb, then obviously, one has to speak out against this travesty.",
        "No.",
