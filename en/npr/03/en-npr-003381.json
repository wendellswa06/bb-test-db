        "So you were 40 years old when you started college.",

        "So, how does it feel?",
        "Well, it was a wild experience.",
        "I was in an all-male Washington and Lee University that's now co-educated, and there were three of us who were non-traditional age, three of us who were married and had children and were students.",
        "And we found ourselves taking physical education classes, which were mandatory with people who are half our age.",
        "Although the - we later found or at least, I later found they had waived the P.E.",
        "requirement for us, but never told us, that they had done so.",
        "Now, you went into teaching.",
        "When and how did you obtain your doctorate?",
        "Well, first I taught three years in a private secondary school and then I got a letter from my faculty advisor, and now former department head, suggesting that I go to graduate school, get a PhD and come back to Washington and Lee.",
        "So I went to the College of William and Mary and spent two and a half years there in residence, took my comprehensive exams and then ended up being a teaching fellow at Washington and Lee for two years.",
        "Subsequently, I taught at the State University of New York where I spent my time teaching and writing my dissertation, and came back to Washington and Lee to join the faculty in 1995.",
        "In that short decade and change, the 12 years since 1995, you have made tremendous strides, taught so many people and now are becoming the chair of the history department.",
        "How did you feel on learning that you had made that next step?"

        "Sometimes my classes are majority white, sometimes they're 50-50.",
        "But it's interesting - you have white students from the lower south in African-American history, alongside African-American students.",
        "And I have a great deal of fun and joy with the students who take that course, for instance.",
        "Perhaps one real accomplishment is along with a white professor who does African-American literature, we were able to found an African-American studies program at Washington and Lee.",
