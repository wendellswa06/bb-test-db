        "Unless you're Steven Spielberg or the ruler of a small country with really large oil reserves, the housing market in Los Angeles is, as some Angelenos might say, `way expensive.",
        "So then how come when it's so hard to buy anything reasonable, there's a perfectly gorgeous house in the middle of Los Angeles that's going begging?",
        "I'm Carolyn Ramsay.",
        "I was the president of the Windsor Square Association, which is the neighborhood association in Los Angeles.",
        "And we're walking through the neighborhood right now.",
        "We're walking toward the mayor's residence.",
        "Neighborhood historian Carolyn Ramsay is escorting me over to Getty House.",
        "It's the mayor's official residence in the Windsor Square section of Los Angeles.",
        "In this community of graceful old homes on shady streets with wide green lawns, Getty House doesn't stick out; it looks like all its expensive neighbors.",
        "Mayor Tom Bradley actually lived here for 16 years, but he was the first and last mayor to call it home.",
        "Then came multimillionaire businessman-philanthropist Richard Riordan.",
        "Ramsay says people understood when he didn't move it.",
        "It's amazing.",
        "It is not discussed in the neighborhood as a negative thing, because when Mayor Riordan chose not to live here, he had some fabulous spread in Bel Air.",
        "Nobody expected him to give up his Bel Air mansion to move to the neighborhood.",
        "Riordan's big house was, after all, `way bigger' than their big houses.",
        "But the mayor gave the city a little gift.",
        "His wife, Nancy, put together a committee and raised $2 million for the Getty Foundation to overhaul Getty House, named for the billionaire oil baron who also chose not to live in it, and make it ready for subsequent mayors.",
        "The next mayor, James Hahn.",
        "promptly announced he wasn't moving from his neighborhood, either, but the neighbors still weren't upset.",
        "Carolyn Ramsay.",
        "Well, he has small children, and San Pedro is really far from here so he would have had to pull his children out of school to live in the mayor's residence.",
        "And I don't think anybody really expected him to do that.",
        "So Hahn used it for receptions and other official activities.",
        "Last week, we got a new mayor and guess what?",
        "Antonio Villaraigosa has also said `No, thanks' to moving into Getty House.",
        "He says his family will `make use' of the mansion, but his youngest children want to stay near their schools and friends.",
        "The neighbors' reaction?",
        "Again, no hard feelings.",
        "Carolyn Ramsay.",
        "I think that there are many reasons that the neighborhood feels connected to the Getty House and feels proud of the Getty House without having a proprietary feeling about the mayor living there or, you know, feeling insulted that the mayor does not live there."

        "There's Gracie Mansion in New York, the Manoogian Mansion in Detroit, Los Angeles has Getty House and then the city of Denver has just recently acquired a home for their mayor.",
        "And you tell a story on yourself about the time you needed to buy a new pair of boots.",
        "Well, let me ask you, how much did the election change things?",
        "There's the same cast of characters, pretty much.",
        "Well, I - people that aren't there negotiating, and I'm not there, but people that aren't are speculating on all kinds of things, in terms of the president is playing with more power, he acts like a tyrant because he won the election.",
        "I don't really see that at this point, that there is any big change because of the election.",
        "Well, the president, if he campaigned on one thing, it was raise taxes on the wealthy.",
        "Yeah, raise taxes on the top 2, which he labeled - the top 2 percent, which he labeled the wealthy.",
        "Whatever we did, we had to put that in that new tax code for him, as he said it when he was running, because he thought that was the only way to be fair.",

        "Well, there are a lot of Republicans who are saying over my dead body, or we would like to give you the same kind of cuts but not income tax cuts; get them from other places that rich people pay taxes.",

        "Yeah, that's - the whole tax expenditure, that's a huge part of the tax code.",
        "When you get around to that, some Republicans are saying instead of what we were talking about, do some things in that tax code to hit the rich.",
        "Well Senator Domenici, when we start talking about tax code, a lot of people's eyes glaze over.",
        "Can you get to the essence of this?",
        "What is this debate really about?",
        "Well, this debate is about - it starts out and it remains, although it's got a new name and some additional problems, but it started out as a genuine effort on the part of the leadership of each house to come up with a proposal that would save this country from the embarrassment and/or ruin of having the debt get so big that it exceeded GDP, gross domestic product, by 60, 70 and 80 percent and was growing by leaps and bounds.",
        "And the reason it was started was because most experts think that that is unsustainable.",
        "And that's whatever word you want to use, use the worst you can because that means you can't continue as a country, the same kind of country.",
        "Things are going to happen that you become something else.",
        "You become less reliable, you debauch your money.",
        "All these kind of things can happen to you.",
        "And so it started two years ago, and two and a half, with each party working on it.",
        "That's where I got on a nonpartisan budget group and - bipartisan, I should say.",
        "And we worked for a year.",
        "And we found out everything about this, and we voted and produced something that was bipartisan.",
        "Now, the problem is we've got two approaches going on - and what may be three but two at least - one by the majority House, which says, don't count us out, we're still in the majority, one majority, we got elected, and we do run the House.",
        "We have the United States Senate, which acts like it's another negotiating body.",
        "And then we have the president and his people, and they're the third one.",
        "And they're trying to reduce that deficit, which cumulatively is the debt, which now exceeds $16 trillion.",
        "What, as you go through this, frustrates you the most about each of those parties?",
        "The Republicans, for example, in the House say whatever we do, we're not going to raise tax rates on the top 2 percent.",
        "The Democrats in the Senate say, you know, Social Security, off the table.",
        "Yeah, what - let me tell you what worries me the most is none of those things.",
        "It's negotiating an agreement of this content and this importance and this magnitude, negotiating it open in the public and putting out, one at a time, the basic things that you propose.",
        "That bothers me the most because that lends itself to all kinds of things that have nothing - that have the other side reacting in ways that have nothing to do with what they should, the way they should be thinking."

        "Finds out when he finally gets re-elected, it doesn't matter who you want to blame it on, it's real, and it doesn't matter who you want to say caused it, it's now everybody's problem because if it should cause our monetary, money system to fall apart, there's no telling how bad off this country could go.",
        "Those of who are interested, who have taken the time to listen to historians, listen to money experts tell us what might happen when that ratio of the debt to the gross product of the country gets big, and it's so big that it's carrying 200 or 300 percent, they just tell you right off you don't have any functioning country.",
        "And last - what is it, last year, the - one of the rating agencies cut the U.S.",

        "And right now I guess the point we ought to talk about to you and your listeners, understanding that I'm not there, and I'm not a player, a participant, but yet I'm a player, one of the outside groups that finds his way in through cracks and corners and talks to the people over there."
