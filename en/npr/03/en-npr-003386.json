        "In the 20th century, it was code for racial desegregation--excuse me, for racial segregation.",
        "Any liberal of a certain age who hears those words will immediately summon the image of Governor George Wallace standing in the doorway at the University of Alabama in a last-ditch effort to bar black students.",
        "Federal marshals moved Wallace aside; federal court orders, federal legislation and sometimes federal troops were the instruments of desegregation and later women's rights.",

        "Then I saw the price and I said, oh no, can't go there.",
        "So I ended up buying a pair of discount boots and wore them the next night, to New Year's Eve, and they didn't feel very comfortable.",
        "They didn't - they weren't exactly what I wanted.",
        "In fact, they really weren't what I wanted at all.",

        "Right?",
        "I think we all have one of those, where we - things we thought were good at the time because the price is what enticed us, and in fact we end up maybe wearing them once or twice and not wearing them again.",
        "So this experience happened to me again and again.",
        "And I think of myself as a rational person.",
        "And I wonder, gee, did it happen to other people?",

        "And one of the points you make in the book is, how come it seems so often that the only choices are the $200 butter Italian leather boots or the Chinese clunkers?",
        "Yeah, yeah, and as I discovered, this bifurcation of price, this high/low pricing is a relatively new thing.",
        "You know, our parents and our grandparents were able to find pretty good value at a pretty good price.",

        "And that's a distinction you argue that's been lost.",
        "Yeah, I think it's a really serious problem in the United States, that we have lost track of what we mean by value.",
        "We ascribe low price, we confuse low price with value, and that's, as I said, led me on quite a journey.",
        "One of the places you went to was the place where so many of our first apartments were furnished, from the IKEA factory in Scandinavia, and you write about this kind of style, not just IKEA, but that's really emblematic of it.",
        "It's got good style, it looks good, it is also, as you write, describe it -disposable.",
        "Yeah, you know, actually, IKEA really doesn't have its own factories.",
        "It outsources what it makes, and what's really interesting about IKEA is that many of us think, well, you know, we don't go to Wal-Mart, we don't go to discount stores, but we'll go to IKEA, and that's why I wanted to go to Sweden and see how it worked.",
        "And the people at IKEA are just wonderful people.",
        "It's a fascinating place.",
        "But what I learned there was that IKEA designs to a price, which is really kind of a strange idea.",
        "They set a price for, say, a table and chairs for $100, they design it, they have a team of expert designers who do a beautiful job of designing these things.",
        "But then they squeeze their suppliers to - really to the limit to get these products at the lowest, lowest possible price.",
        "And what that means is, of course, inevitably, they cut corners.",
        "They cut corners in terms of the labor they use.",
        "They cut corners in terms of the environmental effects, and of course they cut corners in terms of the quality.",
        "And in the course of doing the research, I found that IKEA has advertisements which tell you not to really develop a relationship with their products because the new one is so much better.",
        "They are encouraging this kind of disposability of products; even, you know, what we think of as a lovely kind of product, which is IKEA, is engaged in this when they get into the price wars.",
        "And this, you argue, extends to an entire culture of bargain hunting that eventually - it's not just boots, where we have only choices between very cheap and very expensive, but almost everything.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And one gentleman I talked to said, you know, Americans don't feel that they deserve quality anymore.",
        "They think that quality is only for wealthy people and we're, you know, we're in a position now where if it's - it's either - we think it should be very, very expensive or we're going to have to make do with the product.",
        "And many times, I think, many of us have had this experience where we go in, we are price sensitive.",
        "Of course we're all price sensitive, but if you're like me, you're also deal prone.",
        "That's actually a psychological term.",
        "We see that deal, we lust after that deal.",
        "We may not be thinking about the object, we're thinking about that deal.",
        "And there's a mathematics and psychology to getting us to focus on that deal, on that low price and get us to not think so hard about what it is that we're buying.",
        "And again, that is a, you know, really a fascinating story about how psychologists, marketers, even mathematicians get involved in designing price to lure us in and help us forget about what we're buying.",
        "And that's where, we were talking earlier, the shirt for $50, half off, it was 100 before.",
        "The exact same shirt just sold for $50, nowhere near as interesting."

        "I've certainly been there.",
        "In fact, my husband teases me ceaselessly me on this, that I see a very, very high price on something - and this is particularly true for clothing - the thing could be kind of dopey-looking, it may not fit too well or whatever, but if it has a very high reference price and now it's on discount, I'm much more likely to buy it and put aside my judgment, my independent judgment.",
        "But I would not have bought it if the discount price was the full price on that object.",

        "But you know, it was a fairly high-quality piece of clothing, and you can still buy a dress shirt today for $20, but the quality seems to - you know, no one wants to pay what would be the inflation-adjusted price for clothing and especially shoes.",
        "And why do you think that's true, Jerry?",
        "I don't know.",
        "You know, one pair of shoes that might cost you three times what an almost identical-looking pair of shoes will last you 10 times longer and be much more comfortable while you're wearing them.",
        "The same thing is true of most clothing.",
        "If you buy something that's not extremely stylish but, you know, tends to be kind of middle of the road, you can wear things, like a button-down shirt, forever, but I don't know why."

        "It seems like if you look on the pages of Esquire, you can find nice dress shirts for, like, $400, but there's nothing in what would be the inflation-adjusted range of say from 60 to $100 for something of good quality.",
        "And Jerry, just out of curiosity, that sort of second-string, mid-level, good-quality stuff that you were selling, what, 30 years ago, where was that made?",
        "Most of it was made in the United States.",
        "In fact, I believe Boyd's was owned by Cluett Peabody, which also owned Arrow shirts.",

        "And Jerry brings up the question, you know, why do you think that is?",
        "Well, you know, when you're talking about chain stores that are mass-marketers, global multinationals, they have to move an awful lot of product to get that value, to get that price down as far as possible.",
        "And if they're going to move all that product, they've got to, as I say before, they also have to keep the prices very, very low.",
