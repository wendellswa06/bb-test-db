        "Ellen Ruppel Shell takes aim at a number of targets in her book \"\"Cheap: The High Cost of Discount Culture,\"\" discounters like Ikea and Wal-Mart, China for allowing sweat shops and all of us, the buyers who snap up the bargains, sometimes at the expense of our principles.",
        "We're talking about the psychology of pricing and the cost of cheap.",
        "What did you buy that you thought to be a steal but turned out to be junk?",
        "If you're in business to sell, what have you learned about prices and consumers?",

        "Hi.",
        "I've had an experience where when I have tried to buy quality and been willing to upgrade, I find that the items don't actually last any longer than when I buy them at the discount cheap prices a lot of times.",
        "Really?",
        "So the biggest example was shoes.",
        "When I was growing up, I always would buy, you know, the $20, man-made-everything shoes at Payless.",
        "And I remember when I was getting ready for an internship in college, close to my senior year, I decided I was going to invest in, you know, a $100 pair of shoes.",
        "It was all leather, and they didn't last me any longer than the Payless shoes lasted.",
        "Well, Ellen Ruppel Shell, that's an experience that does happen to people.",
        "You try to step up and, well, it's no good, either.",
        "You know, absolutely, and when it comes to things like clothing, I think that's an interesting point.",
        "Clothing can be quite durable and last a long time that is not expensively made.",
        "However, it usually doesn't have the drape or the fit of more expensive clothing.",
        "And of course, that's a choice that people can make, and I'm not for a minute saying that people need to make the choice.",
        "What I am suggesting, to get back to what Jerry said, is that people have the choice.",
        "So those who are interested in the middle ground are made able to find that middle ground, and unfortunately in our current economic environment, it's getting increasingly difficult to find that middle ground.",
        "So when you go to a Payless or some of the discount stores, the other thing we're obviously not paying for is service or necessarily good wages and benefits for the workers in those stores.",
        "And this, of course, comes back to bite us, and I attribute a good deal of our current economic decline to this obsession with low price.",
        "Well, just to pick a bone, there are sweatshops in China for sure - and by the way, Heather, thank you very much for the call.",
        "There are, of course, sweatshops in China and deplorable conditions.",
        "But there are factories run by American companies there in China that pay, for Chinese workers, very well, and these are people who would otherwise be poverty-stricken in the countryside.",
        "This is their way up in the world."

        "You know, that's a very complicated argument that I do get into in the book.",
        "It involves a lot of nuance, and it's a difficult one to make either way.",
        "I have been to China, many of us have, and certainly the conditions in some of the factories are not the conditions that we would want to see here in the United States.",
        "But people argue, well, this is a way up for these folks, and in some cases it certainly is.",
        "But as we continue pushing prices down, the pressures on people in those countries, just as the pressures on people in this country, become greater and greater.",
        "There's also an argument that, well, there's a lot of single mothers who have to go get the lowest prices they can.",
        "They're struggling to get along, and if you're buying toilet paper or, you know, food for that matter, Wal-Mart, they've got really good prices.",
        "Oh absolutely, and again, people are free to make their own choices.",
        "But what I found in the course of doing this research, between 2000 and 2007, the median family income dropped in the United States by about $1,175, adjusting for inflation, while our spending increased by over $4,500.",
        "So yet as we were spending what seemed like less and less on consumer goods, we were spending more and more money.",
        "So the price of clothing, for example, dropped by about 32 percent.",
        "The price of appliances dropped by about 52 percent.",
        "But at the same time, the price of health insurance increased by 74 percent.",
        "The price of mortgages increased by 76 percent.",
        "So while we were able to get consumer goods cheaper and cheaper, our fixed costs, the things about which we don't have any choices, increased.",
        "And at the same time, our wages and benefits decreased.",
        "So in a way, cheap consumer goods is a little like bread and circuses.",
        "Yes, you can get, you know, tube tops and maybe ground beef at a lower price - not always, by the way, but maybe you can.",
        "But what does that mean in terms of your own benefits and wages?",
        "It's not just - when we're competing with the developing world for wages and benefits, we're going to lose.",

        "I want to put in a plug for secondhand stores for buying, well, everything from clothing to these small appliances.",
        "And it seems to me that when I talk to my friends about this, they turn up their noses, and I wonder what is this?",
        "Because it seems like it's a snob thing.",
        "They know about secondhand stores, but they don't want to go there, but I've managed to get really good-quality stuff, you know, people - wealthy people give their cast-off things to the non-profit sector, and they are sold in secondhand stores.",
        "And you get really good-quality stuff that way.",
        "I've gotten silk clothing and linen clothing and 100-percent cotton clothing and furniture, too.",
        "I got a table for only, what was that, $65, I believe.",
        "Well, you might have to put a couple of other - move the decimal points if it had been sold in an antique store.",
        "But Ellen Ruppel Shell, she's got a point.",
        "There are certainly a lot of options."

        "Well, you know, that is likely to be cheaper than a table in a discount store, and also it stood up to time.",
        "It's lasted long enough to become secondhand, which means it's likely to be of pretty good quality.",
        "It also means that you can take that table, you can sand it down, you can re-varnish it, you can own that table.",
        "A lot of discount goods - let's look at that table for a minute.",
        "It could be veneer, okay, and this is very common, veneer over particle board.",

        "We don't really know where they come from.",
        "We don't know much about their history or how they're made, and we sort of think of them as kind of disposable.",
        "Or even if we don't, we don't really think we can modify them to suit our needs, whereas good vintage products, secondhand products, oftentimes are a much better choice for people.",

        "It's amazing how many times I really don't want it anymore.",
        "You know, Neal, that is genius.",
        "What I talk about in the book is the incredible jolt, incredible high we get when we see low price.",
        "And in fact looking into the brain using brain scanners, we can see that people's response to a good deal is actually much higher than the response to a discounted product.",
        "In other words, our biggest charge comes from getting that deal.",
        "If you can walk away, even if you can walk away from the product, take a little walk around the store, think about whether you really want it, think about whether that's, you know, it's the thing you want and not the price you want, that can be very, very helpful.",
        "And I think it's very telling that the caller said, or the writer said, gee, you know, oftentimes I decide not to even buy it.",
        "Right.",
        "She's not reacting to price."

        "But today, sales are year-round.",
        "And so, it's very, very difficult to determine what the value of a product is.",
        "Many of us think of price as a very objective determinant, the only objective thing we know about products, we think.",
        "But, in fact, price is very subjective, depends on the context.",
