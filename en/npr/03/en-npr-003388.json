        "In fact, in Saudi Arabia, people are more concerned with the quality, not as sensitive to the price as they are in other parts of the world.",
        "But the real problem is that, how can we ensure that the products that we are buying are the real quality, given that there are so many products that you really, really, you know, copy the good quality products and they have fake, you know, country of origin.",
        "And for this reason, the importance of consumer protection and the consumer rating, like when I go and book a hotel on the Internet, I have other consumers rating it.",
        "Right.",
        "So, how can - you know, the issue is that how can we get the community and the consumers themselves to rate the products so other consumers can get an indication of the level of the quality?",
        "And I will ask the question on your behalf, but I did want to ask you a question: Are, these days, most prices set by price tag as they are here in this country?",
        "Or is this still a culture where prices are bargained?",
        "Well, prices are bargained.",
        "It's a free pricing.",
        "Any - all vendors can set their prices, you know, outlets as they wish.",
        "So it's a pure competition market.",

        "Yes.",
        "I talk about the ancient bazaar where there was a give and take between buyer and seller.",
        "And if some - if a merchant in the ancient bazaar ripped off his neighbor, he didn't stay in business very long.",
        "So there was a kind of automatic quality control when you knew where the product was made, when you knew that guy who was selling it, and you, you know, knew who his family was, that's a very long time ago, maybe still the case to some degree in Saudi Arabia and other parts of the world.",
        "If you're talking about trying to get millions out of a turnip, you know, it just isn't going to happen, no matter how much you squeeze.",
        "Frankly, if they won their case, probably more likely just to turn around and get the company to agree not to do it again in the future.",
        "How do we know about quality?",
        "Well, a wise man said a long time ago that knowledge in the marketplace is probably the scarcest commodity, you know, really trying to figure out how something is made, where it's made, if you're being fooled.",
        "These are very difficult things to know.",
        "And it's particularly difficult today when we have multinationals making products, who knows where.",
        "We don't really know what goes into them a lot of the time.",
        "So it is - it does certainly behoove consumers to know as much as they possibly can about products.",
        "That's where the Internet comes in handy.",
        "But as one behavioral psychologist told me, people prefer - oftentimes prefer not to research, especially discount buys, because they, again, love to get that hit of a discount.",
        "They don't want to know too much."

        "At one end was a paper that called for basically a continuation of the current policy.",
        "They sort of threw that one away.",
        "At the other end was one that called for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.",
        "They threw that away.",
        "And that gave them, in effect, two alternatives in the middle - two options for either tweaking or seriously changing American policy."
