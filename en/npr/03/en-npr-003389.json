        "One of those calls for withdrawing American forces gradually, probably to bases in other countries and, in effect, getting out of combat in Iraq - staying around to strike at terrorists, potentially to do some training.",
        "But basically, it would be a phased withdrawal.",
        "The other one, the more subtle option, is one that calls for American troops to stay in longer, but calls on the administration to shift its emphasis toward diplomacy and specifically to bring in Iran and Syria, two countries that the Bush administration has not wanted to get involved in Iraq until now.",

        "I talked about the legal aspects of these investigations with Carl Tobias, and he's a law professor at the University of Richmond.",
        "Now, Tobias says we could very well see Enron-type trials of executives at the firms being investigated.",
        "People could be convicted and pay large fines or actually serve jail time, depending on the violation of any criminal laws or perhaps some civil law.",
        "Nancy, exactly what laws are we talking about here that have been broken?",
        "Well, as far as AIG goes, Attorney General Cuomo is thought to be relying on a New York State law that says that creditors can challenge any payment made by a company if they don't think the company got good value in exchange for that payment.",
        "And as far as AIG goes, the argument would be that the executives were paid millions of dollars, but their services weren't worth that kind of money.",
        "Now, in Washington Mutual's case, prosecutors haven't said what laws investigators think may have been broken by the bank, but there are a number of possibilities.",
        "Investigators might be looking into whether Washington Mutual's financial statements or statements to analysts were false or misleading.",
