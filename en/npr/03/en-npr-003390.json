        "So there are a lot of people who may have a marijuana conviction, but they also have other convictions that would disqualify them.",
        "So we're evaluating that.",

        "We heard a lot about drug policy and the interstate commerce clause.",
        "How does that issue play as a states' rights issue?",
        "Well, the issue in that case is whether or not the California state law that permits people to use marijuana for medical problems, if it's prescribed by a doctor--question is, does that state law stand, even though the federal government has a general ban against all use of marijuana?",
        "So it's a classic fight between the state and the federal governments over social policy.",
        "Interestingly, Alabama filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the two California women who argue that they have a medical right to use marijuana.",
        "Again, I guess those are true believers in states' rights.",
        "Well, there are the true believers in states' rights who continue to support the idea that the states ought to have latitude to be 50 state laboratories in social policy.",
        "And then there are the former states' rights supporters who now have federal power and see that states' rights can be an impediment to their federal power.",
        "So we've got both kinds out there.",
        "And I guess there's an element of opportunism on both sides."

        "Well, it's inevitable.",
        "And the framers of the Constitution fundamentally understood this, that anyone who holds power will be sorely tempted to abuse it, and once someone sits in a position of power, it's going to be very difficult to persuade them that that power ought to be limited in some meaningful way.",
        "So if you gain federal power, the White House and the Congress, it's going to be very difficult to persuade the Republicans at this point that the states ought to have wide latitude to do what they need to do, even if it's not consistent with the federal government's policies.",
        "This is about, in some respects, the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.",
        "It's about the 10th Amendment, but it's also about the principle that runs through the entire Constitution that we have two sovereigns, both the federal sovereign and the state sovereign.",
        "The idea, though, of state sovereignty has eroded considerably over the past couple of hundred years.",
        "Well, in the 20th century, by the 1930s, the United States had essentially given up on limiting Congress in any way, shape or form, so that by the time we got to 1995, which was the first federalism decision of recent note, nobody believed anymore that there could be a limit on Congress.",
        "Congress looked like it had plenary power over every issue in the United States.",
        "Since 1995, with the Supreme Court putting some moderate limitations on Congress, there's been a slow rebuilding of the wall around Congress saying 'Congress doesn't get power over everything.'",

        "Now traditionally, as we've said, the Democrats have been the party of the federal government and the Republicans of smaller government and more authority at the state level.",
        "Well, what's so interesting is that the Republicans gained the power that they have now through the latter part of the 20th century and into the 21st by arguing for smaller government.",
        "But once they achieved large government and control of large government, now we see the Department of Justice aggressively pursuing social policies at the expense of states' rights.",
        "So there's a lot of irony in where different people are standing on this issue right now.",
        "With respect to liberals, the original response to federalism starting in 1995 was vigorous, to put it in an understated way.",
        "And the theory was that federalism and states' rights were just a code word for anti-civil rights.",
        "What's so interesting about the case that the court heard yesterday is we have a liberal agenda in California, and they're arguing for states' rights for a liberal agenda and it's the federal government run by conservatives that's arguing for expansive federal power.",
