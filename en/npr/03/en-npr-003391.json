        "Pardon me?",
        "Abandoning...",
        "Large parts of the country, the so-called red states.",
        "Well, if you are pursuing particular issues in a state legislature--state legislatures are historically easy to work through in the sense that there's not a lot of attention paid to what's going on there.",
        "And you can get many agendas through, liberal or conservative, through a state legislature that you could never get through Congress.",
        "It's much smaller.",
        "It's much more local and so local people have more influence.",
        "So you are not giving up on every state.",
        "It's an issue-by-issue thing and you have to go from state to state to make the argument.",
        "Now the argument against federalism in the past was that it was so inefficient to go to all 50 states.",
        "But the answer to that has to be, 'Well, that's the system we've got.'",
        "But if, for example, you're concerned about the issue of gay marriage, just as you would argue states' rights gives Massachusetts every right to keep gay marriage, you'd have to accept that the 11 states that just passed constitutional amendments barring gay marriage, that's OK for them, too.",
        "Right.",
        "No, you have to take the bad with the good.",
        "There will be states who don't follow your policy predilections and there'll be other states that do.",
        "But a good example of how these issues have developed is divorce.",
        "Divorce was highly--it was looked down upon for a very long time and it took an experiment in various states, starting with Nevada, with no-fault divorce.",
        "As other states watched and saw that that was a better system than the one they had, no-fault divorce grew geometrically across the country.",
        "It's the same principle here.",
        "If we see that medical marijuana works in California, we don't have a lot of abuses and people are feeling better because they've been very, very ill, then we're going to see it expand.",
        "If it's a total disaster and there are too many doctors prescribing it for the wrong reasons, we're going to say, 'Well, that was an experiment that didn't work.",
        "We'll have to shut it down.",
        "That's the beauty of the system.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Bruce, who's with us from Portland, Oregon.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "I have a question for Professor Hamilton, and that is: Recently the Supreme Court refused to consider the gay marriage ban or the approval of it in Massachusetts and you just mentioned about the 11 states that during the last election basically banned gay marriage.",
        "And my question is this: Does the Supreme Court do this as a political maneuver to basically throw it to the states so that they only need 27 more to basically ratify the Constitution to amend it?",
        "No.",
        "What the Supreme Court did there is actually extremely apolitical.",
        "The court never takes an issue the first time it comes up.",
        "And that was the first time the court had been faced with that particular issue.",
        "It's going to wait, to watch how the issue percolates through the various courts in the country.",
        "When we get to a point where various courts have different viewpoints on an issue and the issue's a federal issue, not just a state constitutional issue, that's when the Supreme Court will weigh in.",
        "But at this point, that was a state constitutional issue.",
        "There's no split among the states.",
        "It just wasn't time for them to weigh in yet."

        "I wonder--if the case had been brought by a Massachusetts married gay couple who sought to have that marriage recognized in Ohio, just to pick a state out of a hat, that might have been an issue for the Supreme Court.",
        "Well, that would have implicated a federal law that was passed a year ago; that is the Defense of Marriage Act, which raises that very issue.",
        "If you've got a federal law at stake, then, in fact, the Department of Justice probably would ask for a review because they would like to get it over with--what's the answer to this federal issue?",
        "So that would be a completely different issue.",
        "Bruce, thanks for the phone call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And I guess, Professor Hamilton, the issue down the road is if the Supreme Court reverses itself on Roe v.",
        "Wade, the issue will be abortion.",
        "Well, if the Supreme Court reverses itself on Roe v.",
        "Wade, we're going to see 50 states renewing their debate over abortion.",
        "Now what's really happened with Roe v.",
        "Wade is that we have a vast diversity among the states in how they deal with abortion.",
        "I'm not sure the reversal of Roe v.",

        "That's right.",
        "So actually, you know, we really make the most out of, like, a 10 second clip, truth be told.",
        "Whereas now, I think you'll probably see Republicans wanting to fight it out in Congress or with maybe a federal law or constitutional amendment, if that's what they think is necessary.",
        "Well, I think that's exactly right.",
        "And one of the more humorous moments in recent history is when this--the Bush administration started to consider whether or not to have a federal marriage amendment.",
        "If there's anything that belongs under state control, it's marriage.",
        "And so when the Republican-controlled government switches over to creating a federal solution to something that's always been a local or state issue, you know that states' rights has now left their particular platform.",
        "And briefly, before we let you go, by adopting some issues as states' rights issues, might liberals pick up some conservative jurists who believe in states' rights?"

        "Thank you.",

        "Right.",
        "I was--it was shortly after the election, and all my friends were kind of sulky and whiny, saying, 'Oh, we should secede' or 'We have to move to Canada,' and so forth.",
        "And I was thinking of ways to cheer them up and I thought, well, they could read the works of the stoic philosophers, but that's maybe not the most constructive thing.",
        "And then I thought, 'Wait a minute.",
        "There might be a silver lining in this.",
        "Bush, in a way, might be our friend, and the reasoning is this: If you live in one of the blue states that voted for Kerry, you're probably living in one of the more prosperous regions of the country.",
        "The liberal enclaves are, you know, on the coast, in cities like New York and Boston; and the West Coast and the Great Lakes states.",
        "And that part of the country, there's a greater part of the federal tax burden than the red states that voted for Bush.",
        "Now Bush, of course, has already lowered our taxes twice, in 2001 and 2003, I believe, and when he did that, he made things easier on the blue states.",
        "Because, in fact, the blue states send more money to Washington than they get back and the red states get back more than they send.",
        "So the blue states, where the liberals by and large live, are actually subsidizing the red states.",
        "And I remember this, you know, came vividly to mind years ago when Newt Gingrich was railing against the federal government and someone pointed out that, you know, 'Hey, Newt Gingrich's congressional district gets much more from Washington than they send in.",
        "So actually, his district is sort of the welfare case, dependent on the federal government.",
        "So anyway, I thought, what Bush has already done and is offering to do more of, to make permanent, are tax cuts that reduce the subsidy that the blue states pay to the red states, and that means that more of this money stays in the blue states and they can spend it on, you know, the sorts of values that they cherish that may not be cherished in the red states.",
        "Now every year my federal taxes keep going down and my local taxes keep going--my local and state taxes keep going up, so my tax burden, you know, stays about the same, but I'm happy with that.",
        "And, you know, there's--more money is spent locally.",
        "Now, of course, in New York City we have our own mini-welfare state.",
        "Anyway, that's the rationale.",
        "But in other words, liberals would have reason to--anything that would shrink the federal government would be good.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I'm not making this case entirely seriously.",
        "I mean, there's a little bit of irony running through it, but I think that--yes, there are always unintended consequences, and in this case, the unintended consequence of Bush's tax cuts, one of them at least, is to reduce the burden on the blue states, to leave them with more money that they can spend in ways that they want.",
        "They can spend it to improve health insurance within their states, as Vermont has discussed doing.",
        "Or they can spend it on education.",
        "Of course, the blue states already spend more per pupil on education than the red states and, you know, maybe that's one of their values.",
        "And I also think that, you know, it's--you know, let a hundred flowers bloom.",
        "The red states should be free to, you know, pursue their own experiments.",
        "Well, I think that, as some of the other speakers have said, because they don't really have very much of a choice.",
        "I actually--I'm not sure that states' rights is necessarily a principle position for liberals any more than it's been a principle position for anyone.",
        "I think as, you know, some of the other people have said, it's a question of power, and liberals have no power.",
        "They have essentially no say in how their country's being run right now.",
        "If they want to do anything in the next four years except kind of play defense and watch as the New Deal and the Great Society are kind of dismantled, they're going to have to do it on the state level.",
        "You know, as I pointed out, if you look at the institution of marriage, it seems to be under greater threat in the Bible Belt states.",
        "They have a much higher divorce rate than the country as a whole.",
        "And if you look at Massachusetts, lo and behold, it has the lowest divorce rate in the country.",
        "So the institution of marriage seems more in peril in the Bible Belt states than it does in Massachusetts.",
        "So maybe Massachusetts feels a little freer to do some progressive experimentation and to allow gay marriage.",
        "And the Bible Belt states, they would say, 'Whoa, we better protect the institution of marriage, so let's ban gay marriage.",
        "I don't know if it'll work but maybe it's worth a shot for them."

        "And I think it's--to push it even further, by putting the money back into the hands of the state, people can decide--as opposed to move to Canada or Costa Rica or wherever else they want to flee to, they can actually just avoid the sort of politics that they don't believe in by moving to California or Utah.",
        "And I think that if the Democrats really want to push an agenda that's going to be popular, massive tax cuts at the federal level, putting the federal government, you know, back to being in charge of defense and a few other issues--put the money back in the hands of New Yorkers and Californians and then when people in, you know, Wyoming figure out they can't pay for their own state, they'll start raising taxes.",
