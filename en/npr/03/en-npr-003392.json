        "Yes.",
        "I want to weigh in as a conservative, as someone who still advocates the principle of states' rights, which to me, more than anything, is a matter of adhering to the principles of the Constitution restricting the powers of the national government, which I think remain a very important principle.",
        "I also think that the idea of the state functioning as laboratory to experiment with different approaches to addressing our problems is a very worthwhile feature of what generally comes under the rubric of states' rights.",
        "I'm sorry, come again on that last thought, Steve?",
        "Well, I was just saying that the concept of the states taking different approaches rather than having a uniform national approach to various issues enables them to function as laboratories to determine...",
        "Oh, I see.",
        "...what's better and what doesn't work.",
        "I see.",
        "And frankly, my belief is that conservative approaches do work better to address our social problems than liberal approaches.",
        "But if there was an issue on which you did not necessarily agree on the issue but if it was a states' right issue, you would say, 'Go ahead.'",
        "Well, up to a point.",

        "Yeah, but if it was approved in a referendum or by the state legislatures?",
        "That would be a different matter.",
        "So, Jim Holt, there are people like Steve who hold to the idea of states' rights as a matter of principle, am I right, Steve?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's good, and I like his point about the states functioning as laboratories, and you get more empirical evidence on how good certain policies work.",
        "But I would disagree with him when he says that--or I would quibble, perhaps, with his believe that the conservative policies always work best.",
        "I think an interesting case is criminal law and the severity of the punishments for different crimes and the use of the death penalty.",
        "This varies widely from state to state.",
        "I used to be quite--I used to live in the state of Maine, and I was quite proud when I would go to Europe and Europeans would say, 'Oh, you Americans are so barbarous.",
        "You have the death penalty.",
        "And I said, 'Look, I'm from Maine.",

        "I was quite proud of that.",
        "That's a rather silly point, but the interesting point is, if you look at the states that have reinstituted the death penalty since the Supreme Court said that was OK back in 1976, they have, as a whole, a higher murder rate than the states that don't have it.",
        "Now you can say that, you know--correlation doesn't imply causation.",
        "OK.",
        "But if you also look at states in the 1980s that put in place very severe mandatory sentences for crimes, especially for drug crimes, and you compare them to the states that did not take that more punitive approach, the drop in crime is the same in each case.",
        "So what that seems to mean is this experiment shows that simply piling everyone into lockup and executing prisoners for capital crimes doesn't do any good in deterring criminals.",
        "It doesn't bring down the crime rate.",
        "So this is one thing we can learn from federalist experiments, and I think that's a good thing.",
        "I'm all in favor of empirical evidence, and if the evidence, you know, shows that a conservative policy works better, I'll buy it.",
        "And, Steve, we'll accept the idea that you may have drawn a different conclusion from the same pieces of evidence, but--and leave it there.",
        "And thank you for your phone call.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Like if you're an African-American living in the South, you might not be so crazy about the concept of states' rights.",

        "Well, Jim Holt, Colin raises the exact point.",
        "I mean, doesn't embrace of states' rights in New York leave people like Colin out in the cold?",
        "Well, that's a good point, but, you know, the truth is what else can we do at this point?",
        "I mean, the Democrats don't have, really, any power in Washington for the time being.",
        "They can't--you know, about the best they can do in the Senate is filibuster.",
        "And so a lot of senators from states--New Jersey Senator Jon Corzine, for example, is talking about--or is considering, apparently, running for governor and leaving the Senate, because there's just not that much to do in the Senate at the moment.",
        "Now the--so I don't think that--if there's an increased emphasis on trying to, you know, pursue a more liberal vision of a just state within the states where liberals have some power, I don't really see how that hurts states like Oklahoma.",
        "If the liberal experiments are successful, Oklahoma would be able to observe that and perhaps put, you know, the best parts of those policies in place in those states.",
        "So I don't--you know, it doesn't seem to me a zero-sum game, exactly, and I really do think that there's really not that much else that liberals can do at the moment.",
        "Well, can I just come in and make a proposal of my own?",
        "Sure.",
        "What I think we need nationally is more of a return to a sort of populist ethic, where we find ways to work, you know, as a party--and this is me speaking as a Democrat--working as a party to talk to people who don't, you know, have as much as other people--the disadvantaged and, you know, people who are trying to, you know, just make a living.",
        "And I'm--the--like, in Oklahoma, FDR is practically a saint, and the national party seems to have just sort of turned away from all of these voters out here who would vote Democratic if people were talking to them.",
        "And it just--I feel like turning inward more towards the coast is not going to help Democrats win elections in the future.",
        "And that's--I guess that's all I have to say.",
