        "Now you've also written about the states' rights issue and said liberals who threatened to secede after the election were indulging in escapist fantasy.",
        "Why should they embrace states' rights instead?",
        "Thank you, Ari.",
        "Although at the same time, I would say that I think that there has been a kind of psychological shift among many liberals due to the kind of profound alienation that so many feel from the rest of the country.",
        "There's always been this sense among progressives that they have to--a kind of admirable sense, I think, that it's up to them to save the entire nation, to look out for the poor and oppressed in states where the majority might want to tyrannize them.",
        "I mean, you know, I think all of us are glad that Martin Luther King didn't embrace states' rights and that, you know, the Freedom Riders, you know, weren't willing to kind of let the South do their own thing.",
        "But right now, there's such a feeling that these states have almost declared war on our values, and by that I mean blue-state values, and actually act as if blue states don't have any values at all but are just these kind of sinister, decadent cosmopolitans.",
        "But if we want to kind of preserve anything of what we love about this country, we can only do it around our own homes.",

        "This is Michael, who is with us from Salt Lake City.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi, Michael.",
        "I find it very interesting that, as the nation turns toward a more conservative view, liberals want to leave, want to secede.",
        "I remember not too long ago that when the nation was taking a more liberal position, the conservatives weren't screaming and saying that they were going to move, to leave the country.",
        "They worked quietly within the system to change things toward their point of view.",
        "Michelle?",
        "Well, I think we all know that at one point the conservatives did, indeed, try to secede, and that kind of secession as mythology has been very much alive.",
        "I mean, you're still having battles over the Confederate flag.",
        "I think that--first of all, I don't think that the secession battle--that the secession talk is necessarily serious, and I should also say that liberals don't want to leave their states; they want to retain their states.",
        "I think that many of them feel that the country is becoming a place that they don't recognize.",
        "It's becoming--it's not that it's, you know, veering slightly more to the right or slightly more to the left and that--it's becoming a fundamentally different kind of America than has ever been before, than is kind of--is increasingly, you know, going away from any of the values that they ever thought, that we ever thought to associate with our country.",
        "And--but actually, I think that in certain ways states' rights are a way to do exactly what the conservatives did do after Barry Goldwater's defeat, when they really started organizing at the local level and took over the school boards and took over the town councils and kind of worked from the bottom up, so that now they have a huge base in huge parts of the country.",
        "I think liberals need to do much the same thing.",
        "Michael, do you find it similarly ironic when you see conservatives now in power in Washington saying, 'States' rights, states' schmights'?",
        "Well, I actually support states' rights, strangely enough, as a conservative.",
        "I believe that there needs to be a balance.",
        "I believe that we ride the balance between the liberals and the conservatives, between federal power and states' rights.",
        "And that's how we find the middle of the road, and I think that's what makes democracy work is that we have those two opposing views.",
        "OK, Michael.",
        "Thanks very much for the call."

        "Yes.",
        "Thanks for the interesting show.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "I'm calling because I am concerned that there's been too much of an advocacy for Democrats to retreat into kind of a posture of just focusing on their states.",
        "I mean, it's hugely important that Democrats continue to try to also change things at the federal level, because that affects so many people's lives.",
        "For instance, Jim Holt was talking about the issue of taxation, and I think it's hugely important that Democrats continue to work to get a more progressive federal income tax and to use those resources on education and health care, and that this talk of states' rights is OK; I mean, there are some interesting points--for instance, on the issue of gay marriage.",
        "But we shouldn't just focus on the states.",
        "We should continue to try to change, also, at the federal level, because it affects so many people's well-being.",
        "Michelle, this is the fundamental conundrum, isn't it?",
        "In a remote spot on the Oregon coast this week, a group of people gathered for a kind of revival.",
        "Members of the Archangel Ancient Tree Archive planted clones of two- and three-thousand-year-old redwood and sequoia trees.",
        "The cuttings were gathered from giants that had been logged back in the late 1800's.",
        "David Milarch, who heads the project, joins us on the phone from Port Orford, Oregon.",
        "Thanks very much for being with us.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It is, and I really sympathize with what the caller's saying, although I think we have to accept that at least for the next two years we can do nothing.",
        "We can, at the most, kind of use the filibuster strategically to head off some of the most kind of egregious initiatives of the right, but a more progressive income tax or kind of more, you know, kind of economic, you know, policies that are more economically just--you know, as much as I would like to think that there was a forum for progressives to work toward that at the national level, we are wholly unrepresented in any of the centers of power.",
        "And so I think that the question isn't do you kind of give up on economic justice nationally, forever, as much as--you can only kind of bash your head against a brick wall so much, I think, before you're really going to turn people off politics entirely.",
        "If you want to give these activists, who are so kind of amazingly energetic by the 2004 election--if you want to keep them in politics, you have to give them, I think, something to work for that they could actually achieve.",
        "You know, you have to give people some avenue in which to improve their own lives.",

        "Hm.",
        "David?",
        "Well, I see Ms. Goldberg's point, but I think there--it's important, though, even if, let's say, Democrats can't make, over the next, say, two to four years, the kinds of changes that we would like to see, we should still try, I mean, in the sense of get our points out there, stand up for them and give reasons for why our ideas are better.",
        "Even if it doesn't result in concrete policy changes over the next four years, at least it might help us avoid things moving in a much less progressive direction, and maybe it also will help us build momentum for the future and turn more people into being Democrats, you know?",

        "One of his vertebrae slid over another, she said, pinching the spinal cord at a 90-degree angle.",
        "She said this would have impaired the use of Gray's arms and legs and his muscles used for breathing.",
        "Without medical help, she said, Gray slowly suffocated.",
        "But how did the injury happen?",
        "Allan rejected the defense suggestion that Gray could have hurt himself.",

        "She likened the impact to a diving accident in shallow water.",
        "Allan told jurors she thinks this happened between the van's second stop, when witnesses said Gray was shaking the van, and its fourth stop.",
        "That's when Officer William Porter checked on Gray and had a key exchange with him.",
        "Porter told investigators that Gray asked for help, said he couldn't breathe, and when Porter asked if he wanted a medic, said yes.",
        "Gray also said he couldn't move, and Porter helped pull him up onto a bench.",
        "Medical examiner Allan says all this is consistent with the injuries she found at Gray's autopsy.",
        "A neurosurgeon brought in as a prosecution witness agreed, and both said Gray's condition likely worsened as he continued to ride in the van.",

        "In fact, officers say they only saw Gray lying face down.",

        "He said Officer Porter told the driver they needed to take Gray to the hospital.",
        "What if the driver had listened and done that, Murtha asked.",
