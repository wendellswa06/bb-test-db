        "So, I was with my son Jake, and Jake goes, well, look, dad.",
        "Look over here on the other side.",
        "And he found some shoots that were green and they were attached to the roots and some of the base of the 35-foot-diameter stump.",
        "And he goes why don't we try these?",
        "And that's exactly how it was birthed.",
        "So, you planted these cuttings and what'll happen?",
        "Well, number one, we were astounding that something over 2,000 years old decided to put roots on itself and live again.",
        "So, after the jubilation - and there was real jubilation at Archangel - we came up with the grand idea of using these trees that were lost to the world and planting them in old growth forest groves.",
        "And I'm happy to say that we're well on our way of attaining that goal.",
        "As I understand, old growth forest, it won't look like much of anything for a few hundred years.",
        "Well, that's not true.",
        "What most people don't understand about coast redwoods and giant sequoias is that they're probably the second-fastest-growing tree on earth that I know of, only second only to the eucalyptus.",
        "And they will grow 10 feet a year, and that is a lot of stored carbon in a very short period of time.",
        "Groves of those or forests of those will really make a measurable dent in the CO2 imbalance in our atmosphere.",
        "Why are they planted in Port Orford?",
        "Well, it's an ideal place because it's rainier with lots of fog, which these trees need here, than almost anywhere on the Pacific Coast.",
        "It's ideal.",
        "Mr.",
        "Milarch, what brought you into this Archangel Ancient Tree Archive?",
        "Well, we've been in the shade tree business in northern Michigan for several generations.",
        "And 20 years ago, our trees that we were growing for the cities and nurseries started to die and we didn't know why.",
        "Well, after a couple of years and a lot of research, we found out it was due in large part to the decline in air quality.",
        "So, we were trying to find an answer of trees that could be stronger, hardier, could take the increase in temperature as well as the increase in toxins in the air.",
        "And it just kind of popped forward one day while we were all pruning - we said, well, why don't we try and clone the largest, oldest trees when they have a better chance of be stronger.",
        "And it was just birthed out in the field one day."

        "But we're building these old growth forests to be a model for the world that, number one, it can be done.",
        "But I think it's important that people understand that the reason we're doing this too is the archive, for the first time in the history of the world, the world's greatest trees genetics, so they can be studied and utilized long, long into the future.",

        "My question is, why don't we increase taxes when we wage a war?",
        "For instance, Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "Surely, if national interest is at stake, then we should be willing to pay the price rather than add to the deficit.",
        "Well, really good question.",
        "A lot of people have asked that and advocated for extra taxes, as we have done in conflicts going all the way back to the War of 1812.",
        "Also, in the Civil War and the war in Vietnam, there were tax increases to pay for those conflicts.",
        "But we haven't been doing that in the last few conflicts, especially in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "As you recall, Scott, in Afghanistan, President Bush actually lowered taxes.",
        "And President Obama continued that tradition as - lower taxes, he said, in order to give people more money to fight the recession.",
        "I think the general response has been that it would be a bad idea to raise taxes because of the economic difficulties that we've been experiencing, all the way back to when the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began.",
        "But a lot of people still support this idea.",
        "However, Congress has decided not to do that."

        "Governor Romney actually has not given us specifics on how he would raise money to finance the military spending he envisions.",
        "There's some disagreement about exactly how much that extra military spending would cost - anywhere from 1 trillion to $2 trillion beyond what the Obama administration would ask for defense.",
        "But Governor Romney says his plans would usher in a stronger economy, that would help pay for the military spending; and that military spending is the most important obligation for government.",

        "Well, in terms of the defense cuts, if you're talking about the sequestration threat, then the Obama administration have said that they are exempting the VA from those cuts.",
        "So if you're his caregiver, those benefits you're getting, shouldn't change.",
