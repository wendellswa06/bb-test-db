        "Well, you date that back, I guess, to a figure from your childhood, a wrestler by the name of the Iron Sheik, and this goes back, I guess, to 1979 and the hostage crisis with Iran is, I guess, when he became popular and eventually won the championship belt.",
        "And let's listen to a short excerpt from your film.",
        "In terms of fixing the VA's problems more generally, both candidates favor a computerized data system.",
        "It's hard to believe, maybe, but the VA and the Pentagon are only now getting around to using a common electronic record for each soldier.",
        "And it's going to take, probably, until 2017 to fully implement that system.",
        "And in the meantime, vets are still complaining that it takes months - or sometimes, years - to get their needs addressed, if they appeal a VA decision.",
        "They've also added to their own workload, at the VA, because they took on nearly a million extra cases when they presumed that Agent Orange, Gulf War Syndrome and PTSD are all service-related.",
        "Finally, Quil, we have a question here, from a 29-year-old veteran named John-Ryan Dobbs.",
        "He says he's been out of the military for three years, now, but has had a hard time finding work.",
        "And he writes, quote, \"\"Most of the time, I feel that my military experience is a negative thing, and sways employers away from hiring me.",
        "I'm just curious what either one\"\" - meaning either presidential candidate - \"\"will do to help veterans actually get jobs.",
        "Well, both candidates have pushed the idea of getting military credentials translated into civilian credentials.",
        "So if you drove a truck in Iraq or Afghanistan, you should be able to convert that easily into a commercial truck driver's license back here.",
        "Likewise, if you were a mechanic or worked on high-tech communications, or you were a medic, all those should be - easily translate into corresponding licenses back home.",
        "There are some studies - and I've heard lots of anecdotes - that suggest some employers feel there's some sort of stigma for Iraq and Afghanistan vets; that they're afraid that those soldiers might have PTSD, and so they're reluctant to hire them.",
        "And in fact, the numbers that came out September say that for post-9/11 soldiers - Iraq and Afghanistan soldiers - their unemployment rate is about 2 percentage points worse than non-veterans.",
        "The Romney campaign says that they'll keep more veterans employed by maintaining a bigger military; basically, keeping them in the service.",
        "And the Obama administration has pushed jobs bills while in office, and they have been blaming Republicans in Congress for not passing the last veterans' jobs bill, which was killed by a procedural move.",
        "Of course, both parties are blaming the other party, for playing politics with that bill.",

        "Right, he was pulling the auto-Prometheus.",
        "Put that in a playbook, I like it.",
        "Because John Elway is exactly the prototype that you're talking about, the pocket passer, the guy who had a cannon for an arm, who knew how to read a defense, who knew how to do all those things that Tim Tebow didn't.",
        "But Tim Tebow was winning.",
        "So in his role as GM of the Denver Broncos, Elway would see that and be happy that his team was having success, and yet he has this internal barometer of right and wrong for quarterbacks, and what Tim Tebow was doing was all wrong.",
        "You could see that he didn't know how to deal with it.",
        "He didn't know how to deal with the fans saying we want Tebow, and when Tebow had this string of successful games, he was wondering: Am I going to be handcuffed into future seasons of Tebowism?",
        "Which I'm sure Elway said, we got very lucky this year, we did some good things, he has some assets, but we mostly got lucky, and I would not like my professional life linked to Tim Tebow."

        "Yeah, that fits in with Tebow's myth.",
        "And then if you really want to talk about - wow, I think there's probably something to be written about - I think it's Matthew 21:12, where Jesus goes into the temple and upends the money-lenders and throws them out of the temple.",
        "That's Tim Tebow going to the Jets locker room, a locker room that was very dysfunctional; where Santonio Holmes, the disaffected wide receiver, hated his quarterback Mark Sanchez; where Rex Ryan and all his bluster and profanity, you know, causes a cauldron of dissent and people sniping at each other.",
