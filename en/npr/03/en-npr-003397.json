        "But I wanted to ask you, Chris Bell, the idea that, well, first of all, those matches might just have been scripted, and also the revelation that Hulk Hogan, who said, say your prayers and go to bed early and eat your greens, work hard, play by the rules.",
        "Well, that he turned out to have taken steroids.",
        "Yeah, you know, that's the question I ask in the film is when you have all these heroes that are larger than life, and we expect so much of them, we put these guys on a pedestal constantly, say that guy's a winner and he'll do anything to win, and then at some point we find out that they took steroids, to me as a kid, that was quite disappointing.",

        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "You know, he's the governor of California and I would hope that, you know, Arnold would have something to say about this issue.",
        "He's the one guy I think in you know, all of government that could actually step forward and do something to help this matter, but instead, you know, hides behind the fact that hey, look my position on steroids is very clear.",
        "I don't need an interview with you and you know we tried several times to get that interview and weren't able to do it.",
        "So I wish that he would step forward because I think that there's a lot of kids that are struggling with this issue and especially in California."

        "Interesting though, one of your brothers, and again, both are, I said before, unapologetic and that's not quite right because there's some apology involved, but nevertheless one of them is a football coach, at least in one scene in the movie, and does not admit to his kids that he takes steroids, that he thinks they're a good thing.",
        "In fact, he tells them he doesn't take steroids and neither should they.",
        "Yeah, you know that's a conflict of the film and that's why I said that I think it's - we present everything because otherwise, you know, I could have kept that out of the film, but I think that that was very interesting, the complexities of my brother coaching football and telling kids that you know, hey, you should stay off the steroids, but he's doing them.",
        "And you know, there are reasons that he says that he said that in the mid - in the film.",
        "He actually has gone back and told a lot of those kids on a one-to-one basis that he does it as an adult.",
        "But it is really hard to explain to kids the difference between an adult doing something and a kid doing it.",
        "And the other thing, you know, that I said about my brother in the film is he was actually at the time when he was doing steroids, he was doing them illegally, and I think that's the biggest problem with all this.",
        "We've driven this behavior underground and we have all these guys doing it illegally and we don't really know much about it and we need to explore it more.",
        "And your other brother makes toward the end of the film one last attempt as lifter to get - was it 700 pounds?",
        "Yeah.",
        "705 pounds.",
        "And he says to his wife, this will be the last time I take steroids and will get it up, and he does triumph in getting over 700 pounds.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's, you know, it's interesting to see somebody can push their bodies to that level and that's a part of the film I wanted to explore as well, as I, you know, we look at an athlete and we say you like, look, Barry Bonds has hit 756 homeruns because he was on steroids and it's not necessarily the case.",
        "You know, you still have to have a lot of athletic ability, and steroids allow you to train harder and so these guys are training harder, training longer and that goes to you know, also to the question of if these drugs actually allow athletes to extend their careers.",
        "You know, they're not allowed to take them for rehabilitation purposes, they're not allowed to take them if they get injured.",
        "And they are some of the best drugs for that so - and that's been shown in a lot of the research that we did, three years of research, to find that these things could actually be used in a safe you know, safe manner for treating athletes.",
        "Yet, you know, they're not allowed to treat their on-the-job injuries with anabolic steroids, but they can inject corteco steroids they can take, you know...",
        "A doctor can inject corteco steroids.",
        "Well, absolutely."
