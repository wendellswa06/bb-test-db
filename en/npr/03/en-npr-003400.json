        "There are others, though, who say this is the kind of thing unrestricted travel and remittances were intended to accomplish.",

        "A lot of the energy was sucked out of the room just over the course of time when Judith Miller had to go to jail first and foremost, because it was very clear that what had started out as a Moby Dick tale, where you could tell the prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald was really going after some seriously big fish, it just got whittled down to, you know, one of those weekend bass fishing tournaments.",
        "And now here we have the Scooter Libby trial, where it's not even talking about obstructing justice or being part of an information campaign.",

        "And if Fitzgerald's act - Fitzgerald definitely has his work cut out for him.",
        "But he has shown to be very thorough in the past."

        "And actually, Fitzgerald filed a motion that he didn't want Armitage even brought up in the case anymore because this is no longer about Valerie Plame, as you mentioned earlier.",
