        "But it's also going to be one more little bit of, you know, raw meat that America is going to see and they're going to think, you know what, all these people inside the Beltway, they're so chummy with each other, they're just rubbing elbows at cocktail parties.",
        "And it'll probably just, you know, lead America just to continue to think what they think of us inside the Beltway."

        "But this battle over the nature of the position, John Elway was offended, it seemed - aesthetically offended - that the position was not being played the way he thought it ought to be played.",
        "Yeah, and there's maybe something to that.",
        "I will say this: There are - there is the type of pocket passer, the passer who drops back and throws for yards.",
        "And this type of passer is absolutely ascendant in the NFL, mostly because of - the players themselves are great, the offenses are great, but there have been so many rule changes that allow the quarterbacks to flourish.",
        "And if you look at the top five passing seasons in NFL history, in terms of yards thrown - I mean, there have only been five seasons where a quarterback has thrown for over 5,000 yards - three of them were this year.",
        "So that tells you that the rules have changed, as well as the quarterbacks have changed.",
        "But at the same time, Michael Vick and Cam Newton are perhaps two better examples than Tim Tebow, of the mobile quarterback, of a quarterback who could hurt you with his arm but also hurt you with his legs.",
        "And I think one of the things about Tim Tebow is there is a role for the mobile quarterback, it will challenge offensive coordinators and the traditional NFL purists, but a smart person should be able to incorporate that into the game.",
        "It's just that Tim Tebow was really - and is really such a poor standard-bearer for the running quarterback - because his arm, compared to Newton and compared to Vick an compared to the Heisman trophy winner who's coming in, RG3, Robert Griffin III - it just is totally inadequate, Tim Tebow's arm is.",
        "So that's maybe one of the reasons why John Elway just couldn't take it when Tim Tebow dropped back to pass and couldn't complete a 12 yard out, one of the most fundamental passes in the NFL."

        "Michael Vick is a little more fragile, and he often does get hurt.",
        "And Cam Newton has only played one year.",
        "But he had an excellent rookie-of-the-year type year, and he's a bigger guy.",
        "I don't know what RG3 is going to be, he's kind of skinny, but he can throw a little.",

        "I think, though, one model for successful quarterbacking, and not the only model, is Ben Roethlisberger, who is a big guy who could run.",
        "But how he uses his running ability is not to tear downfield - sometimes he does that - but he uses his feet to avoid the sack.",
        "So he continues to establish himself as a thrower.",
        "He'll run around in the backfield, because he has a really porous offensive line, and then he'll use his arm primarily to hurt you.",

        "Except in the fourth quarter in overtime, I think you're right.",
        "So the issue with Tebow has never been as it was with Michael Vick and dating all the way back to Randall Cunningham, whether it's better to have a quarterback who you can always find in the same place, namely five to seven yards back in the pocket.",
        "Because I think we've seen with Vick, and now Cam Newton, that having a threat with your legs - and Aaron Rogers, frankly, as well, really improves your football team."

        "The problem with Tebow and the reason Elway doesn't like him is because whether it's on the run or in the pocket, he doesn't hit his receivers.",

        "But Avi makes a point, Mike Pesca.",
        "In the past, this conversation has acquired a lot of attitudes of race about it.",
        "Well, yeah, that's true, and even though people will always say are we talking about a running quarterback versus a pocket passer, and people will always bring up the exception - oh, it's not about race, they might say, Fran Tarkington was a scrambler, who's a white quarterback, and Tim Tebow, now, for all his throwing inadequacies, is a white quarterback.",
        "But of course - of course race comes into it, and a lot of depends upon the systems that these quarterbacks were brought up in.",
        "And a lot of the time, the big colleges used to have white quarterbacks playing for them, and they would be the pocket passers, and the scramblers were often more the black quarterbacks.",
        "But that is definitely changing.",
        "I don't think right now, among NFL personnel types, there is racism or racism that would redound in someone making huge blunders or not giving good quarterbacks an opportunity.",
        "I think among fans, I think in the casual conversation, there is often an undercurrent of the racial dynamic, and I definitely think that some quarterbacks get criticized as not being leaders, and sometimes that's a proxy for race.",
        "But you did see that with Cam Newton.",
        "There was a lot said about his personality, his character.",
        "Maybe you shouldn't draft him because he was a poor character.",
        "So on the one hand, you could say yeah, because his dad accepted money for him to play at Auburn, that might lead you to think he has poor character.",
        "But on the other hand, you could say that that was his dad and not him.",
        "But now as we're looking at Robert Griffin III, he's - no one has ever criticized his character.",
        "It's one of the assets of drafting him.",
        "So if it was pure racism, I would think that there would be more red flags made about him, and we're not really seeing any.",

        "But in any case...",
        "And he's more a pocket passer, and Griffin is more of a rusher, but Griffin's really a pocket passer.",
