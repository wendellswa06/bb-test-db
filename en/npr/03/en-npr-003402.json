        "Hello.",
        "Here's an email from Steven(ph) in San Leandro, California: I don't deny that today's NFL quarterbacks have amazing talents.",
        "I've wondered, though, just how good they'd be if they were not programmed by their electronically wired coaches.",
        "With few exceptions, all the plays in the NFL are called by the coaches.",
        "no wired-up coaches, no voices helmets, just 11 players versus 11 players, a game played on the field.",
        "How does your guest think today's NFL quarterbacks would fare if they were not programmed by the coaches and the plays sent in from the sidelines?",
        "Well, it used to be hand signals or flags or whatever, but yeah, the first time - old-time quarterbacks will say is, yeah, it was different in my day, when we called the plays ourselves.",
        "Yeah, but who stands in direct opposition to this?",
        "Peyton Manning.",
        "There's been no quarterback who's had more freedom than Peyton Manning.",
        "Sure, he's given a game plan, but he goes to the line of scrimmage, and he shouts audibles that seem like some weird stream of consciousness, not even worthy of James Joyce.",
        "He'll shout, you know, Louisville, chocolate, ice cream, \"\"Soul Train.\"\" What does that mean?",
        "No one knows.",
        "But the offense will change according to what he's saying and on every play.",
        "Sometimes he'll just fake calling those signals.",
        "Sometimes he'll reposition his running backs or his wide receivers.",
        "So it seems that he's not an automaton at all.",
        "It seems that he has autonomy, and a lot of these other quarterbacks, the great ones do that, too.",
        "They're not as programmed as the fact that, you know, we see them with the helmets, and we see the offensive coaches with their Motorola headphones.",
        "They're not as programmed as that would exist.",
        "And by the way, even though Motorola has the contract for the sideline technology, they don't actually use Motorola technology, I found out.",
        "Oh really?",
        "That's interesting.",
        "Yeah, they just - they have the contract to wear a headphone, and they're using something else.",
        "That's Mike Pesca, who's NPR sports correspondent.",
        "In a minute, Joe Theismann, the world champion quarterback, formerly of the Washington Redskins, will join us, as well, as we discuss the evolution of the quarterback.",
        "We should note also, that Tim Tebow, who were talking about earlier, traded today by the Denver Broncos to the New York Jets for I think a sixth - and seventh-round pick and a bag of balls.",

        "Several of the NFL's up-and-coming quarterbacks share a link in George Whitfield Jr., a private QB coach.",
        "He's worked with Ben Roethlisberger, Cam Newton and now trains Stanford's Andrew Luck.",
        "Several players who demonstrate the evolution of the pro quarterback.",
        "In an interview with the New York Times, Whitfield cautioned that while Peyton Manning and Tom Brady may not have the same physical abilities, the difference they both share is mechanics, fundamentals and organized mindset approach.",
        "The guys who can sustain long careers and healthy careers are the guys who can operate on the chessboard.",
        "But will faster, more athletic, more powerful players put that chessboard in three dimensions and push aside the pocket passers of old?",

        "Joining us now is former Super Bowl champion, Joe Thiesmann spent 12 years with the Washington Redskins, and he led the Redskins to a victory over the Miami Dolphins back in Super Bowl XVII.",
        "He joins us from his office in Sterling, Virginia, where he's an analyst for the NFL Network.",
        "And Joe Theismann, nice to have you with us today.",
        "Thank you, Neal, it's great to be with you.",
        "And this debate over the prototypical quarterback over the challenge of more younger, more athletic, this is endless, isn't it?",
        "It is, and there really isn't a prototypical quarterback anymore.",
        "I think what you're seeing more and more are coaches taking the ability of the young man who plays the position and then adapting to him.",
        "And, you know, I think in the case of Cam Newton - I was listening to Mike a little bit earlier - but in the case of Cam Newton, because he struggled at the combine and didn't throw the ball that effectively, that was a lot of the evaluation that was made about Cam's ability to throw the football, very similar to what we see with Tim Tebow and what he went through last year being a 46-percent passer.",
        "But they both bring something unique and different to the position.",
        "Some of us that have played in more of a traditional sense - and you mentioned Tom Brady and Peyton Manning - guys that aren't as mobile, they really had to get it done with their arms, and offenses were designed that way.",
        "Now what you're finding is that there is a lot more of the incorporation of them using their athletic skills, but the fear still remains - and the commitment you want to make to a quarterback is eight, 10 years - the fear remains with someone like Cam or someone like Tim, or possibly even someone with Robert Griffin Jr. coming in, who has all the tangibles and intangibles that people are looking for, is: What about the durability factor?"

        "That is the question that looms with someone that decides to take off and run the football as much as they do.",
        "There isn't anybody that knows more about one hit taking you out of the game than I do.",
        "We - Joe Theismann refers to a notorious hit by Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants, who - which ended his career.",
        "That's right, and it's - so, you know, there is that susceptibility when you're a more mobile quarterback that you could wind up taking that one shot that takes the best-laid plans of an entire organization and, sort of, puts them on the shelf.",
        "And that's really one of the questions that looms, I think, for Peyton Manning, going forward.",
        "As I remember, Joe, you were standing in the pocket when you got hit by Lawrence Taylor.",
        "I was, I was, but, you know, on top of that - and Michael Vick is a very mobile guy who got beat up in the pocket.",
        "So there really is no safe place.",
        "A lot of times you think you're safer when you do run out of the pocket, but our profession happens to be one of vulnerability.",
        "You can get it anywhere in our game.",
        "Hi, quickly.",
        "I was curious, though, there seemed to be almost a sigh of relief from some people - and I heard a quote from Brian Urlacher, the middle linebacker with the Chicago Bears, yesterday - a sigh of relief that the Tebow experiment seems to be over.",
        "He's being traded to the New York Jets, where he will be, I guess, a backup and run a specialty offense called the Wildcat, where he will be more a runner, probably, than a passer - and just from time to time.",
        "He won't be the starting QB.",
        "This offense against the old idea of the quarterback, well, that its time has run its course.",
        "It does.",
        "It goes contrary to it.",
        "But again, it's - we're in a different age, and I think you can't be Neanderthal about what has taken place.",
        "Football is a very gladiator-type game.",
        "You know, you've got your gladiators dressed in uniform doing battle and combat in these coliseums, but the fact of the matter is it is a very sophisticated game.",
        "And I was listening to you guys talk about the headset communications and everything that goes on.",
        "For coaches, it's good with young players, and then once you get an older veteran who's been successful, it becomes less and less important.",
        "And I just don't see where this is going to be a success."

        "The difference that Tim Tebow brings to, quote-unquote, \"\"the Wildcat,\"\" which was basically taking someone who was a runner and putting them back at the quarterback position because defenses do not design defenses to stop quarterbacks.",
        "They're designed to stop everybody else, but not the quarterback.",
        "An so if you had a running back at the quarterback position, you really didn't have someone assigned to him.",
        "In the case of Tim Tebow, he brings a uniqueness because he does have the ability to throw a football, where the Ricky Williams's and the Brad Smiths were guys that really, you couldn't say they threw the football that well.",
        "Tim has to develop the ability to throw the football.",
        "If I'm Mark Sanchez, even though I signed a new contract, I'm not thrilled, because you're talking about specialty packages that take me off the field.",

        "Do you want to take Peyton Manning off the field?",
        "Do you want to take Drew Brees off the field, because you think you can get five or six or eight plays out of a certain type of a formation?",
        "I think it disrupts the rhythm of a quarterback.",
        "And Mark Sanchez is the incumbent and fair to say, Mike Pesca, embattled quarterback of the New York Jets.",
        "And this was the same situation that came up last year, when Tim Tebow was on the bench, and you had fans in the stands chanting we want Tebow.",
        "Well, Tim is - Tim became - he's like Jeremy Lee(ph), just as an - Jeremy Lin with the New York Knicks.",
        "It's the flare for the dramatic that we deal with in society today.",
        "In Tim's case, he was counted out.",
        "You know, he couldn't throw the football.",
        "He couldn't win.",
        "Well, he still can't throw the football effectively, but he found a way to win - but not just win, but win in a dramatic fashion that captured the fancy of the world, not just us in American football.",
        "But he became a phenom around the world because of week after week after week he would do something incredible, and then you get to the playoffs against the highly vaunted Pittsburgh Steelers, and he wins that game in overtime with a pass.",
        "But through the course of - can someone go through the course of time and be effective - not for seven games, not for a year, not for two years - but can you play the position in an effective manner and not be able to throw the football?",
        "And I believe the answer to that is no.",
        "And I would say, an add-on to what Joe was saying.",
        "When you spoke earlier of Brian Urlacher maybe being offended, the sensibility being offended, I think there is a little bit of a rift between the football rationalists and the magical thinkers, in that the people who know the game would watch Tim Tebow and say sure, just like Joe was saying, there's great flare for the dramatic at the end, but watch what he does every down, watch how fundamentally deficient he is.",
        "It would bother them.",
        "And perhaps the magical thinkers would say, it doesn't matter if the guy just wins.",
        "And when you say the guy just wins, it drives NFL personnel people or draft evaluators or really studied football fans, it drives them up a wall.",
        "The other side to that argument is: Why do we watch sports except for the magic, except for the things that upend expectations?",
        "And that's one of the things that makes Tim Tebow a guy you can't keep your eyes off of.",
        "And probably it is annoying to Mark Sanchez, and I would just say about him, that he - the deal for Mark Sanchez is he needs to become the kind of guy where you say we can't take him off the field.",
        "Then he will know he will have succeeded.",
        "A couple years ago when the Jets had Brad Smith on their team, and they ran the option a lot, those few plays would actually help the Jets offense.",
        "And without that little wrinkle, the Jets offense wasn't nearly as good last year."
