        "Also an email we have from Anne(ph) in Birmingham: Cam Newton's father was not accused of recruiting violations with Auburn.",
        "It was another school - I think Mississippi State.",
        "Auburn was not involved and was cleared after extensive investigations.",
        "The state of Alabama gets enough bad press without blunders we didn't do.",

        "For the value - Tim Tebow wasn't very - one of the highest paid quarterbacks at all, but the value that he gave the Broncos institution - I mean, it was kind of a no-brainer to keep him.",
        "I think the only reason that John Elway got rid of him at all is because he completely offended him, not just fundamentally on the field with his mechanics, but the Tebowmania, the secular - his secular sensibilities.",
        "Believe it or not, out West, out here, there's a lot of secular people, and they were not very appreciative of bringing this religious aspect into the game.",
        "And I think that that really distracted from football, and that really was the reason why John Elway, pretty much, made his decision.",
        "It was the fan base, like the hardcore Broncos, were really, really appalled at the fact that here's a guy, you know, proselytizing here on - in their city, and they just didn't like it.",
        "Mike, I think, to some degree, that died down through the course of the season.",
        "And one of the things that many people said was that Tim Tebow, because of his charisma, was a guaranteed popular person with the fans and sold a lot of tickets.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I - what the caller is saying may be right.",
        "I just have never seen it, you know, quote, \"\"out of Elway's mouth\"\" or someone reporting off the record that he had a problem specifically with his religiosity.",
        "You could substitute the religiosity with anything else that would make this guy a rock star, and a GM doesn't like to be in the position of having, you know, a popular insurrection forcing his hand, especially in a way that he doesn't like.",
        "And though Tim Tebow's popularity - let's not discount the fact that the Jets signed him because they thought he'd be a capable backup who could make a couple of plays on offense every game.",
        "Sure, they definitely did.",
        "But don't forget the fact that they also signed him because Jets season tickets are still on sale, and Woody Johnson, the owner of the Jets, knows that he has to sell and pay off this new stadium.",
        "And I don't think - I think it's too cynical, and some of the hosts on local New York sports radio have been saying all this is about is getting the back page of those tabloids.",
        "All this is about is jealousy against the Giants and selling tickets as a Jet.",
        "I don't think that's true.",
        "But I think that if you're going to take a guy who does help the team a little bit, why not take the guy who can help the team a little bit and sell tickets a lot?",
        "And I think that factored into the decision."

        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for taking my call, Neal.",
        "I think a lot of what's going on with the quarterback position, the position is real - still very much playing catch-up to the Lawrence Taylor phenomenon of the early '80s.",
        "Before Lawrence Taylor, I think football teams at the youth level, on all the way up through high school, their best athletes, their best players always went for the offensive side of the ball.",
        "Lawrence Taylor came along, and, all of a sudden, he changed the dynamic.",
        "He threw 180 into it.",
        "Suddenly, teams could be competitive by putting their best players on the defensive side of the ball.",
        "And I think we're living in an age where we're seeing the deficiency in athleticism come from, you know, from the offensive side where you don't have the great number of fantastic breakaway running backs like you used to.",
        "In today's NFL, you know, it's like having a shutdown cornerback, like a Darrelle Revis, where - that's a luxury not all teams have.",
        "So the upper - the one percent of the NFL, those teams are going to have a Tom Brady.",
        "They're going to have, you know, the Drew Breeses and the great quarterbacks.",
        "But for the other teams, they've got to make do with somebody, and players like a Tim Tebow are going to fit that bill.",
        "They're going to come in, have a niche.",
        "They're going to have a moment.",
        "They're going to have some wrinkle at certain seasons or certain parts of the seasons that defensive coordinators are going to have to try to adjust to.",

        "I can't let Mike Pesca go.",
        "We can't have a conversation about the NFL today without talking about the other big story of the day, and that is really serious fines handed out to the coaches and general manager at the NFL - at the New Orleans Saints for Bountygate.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The Saints had a program where players would pool money and be paid by other players for big hits.",
        "And in the playoffs, injuries were rewarded.",
        "And if a player - an opponent - was injured and couldn't come back to the game, that got an extra bonus.",
        "So it's not unheard of for players to have bounties or little bits of money for big hits.",
        "Rewarding for injury seems to be unprecedented.",
        "But the big thing that this was different from everything that's gone on in the past or what has been reported, is that the coaching staff of the Saints knew about this, perhaps even oversaw the program.",
        "So Gregg Williams, the defensive coordinator of the Saints, who is, you know, a guy who takes pride in the fact that his defenses play nasty, that you remember the defenses because they put hard licks on you, he was either overseeing or at least countenancing this program.",
        "Now, the NFL came down, as you say, really hard on the Saints - their administrators, Mickey Loomis, the GM, suspended for half a year, Sean Payton, the coach, suspended for a year.",
        "Gregg Williams, who left the Saints after the season and before the story broke and latched on with the Rams, he is suspended indefinitely.",
        "It was - people thought that maybe Williams would be suspended and perhaps indefinitely.",
        "I think the punishment against Sean Payton is surprising in its severity, but it shows how seriously the NFL took this.",
        "And the team itself was fined $500,000 and lost a couple of draft picks.",
        "That's going to be pretty serious too.",
        "And how do you lose your coach for a full season?",
        "We'll have to see what the Saints do now.",
        "Seemed to me we spent about 40 minutes last time looking at that replay in a hockey game to see whether that was a goal or not."

        "Now, that is a few games during the season.",
        "Drew Brees, as a quarterback, knows his system, so they'll probably be able to get by.",
        "I don't think that the league was intent on making the Saints product on the field that much worse, but they had to issue these big suspensions, from their point of view, simply because, well, it's a horrible sportsmanship.",
        "But also, they face a lot of lawsuits.",
        "And people are suing the NFL for head injuries.",

        "Six more years, that is what is being given to him by the party, six more years of leadership.",
        "What's the significance of that mandate for him?",
        "The significance is that ZANU-PF as a party has never really stood up to him, and he himself in a way is not his own man either.",
        "Zimbabwe never demobilized after the war against the Rhodesians.",
        "The Zimbabwe Army is massively in control of the country.",
