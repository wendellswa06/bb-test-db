        "Soraya, what about the Russia troops that are massed along the Russian border with Ukraine?",
        "I mean any talk of them being required to pull back?",
        "No.",
        "It was a surprising omission from this agreement.",
        "And also, there was also no mention of Moscow and Kiev engaging in further talks, which was another thing that the U.S.",
        "and Europeans were demanding.",
        "Nor was there any mention of Crimea which, of course, is a big sticking point.",
        "I mean the Russians have annexed this peninsula and Ukraine, backed by the West, claimed it still belongs to them.",
        "Russia, on the other hand, appeared to give up its demand that Ukraine become a loose federation in which Russian-speaking regions would have autonomy.",
        "So there was a lot of compromise all the way around, as noted by these omissions.",
        "Any the reaction to this yet in Eastern Ukraine where there's been this unrest?",
        "The pro-Russian separatists are very suspicious of this deal.",
        "Some of the leaders have said absolutely no way are we going to do this unless other conditions are met.",
        "For example, protesters in Kiev, who've been in Maidan or Independent Square there for many months and, of course, that's also what sparked the ouster of the former government, they want to see these guys go first before they leave.",
        "Some of them are even saying the new Kiev government should leave, that's what this deal actually means.",
        "And then others are saying no, we can't go until there's a referendum, such as the one that happened in Crimea, which ultimately led to its being annexed by Russia.",
        "So it doesn't appear the protesters will be leaving any time soon.",
        "But the clock is ticking, as Secretary of State John Kerry told reporters in Geneva.",
        "I made clear to Foreign Minister Lavrov today that if we're not able to see progress on the immediate efforts, then we will have no choice but to impose further costs on Russia.",
        "And that deadline, if it passes, what are the costs that Kerry is referring to there?",
        "More than likely he's talking about sanctions.",
        "I mean he didn't specify, but that's clearly what the Europeans and what the United States have been talking about.",
        "The problem is it's not going to be the kind of sweeping sanctions that the U.S.",
        "would like to see that would really target the energy or financial sector in Russia.",
        "It's more likely to be travel bans, if you, will on oligarchs and people within President Putin's inner circle, as well as freezing their assets in foreign countries.",
        "Soraya, help us get a sense for what this deal might mean.",
        "I mean the United States and Russia, they, it sounds like they seem to be trying to find common ground, but they also seem very far apart when you listen to what their leaders are saying.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean very deep divisions over the cause of this crisis remain.",
        "And it was interesting yesterday that President Putin took to the airwaves just as these talks were going on and made it pretty clear that he reserves the right to send Russian troops across the border if things don't get resolved there to his satisfaction."

        "On the one hand, it's understandable that Turkey or President Erdogan would make that statement because Turkey has been fighting the PKK for about 33 years.",

        "And that is a Kurdish separatist group that is the parent organization of the group in Syria that the United States is funding.",
