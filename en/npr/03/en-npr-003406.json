        "What changed is that we intermediate much more of this information through these technologies.",
        "So that is very exciting.",
        "But how do you actually make, get the number that you arrived at, 295 exabytes?",
        "Yeah, so basically you take the number of devices that are out there.",
        "Then you look at the informational performance of each of the devices.",
        "And then you multiply it.",
        "With that you get the hardware performance.",
        "Now, after that, you have to standardize it.",
        "You have to normalize it on compression rates.",
        "That is basically because information is a very slippery thing to measure.",
        "Think about like if you have a Word document, for example, and you save it on your hard disk.",
        "It might be 100 kilobytes.",
        "And then you compress it with a zip file, and it's only 50 kilobytes.",
        "So how much information is in that, 100 or 50?",
        "So you have to normalize it on the compression rate on the uttermost compression rate.",
        "Like, you zip it and zip it and zip it, and what is left there is then real information, and the rest was just redundant data.",
        "the number of devices, the hardware performance and then the normalization of compression rates.",
        "So if you have an e-book, and you have a paperback book, do you count just one of them, or do you count both of them?",
        "We count both of them.",
        "So - be - (unintelligible) information.",
        "So we estimate the technological capacity.",
        "And how long do you think all of this is going to be stored?",
        "Forever?",
        "I mean, now that something is now digitized, will it last forever and just fill things up until there's no more room?",
        "Well, all technologies have a certain shelf life, a certain utility life.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Well because, like, these numbers are very big, when you say 295 exabytes.",
        "That's what we store.",

        "Also, in historical terms, if you look at it.",
        "So if you take all this information, put it into books, that's more than 80 times the historic -famous, historic Library of Alexandria per person on planet Earth.",
        "That means everybody has 80 times more information right now available.",
        "So that's a huge - these are huge numbers and huge progresses.",
        "But if you compare it, for example, to what the human DNA is storing, the human DNA of one single person in all the 60 trillion cells that you have can store around 300 times more information.",
        "Wow.",

        "So we have a lot of these technologies bring us a lot more information, but then we come up with clever, artificial ways to filter through this information.",

        "That means the (unintelligible) all one single human brain.",
        "They are as much as all the instructions as all computers can make.",
