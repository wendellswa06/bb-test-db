        "No, I don't.",
        "Can you tell us why.",
        "Well, it's going to work, if the bill gets passed that he wants, it's going to work in the sense that a lot more people are going to have health insurance, but the basic problem with the health care system is not going to be resolved.",
        "In fact, it will probably get even worse.",
        "The basic problem is that we can't afford the rising costs of health care.",
        "It's breaking the bank.",
        "It's breaking in the private economy and in the public sector, and there's nothing in the bills that are winding their way through Congress that effectively controls health cost inflation.",
        "But you said if the president gets what he wants, it will work.",
        "What is not in those bills that he wants?",
        "Well no, I meant - no, I didn't mean that it would work.",
        "I think that what the president is asking for isn't enough.",
        "I see.",
        "What we have to have is a reform not only of health insurance, but of the health care delivery system, because that's where the basic problem lies.",
        "The delivery system is inefficient, expensive, wasteful, and it has the wrong incentives."

        "It's become a business, and as a business, it wants to constantly increase its sales, and until we change that, we're not going to have real health care reform.",
        "Will a federal, as the president talks about, a competitive option, would that work in bringing down the costs?",
        "No, I don't think it will.",
        "We have a federal health care plan now, a huge health care plan.",
        "It's called Medicare, and it takes care of everybody over the age of 65, and it does not control costs.",
        "In fact, it's going broke.",
        "The health care costs in the Medicare plan are rising almost as rapidly as health care costs elsewhere in the system.",
        "So a federal plan is not going to help unless and until we change the way we provide health care.",
        "What would you like to see?",
        "I would like to see a system that is based entirely on a not-for-profit organization.",
        "All-for-profit health care organizations should be replaced by not-for-profit organizations.",
        "Doctors should be working for a salary in private groups, multi-specialty groups, and they should be paid on a per capita basis from a central authority, a single-payer authority, which provides coverage for comprehensive care.",
        "The doctors are paid a salary for their time.",
        "They don't get paid on a piece-work, fee-for-service basis as they are now, and so they won't have incentives to over-provide care, and because it'll be not for profit and will be regulated, they won't have any incentives or opportunity or reason to under-provide care.",
        "They'll do what doctors should do, namely, take good care of patients.",
        "And that will bring - keep health care costs down?",
        "No question about it.",
        "There is a vast amount of evidence that has been accumulated over the years which shows that at least a third of what we now provide in health care doesn't do any good.",
        "It is not worth the money.",
        "It's unnecessary.",
        "It duplicates and spends money unnecessarily, and that would - and the reason there is that excess of expenditure is that there are incentives.",
        "The providers, the hospitals and the clinics and the diagnostic services and the doctors, are paid on a piece-work basis.",
        "The more they do, the more they get paid."

        "He and his family were all legal residents.",
        "He grew up, became a home health care worker, married and had a family.",
        "In 2007, during a routine traffic stop, police found a small amount of marijuana in the car, about enough to make two or three cigarettes.",
        "Moncrieffe, who had no prior record, was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute.",
        "That's a generic felony under Georgia law and allows for a wide range of sentences.",
        "His lawyer did not advise him that if he pled guilty, he could be deported, a requirement that the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court has since imposed.",
        "Ignorant of the immigration consequences, Moncrieffe accepted a plea deal under which he would avoid prison and have his conviction expunged after five years' probation.",
        "The federal government, however, first put him in immigration detention and then deported him to Jamaica, contending that under federal law, there was no discretion on the matter since Moncrieffe had been convicted of an aggravated felony.",
        "Today, the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court ruled that Moncrieffe's Georgia conviction was not, in fact, an aggravated felony under federal law.",
        "Writing for the seven-member majority, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that where the amount is small and there is no sale, the crime does not qualify as an aggravated felony.",
        "Rather, it's a low-level offense that's not a felony at all under federal law.",
        "The government's attempt to characterize such an offense as an aggravated felony, she said, defies the commonsense conception of these terms.",
        "Moncrieffe, the father of five American children, was close to tears upon learning of the court decision today."
