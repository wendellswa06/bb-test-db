        "Not only can serial layoffs be devastating in the moment, they can also mar a resume and raise red flags for potential employers.",

        "Al and Michelle Ford's great recession started about a year before the official one was declared.",
        "At the end of 2006, word came that the paint-supply company where they both worked was consolidating and reorganizing.",
        "Al had spent 14 years on the manufacturing side of the company, running a paint production line.",
        "Michelle had logged nine years managing customer-service workers.",
        "Within a month of each other, the Fords each got a pink slip.",

        "I thought the world was coming to an end.",
        "I mean, it was just like everything was pulled out from under.",
        "The Fords had been together 20 years and raised two kids.",
        "They now wondered if they'd be able to hold onto their three-bedroom house in St. Paul, and avoid draining their retirement savings.",
        "And though they can joke about it now, hunting for jobs was itself stressful.",
        "It even involved negotiating the use of one corner of their basement.",

        "Eventually, everybody comes back.",
        "And I think that's the one thing that has empowered these sports leagues to act the way they act - is that it has yet to be proven that a sports base hasn't eventually come back to the game.",
        "I think the crowds are going to be a little thin early, but I think by the end of the season, it's going to be business as usual.",
        "And let's turn to football and the nightmare of the dream team, the Philadelphia Eagles.",
        "Thirty-one to 14 loss to the Seattle Seahawks; the Eagles are now 4-and-8.",
        "What happened?",
        "Everything happened, and I think it's going to cost Andy Reid his job.",
        "And if it doesn't, maybe it should.",
        "I think you had a problem from day one with DeSean Jackson, the wide receiver who was a star player.",
        "He's an electric athlete.",
        "He's one of the few game-breakers in the NFL.",
        "And it seemed that everybody in the league - everybody on the Eagles got a contract extension, or a new contract, but him.",
        "And he pretty much pouted the whole season and wasn't the same player, and Michael Vick wasn't the same player.",
        "And I think there was a lot of hype that went into it as well, because they didn't even come into the season as the best team.",
        "That belonged to the Green Bay Packers.",
        "And I think when you have a whole lot of expectations, once you start to get into some negative momentum, they weren't really able to turn it around.",
        "I think one thing that happened with the coach, Andy Reid, as well, is that he clearly was not able to reach his players.",
        "And this season just spiraled with a couple of bad losses - when they lost to the 49ers.",
        "And I think that they just never were able to recover and unfortunately, may end up very well - cost the coach his job.",
        "Meanwhile, the Green Bay Packers continue to win.",
        "They won their last few games last season, culminating in the Super Bowl.",
        "And they are 11-and-0 so far this season.",
        "Doesn't it get harder to win from here on out, to have a perfect season?",
        "Sure, it does.",
        "And I think - and if anybody remembers 2007, when the Patriots went undefeated - the entire month of December was incredibly stressful for them because of the pressure not only to win, but the pressure to run the table and to be perfect.",
        "So the more games you win, the closer you get to perfection, the more you have to win the Super Bowl or the season is going to be a complete disappointment.",
        "I think what really matters is how a team responds to that.",
        "And I think the Packers right now are the kind of team that they're actually embracing this.",
        "They want to go undefeated.",
        "I don't think they're afraid of the moment.",
        "And I think that starts with the quarterback, and it starts with Charles Woodson, their cornerback.",
        "They are really cocky.",
        "They're really brash.",
        "They really want to make history.",
        "And I think that they've got all the talent to do it.",
        "But once again, these games get tougher and tougher and tougher.",
        "It's going to be really interesting to see what happens if they get down in a game, or if they get down in a playoff game - if the pressure begins to swallow them up the kind of way to Patriots back in 2008.",
