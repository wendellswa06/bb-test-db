        "The show is an attempt to portray an often-maligned and stereotyped group in all its diversity - not as characters, but as people.",
        "Joining us now is Eric Deggans.",
        "He's a TV and media critic for the St. Petersburg Times in Florida.",
        "Eric, welcome to the program.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "So let's dig in with the show's cast.",
        "It follows five families in Dearborn, Michigan.",
        "Who did they decide to follow for this program?",
        "Well, it was interesting.",
        "Producers seemed to find a range of people - all, you know, negotiating how devout they were as Muslims, and how much they wanted to assimilate into America.",
        "In particular, there's a family, the Amen family, where you have three daughters: one who always wears the hijab headscarf; you have another one who describes herself as kind of a redneck - she's kind of a wild child - she doesn't wear it; and then you have a third who stopped wearing it after 9/11, but then decided to put it back on when she was trying to conceive and having problems conceiving, because she's concerned that God may be punishing her.",
        "And there's an interesting scene where she - once she's decided she is going to start wearing the headscarf, she talks to her husband about taking down the photos in her house.",
        "They'd be finding dead people in the house - what, looking at pictures of me without my scarf and here I am, with a scarf, in front of them.",
        "Weird.",
        "So much of the show is about assimilation.",
        "Or, I say it's a little different than that.",
        "What it's really about is several couples trying to decide how much of their religion, how much of their culture they want to hold onto, and how much they want to assimilate into American culture, and really saying, you know, I can be very strongly connected to my heritage but I can also be American, and I should be accepted - which is not normally how America works.",
        "When most people think of cable reality TV - I mean, they're thinking of the Kardashians or frankly, any of the other shows on TLC about little people or big families or, you know - there's a little bit of a circus aspect to it.",
        "And is this really the right format to tackle issues like Islamophobia or racism or assimilation?",
        "Well, what's interesting is that we're used to reality TV shows that make fun of or exploit the stars.",
        "And clearly, I think that's something TLC avoided here, and that was a good move.",
        "They seem to be trying to tell these stories in a language that young viewers can understand - which is reality television.",
        "I've always said, reality TV is sort of the young viewers' version of a sitcom.",
        "So, they figured out a way to lighten up the ideas a little bit, and maybe deliver them to an audience that wouldn't normally be thinking about this stuff.",
        "But the problem with reality TV is that it's very manipulated and sometimes, you can't necessarily trust what you're seeing.",
        "For example, there was a scene where a couple goes to a restaurant, and they seem to be reacted to in a racist or prejudiced way.",
        "And..."

        "And finally, they get seated.",

        "Eric, I know for me, that was a sort of familiar feeling when I was watching that scene - where sometimes, you're second-guessing your environment if you're in a place you're not familiar with.",
        "And in this scene, this couple had left Dearborn.",
        "That's a state that we would expect to be competitive in, but we want to make sure that we get a candidate that, frankly, we don't have to worry about when it comes time to fight that general election contest.",
        "Indiana is a state where the GOP lost a Senate seat in 2012, nominating a candidate that political pros viewed as too conservative.",
        "Law argues that should not happen again.",
        "You have two congressmen - Todd Young and Marlin Stutzman of Indiana, and we're supporting Todd Young.",
        "Why?",
        "We think Todd Young is the kind of candidate who has experience in reaching a broad plurality of voters.",
        "He's got a very, very good track record on issues that Indianans care about.",

        "And Marlin Stutzman, I think, has been a less distinguished leader in the Congress.",
        "He comes from a very, very safe district.",
        "There's obviously nothing wrong with that, but it means that he is less talented at being able to appeal to a broader cross-section of voters when it comes to a general election.",
        "Oh, let's think about this.",
        "The guy you support comes from the 9th Congressional District, Southern Indiana.",
        "I think it has elected Democrats in the past, hasn't it?",
        "So this is a swing kind of district.",
        "It is.",
        "It's one that leans Republican, but, you know, he's had experience defeating the person who is the chosen Democratic candidate in this case, Baron Hill.",
        "He knows how to win those kinds of races.",
        "And even though Indiana is a lean-Republican state, the upstate - the more industrial part of the state - can make it tough sometimes for Republicans if you're not able to have a broad cross-section of appeal.",
        "So in our view, there's a pretty clear choice here.",
        "I can see some base Republican voter listening to you talking and saying, as people do sometimes say, well, you're going for the RINO - the Republican in name only - against a true conservative.",
        "What do you say to that?",
        "Well, I think Todd Young is every inch a conservative.",
        "I mean, he is a Hoosier conservative right down the line, supports traditional conservative Republican Party values on things like Obamacare and spending and regulation, and as well as national defense, where he's carved out, we think, a pretty impressive role already.",
        "When you get involved in a primary, is there a risk that you yourself become an issue for the guy you're supporting?",
        "His opponent can say, look, this guy's the establishment guy.",
        "He's got the establishment behind him.",
        "He's got all that Washington money.",
        "Well, I'm perfectly happy to be the issue.",
        "I don't think most people care about who I am or who the organization is.",
        "They're interested in the facts, hopefully that we're presenting accurately and in a compelling way.",
        "We think that's what ends up telling the story and what voters decide on in the end.",
        "This is an interesting challenge, though.",
        "I wonder if this has changed in recent years.",
        "In 2006, Republicans were in trouble.",
        "George W.",
        "Bush was unpopular.",
        "And Republican congressional leaders said, we're running local races.",
        "It's about local issues.",
        "That's all people really care about.",
        "And it turned out, no, they were hit by a national wave.",
        "In 2010, the same thing happened to Democrats.",
        "Is it harder in this environment to avoid that national conversation?"

        "You know, the answer is it depends.",

        "I don't think she's a wave candidate.",
        "I don't think she is going to be compelling enough vis-a-vis, you know, Donald Trump or whomever else to be able to generate that kind of weight.",
        "The truth of the matter is that voters don't really like either choice.",
        "What that suggests is you could see a lot of ticket splitting.",
        "You could see a lot of people hedging bets.",
        "You could see, for example, people finally voting to give Hillary Clinton the keys to the car, but voting for a Republican down-ticket to be the, you know - the driving instructor in the seat with the foot on the emergency brake because they're concerned about where she would take the country.",
        "How vital is it to you as a Republican that your party hold the Senate?",
        "We think it's absolutely critical for several reasons.",
        "One is, obviously, if we don't win the White House, it's the critical check on nominating power, especially for the Supreme Court, where we could see, for the first time since Richard Nixon, a liberal majority in the Supreme Court.",
        "That is a game-changing event in the future direction of our country, so that's very important.",
        "And then the other thing is, in 2014, we were a part - not the critical part, but a small part - of helping to elect one of the strongest classes of new Republican senators that we've seen, certainly, in my political career.",
        "And a lot of them are going to be the future political leaders on the Republican side.",
        "They're going to define not only what the Republican Party is, but who the Republican Party is.",
        "And from our perspective, it's really important that they be allowed to continue to be in leadership, to shine, to move the agenda so that down the road - five, 10, 15 years - you're going to see their names on gubernatorial ballots and even, ultimately, the presidential election line.",
