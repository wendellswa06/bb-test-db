        "And the overall scheme that was alleged was that these narcotics cops were beating and targeting drug dealers, stealing their money, and then fabricating police reports, kind of to cover up their crimes - confident in the belief that because, you know, they were cops, no one would take a drug dealer's word over theirs, if anyone came forward to speak out against them.",
        "And even selling the drugs themselves, right?",
        "Yeah, in one case mentioned in the indictment, one of the police officers is accused of setting up a deal with his nephew I believe, ripping drugs off from a drug dealer, turning around, selling it on the street and splitting up the proceeds with other officers on the force.",
        "Now, according to prosecutors, the activity was going on for at least six years.",
        "This is covering 2006 to 2012.",

        "As a reporter, do you buy that?",
        "To some degree yes, to some degree no. You know, I see his point.",
        "But at the same time, there clearly is a problem.",
        "I mean there's a culture where we've seen in a number of cases over the years dating back decades, of various squads of narcotics officers and other groups on the force just running into problems, whether they were raiding bodegas or whether they're ripping off drug dealers, as alleged in this indictment.",
