        "And, in fact, the group wasn't even on the State Department's list of terrorist organizations at the time.",

        "And allegedly she and other people went to door to door asking for money for al-Shabab.",
        "And she held these little mini fundraisers, a kind of teleconference in which she would speak for a while about how important it was to support the group and then ask for pledges that she'd later collect.",
        "And then she'd allegedly, you know, wire the money to al-Shabab in Somalia.",
        "And you have to understand that $8,500 from this community is a huge amount of money.",
        "A lot of the Somali community in Minneapolis is really living hand to mouth.",
        "And a lot of the people there are holding down two or three jobs just to make ends meet.",
        "Is it clear, Dina, how many people from these communities in fact went to fight in Somalia?",
        "It's a little unclear.",
        "I mean today the indictment listed 10 names and the number that we've heard is more than two dozen.",
        "And we know that at least six of the young men who left Minneapolis died in the fighting in Somalia and they aren't on the indictment.",
