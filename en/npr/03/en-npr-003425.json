        "So, there seems to have been a push to make sure that that information is suppressed, that they came out and strongly denied the allegation of rape.",
        "A doctor would have been perhaps the key witness to people who had been raped and perhaps, you know, transferred to his clinic.",
        "He - his emails that were sent out the day or two days before his death was very forward-looking, talking to his friends about meeting up soon.",

        "Yes.",
        "This week marked a very dramatic shift in the administration's strategy on this issue.",
        "And you could even say in general the Obama approach, you know, in large has been to try to get people under the tent and working together, including with the insurance industry, which the Clinton - which Bill and Hillary Clinton attacked head on 15 years ago."

        "I think the real problem is that it's a known factor of economics that the financial recovery precedes the real recovery of jobs across the country, which are expected to be in trouble for quite some time.",
        "The political problem is when you have large financial companies giving out the kinds of bonuses that they were doing two and three years ago just starting to occur again, it becomes difficult for the president to say this really is a change regime and the companies we bailed out with such a cost a year ago now are profiteering again.",
