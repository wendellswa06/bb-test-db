        "Well, indeed, the prime minister at the time, José María Aznar, in the first few days after the attacks, was squarely blaming ETA.",
        "And now, some people on the far right still suggest that ETA had some sort of role, but the investigations don't seem to point in that direction.",
        "What many commentators here are saying is that the attacks do have some sort of link to this, in that it created an even greater wave of revulsion against terrorism here in Spain, that ETA is now recoiling from using those methods.",
        "But I think what's interesting here is that, at the time, you had a very hard-lined government clamping down on ETA through every possible means.",

        "And in that statute, the government agreed to call Catalonia a nationality.",
        "This is something the Basques have wanted for a long time.",
        "They also want a new statute that gives them even more self-rule than the considerable self-rule they have now.",

        "They even have their own president.",
        "And finally, the reaction among the people of Spain?",
        "Well, in Spain, there's a mixture of euphoria and skepticism or mistrust.",
        "A lot of people have been waiting for years, if not decades to hear this news.",
