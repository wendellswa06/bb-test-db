        "Well, we ended up having 4,367 teams, and in order to be the first, of course, you had to be smart and mobilize thousands of people to work for you to look for balloons, but another strategy would be to use misinformation, to spread false pictures and even hoist decoy balloons in order to throw your competitors off the track.",
