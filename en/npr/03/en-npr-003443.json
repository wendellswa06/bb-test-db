        "But it's funny, I think about previous campaigns, where, you know, maybe Joe Biden, as a VP, appealed to a particular demographic group that Barack Obama didn't appeal to or Sarah Palin animated a part of the base that John McCain didn't.",
        "In this campaign, I don't see Pence or Kaine playing that role in any significant way for either side.",

        "How Pence deals with all the various Trump statements and whether he just counters with the Benghazi and all the other stuff.",
        "And then the part - the shoe we're all sort of waiting for to drop in the campaign - I doubt Pence would get into it but what Trump keeps mentioning is going after Bill Clinton's scandals.",
        "And that's the next step of this ugliness.",
        "And so it'll be interesting if the debate sort of wanders off in that territory.",

        "And as soon as it happened, dozens of lawmakers who voted for the bill immediately expressed buyer's remorse.",

        "Politics.",
        "So, you know, they - they passed this vote, which was nominally in favor of the 9/11 families, and who could want to vote against the 9/11 families in an election year?",

        "But I think, at some deep level, there was a level of conscience in there.",
