        "The African-American communities are growing and thriving, but there are those disparities that exist in our community, which separates us based on assets, opportunity, and personal motivation.",
        "We have to somehow begin to bridge those gaps and have an opportunity to do that.",
        "Tell me what you mean by personal motivation, because some, you know, African-American social scientists have said, well, you know, sometimes black people give up on progress because they haven't seen it.",

        "On the one hand, we do see and I think we really do need to celebrate the levels of improvement.",

        "Let me just ask you why do you think that is?",
        "Is there - I mean you're talking about 40-plus years, then is it that racism remains the persistent problem, is it that government doesn't know how to address these problems, government doesn't want to, individuals don't know how to keep their communities together.",
        "You know, I know that no one really wants to point the finger, but to the extent that we can get to some root causes, what do you think they are?",

        "If we look at something like those families that have an adult that's college educated with a bachelor's degree, once we look at that parity and opportunity the income gap we can virtually close.",
        "Once we look at how other opportunity structures where achievement is relatively equal, then also the income gaps have closed.",
        "So in many ways it really goes back to providing the social investment and a structure of opportunity.",
        "And then it's up to communities and families and individuals to make the most that they can out of those particular opportunities.",

        "We invited in NPR Juan Williams, and Sister Souljah and Mayor Shirley Franklin from the city of Atlanta to be with us to begin talking about these issues from a very high-level viewpoint, nationally and statewide; and then to begin to build an agenda at the grassroots level where people and communities can begin starting to help ourselves to bridge these gaps.",
