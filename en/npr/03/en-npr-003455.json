        "For all the perceived fear, Coleman says, the Dubai would find it very difficult to sneak any terrorists, weapons, or any other bad things past all those feds, if it wanted to.",
        "Stephen Flynn is a former Coast Guard commander, who now studies port security for the Council on Foreign Relations.",
        "There's a lot to be worried about.",
        "But this particular purchase of terminal operations inside the United States by Dubai Ports, I would not place at the top of my list of concerns.",
        "Flynn points out that Dubai is a close United States ally.",
        "Dubai Ports World manages terminal operations all over the globe, and there are far more real fears.",
        "What people should be most worried about is that when containers are stopped at the point of origin, when they're loaded up with cargo, it can be in some very scary neighborhoods.",
        "The container coming in to, say, New Jersey today, might have been loaded in an unsecure port in a dangerous part of the Middle East or Asia.",
        "It might have then traded hands a dozen or more times before making its way here.",
        "And the main security feature, the one thing that ensures the container holds what its shipper it holds, is a tiny plastic seal that costs a dollar, and is easily tampered with.",
        "Again, Stephen Flynn."
