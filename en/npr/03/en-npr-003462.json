        "So again, a familiar three-word phrase in 10 letters in which every letter in the phrase is found inside its corresponding ordinal.",

        "Joe Watkins, does this mean that there's any chance that Hayden might not be confirmed?",
        "I think Michael Hayden will be confirmed.",
        "We do live in a post-9/11 world where we have this task before us to catch the terrorists before they get us.",
        "This is not a war where the enemy is wearing a certain kind of uniform, or coming from one country, or are easily identified.",

        "But, one, does Michael Hayden get confirmed even though he didn't tell people on Capital Hill about this program - and two, even if he is confirmed, is this a problem going down the line for the Bush administration?",
        "I think Mr. Hayden is going to have a tough time on camera and off camera.",

        "Basically, unless we had ties to the terrorists, don't worry.",
        "Now we're learning that perhaps this program was more expansive.",
        "And once again, it raises the question of legality.",

        "Otherwise, they are violating their constitutional responsibility to provide oversight of the federal government.",
        "Congress cannot continue to hide behind the shadows while the Bush administration takes away more and more of our rights.",
        "Right.",
        "That's under the guise of national security and fighting terrorism.",
        "And one last question for you, Joe Watkins.",
        "In fact, the numbers -the President's numbers among conservatives - are going down.",
