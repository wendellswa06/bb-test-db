        "And, of course, they said just that.",

        "And if you think about how girls and boys are raised - girls to be communal, boys to be agentic - it makes sense that two women parenting together, being that they both have this kind of lifelong social pressure to really always be thinking about other people, would get along the best during parenting.",
        "They're the most likely to be thinking about each other's needs more often than not.",

        "So I think if couples really sit down and say, you know, this is how it's going to go if we're not careful, they can be careful.",
        "And the couples I talked to who were doing this most successfully really made parity a team effort and a goal.",
        "So then they could sit down when either of them felt overburdened and say, hey, this mutual goal we set, I'm feeling like we're not meeting it.",

        "He also happened to be Swedish, which she said helped.",
        "But, you know, really kind of staying on top of it seemed to be the most important thing for couples.",
        "And so what do you think the takeaway is?",
        "What needs to happen?",
        "I think the takeaway is more awareness.",
        "One of the problems is that we have this idea of the modern involved father.",
        "We all know that things have improved a lot since the 1950s.",
        "And it's really easy to focus on that rather than to know - and I think most people don't know because they don't look at statistics - that fathers' participation leveled off at 35% around the year 2000.",
        "So we go into parenting expecting something like parity.",
        "But it doesn't manifest.",
        "So our expectations are really not being met.",
        "And that leads to a lot of anger."
