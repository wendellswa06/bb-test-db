        "If - if they - if we're going to have some health reveal, to me - and if this is possible - it would be about Alzheimer's.",
        "If they have a heart attack or get sick in some real way, we'll deal with it.",
        "But Alzheimer's is a real thing, and it can affect you subtly.",
        "And that - if we can have some indication about that, that seems to be the most likely - the most important thing that we should know.",
        "I also wonder if there is a double standard when it comes to transparency.",
        "I was listening to our Politics podcast, and NPR's Asma Khalid was talking about how, when Republicans are asked about this, they want Clinton to be more transparent.",
        "And then Democrats, of course, want Trump to be more transparent.",
        "What's going on here, E J?",
        "Well, I think Clinton, after this week, has to flip the transparency script.",
        "She's the one who's put out over 30 years of tax returns.",
        "He hasn't put out anything and shows no signs of ever doing so.",
        "She has actually put out more detail on her health than he has.",
        "And so I think she's got to start arguing and asking the media to look at the fact that she, relatively speaking, has been quite forthcoming.",
        "And it's true that we ask more of presidential candidates on these matters than we used to.",
        "I think that's a reaction to how much candidates used to withhold in the past.",
        "And, although, I don't get really excited reading LDL numbers, myself.",
        "(Laughter) That's E J Dionne of The Washington Post and Brookings Institution and David Brooks of The New York Times.",
        "Thanks, both of you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Now to another big story of the day here in Washington.",
        "Social conservatives are gathering for the 2016 Values Voter Summit.",
        "Many conservative Christian leaders were slow to endorse Donald Trump or publicly struggled with the idea of Trump at the top of the GOP ticket.",
        "But social conservatives look to be rallying around the nominee and perhaps even more so against Hillary Clinton.",
        "NPR's Sarah McCammon has been traveling with the Trump campaign this week and covered him at the summit.",

        "Donald Trump addressed the summit Friday.",
        "And we'll get to his remarks a little later, but I want to begin with his running mate's comments today because Indiana Governor Mike Pence used his address to the Values Voters Summit to swing back at some controversial comments by Hillary Clinton.",
        "That's right.",
        "And Hillary Clinton is getting some flak for something.",
        "She's actually been saying something like this for a couple of weeks, talking about separating Trump voters into categories, into baskets - one of them being deplorables - what she describes as racists, homophobes, xenophobes, among other things.",
        "But last night at a fundraiser in New York City, she said half are in the basket called deplorables.",
        "She said that she regrets it, but the Trump campaign is jumping on it, sending out multiple statements and tweets about this.",
        "And here's what Mike Pence said.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "So let me just say from the bottom of my heart.",
        "Hillary, they are not a basket of anything.",
        "They are Americans, and they deserve your respect.",
        "(APPLAUSE)",
        "So, as you can hear, he got on a lot of applause for that line, and he linked that comment to a famous gaffe by President Obama when Obama was running in 2008, when he talked about small-town voters clinging to guns and religion.",
        "The Trump campaign is characterizing Clinton's comments as evidence of what they say is her disdain for average Americans.",
        "Mike Pence is a social conservative himself.",
        "His presence at the gathering, the Values Voters Summit makes perfect sense.",
        "How was Donald Trump received?",
        "Well, like you said, at the beginning a lot of religious conservatives struggled with Trump's tone, his multiple marriages and also his policies, like his past support for abortion rights.",
        "But now, you know, evangelicals are overwhelmingly Republican voting bloc, and Hillary Clinton is very unpopular with them.",
        "So there's been a lot of talk at this summit about how elections are choices, and many people here see Trump as the best choice.",
        "Peter Wypynszinski came to the summit from New Orleans, and here's how he put it to me.",
        "I think Trump is a clear and distinct alternative to Hillary Clinton, and while I don't necessarily line up philosophically with everything that he stands for, Hillary Clinton lines up philosophically with everything that I stand against."

        "So that's the kind of thing I've been hearing.",
        "In Trump's remarks Friday night, he criticized the Johnson Amendment.",
        "Now more than 60 years old, a provision of the tax code prohibiting tax exempt organizations like churches from getting too far into electoral politics.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "If they want to talk about Christianity, if they want to preach, if they want to talk about politics, they're unable to do so.",

        "Well, that might not be exactly right.",
        "They don't take a tremendous risk if they want to preach and talk about Christianity.",
        "But they do put their tax-exempt status in jeopardy if they campaign from the pulpit.",
        "Donald Trump wants to do away with the Johnson Amendment, doesn't he?",
        "Right.",
        "He wants to get rid of it altogether, and this is something he's been stressing for months in front of evangelical audiences.",
        "But, you know, it's not clear what it would mean to actually get rid of that.",
        "He'd have to get it through Congress, which might be a challenge.",
        "But the rule is actually rarely enforced.",
        "The IRS does occasionally enforce it and certainly has the power to enforce it.",
        "And it also - as you say - it doesn't prevent pastors from speaking from the pulpit or about issues, about morality and even from endorsing candidates as individuals.",
        "So it wouldn't change what pastors can do on their own time, though, it would give them more latitude to talk explicitly about politics and political candidates from the pulpit of their church.",
        "Well, probably start with childhood.",
        "I went to a Roman Catholic girls school in Seattle.",
        "We moved to New Jersey when I was in the middle of fifth grade and I left that convent school, a girls school, and my parents took us from the Roman Catholic Church into the Episcopal Church.",
        "Why did they leave?",
        "It was before Vatican II had had any impact in local parishes, and I think it had something to do with their search for a religious community, a faith community that would invite questioning rather than providing answers.",
        "So a whole set of shifts for me at that point.",
        "And in my adult life, probably in graduate school, I came back to the church.",
        "I hadn't gotten a lot of help wrestling with science and religion issues in high school and college.",
        "And took a class in graduate school looking at philosophy of science, and we read some of the great physicists of the 20th century, like Heisenberg and Bohr and Einstein.",
        "And for me that was permission almost to begin to see the mystery in what I was doing."

        "Science is about knowing and so is religion, but they're about different kinds of knowing.",
        "Science is about how things happen and what's out there.",
        "And religion is much more about the meaning behind what is and relationships between human beings and that beyond ourselves and between human beings themselves.",

        "I think the bigger picture, if one looks behind evolution, having to do with cosmology, is certainly a piece where I've grappled and found some wonderful coherence, if you will, between the way the Bible talks about creation and the way the Big Bang story goes.",

        "Why did they think you would make a good priest?",
        "I think it had probably something to do with my own journey, wrestling with those questions of science and religion, and inviting other people in the community to wrestle with questions.",
        "Well, now here you are.",
        "Much has been made of the fact that you're the first woman elected as presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church.",

        "Do you feel like now that you are in this position of leadership, that you're accepted in that role?",
        "Well, there are a handful of bishops in the Episcopal Church who don't believe in ordaining women and who have had some negative reaction to my election, but it's a very small percentage.",
        "There are times in human history when women's leadership has been celebrated and welcomed and other times when it's been shunned.",
        "And fortunately, I think we're moving toward a more open understanding in this season."
