        "One of the big issues that has divided members of your church is the idea of gay priests, and you have voted to consecrate a gay bishop, and that is a very controversial subject.",
        "Is that an issue that can be reconciled?",
        "Well, we're working hard at it at the moment.",
        "It's certainly not clear what the outcome's going to be immediately.",

        "It's a very easy way to neglect, to ignore the other suffering in the world.",
        "It's important, but it's not the centerpiece of what we're about.",
        "What other reforms do you hope to bring to the church under your leadership?",
        "I think my basic hope is that we remember that, as the archbishop of Canterbury in the '40s said, the church is the only institution that exists primarily for the benefit of those who are not its members, that our focus needs not to be so much on internal politics, but on serving the world, on helping to heal a world that's broken."

        "Once the pandemic virus got in, the planners say 100 million Americans could get sick, 10 million could need hospital care, as many as 2 million might die.",
        "It might not happen that way, but the administration has decided that it's prudent to plan for it.",

        "And that's because every community will be affected over a period of 6 to 18 months, not at the same time, but it's not going to be possible to fly to everybody's aid.",
        "At the White House we heard Frances Townsend say that it's possible to avoid chaos, but when the administration talks about civil disorder, what are they anticipating?",
        "That's really one of the most striking things about this document compared to previous things.",
        "It says that breakdowns in public order may result when people get really angry and frustrated about various shortages, shortages of medical care and other critical services.",
        "The report frankly acknowledges that there will be rationing, although the administration prefers to call it prioritization of care.",
