        "When was that?",
        "Nineteen twenty-three.",
        "So, a few years later, I met his granddaughter, Karen Hudson, when she was in the process of writing her first book on his work and I became fascinated with two things.",
        "First, the fact that a black man was doing this kind of work back then and how forward-looking a lot of the details in his homes were.",
        "He created grand houses for wealthy people, but they weren't stiff and formal.",
        "They took advantage of the climate and the sort of relaxed Southern California lifestyle.",
        "You can see some of those on our website.",
        "I'm looking at them right now, Karen, at NPR.org and they're lovely.",
        "There are a lot of windows, a lot of natural light coming in, really open to the environment.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He really believed in sort of trying to erase the line of demarcation between the outdoors and the indoors.",
        "And, Karen, you're going to tell us about a party that you went to for a new book on Paul Williams' celebrity clients.",
        "Yes.",
        "It's called \"\"Paul R.",
        "Williams: Classic Hollywood Style,\"\" also by his granddaughter, Karen Hudson.",
        "Let's eavesdrop on that book party.",
        "It's great to have you all here today, particularly to celebrate Karen and her book and her grandfather and a beautiful Southern California day.",
        "Before introducing author Karen Hudson, host Peter Mullin confesses to his garden full of well-healed guests that he was attracted to the house they're standing before without knowing much about its creator.",
        "Frankly, I didn't know anything about Paul Williams at the time, but I did love the architecture of this house and quickly learned about Paul Williams and what an extraordinary talent he was.",
        "All the more so because when Williams began his career, there were no black architects he could find as role models or mentors.",
        "Born in downtown Los Angeles in 1894, Williams became orphaned before he was four when both his parents died of tuberculosis.",
        "A family friend raised him and told him he was so bright, he could do anything he wanted."

        "He wanted to design homes for families, perhaps because he lost his own so early in life.",
        "His work has come to signify Southern California glamour to the rest of the country and the world.",
        "The bright, airy rooms and the oversized windows that, as he put it, bring the outdoors in are common now, but weren't when Williams began practicing in the early 1920s.",

        "Yes.",
        "The government claims that the evidence gathered by the United - presented by the United States were - was in breach of a the interception of communications act here.",
        "Apparently the Americans have wiretap information, telephone conversations.",
        "And that's what they said that was presented and breached his so-called constitutional rights.",
        "And that has been a point that the government has taken a lot of flak for here.",
        "I mean, social commentators, their political opponents, people in the media have all hauled the government over the coals for this.",
        "And basically what people were saying was if that was the case, then it's the matter for the court.",
        "I mean, an extradition and hearing is brought - is mandated by law unless the person waives their rights to a court hearing.",
        "And the court would decide whether there was in fact a breach of the law.",
        "But the government was very stubborn about it and we all knew why they - it's because of his connection to the ruling party.",
        "There is - his father died in a prison cell facing extradition and there was long suspicion that the quote-unquote \"\"accident\"\" in which he was killed was no accident, but that some people were afraid that he - if extradited to the United States would say some very damaging things about politicians in Jamaica.",
        "Yes.",
        "And that - I gather that that was his big fear as well, that he did not want to be held in a Jamaican prison.",
        "But a couple of people who know him very well have told us that he actually said that he would rather - we would rather be held by the Americans, but he didn't want to be captured by Jamaicans - by the Jamaican state.",

        "If that is true or not, I don't know.",
