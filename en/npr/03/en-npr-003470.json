        "What a lot of people, regardless of their party, are talking about is this is the end of Bruce Golding, current prime minister's political career, because of how badly the whole situation was botched at that level.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, I think it's going to be very difficult for him to bounce back from this.",
        "He's been politically wounded.",
        "The whole affair, starting from last August when he - when it became clear that he was resisting this extradition, and then the recent revelation that he sanctioned this approach through the U.S.",
        "law firm Manatt, Phelps & Phillips to lobby on behalf of the fellow - of Mr. Coke.",
        "Surprisingly, there are some people in the know who have told us that he's actually just taking the blame because he didn't -he got a lot of the information after the fact.",
        "Really and truly, that says quite a bit about his leadership, because if you have people inside your organization who are doing these things without clearing them with you first, it suggests that you don't have your hands firmly on the reins as you should.",
        "I think he's very, very wounded.",
        "I can't see the ruling party going back into an election with him as their leader.",
        "I think he's going to have to make some succession - some organization - some planning for succession and step down soon.",
        "Andrew, thanks very much for the call.",

        "Thank you.",

        "Tourism is what drives Jamaica's economy, and most of our visitors, at least 85 percent if not more, come to Jamaica from the United States.",
        "So that's one big factor.",
        "Another factor is that a significant number of Jamaicans now live in the United States, and that's where remittances come into play.",
        "The U.S.",
        "is also seen as a country to which, for instance, our dollar is pegged to the U.S.",

        "During the Democratic convention, from various speakers, there was a lot of talk of restoring America's relationship with other nations.",
        "During the Republican convention, it was more focused on the need for strong national security, and somewhat more unilateralist, as it has been with the Bush administration.",
        "Not that it was absolutely in lockstep, but there was more of a focus on the U.S.",
        "defending itself, including through, what's being called, you know, energy independence.",
        "How are you picking up on those messages from the two campaigns?",
        "Clearly, the Republican campaign, which we covered at the BBC throughout - I was up for that coverage throughout the night, they were - both Democratic, and the Republican.",
        "The Republican campaign came across to most people here, and I could tell you from the text messages that we had from listeners as well, as very jingoistic and, you know, at times almost unbelievable to a British audience that you could still, in 2008, run a campaign which is based very much on the background chanting of USA, USA, USA.",
        "For us that would seem unseemly.",
        "You know, we're very British, and we try to focus on our role in a global sense.",
        "It would seem very jingoistic to us, and for a Prime Minister to have that kind of background chant in Britain, I think that would be very difficult.",
        "It would be a turnoff.",
        "Having said that, I think what's happened now is that, from our point of view, that the race has become, and probably from American points of views as far as we can see it, has become about personality rather than issues, as such.",
        "I mean, Kathy there in Jamaica will know that there's been a plethora of reggae songs about Obama, but my favorite is one by Coco T, which simply just says, Obama, Obama, on and on.",
