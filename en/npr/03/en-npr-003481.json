        "To get on that ballot, he has to sign a loyalty pledge, which basically states that if you don't win, you have to pledge to support the nominee and not run third party.",
        "Now, with Trump, think about all the stuff that conventional wisdom said was going to be political suicide - the Megyn Kelly conflict, the comments about John McCain - but he's just getting more popular with the base.",

        "That's a 52-point turnaround, just unheard of, especially for someone as well-known as Trump is.",

        "You know, this phenomenon now has caused the pollster there, Ann Selzer, very renowned and respected in the state, to say that this is like 2008 all over again.",
        "In some ways, it is because Sanders is winning over first-time caucus goers, young voters.",
        "You know, but he's not Barack Obama.",
        "I mean, let's be honest about that.",

        "We've seen him try to tic off some other items off his bucket list or something that he says rhymes with his bucket list.",
        "But there's a big climate change conference coming up in December in Paris, and he really wants to secure a deal out of that, like he did with the Iran deal and some of his other executive actions to really put on the legacy belt for him."
