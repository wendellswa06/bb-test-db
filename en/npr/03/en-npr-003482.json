        "The goal is to make certain that taxpayers are never again on the hook because a firm is deemed too big to fail.",
        "It's that last item that's generated much of the recent controversy in the Senate, with some Republicans arguing that a $50 billion dismantling fund paid for by big banks would amount to a permanent taxpayer bailout.",
        "Mr. Obama echoed independent observers who take issue with that Republican claim.",

        "I gather from The Washington Post report and the interview we've done that though you would need to demonstrate that voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio were swayed by some of the information that came out that - for which Russian hackers may have been responsible through WikiLeaks, which is not the same thing.",
        "It's not, but what I'm saying is that the judgments which they have a constitutional right to exercise would consider these factors.",
        "And what we've - what we've said is we're going to help you to be able to exercise that judgment without the fear of what we think is unconstitutional state law interfering."
