        "And what the film--what my objective was to show how the politics between the United States and Puerto Rico affected the culture here in the United States, as well as the island.",
        "So from the time--so I go--actually, I go back 4,000 years.",
        "I begin the film 4,000 years ago and I show that we had a civilization of our own and then Spain came in and tried to commit genocide and then the United States came in and tried to save us from the Spain and did not so great things to the country as well.",
        "And it forced a lot of the Puerto Rican people to leave the island to look for a new life and new work.",
        "And that's where the Nuyoricans were born, because the majority of them went to New York.",
        "But yet, through all of that, through all the stress and strife, through all the ups and downs, we've maintained our culture.",
        "And I really wanted to make this film, not really for the masses.",
        "My initial intent was to make it for Puerto Rican people, because a lot of Puerto Rican Americans sometimes feel outside of the Puerto Rican experience because their parents didn't teach them Spanish, and then they get ridiculed from that.",
        "Some of them have never visited the island and, you know, and some people may call them a fake Puerto Rican.",
        "And I don't think that that's fair, because they still grew up on rice and beans.",
        "They still listen to salsa and merengue.",
        "You know, you may not be born in Puerto Rico, but Puerto Rican is definitely born in you.",
        "And from the screenings that--you know, just the test screenings that we've held, it's affecting everybody."
