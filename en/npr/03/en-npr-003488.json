        "Cranes are man-sized birds.",
        "Most of them are four to five feet tall.",
        "They're monogamous.",
        "Nothing they do is without grace.",
        "The common denominator in cranes is that they are long-legged, long-necked birds with very big voices.",
        "Their voice can be heard for several miles on a still morning.",
        "The Wisconsin environmentalist philosopher Aldo Leopold writing back in 1935 wrote so eloquently about cranes.",
        "And one of the sentences he wrote is: The silence discernible in some wetlands perhaps arises from their once having harbored cranes.",
        "Now they stand humbled adrift in history.",
        "When you see a marsh without cranes, it's very silent.",
        "When a crane is in a marsh, and they call, there's this great spirit that lifts up in that area and brings life and meaning to the whole place.",
        "What is the sound of the whopping crane?",
        "Woop.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Really, that's what it sounds like.",
        "It's woop-doop-doop, woop-doop-doop, woop-doop-doop.",
        "And the doop-doop is the female, and the woop is the male.",
        "That's their duet.",
        "Ah.",
        "And they also do this incredible mating dance, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "They throw sticks in the air, they jump high in the air, they run in circles, and they'll run side by side.",
        "Then they'll actually jump into the air, go for a distance, land and continue to circle and bow.",
        "And it must be quite exhausting."

        "I have visited the International Crane Foundation, and what you say about the stately graceful way these creatures walk really resonates.",
        "They all have this incredible, beautiful waltz of a walk.",
        "George, at the International Crane Foundation, you have, I believe it's an African grey-crowned crane with a big pouf on its head named Slidel.",
        "I believe this bird is from Kenya, a place where you've had some success at their restoration.",
        "Yes.",
        "They're from East Africa.",
        "We're very concerned about the beautiful cranes of Africa, particularly the crowned cranes.",
        "They're being captured illegally and sent to the estates of the wealthy in the Middle East and to safari parks in China and to animal dealers in Europe.",
        "We've had an 80 percent decline of the birds in east Africa, but we have had some successes too.",
        "We have wonderful people working out there.",
        "Maurice Wanjala has established a community group to protect the cranes and the wetlands, and another guy named Jimmy Muheebwa in Uganda has actually restored some wetlands that were drained, and the cranes have come back.",
        "Tell me about the cranes that live in the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.",
        "So if we look out at the world today, we're getting about 40 percent of our food from the 18 percent of cropland that gets irrigation.",
        "So it's very, very important to our food security even today.",
        "But if you look at what's happening on the ground, where we have irrigated agriculture going on, you see a couple things happening.",
        "In fact, she's surrendering to him because it seems important to her that he live and that he live knowing that she forgave him.",
        "So in a sense, the moments when - in the book where women choose to act, the acts are always of love, and thinking about it now, I wonder why that is, whether I, as a man, too, try to work out my own darkness in a sense.",
        "When you think about the loop of what we call reality and what we call fiction, clearly, you've been influenced by what's going on in the world today.",
        "Right.",
        "Do you have any hopes or fears that your fiction will then in turn influence the dialogue that we have in the world about issues like rape, issues like warfare, issues like child soldiers?",
        "I do live with a sincere hope that my own humanity is naked on the page and that the people who read my books are able to connect with their humanity and that things will become a little more complicated and decisions will become harder for another generation of people."

        "And what I began to notice after a while was that women were expected to make - work that deals with the domestic.",
        "And so women in these workshops who would write highly complex intellectuals, sometimes, inaccessible poetry, would have no one would have a way to read it.",
