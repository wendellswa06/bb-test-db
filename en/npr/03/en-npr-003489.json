        "It's not a fully sustainable project, though.",
        "Exactly.",
        "The - irrigation's been a cornerstone of human civilization, as you say, from the very beginning.",
        "You know, if you look at the earliest civilizations in ancient Mesopotamia between the Tigris and Euphrates, the Nile Valley, the Yellow River Valley in China, you know, these were the beginnings of human civilization exactly because irrigation freed up a number of people in that society to do other things than grow food, to develop mathematics and science and art and all kinds of things.",

        "I really believe that, you know?",
        "Because when you have a solid footing, it's hard for anyone to knock you down, you know?",
        "But also outside of the youth, it's also for the political world to recognize us and give us our respect 'cause in the documentary, you know, we had our own government that was a model for a lot of other governments throughout the Caribbean.",
        "And all that we had to fight for--a voice in Congress and the Senate --and so, you know, it's also for the politicians out there to say, yo, we're fantastic!",

        "They keep fluctuating as well.",
        "But there are some states that we can say right away that the Democrats are in trouble, and a lot of them have to do with retirements.",
