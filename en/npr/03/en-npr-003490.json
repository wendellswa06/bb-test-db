        "That it will reduce violence, the fact that police then can be involved in working on other crimes and that tax dollars can be raised - none of that really holds up under any scrutiny.",
        "In the case of medical marijuana, the Obama administration has told federal prosecutors not to go after dispensaries that are in compliance with local and state laws.",

        "Well, I think as resources become more scarce, there's going to be more competition for them, and money and who can afford to pay is actually going to be part of the issue.",
        "It will probably be the case that people in cities will be able to afford to pay more for water than farmers do, and we're already seeing now some of the water rights that exist in places like California for growing agricultural crops being sold to cities, because farmers make more money selling water than they do growing crops and selling it.",

        "That's...",

        "And it's interest, Sandra Postel, reading some of your work, I came across a concept - it may not be original to you - but that trade in crops, sending wheat or corn to a dry place like Saudi Arabia, is essentially trade in water.",
        "That's right.",
        "Grain is the currency by which we trade water around the world.",
        "It takes about 1,000 tons of water to make one ton of grain.",
        "So the reason a country like Egypt imports more than half of its grain is not because it's short of land.",
        "It's because it's short of water.",
        "So as it imports so much grain, it's actually importing 1,000 times that tonnage in water.",
        "So we call it virtual water.",
        "So you're trading - one of the ways we balance water budgets around the world is by trading grain.",
        "So - and that's not been such a big issue so far.",
        "We've been able to do that with the extra grain.",
        "The problem that we're beginning to see and get worried about is that you have very large countries that used to be self-sufficient in grain, notably China, with 1.3 billion people, India with 1.2 billion people, Pakistan with nearly 200 million people, now beginning to become so water-short that they can't be food self-sufficient anymore.",
        "And as they begin to look to the international grain market to buy more food, it's going to force prices up.",
        "And they'll be able to afford it, but what worries a lot of us is what that means for the people in South Asia and particularly sub-Saharan Africa that are hungry even today.",
        "And so that tension is going to worsen."
