        "Yet, Jason Clay, the situation 50 years ago, we were on the edge of that situation, yet technology in form of the green revolution, solved that problem - or so we thought.",
        "So we put together a package that included seeds and genetics, water, fertilizers and pesticides and really allowed us to grow agriculture faster in some places, so that we were able to take land out of production, to grow agriculture production faster than the population grew.",
        "But right now, we don't have any technologies available that actually are growing faster than the population is growing.",
        "And so - and it's not just population.",
        "It's consumption, too, how much we're consuming, how much animal protein we're consuming.",
        "If you take our technologies and add them all up, we could actually do this, but we're going to have to be very smart about it and we're going to have to start working on it very quickly.",
        "Forty years down the road, just for what some people think of as the peak of population, isn't that long.",
        "The peak of consumption, we don't even know when that's going to be.",
        "That could be 100 years or 200 years.",
        "Are we talking about genetic engineering, here?",
        "Well, we certainly can't take genetics off the table.",
        "But genetic engineering isn't GMOs, and we have to be very clear about that.",
        "We can do a lot by selecting traits.",
        "We can select traits and markers for productivity, for drought tolerance, disease resistance - actually, for nutrients, too.",
        "That would be a novel concept.",
        "We haven't done that too much yet, but I think we can begin to use 21st-century technology to do that.",
        "That takes time, though.",
        "GMOs can happen...",
        "Forty years is not long when it comes to genetics.",
        "But if we map the genomes of some of the basic crops around the planet, we can actually double or triple production within that genome.",
        "We don't have to be doing GMOs."

        "But one of the other issues that you didn't speak to, and you have talked about how in dry areas even rain builds up salts in soils, but how about fertilization?",
        "I've found that fertilization also builds up salt in the soil, and that's one of the big problems in the - you know, the salad basket of California.",

        "But if you're growing trees that have been there for, you know, 30 to 60 years, you know, and you want to change the irrigation system to drip, well, that might not be such a great idea.",
        "You know, yes, we can use 21st century technology to identify better ways to do stuff, but we need to support people like Wes Jackson(ph), who's a geneticist who's trying to develop, you know, a grain which is perennial.",
        "Well, good luck to you.",
        "We need to support people like Charles Fishman, who wrote \"\"The Big Thirst,\"\" and, you know, that's an eye-opener.",
        "And he posits that the reason we waste so much water in this United States is because we don't pay attention to it.",
        "It comes - you know, you turn on the tap, and it comes out.",
        "We flush more water down our toilet than, you know, Great Britain and Canada use, total, you know.",

        "A lot of farmers simply flood their fields or run water down the funnels between the furrows, the areas between the furrows.",
        "She was talking about drip irrigation.",
        "That's a relatively newer system and one that is much more - well, it saves a lot of water.",
        "It does.",
        "We're water-rich as a nation, but we're very water-stressed in the western part of the country, and that's where we have most of our irrigation happening.",
        "And you know, the silver lining in all this is that there's so much we can do.",
        "As the caller pointed out, there's a waste of water going on, but that's because we haven't really given farmers the incentives they need to really use the most modern and up-to-date technology.",
        "And we haven't provided that opportunity the way we can.",
        "So drip irrigation is just one example of - it's the most efficient way we know of to deliver water directly to plants.",
        "You're delivering the water directly to the roots of the plant in the amounts of water that the plant needs and not, you know, just spreading the water on the field where it's subject to evaporation and running off and adding to the pollution that Gloria talked about.",
        "And so I think that's one technology that's underused.",
        "In this country we've got about seven, eight percent of - or about seven or eight percent of our irrigated land under drip irrigation.",
        "Countries like Israel, Jordan that are growing more fruits and vegetables, up over half.",
        "So there's a lot that we can do to improve that efficiency.",
        "But again, farmers are good businesspeople.",
        "You know, they're making decisions as to how to use their water, what crops to grow, based on the incentives and the prices that - just like any good business person would - the incentives that confront them.",
        "So there really are challenges to how do we change the incentives to promote, you know, the better use of efficiency technology where and how we grow crops.",
        "And Jason Clay of the World Wildlife Fund, what about that idea, the image - we turn on a tap, it's there.",
        "Of course we use it, and of course we waste it because we don't really think about it."

        "So we're going to have to figure out how to use water more efficiently.",

        "Or anywhere, okay.",
        "Can you help us out with that, Jason?",
        "Well, one of the projects that we've been involved with is in Africa, where we're trying to identify what the orphan crops are, the kind of neglected crops, the crops that haven't benefitted from modern plant breeding, and what we could do if we map those genomes and begin to select for traits in years rather than decades or centuries so that we could take tree crops and then double or triple or quadruple production.",
        "We're talking about things like cassava, cocoa yams, peanuts, palm oil, et cetera, all native to Africa and used by those people.",
        "And the question is then how do we double-up or triple-up production.",

        "We find that anywhere in the world, the best farmers are 100 percent - or excuse me, 100 times more productive than the worst farmers.",
        "So how do they do it?",
        "What are the practices they use?",
        "We need to begin to identify that, document it and spread that around.",
        "We have 500 million, 800 million cell phones in Africa?",
        "Why aren't we using that to spread information like this, SMS texting and messaging, and replace the old extension agent that's 10, 20, 30 years out of date by the time they're 40 or 50 or 60 years old and use cell phones to get immediate information to people.",
        "Yet - I assume the extension service in a lot of places you're talking about in Africa is your father and his brother and maybe your grandfather.",
        "In the sense that most governments can't afford to pay for extension agents anymore, yes, that's true.",
        "But learning about modern techniques from your grandparents isn't exactly the most straightforward way to go forward.",
