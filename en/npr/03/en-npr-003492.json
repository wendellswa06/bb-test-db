        "I'm sorry, really having a hard time hearing you, but we're going to let you go, but we'll pick up your question with Sandra Postel of the National Geographic Society; he's a freshwater fellow here, and that is this idea that, well, obviously climate change is having a tremendous impact in places like Texas, in places like Australia, in places like China and Russia.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's very troubling from a water perspective because what the scientists are saying now is that we're sort of outside.",

        "We saw in 2008, and again earlier this year, in February 2011, a spiking of food prices like we hadn't seen.",
        "And what that does is it creates more hunger.",
        "We saw at least another 150 million poor people go hungry, from about 850 million to up over a billion, because of that spiking of food prices.",
        "And also, it also changes the dynamics of the whole food system.",
        "And so, you know, this is the kind of thing on top of the demand - the increase in demand for food, again, as more and more countries and people want to consume meat the way we do.",
        "You know, we've had a tripling of world population, but a six-fold increase in our meat consumption since 1950.",

        "It gets you out of poverty because you can suddenly be more food self-sufficient, not have those terrible years when the drought hits, and begin to take some crops to market.",
        "In Bangladesh, where this idea first kicked off, the treadle pump, 1.2 million of those were sold, and a lot of farm families found that to be their ticket out of poverty and toward that next level of income where they could then buy a different kind of pump, where they don't have to work quite so hard.",

        "In our case as farmers, we have our own private water, but we are under extreme pressure from our water districts to start putting meters on our own private wells to start charging us and regulating what we use out of our own private water.",

        "I think some other states in the United States have done the same.",
        "Some years ago, there was a city or a town somewhere in South America that privatized their public - or their water, and I think successfully the public opened it back up because it made water too expensive and inaccessible to a lot of the poor people there.",

        "Would we use it for growing peaches?",
        "Would we use it for growing calories?",
        "Would we use it for growing other things?",
        "I mean, those are decisions that we - we're going to have to start managing them a little better and not just have ad hoc decisions, I think.",

        "Hats off to the caller for being so sustainable in the way, you know, she and her farmers are - her farm is producing, you know, peaches and the other crops because, in Texas, you have a strong sort of disincentive to be that efficient and that sustainable because they have in Texas what's called the rule of capture, which means that if you own land and you drill a well, like they have done, you can pump as much water from beneath your land as you want to.",
        "And so there's not a strong - there's a long history there of if you own the land, you own the water and you can pump as much as you want.",
        "And as Jason just said, exactly right, it's a common pool under there.",
        "So if - as more and more people pump, as you add more straws to that single source of water, it's going to get sucked out faster and faster.",
        "And what's the concern now is if you look around the world that all the places where that's happening, so many wells, so many straws in that common pool of groundwater beneath the earth, we're producing something like 10 percent of our food today by over-pumping ground water.",
        "So that's kind of a bubble in the food economy from that over-pumping.",
        "We're propping it up with the unsustainable use of water.",
        "And like we've learned from the housing bubble, the dot-com bubble, they pop.",
        "And we're beginning to see in parts of India, for example, where a lot of these over-pumping has happened, that wells are beginning to run dry or farmers can't afford to keep pumping.",
        "And so, that land comes out of production or it goes back to dryland farming, which is less productive."
