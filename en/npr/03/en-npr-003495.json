        "Without actually having had his hands on a telescope, he immediately improved the instrument by a factor of three and then took that to a factor of seven beyond that.",
        "In addition to the technological leap, was there a philosophical leap to even want to look more closely at the heavens?",
        "Do you think looking closely at them and trying to figure out what they were made of and what's the difference between a planet and a star was revolutionary by itself?",
        "I wouldn't think that would be the case for the general populous.",
        "However, for someone like Galileo, that would have been an impetus to make this kind of observation.",
        "Galileo's a very curious individual.",
        "He already is in disagreement with the prevailing theories of a number of astronomical things anyway.",
        "So he puts these things together with the capability of the instrument and starts to make these observations and realizes that seeing Jupiter as a world unto itself with its own moons and orbit is probably a fairly good representative model of the structure of the solar system as the heliocentric solar system.",
        "And so this is what gives him the courage to push on and say yes, I believe this is true.",
        "Do you remember the first time you looked through a telescope?",
        "It was a remarkable experience, realizing what is out in the universe beyond the world that we see and really beyond what we read about in books or see in pictures, to actually see it yourself; and for me, seeing it for myself told me that this is what I'm interested in for the rest of my life.",
        "I want to study the universe.",
        "If people who are just hobbyists, or they've got some really good binoculars or maybe a dusty telescope somewhere just want to remind themselves of that feeling of how cool it is to look out there, what should they be looking at?",
        "The simple things for people to observe are still some of the best objects to observe.",
        "A simple, bright star can be a really beautiful object.",
        "There's a bright star in the summer sky called Vega, which is absolutely stunning.",
        "It looks like a brilliant diamond.",
        "I can't think of another star that looks as impressive.",
        "But Saturn is a fabulous object to see; and Saturn is available for view right now.",
        "It's rising in the evening sky, about an hour or so after sunset, high in the eastern sky.",
        "In fact right now, as we observe it, the rings are very close to edge on, which is an unusual sort of a view for us.",
        "It happens only every 12 years or so that we get the chance to make this kind of observation.",
        "And it's interestingly close to the same kind of observation that Galileo would have had in 1610.",
        "Derrick Pitts is the chief astronomer at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, where the exhibit \"\"Galileo, the Medici and the Age of Astronomy\"\" will be on view until September."

        "An extraordinary exchange took place at the U.S.",
        "Supreme Court last week between a senior justice, John Paul Stevens, and Justice Antonin Scalia.",
        "The subject was the death penalty, a topic that's caused more than a few justices to change their minds over the years.",
        "NPR's legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has more.",
        "You might think that legal discourse is tame, even boring.",
        "Well, read these opinions and think again.",
        "They came in a case testing whether execution by lethal injection, as carried out in most death penalty states, is cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "The court, including both Stevens and Scalia, said they are Constitutional, but they agreed on nothing else at all.",
        "Stevens, who served on the court for 33 years and turns 88 today, said that after seeing thousands of death penalty cases and systems over the years, he has now concluded that the death penalty is unconstitutional.",
        "But, he added, he's bound by the court's precedents upholding capital punishment and will adhere to them, including in the lethal injection case.",
        "Ironically, Stevens was partly responsible for one of those key precedents.",
        "In 1976 he wrote part of the opinion ending a moratorium on the death penalty and allowing it to be used again, if special procedures were used to ensure that only criminals guilty of the most heinous crimes were executed.",
        "We identified three societal purposes for the death penalty back then, Stevens observed - incapacitation, deterrence and retribution.",
        "Incapacitation is no long much of an issue, he said, because most states now have life in prison without parole, which they didn't in 1976.",
        "As for deterrence, he said, despite 30 years of research, there is no reliable statistical evidence that capital punishment in fact deters offenders.",
        "That, he said, leaves retribution as the only justification and Stevens suggested that retribution may not be enough to justify capital punishment in light of the possibility of the wrong person being executed, the financial and resource burden on the court and the lack of finality of victims' families who often have to suffer through decade of appeals before a case is resolved.",
        "In the last analysis, said Stevens, I have relied on my own experience in reaching the conclusion that the imposition of the death penalty represents the pointless and needless extinction of life with only marginal contributions to any discernible social or public purpose.",
        "A penalty with such negligible returns to the state is patently excessive and violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
        "Justice Scalia responded with a rhetorical skewer.",
        "Hardest to take, he said , is Justice Stevens' bemoaning of the enormous costs of the death penalty, since as Scalia put it, those costs are largely the creation of Justice Stevens and other justices who have encumbered capital punishment with unwarranted restrictions found nowhere in the Constitution.",
        "You write that while Facebook might be the hottest game in town, it's still a pretty warped and inaccurate picture of what it means to have fiends.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "I mean just like what you're talking about.",
        "As your friends have exploded beyond maybe the people you went to college with or the people you hang out with on weekends to include your employer and your grandmother and all these other different parts of your life, maybe what you're saying becomes a little bit diluted, and you really don't want to say the same thing to all those people."

        "So you stop using Facebook, the biggest social network that 700 million people actively use every month, and you maybe retreat into yourself or go back offline.",
        "So you're saying that when people say they don't like Facebook because of the privacy, that's really not the issue there.",
        "I do think that is one of the big issues and certainly the one most actively portrayed in the media.",
        "I think that there are maybe five or so key weaknesses of Facebook, including the kind of awkward friending model, and that it creates these static friendships that don't really expire like natural friendships do and privacy issues, as well as other potential areas of improvement that maybe other people could do better, that might have more - a social network that has a closer relationship to where we are in time instead of just our real name as we express ourselves online might be a better representation of ourselves.",
        "So what I was doing was looking at some of the weaknesses of Facebook and looking at some promising new social networking sites that address them better.",
        "Let's talk about some of those.",
        "What have you found?",
        "Well, one of the things that I think is most interesting is talking about friends in a more dynamic way.",
        "So, for instance, if you were to go to a wedding this weekend, many people there would be taking pictures there with their smartphones.",
        "And every picture that's taken with a smartphone is geotagged.",
        "We know when and where it was taken.",
        "And if we were to all join a social network together, for instance there's one called Color, there's one called Like a Little, there are quite a few of these sites, well, more apps because you have them on your smartphone.",
        "And we all took these pictures at the same time, these services would recognize that we were all there and create this kind of collaborative album that tells a story told by many people who were in the same place at the same time.",
        "And I think we all might appreciate that version of it rather than looking all over Facebook or just our own albums to see what happened.",
        "And, you know, until I read your column, I didn't even know these existed.",
        "They...",
        "Well, the thing is they're quite small."

        "And honestly, when I put up this story earlier this week, my comments were filled with more and more people talking about these sites.",
        "But the reality is starting a privacy-conscious version of Facebook means that your users are going to make their information private by default, which means no one's going to be able to find them.",
        "Starting a distributed version of Facebook, where your users host their own information rather than putting it on a network where someone else owns it means that your users have to be pretty geeky.",
        "So these things are hard to start.",
        "You know, one of the big problems with Facebook is you can't really separate your personal life from your work life like you can on something like LinkedIn.",
        "That's right, but LinkedIn, I think, at least for me, is a site where I go to get information but not necessarily to engage and hang out.",
