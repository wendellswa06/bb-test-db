        "Well, I think that's great that they're thinking about their options.",
        "But I do see is when I see these new sites start, they build on top of Facebook because Facebook offers some tools called Facebook Connect.",
        "And Twitter actually offers something similar, as well, but the Facebook one is much more widely used, where when you sign on to a new site, you can also plug into your account on Facebook and bring all your friends on Facebook.",
        "And when you post new information on this site, it gets fed back to your Facebook news feed.",
        "So it attracts more people to come in.",
        "And it's really hard for new sites to kind of let go of that - it's addicting to use Facebook Connect because it makes their services so much more instantly populated with people's friends.",

        "I think in the war of ideas, al-Qaida has been able to succeed in some important ways.",
