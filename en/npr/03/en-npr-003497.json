        "You talk about Osama bin Laden's goals, but also his strategy.",
        "Describe that for us, would you?",
        "Bin Laden's strategy - which he's made very clear on numerous occasions - is to draw the United States into wars in various Muslim countries, much as the Soviet Union was drawn into the occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.",
        "And then, as in Afghanistan of the 1980s, he hopes to slowly bleed the United States, wear down its resolve and undermine our willingness to come to the defense of our friends and allies in the region.",
        "For Osama bin Laden, the American occupation of Iraq was a dream come true, a trap where American forces could be slowly dragged into a civil war and a quagmire.",
        "But the real battleground - you write for much of your piece in Foreign Affairs - is Afghanistan, continues to be Afghanistan.",
        "This is where the U.S.",
        "and the West must win.",
        "The head of the beast of al-Qaida is in South Asia, on the Afghan-Pakistan border.",
        "That's where the organization has thrived for the last decade, and that's where we need to devote heavy resources, both military and economic, in order to defeat the Taliban and al-Qaida.",
        "Iraq - you can see that if the U.S.",
        "withdraws from Iraq, al-Qaida is going to claim a great victory.",
        "It will be a huge propaganda victory for them.",
        "And then you conclude, well, let them.",
        "Well, I think the situation in Iraq is a very catastrophic one for the United States.",
        "Al-Qaida is already claiming victory there, and that claim, I think, resonates very powerfully around the Islamic world.",
        "I think the proper course of action in Iraq now is a phased, orderly withdrawal, a withdrawal done in a manner in close coordination with the Iraqi government and which tries to give the Iraqi government as much legitimacy and credit as it can for ending the occupation.",
        "One thing that you write here does surprise me.",
        "You say that you think that killing or capturing Osama bin Laden and Zawahiri and the Taliban leader Mullah Omar, this would be very, very important.",
        "You also write that al-Qaida now is highly decentralized, a lot of independent cells.",
        "What difference does it make if you get these particular leaders?",
        "I think decapitating the al-Qaida leadership is very important.",
        "For more than five years now, these men have been on the run, continuing to carry out operations.",
        "They've established a mystique, a myth about themselves, a \"\"Robin Hood\"\" of the Islamic world that they are beyond the reach of the United States government.",
        "We've allowed that mystique and myth to go on far too long.",
        "We should take action to bring them to justice or to see that they're no longer capable of carrying out their operations as quickly as possible.",
        "I would acknowledge that having let five years go by while they're still out there - it won't have the impact that it would have had five years ago, but that's not a reason for giving up.",
        "Simply saying that it's good enough that Osama bin Laden is somewhere in a cave is a recipe for failure."

        "It's \"\"the long war\"\" - you quote that phrase and say people talk about the long war - it doesn't have to be that long a war, another surprise at the conclusion of your article.",
        "You seem to think that there are goals - clear goals - if the United States pursues them, if the West pursues them, we could actually achieve triumph over al-Qaida within a reasonable amount of time.",
        "I could end up, like, seriously in an anaphylactic reaction and end up in the hospital and possibly die.",
        "So, this college, along with many other colleges, fit this description, but this college kind of stood out.",
        "When I visited, what really stood out to me was that the students, they seemed far more committed to, like, the life of the minds than any other campus I've visited.",
        "So basically it felt more at home.",
        "I felt more at home there than any other school I visited.",

        "YODER: Yeah.",
        "The big question is how big that chance is.",
        "And in the column that we wrote, I talked about the fat envelopes of acceptance, the thin envelopes of doom.",
        "And this, to me, was sort of the worst of all, was the wait-listing because it - to me, I have two issues.",
        "One is I worry that it skews that particular college in the student's mind.",
        "It's sort of like being left on the side of the dance floor…",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mr. S.",
        "YODER: …and waiting for someone to take your hand.",
        "The other thing is I was really hoping for some closure this month.",
        "This has been a long and winding road for the past year of college visits and applications and filling out those aggravating financial aid forms that you're pretty sure aren't going to yield very much.",
        "And so, by the end of this month, I was kind of looking forward to some closure.",
        "And I realized these waiting lists are necessary evil because kids these days apply to a lot of schools, there's economic uncertainty, and so the colleges need to have this pool of applicants in reserve."

        "But for me, if I am selfish, I think maybe Isaac got to count his blessings and dance with one of the ones that brung him.",
        "But he's gotten into some very good colleges, including some that we really didn't expect him to get into.",
        "In the meantime, though, you talked about those financial application forms.",
        "As I understand it, if you're accepted off the waitlist, they've probably given away all their financial aid money already.",
        "Mr.",
        "S.",

        "Stay on that waitlist.",
        "My daughter stayed on the waitlist and in fact she got some financial aid that we weren't expecting.",

        "I'm not really against being on the waitlist.",
        "In fact, it's a lot better than getting an outright rejection letter.",
        "It just - it feels a lot better because it's more like they're saying that you're a qualified, you're a qualified student, but, you know, we're a small school and we don't really have that much space so we can't really let you in at this time.",
        "And also it kind of gives second chance to students who have their mindset on having that school as an option.",
        "It gives them another chance to show that they're an ideal candidate and that they really want to go there.",
        "And really want to go there, but if you accepted, is there any impression that you'll be seen as some sort of, you know, second-class citizen there?",
        "Mr. I.",

        "YODER: You know, I think that's a great question, and in my mind I would tend to worry about it.",
        "We got one letter from an academic admissions director saying, don't worry about that because the only time you're going to see these admissions people is right now.",
        "And once you get into college, you're not going to see them for four years.",

        "And - well, that's an issue for a lot of people.",

        "I.",
        "YODER: Yeah.",
        "This is where it gets tricky, 'cause even if I do get accepted and get off the waitlist, I won't necessarily accept.",

        "And more than likely, like you said, there will be no financial aid.",
        "So, even if I do get off the waitlist, it'll still be another tough decision.",
