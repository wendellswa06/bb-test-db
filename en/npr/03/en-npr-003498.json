        "Well, I have to get the money in for another school by May 1st, because they tell if - they tell me if I get off the waitlist after May 1st once they find out who has accepted for them.",
        "So I have to pick my second choice and give them the money, so I have a slot in their class, to chill out with their dean.",
        "So how much money is that, if you reserve a place in one of the schools that has accepted you?",
        "Mr.",
        "I.",
        "YODER: I don't know, a couple hundred dollars?",

        "You know, I can't say that I have actually checked it out.",
        "Not a trifling sum, but not all the money in the world either.",
        "And if you then later got into the college of your choice, you could still go back and say, well, never mind.",
        "We can - that's a couple of textbooks.",
        "In the long run, it's just a drop in the bucket.",
        "Mr.",
        "S.",
        "YODER: That's right, although psychologically I wonder about that.",
        "I wonder if it isn't, again, better to make a choice among the really fabulous choices that we've got.",
        "But this is for Isaac and I don't necessarily agree.",
        "Why do you want to hang on for this particular school, Isaac?",
        "Mr.",
        "I.",
        "YODER: Well, it really has stood apart for me when I - stood apart from the rest of the schools that I visited.",
        "Like I said before, it just seemed far more - the students seemed far more intellectually immersed than anywhere else I've been.",
        "I just felt far more at home, so I want to keep it on my top - keep it open as an option.",
        "And this can drag on.",
        "This - if May 1st is that deadline, nevertheless, and you may commit to another school, and there have been students known to commit to more than one school - frowned upon but not illegal.",
        "Nevertheless, if later on down the road, in July, if this top school said we found a place for you, would you switch that late?",
        "Mr.",
        "I.",
        "YODER: It would get very tricky right there, because I would have the worst, probably the least of the classes that other kids don't want, there'll be no housing, no financial aid.",
        "It would be a very tough decision because it'd be between that - my top school with none of that, versus another great school that's giving me money and I could have first pick of classes and housing.",
        "So that would be a very tough choice."
