        "Hello.",
        "As we begin our conversation, we should note that today is actually the 60th anniversary of the Nuremberg trials, the trials of Nazi war criminals that paved the way for this kind of historical reckoning.",
        "Is the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal serving the same purpose?",
        "I don't think it is.",
        "It's more complex in a certain sense, the--ICTY, as the war crimes tribunal is known--partly, of course, because there were more sides involved, and so you have indictees for a variety of sides and a variety of wars.",
        "And so it's essentially more complicated.",
        "And whereas in Germany during the Nuremberg trials, the political settlements at the end of the war was clear; Germany was absolutely defeated.",
        "You don't have the same situation pertaining in the former Yugoslavia.",
        "Now Milosevic went on trial starting back in the beginning of 2002.",
        "Why is this taking so long?",
        "I think it's been ill-prepared by the prosecution in as much that they're trying him for too many things.",
        "So their case took a long time, particularly since it--Milosevic is, by nature, somebody who likes and enjoys playing games.",
        "He refuses to recognize the court.",
        "He defends himself whilst at the same time not recognizing the court's jurisdiction.",
        "And so it's one huge game as far as he's concerned, and he's used every minute to prolong, to divert, to deflect the trial.",
        "And now that he is running his own defense, he's able to do that with quite consummate skill, as well, of course, calling on his ill health, which is genuine--he's a diabetic, he has high blood pressure, he has heart problems--in order to prolong the entire proceeding.",
        "What do people in the region think about this whole process, the trials and what's happening there?",
        "There are very varied feelings about it.",
        "If, for example, you take the Bosniacs, who are the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were the greatest victims of these wars, no question about that, they are very concerned to see the tribunal do its work and for people to get their just desserts.",
        "But then if you go across to neighboring Croatia, upon whom some sanctions were applied until very recently because they refused, or were unable, to give up their biggest war crimes suspect, General Ante Gotovina, you see in Croatia ferocious hostility towards the war crimes tribunal.",
        "The Croats insist that they were fighting a war of independence, and they were having to throw out what they regard as the Serbian occupier, and so in no way should they be subject to the war crimes tribunal.",
        "And, of course, in Serbia itself, the war crimes tribunal is seen as yet another instrument that the international community wields in its discriminatory attitude towards Serbia and the Serbs.",
        "It certainly does complicate a lot of the political issues, which are trying to be solved there at the moment."
