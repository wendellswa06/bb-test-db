        "Most mammals have love 'em and leave 'em relationships, but not the prairie vole.",

        "Let's start with the courtship phase of this relationship.",
        "What happens when a male prairie vole spots an eligible female?",
        "Well, the first thing he has to do is to get her interested in him and he does that by kind of just courting her.",
        "And the smell of her pheromones gets her brain activated and she starts turning out steroid hormones, like estrogen.",
        "And after about 24 hours she's ready to mate.",
        "OK.",
        "So, in the wild, prairie voles don't have a long life expectancy.",
        "But in the lab, where they're under the conditions where they can have longer lives, I understand that bond is strong enough to keep them together for a long time.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "They'll stay together for the rest of their life, which in the lab is around two or three years.",
        "But even in the wild, they're known as the potato chip of the prairie because they are preyed upon by hawks and other things.",
        "But, you know, they can live for a year or so.",
        "And in about 80 percent of the cases where a male or a female loses their partner, they never take on another partner.",
        "So, they really do stay together for life.",
        "Wow.",
        "That's amazing.",
        "They're not always faithful though.",
        "Thank you.",
        "If John Dillinger had been brought in when my grandfather was on duty, he would have died laughing instead of in a hail of bullets.",
        "So I am glad for any shaving upgrade.",
        "But Gillette's new razor has five coated blades, a stabilizer, a strip infused with mineral oil, a microcomb to steer stray beard hairs obediently into place for beheading, and an ergonomic handle - whatever that is."

        "Shaving commercials for men today are filled with words like soft, scented and smooth, as if shaving amounted to pampering a baby's bottom.",
        "When the 82nd Airborne hits the ground, do they think that their smooth, scented cheeks, saturated with mineral oil, will intimidate all enemies?",
        "Maybe the rush to buy new blades and razors will jolt the economy and create jobs in a way that housing credits and stimulus spending hasn't.",
        "America might be losing a competitive edge in many enterprises, from cars to space, but as long as we can devise a five-bladed, mineral-oil-saturated razor, we face the future well-shaved.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I've all along been a trailing indicator on this whole story.",
        "Everyone's sort of at number 11 of panic, and I'm at, like, number three as far as whether there's a big story mostly because I haven't seen credible evidence that President Trump himself was involved in something that really could alter the course of this administration.",
        "But I have to say this news, if Flynn is cooperating, signals to me two things, which Ari just got on in the previous interview.",
        "The first, there must be somebody higher, that they must have something - a higher target they're looking at.",
        "And second, Flynn is the Grand Central Station of foreign policy in the early days of the administration, so he would be able to take all the different contacts that they had or allegedly had and put it all together into one story.",
        "Kimberly?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, look; General Flynn has been the center of what all of this is for all the reasons that David set out.",
        "And I think the one difference with General Flynn and other people in this probe is that he's somebody that the president has protected.",
        "The president has a tendency to cut loose and distance himself from anybody with this Russia probe, even suggesting that his former campaign chairman was a minor part of his campaign - Paul Manafort - when he clearly wasn't.",
        "The entire time, he has been very protective of Michael Flynn, even staying in touch with him after he was finally fired after he was warned about - by the acting attorney general that he could be blackmailed.",
        "So he's at the center of this.",
        "So if the investigation is centering in on him, that can't be good news to the people who are at the highest circles of the White House.",
        "As we reflect on the year we've just had in politics, President Trump underscored his world view when he spoke to troops on Thanksgiving.",
        "Let's listen to a little bit of what he had to say.",

        "Well, what the whole region of the former Yugoslavia, by each individual's country and territory's admission, is doing is that they all want to get to the European Union as fast as possible.",
        "In order to do that, they have to meet certain standards in economics, in politics, in human rights and so on and so forth.",
        "A lot of this is made very difficult because they are all, to varying degrees, under a range of sanctions still for only partially cooperating with the tribunal.",
        "And as long as that's the case, it's very difficult for them to make progress on the road towards European Union membership.",
        "And that has the effect of slowing down, in particular, the economic stabilization of the region because this is still a very deprived and underdeveloped region, and as such, it is still potentially quite explosive.",
        "And some people are rather worried that the ICTY is the--contributing toward deepening of the crisis, the political and economic crisis in the region.",
        "However, in what looks to me like, you know, a really landmark turnaround in the international community policy towards the tribunal, the tribunal was trying to block just a few weeks back Croatia's opening negotiations for European Union membership because Gotovina had not been handed over.",
        "Now until this point, the European Union had accepted the tribunal's decision and was refusing to enter final negotiations with Croatia.",
        "However, a few weeks back this was turned on its head, and the EU ignored the advice of the tribunal.",
        "That means the tribunal's political clout in the process of constitutional reform is now visibly diminishing."
