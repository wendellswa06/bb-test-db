        "I visited this yesterday.",
        "It's in an enormous complex, combining high technology and brain power, where they track, they predict, they research storms, tornadoes, weather of all sorts.",
        "And when I visited this center yesterday, I saw a huge fleet of mobile weather vehicles all ready, just getting ready to take to the road.",
        "There's everything from big semis with 10-foot-tall radars on the truck bed to minivans with all sorts of barometers and anemometers and all kinds of wacky-looking stuff mounted on their roofs, complete with - oh, and some of these vans are complete with golf-ball sized dents.",
        "If you're in Oklahoma, you know what I'm talking about, or in Minnesota, whatever, from - and even broken windshields that come from nice particles of hail, big golf-ball-sized hail.",
        "And as I say, in less than a month, this fleet of weather vehicles is going to be chasing tornadoes all over the Great Plains.",
        "That's part of the Vortex2 Project.",

        "We'll also be talking about - what's the point of storm-chasing?",
        "It's not just for fun or entertainment on cable news, is it?",
        "There are a lot of unsolved mysteries about tornadoes, like why do some storms spawn twisters, and how come there are no tornadoes in other storms?",
        "Why do some tornadoes last longer than others?",
        "What's actually going on in the clouds?",
        "That's something that we really don't know a lot about.",

        "So we know that the rotating updraft of a special kind of storm we call a super-cell is the one that produces the most dangerous tornadoes.",
        "When you say rotating updraft, what's going on?",
        "The wind's going up and down, or what's happening?",
        "Well, the - there is a vertical change to the horizontal wind.",
        "So the wind's usually blowing on the ground sideways, right?",
        "The wind's blowing sideways, and it gets stronger as you go aloft, and in an updraft, that gets tilted.",
        "That vertical change of wind gets tilted, and so there's a propeller on the ground going like this, and that gets tilted, and that becomes a horizontal rotation at the mid-levels of the storm.",
        "And radars can see that well, and we've seen that for some time, and we use that for warnings, and we now, because of that in part, issue better warnings.",

        "In Vortex1 in 1994, 1995, we learned that there is some strong rotation right at the ground, not just in the mid-levels, yet we don't get a tornado.",

        "We can guess stylistically.",

        "Does that give a greater impetus on the part of the Iraqi government who preserved the archaeological heritage and make sure more of these antiquities aren't looted?",

        "I think, perhaps, more important, you know, the one thing about the Iraq Museum, what set it apart probably more than anything is it's not just a regional museum about a regional culture.",
        "It really was a museum about our becoming civilized human beings, if we are indeed civilized at this point.",
        "You know, it really took in one building, showcased our heritage from literally our living in caves as Neanderthals = or our relatives who were living in caves as Neanderthals = all the way through the first sort of codification of civil behavior.",
        "And I think, you know, it's important that Iraq put this back together as just sort of a milestone in its rebuilding.",
        "But I think it's also important that sort of the whole world look at this as reestablishing it, because it really - it's a place that we all have some connection to.",
