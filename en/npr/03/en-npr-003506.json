        "Another interesting way to measure Tunisia's success, or lack thereof, is the number of people who are just fleeing the country by sea.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Tunisia was the No. 1 contributor of migrants to Italy - Tunisians, not people from sub-Saharan Africa going through Tunisia.",
        "So this is another big issue.",
        "You have brain drain.",
        "You have - the suicide rate has almost doubled.",
        "All these show that people are frustrated.",
        "They're angry.",
        "They're not seeing the change they thought democracy would bring them or they thought the revolution would bring them.",
        "And a poor economy, youth unemployment - these things can lead to protests, can lead to more political turmoil.",
        "What does the future look like for Tunisia?",
        "What are you going to be watching as it goes through this government transition?",
        "So this transition has been smooth so far, but they're going to have to do elections on a really short schedule.",
        "They only have seven weeks to pull off presidential elections.",
        "That's not a lot of time.",
        "This is a crucial test for Tunisia to see how the democracy can actually move forward.",
        "Are they able to keep up with the constitution, to keep up with the procedures that are in place?",
        "But people are watching.",
        "They're angry.",
        "They're frustrated.",
        "They want this government to bring them actual, real change - real change to their pocketbooks.",
        "And I'm not sure they're going to be able to do that on the timeline that people want.",
        "Sarah Yerkes of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, thank you for joining us today.",
        "Thank you so much.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "You want that kind of interference in our elections.",
        "And so our role, 24/7, 365 days a year, is kind of like the outlook.",
        "You know, we're watching the sky.",
        "We're watching the country for the potential for these severe storms to form because they're devastating once they form, and we're looking one, two, three days out."

        "And so you make predictions based on what you see coming on all these computers that you have going on there?",
        "Yes, and we kind of assess the pattern of the atmosphere and the ingredients that are required for thunderstorm formation, and then once we do see the potential for storms in a certain area, we kind of focus in on that area and look at it a little closer, try to assess the ingredients more accurately.",
        "Which are?",
        "What ingredients?",
        "Moisture.",
        "Coming from?",
        "The humidity in the air, moisture from water sources like the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "Instability, which is essentially buoyancy in the atmosphere.",
        "When you see a cumulous cloud, there's instability associated with that.",
        "And then lift, something to lift the atmosphere up.",
        "And those occur on a variety of scales, but when you put them together in the right way, with the right wind shear in the atmosphere, you can get a pretty amazing storm.",
        "What is there about the geography of this area, the Tornado Alley, that makes these ingredients happen?",
        "What's happening here?",
        "Well, it is geography, and it's topography, the fact that the Rocky Mountains are just to our west, and the Gulf of Mexico is off to the southeast.",
        "We have westerly winds in the atmosphere that create an area of low pressure, kind of almost semi-permanent to the - downwind of the Rocky Mountains in the plains.",
        "That low pressure draws air northward from the Gulf of Mexico, and we have the right setup for storms if you're given these other ingredients.",
        "So we have moisture, mountains, plains.",
        "Everything's in the right place."

        "Yeah, sure.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, I was struck when I was visiting, we were chatting yesterday, and you were showing me all of the technology that you have there, and I visited different people, and what struck me is that despite all the electronics that you have, it's somebody's call.",
        "It is.",
        "It's like the umpire's going to make that call.",
        "You know, there's no computer going to make that forecast.",
        "There's still a little art in the science of meteorology, and there's still gut instinct on occasion, pattern recognition.",
        "Experience place a role.",
        "I've been here before, I remember this, and this is how things evolved when I saw this pattern.",
        "There's no doubt that that plays an important role in the forecast process.",
        "But we have a tremendous amount of information coming in too, from satellites to radar data to the computer models that we can integrate into that experience as well.",
        "Don, tell us about Vortex2.",
        "I mentioned this fleet of trucks and things and sensors.",
        "What are they going to do?",
        "Well, to get this data that's hard to get, as what we established, we need to go to the storm, not wait for the storm to come to us.",
        "So we take all of our instruments and drive them underneath the storm, and our radar is at the edge of the storm, and actually deploy pods ahead of the tornado to try to get the most detailed measurement."

        "So we take out this whole armada, this array of instruments that you described, and we try to study one storm in detail and understand in very fine resolution what's going on with that storm.",
        "Is this before the cloud, the tornado cloud forms, or you look for it and then chase after it?",
        "No, we need to be there before it starts.",
        "If we want to understand what we call tornado genesis, the process of formation, we need to be there earlier.",
        "Now, this is after the cloud has formed.",
        "If we do what we're supposed to be doing, we're in the right region, and it might be one cloud or another cloud, and once we see one developing strongly, then we all converge on that one storm and we collect our data.",
        "Of course, you can't leave the equipment in the tornado as it's occurring, can you?",
        "I mean, you don't want to lose that - it will get lost, right?",
        "We have some pods that we put in front of the tornado, and we might lose one, but actually it's harder to get one right in front of the tornado than you might imagine if you keep a degree of safety when you deploy them in advance.",
        "So most of our instruments are guided by people, and they get out of the way, and these pods, if we lose them, so be it, but last year, we didn't lose any.",
        "And you also have drones that are lying around, right?",
        "We have UAVs, unmanned aerial vehicles.",
        "We can't fly those in our entire domain where we collect data for some reasons, but there is an area, a rural area where we can fly those, and they're very useful.",
        "You wouldn't want to fly a manned aircraft in and around the tornado, but you can fly a UAV there, and we can get very good information.",
        "With all this - being in the age of such satellite technology, why can't we use, why can't we use satellites to collect...",
        "Well, it's a matter of scale, really.",
        "We're looking with a satellite at something the size of a small city.",
        "You can't really drill down much smaller than that.",
        "A tornado can be on a much smaller scale, and so we need something - what we call in situ, right in place to observe some of these things."

        "L-O-V-E.",
        "We don't know the fine details, particularly at low levels, and so that's why we drive all these vehicles, we fly the UAVs, we take the radars and bring them up very close, and we have different wavelength radars that have different missions on scanning the whole storm or scanning the area of rotation or maybe just trying to scan the tornado.",
        "Now, I imagine when you get these trucks out on the road, and they're -you know, it's something like we've seen in the movies, the movie \"\"Twister,\"\" whatever that is, you must have people waiting for you to go out and chasing with you, eh?",

        "And so when we go out and try and collect our data, we do encounter people that are out there, and we don't caravan all together as we approach the storm, since we have different missions."
