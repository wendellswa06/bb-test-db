        "It's called the Fujita Scale, and in recent years, we have enhanced that scale by adding new information and things that have been learned since the 1970s, when the scale was enacted.",
        "So we now have in place what's called the Enhanced Fujita Scale to measure tornado intensity, wind speed and the related damage that occurs.",
        "So remember that, think of it in Spanish as fajita.",

        "Because of global warming, will that affect the tornado season at all or anything?",
        "It's possible.",
        "There are still uncertainties with respect to the tornado record, and our first speaker, question here was interesting because he asked: Is there an increase in tornado numbers?",
        "Well, there's an increase in the reporting of tornadoes, but our record, as you go back in time, is not a very good record.",
        "The tornadoes in the early part of the century were the strong ones, the powerful ones, and they occurred where people lived.",
        "You need a human being to experience these events.",
        "So we have to understand the underlying problems of using that record and drawing conclusions from it, and we just don't have the time, you know, to do that.",
        "Don, speaking of the record, you've been digging into the history of the famous tri-state tornado.",

        "I don't have the time to go into it, but we've really done a study with more modern scientific thought, and we're just at the place now where we're producing drafts and going to publish our results, and I think what we've learned is yes, that was a very bad tornado, and probably, at least with everything we can see, was pretty much continuous across this tri-state area, over 225 miles of length.",
        "Two hundred and twenty-five mile tornado.",
        "Yes.",
        "Wow.",
        "I guess you have to find people who were around and saw it back then, right?",
        "Well, in part that's what we do.",
        "We can get data otherwise, but we've done an extensive search for survivors, although they're in their 80s and 90s.",
        "This research has been going on for about 10 years now, and we have interviewed about 50 survivors of the tornado who've told us their story, and we've worked with a lot of descendents of survivors to get information."
