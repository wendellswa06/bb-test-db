        "T.D.",
        "Jakes lending his power and strength to a festival that will attract upwards to a hundred and fifty thousand people here from 55 countries.",
        "That's the numbers that they had last year.",
        "Many suggest, though, that this is too much of a prefabrication, if you will, of religion, and there is concern that it's becoming too marketed.",

        "This is my thing, and I have the utmost respect for Jakes.",
        "The thing here is this.",
        "Now when you answered that particular question that you had there, what is it about, the draw of these religious revivals?",
        "And then you asked the question, are they good for the city?",
        "Well, in my estimation, they are good for the city if the gospel of truth is being preached.",
        "If not, then it is not good for the city.",
        "Because, you see, there are four different types of gospels being preached today.",
        "And they are these.",
        "Number one, the gospel of prosperity, the gospel of entertainment, the gospel of emotionalism, and finally, the gospel of truth.",
        "The gospel of truth is the real gospel.",
        "It is the life-changing gospel.",
        "It is the deliverance gospel, the gospel that will set you free.",
        "Now this will be a revival, a real revival.",
        "Now if, indeed, Bishop James' Mega Fest is going to actually form this--if it's going to produce this, rather, then let us have it.",
        "I think it will be something good.",
        "But if not, I think that it's just going to work to the contrary.",
        "George Curry, some will suggest that the marriage of what Reverend Dozier suggested comes together in Mega Fest and other large revivals like this, that you do see the teaching of the gospel, but you do see the entertainment aspect and all the other things he just mentioned there.",
        "Some folks see this as good and that you will draw people who would never just come to church on Sunday to hear the Word.",
        "Others, more traditionalists, say that this is hedonism working its way to religion.",
        "Well, I don't know I'd put Bishop Jakes in the hedonism category.",
        "Oh, and nor did I.",
        "I just want to make sure we're clear on that.",
        "But certainly, it's the same kind of controversy you get around Kirk Franklin, you know.",
        "They're saying that that gospel is not gospel.",
        "If you're reaching people with the Word of God and if it's a different venue, then I say more power to you.",
        "Now, of course, Bishop Jakes has a problem here in the sense that he had a big meeting recently with black publishers in Chicago saying he's going to form this alliance with the black press, and he's spinning ads with everybody in Atlanta but the black press, and they're quite upset about that.",
        "So he's got to make himself consistent across the board there.",
        "Mary.",
        "OK.",
        "But here's the test.",
        "The proof is in the pudding.",
        "And, you know, first of all, is it free?",
        "I mean, if you've got to spend $1,500 to fly across town to go to Mega Fest, that means that this is a gathering of people who already have bought into the religion, so to speak.",
        "What I find is curious is that this whole thing started with women.",
        "It started because there was a void in the lives particularly of African-American women, and here comes Reverend Jakes, who shows them how they can be loosed and how they can be better women.",
        "That's how this started.",
        "So in my mind, this is a good thing.",
        "If we can begin to take these mega churches--he's not the only one--take these mega churches and begin to impact and bring the African-American community back to a moral center.",
        "Well, we don't have to keep talking about less likely and more likely; less likely to graduate from college and more likely to be incarcerated; less likely to get married and more likely to be a single parent.",
        "If we can get away from those kind of things, then this is a good thing.",
        "But if it's just a gathering of people who already believe and it's a big party, well, you know, there's nothing wrong with it, but it's not going to help black America.",
        "Mary, I don't know that mega churches are the answer.",
        "I mean, I don't think just because they have the numbers, that's where you're going to impact the most people.",
        "I think that's not your typical size of churches in the black community, and I think, you know, you're overestimating in terms of what their impact is.",
        "But when you think about the numbers..."

        "But, Reverend Dozier, is it...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...can we not just suggest here, Reverend Dozier, that the flock, those that are astray, need to be brought in in some way, shape or form, and if old measures aren't working, that perhaps this is a new way?",
        "Yes, it would be.",
        "But, Ed, we have to take a look at something.",
        "This is what I look at, you know, in our neighborhood, for example; when I say, is the gospel being preached?",
        "Now everything that is said to be the gospel is really not the gospel.",
        "The gospel, of course, is something that a lot of people don't want to hear.",
        "The gospel tells you how to live your life.",
        "The gospel brings convictions.",
        "See, for an example, when we look at the situation here, woman, thou art loose.",
        "Well, my question would be, OK, Bishop Jakes, what essence are you saying that?",
        "Are you saying that they are loose now to do what?",
        "Are they loose to assist in the continuation of destroying the Earth?",
        "Are they loose how?",
        "How are they loose?",
        "Because, see, God has...",
        "You're suggesting there's some questions about his message, and while I'm mildly critical of the mega church concept, I don't think that his message is confusing.",
        "A lot of women seem to be very clear about it.",
        "They responded to it in great numbers, and it's loose from the oppression and the abuse of the past, and I think that message has been coming across quite clear.",

        "If he had gone to a game in the past and breathed in any kind of peanut dust or residue...",
        "(Foreign language spoken)",
        "I think what's interesting here, though--and we have seen it historically, George.",
        "You bring it up with Kirk Franklin, but, you know, one can go back as far as C.L.",
        "Franklin and Aretha Franklin, when the advent of the collision, if you will, of secular music and gospel music and even, quite frankly, before, C.L.",
        "and Aretha made it the most popular, if you will--becomes a question of how we deal with religion, how we bring others to the flock and what it is to individuals.",
        "And I think probably, the lesson learned here is that religion is, as most people say, an individual's choice.",
        "Some of us prosper by going to church on Sunday.",
        "Some who never go to church are some of the finest human beings going.",
        "So we'll leave it at that, because this is one of those age-old questions that will not be answered.",
