        "Are we mainly talking about Democrats and Obama supporters, because there's also information that shows that most of the new voter registration that's going on that is for one of the two major parties is Democratic registration?",
        "Is this something that benefits one party more than the other?",
        "Well, I think it is fair to say that the lion's share of these new and lapsed voters, as we call them, have been inclined towards voting for Barack Obama.",
        "The number suggests that it's about 65 to 30 in terms of the percentage of people who prefer him over John McCain.",

        "What kind of messaging might campaigns be putting out to reach these groups?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, it's tied in part to the comment I just made earlier which is, they don't necessarily buy into the my-party-is-better-than-your-party argument, instead what they're looking for is a response to real problems."
