        "No, actually Democratic Senator Joe Biden, whose plan would concentrate on having the government pick up the cost for people with catastrophic health expenses, is trying to differentiate himself from most of the other Democrats, specifically by not having a mandate.",
        "And one word Americans don't like - mandate.",
        "I don't want to make this hard.",

        "Remember Harry and Louise?",
        "Harry and Louise, of course, for those who don't remember, being the characters in the insurance industry ads that helped sink President Clinton's health reform efforts in the early 1990s.",
        "You know, and speaking of that effort, what does Senator Hillary Clinton say she's learned from those mistakes?",
        "Well, she says she's learned quite a lot, and she's actually trying to turn that debacle into a positive, says she's learned how not to do health reform and she wouldn't make the same mistakes twice.",
        "Here's one of several things she has cited as a problem with that 1990s effort that she was part of.",
        "Certainly the fact that the White House took on the responsibility of writing the legislation turned out to be a mistake.",
        "At the time it seemed like something worth doing, but I don't think that it was a smart way of investing the Congress in this rather daunting task we were taking on together.",
        "So that's why I believe presidential leadership on this issue should set a goal and set a framework, but not get into the details.",
        "Well, finally, Julie, while most of the Democrats are running away from the label socialized medicine, there is one candidate who embraces it.",
        "Right.",
        "That would be Congressman Dennis Kucinich.",
        "He's been pushing for a single-payer national health insurance program that would eliminate not only private health insurance, but all profit-making entities from the health care system entirely.",
        "Government works.",
        "The question is, who is it working for?",
        "And in health care, it's working for the insurance companies right now.",
        "It's working for the pharmaceutical companies.",
        "You look at their profits.",
        "You look at their Wall Street ratings.",
        "And I'll tell you something: when I'm president of the United States, it will work for the people.",
        "That, of course, Democrat Dennis Kucinich.",
        "And Julie, this is a fair approximation of what these candidates have said.",
        "Yes, it is, and there are several more to come."

        "Young voters tend to use the Internet a lot more than others, and so typically we try to incorporate that into the analysis.",
        "The other benefit actually that has happened over the course of time is that the government itself has done a better job of keeping track of people when they register, and whether or not they're voting."
