        "Wow!",

        "I would just sit there and I was like, oh, my gosh.",

        "Oh, this states red, this is purple, this is blue.",
        "What does purple mean?",
        "But now that I actually understand what's going on, and I know that I can make that difference by casting my vote and encouraging others to do the same, then there's nothing to stop me now.",
        "I'm so ecstatic.",
        "Yesterday, we had on Michael Steele, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland a big hit at the Republican convention, and he talked a little bit about what he thought the fortunes of the party would be, and of, you know, sort of opportunities for black Republicans or for the Republican Party to really get black voters.",
        "He was not hopeful, but you remain faithful.",

        "being that's where we're based at, where we can learn about the different opportunities that the Republican Party offers.",
        "And, also we're able to have a different perspective.",
        "Right now, I currently work for the House Republican Conference, and as I work in that office, I see everyday the different type of benefits that could work with the African-American community.",
        "For me personally, I was able to work not only, like I said, with the House Republican Conference, but with individuals throughout the community and I know, like my mom for example, she's a single parent who makes a certain amount of money a year and not much, but she's still considered middle-class American.",
        "But different issues like health care, education which affects me, they all connect back to the Republican Party and if I'm able to address that, if I'm able to continuously live by example with these different types of standards that I have with the Republican Party, then like I said before, nothing is able to stop us.",
        "All right.",

        "We've been doing so many things.",
        "One of the things we've been really utilizing is the social network, Facebook.",
        "I think Senator Obama has been absolutely ingenious in the fact that he's really tried to get our age group engaged in this political process by having like different Facebook groups and through these Facebook groups, we're able to send messages out to students to let them know that we can go canvass for Senator Obama, or that they can volunteer at the local Obama headquarters, which is like two blocks away from our school, by phone banking, but also helping with data-entry sheets.",
        "Some other programs that I've been planning, on October 25th and November 1st, we'll be going back to Virginia again to do some more canvassing, because as you know, Virginia is such an important state and hasn't been Democratic since the early 1960s.",
        "And if you look at the Gala(ph) polls and things, you'll see that the race is really, really close and right now, he's leading.",
        "And we really need to bring out people in Virginia to make sure they vote.",
