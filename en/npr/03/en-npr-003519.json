        "He's now the historian for the International Spy Museum here in Washington, D.C.",
        "Nice to have you with us.",
        "Thank you very much for having me.",
        "And this seems out of the Cold War.",
        "Well, in some ways, it really does.",
        "But, nonetheless, I think it's important to remember that even though U.S.-Russian relations today are nothing like what U.S.-Soviet relations were during the Cold War, the two nations do not have an identity of interest.",
        "We do not see eye to eye on everything.",
        "And there's a wide variety of issues, issues relating to NATO, to Iran, to missile defense and a whole economic issues and a whole host of others where we and Russia don't see eye to eye.",
        "So, frankly, if I were a Russian citizen, I would think the Russian service was incompetent if it wasn't trying to spy on the United States.",
        "Well, there are spies and then there are spies.",
        "There's an awful lot of people who work at the Russian embassy or at the Russian office at the United Nations who are listed as a, well, you know, military attaches or something like that...",
        "Second secretary or something, you know?",
        "...who actually work for the successors to the KGB.",
        "Those people have a diplomatic cover, and if they are blown, if they are found out, they are - I guess the trade term is PNG-ed, declared persona non grata and sent back to their country of origin.",
        "These people are alleged to be so-called illegals.",
        "What are those?",
        "Illegals, this is something that the Russians and, before them, the Soviets have been doing, going back at least to the 1920s.",
        "And the concept is that you take a Russian, a Russian citizen, and you train them so as to - so that they're able to live in the United States and pass as Americans or at least pass for people who have a good reason, a good excuse for not sounding exactly like Americans.",
        "An awful lot of Russian immigrants here (unintelligible).",
        "For instance, yes.",
        "And then, they are sent to the United States, frequently through an intermediary country or two, often in central Europe, often Canada, and eventually make their way to the United States.",
        "And, often, they take on the identity of an American, a genuine American who, say, died in, you know, childhood or something like this.",
        "And then they just live their lives for five, 10, 15, 20, sometimes more years."

        "All right.",

        "Yes.",
        "I'm not convinced that fake American town ever existed.",
        "But it's, you know, in essence, that function very much did exist in a suburb of Moscow, at a training facility run by the KGB that I imagine - I don't know for a fact - but I imagine it's still run by the SVR.",
        "Certainly, that function of teaching Russians how to be Americans is one that does continue in the Russian service.",
        "But we shouldn't imagine that there are immense legions of these people being trained and dispatched every year to the United States.",
        "In fact, that's one of the things that's so interesting about this case, is that in the Cold War we would catch these people one or two at a time.",
        "Typically, in fact, they were sent as singletons, occasionally as married couples or allegedly married couples.",
        "Here we've got a network of 10.",
        "I mean, that is, to my mind, what's really truly mind-boggling and - at least as far as I'm aware - unprecedented in intelligence history, is 10 illegals all connected to each other, operating simultaneously.",
        "There is a decoded - according to the criminal charge - a decoded instruction which they received from C - Moscow Central.",
        "You were sent to U.S.A.",
        "for long-term service trip, it said.",
        "Your education, bank accounts, car, house et cetera, all these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, i.e., to search and develop ties in policy-making circles and send intels - intelligence reports - back to C - Moscow Central.",
        "Yes, and I think there's a couple of interesting things about that.",
        "First off is - I may be reading too much into that, but that first bit of, we bought your car, we bought your house...",
        "Right.",

        "Precisely.",
        "And certainly during the Cold War, that was a real problem, that the then-KGB had with sending illegals to the West, is that frankly the West was a whole lot nicer place than the Soviet Union was and there was a tremendous temptation, once they were trained to act as Americans, they came here, they effectively were Americans, they lived the American life to, you know, dump the radio in the river and not answer Moscow's calls.",
        "I - we have no positive evidence that they were facing this issue here, but I do sort of wonder.",
        "Secondly, the other interesting issue with the use of illegals here, though, is that, as you noted, they're here for a purpose.",
        "They're here to collect sensitive information that we, the U.S.",
        "government, that is to say, wouldn't freely be sharing with Russia.",

        "Yeah, 10 years of effort to infiltrate a travel agency.",
        "Yes, precisely.",
        "I mean, you as a reporter probably have more inside scoop on what's going on in the inner circles of the Washington, D.C.",
        "government than, near as we can tell, from what's known now, these folks did.",
        "In fact, at least the idea is, most of the information they seem to have been able to have access to, you could have gotten on the Internet.",
        "That's absolutely right.",
        "Which makes this whole thing extremely puzzling.",
        "Interesting also that the FBI was apparently tracking these people for seven years, at least.",
        "At the very least, yes.",
        "And I think that also goes to the question of what were they - what were these alleged Russian agents actually able to acquire, because I imagine that if - if they got even seriously close to something that was actually sensitive, we would have heard about this story a whole long time ago."

        "So issues of technology, particularly weapons technology and also economic intelligence, is something that one can easily imagine Russia - even if our - even if the U.S.-Russian relationship were, you know, like this, very tight, I imagine them wanting to steal."
