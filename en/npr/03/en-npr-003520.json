        "And one of his - one of the things he did was spy on the Russians.",
        "And from the last time I've seen him, which was five, six years ago, he told me that, you know, it still goes on, you know, trading our people there, their people to us.",
        "And I was mentioning that I knew some - I know some Russian friends, and the thing I was wondering is, like, you know, how would you actually know if someone's a spy for the Russians?",
        "That's - in the story in the New York Times today about this - they quoted one of the neighbors of people who lived in Montclair, New Jersey - they couldn't be spies.",
        "Look at what she did with the hydrangeas.",
        "Yes, I saw that.",
        "I thought that was wonderful.",
        "I mean, the short answer, of course, is you won't know.",
        "On the other hand, choose any American you know, even one who speaks with a Russian accent, and I will be willing to take that bet that he or she is not a spy.",
        "Ten is a preposterously large number, okay?",
        "I believe that Oleg Kalugin, a retired KGB general officer, was quoted in the New York Times this morning as saying, Ten - good grief.",
        "You know, during the Cold War, we've never had 10 at once, let alone 10 operating together.",
        "So tremendously small numbers of these people...",
        "Oleg Gordievsky, also a KGB officer who defected during the Cold War, said he estimated that Moscow likely has 40 to 50 couples operating undercover in the United States, so...",
        "He's probably better entitled to an opinion, having been in their service, than I am.",
        "But even if you go with that, 100 people and, what, 300 million Americans.",
        "You're safe trusting your neighbor, I think.",
        "All right.",
        "Right.",
        "I said to my friends, my wife, I said we should just (unintelligible) my friends and tell them to take a lie detector test for us.",

        "The head of the KGB, indeed.",
        "You also have the Obama administration saying that it's not going to affect the relations between the two countries.",
        "I'm wondering why this isn't the sort of thing - it seems to me that if I were in the president's shoes, this will be the kind of thing that would concern me greatly and that would really kind of shake the new relationship between Moscow and Washington.",
        "So if you can just respond to why not - why they're not doing more, that's really my question.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I'd say two things.",
        "First off, you know, in terms of the question of why are they - and by they I assume you mean the FBI and the U.S.",

        "I mean the the president, the administration...",
        "Okay.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "I'm actually pretty impressed with, you know, knowing what we know today, with how the FBI seems to have handled this.",
        "They've been on top of this for quite a long time.",
        "And near as we can tell, in fact, these particular latest Russian agents weren't able to do anything damaging.",
        "Now, in terms of the broader question about U.S.-Russian relations and what does this say about the quality of those relations - yeah, sure.",
        "You can't expect the United Sates to like being spied on.",
        "But the fact of the matter is, that there hasn't been a day that the Soviet Union has existed when they haven't been spying on us.",
        "And frankly, that's true of many, many, many, many other countries as well.",
        "It's simply a fact of international life.",
        "So if we are - if the U.S.",
        "government is going to, you know, send U.S.-Russian relations south over espionage, we might as well just resign ourselves to always hating the Russians.",
        "Do we have couples, American couples, do you think, living in Russia?"

        "All right.",
        "Jordan, thanks very much for the call.",

        "One of our spies is then sent back home summarily.",

        "Absolutely.",

        "Rather than rush out to find a new job, Lee Kravitz decided to spend a year to go back and fulfill old promises, pay back old debts, literal and emotional, and take care of some of the things he'd let slip over the years.",
