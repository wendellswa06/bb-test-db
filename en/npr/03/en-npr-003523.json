        "But if it's too late, probably late, but I guess better late than never.",
        "Lee Kravitz, it reminds me of the part in your book, you borrowed $600 from a friend when you were driving with him through India and Pakistan, retracing Alexander the Great's route, and this had lingered on your mind lo these many years.",
        "Yeah, I had borrowed $600 from him, and for a variety of reasons - I didn't have the money, I needed it to pay for college, I was poor when I was young - I never paid it back.",
        "And in my mind this debt just grew and grew until it was $6 million that I owed him.",
        "As a result...",
        "All of that compound interest.",
        "Compound interest, it really got high.",
        "And as a result, I didn't keep in touch with someone who had shared one of the great adventures of my life, and as I got older, and my memories of that time got less sharp, I really felt a need to get back in touch with him.",
        "So I sent him the check for $600, and lo and behold, he didn't even remember that I had borrowed it from him.",
        "But what was wonderful was that he gave that $600 to his own son so that his son, who was the same age we were when we journeyed overland across Asia, could take a trip like we did and expand his horizons.",
        "It was wonderful.",
        "Cesar, thanks very much for the story, and the market will turn again.",
        "Hang in there.",
        "Indeed.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, Lee Kravitz, by revisiting those memories, you also revisited a part of yourself that, well, had really gotten lost in, I think I can call it the rat race.",
        "Yeah, in the rat race.",
        "I had become, for example, a dad who didn't go on vacation with my kids, when they went skiing.",
        "When they went up a mountain, I stayed down below.",
        "You wouldn't have thought - in fact, my children didn't think of me as being very adventurous, but once I started revisiting that time in my life, I, you know, began to feel much more adventurous than my current life."

        "And I also saw that what I was doing by going on these journeys to complete my unfinished business was a form of adventure that meant taking risks and had great, great rewards that I could achieve.",
        "Great risks and great rewards, but it was perhaps worth it to remember crossing the Khyber Pass.",
        "Yeah, the Khyber Pass with batons(ph) shooting off rifles.",
        "We passed through a civil war in Baluchistan.",
        "We had many, many, many adventures, and of course with Alexander the Great, the problem with trying to follow his route in the desert of southern Iran is that it's not marked.",
        "So we got terribly lost and had to drive down a dried river bed until some Baluchi nomads showed us the way to food, water and kept us alive.",
        "And yet on the brink of extinction, but shortly having a steak in a hotel the next night.",
        "Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a steak in the hotel.",
        "Unfortunately, that steak, there was a big storm outside and it became almost like a monsoon, but it was delicious.",

        "But one of them was I had a student at the beginning of the year, an eighth-grader who had a really hard time reading, and he's been in foster care his whole life and actually ended up moving foster homes about a month after I came into the position.",
        "And I said, you know, Gary, I'm going to stick with you.",

        "And I'm going, you know, there are ways around any difficulty, and part of, I think, what's kept me from going is similar to that $600 thing, just the idea that - that kind of lingering guilt about the fact that I haven't been going.",

        "Even to let that into my consciousness was hard.",

        "And all these folks stepped up and sent me checks, and then when I went back to finally finish the album, I discovered that one of the hard drives had been lost and I wasn't actually going to be able to finish the album.",
