        "And I'm not really angry with him.",
        "It's just I'm more hurt and perplexed that why would he not want to connect with me.",
        "And so that's kind of been my barrier for why I haven't gone out of my way to connect with him."

        "My father and his brother hadn't talked in 30 years.",
        "They'd held a grudge that long.",
        "And so one of my pieces of unfinished business was to move them closer to talking.",
        "And I did it by fact-checking a famous family story.",
        "It was an indirect way of doing it.",
        "It wasn't by - I couldn't force them to talk to each other.",
        "But once I started asking them what they knew about that story -it involved Eliot Ness and my family's organized crime roots, so it was very spicy and interesting - they got interested in what the other was saying.",
        "And I cc-ed them on the same emails, and after a while they were emailing each other directly.",
        "So after 30 years my father and his brother, at a time in their life where they're not going to have many years left, have really begun communicating again, and I feel very good about that.",
        "So families, you're right, they're by far the hardest, hardest of our unfinished business.",
