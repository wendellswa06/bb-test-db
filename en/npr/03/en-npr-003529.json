        "Now, trolling - sending nasty, often personal, often racist, anti-Semitic and sexist taunts over the Internet.",
        "Well, that's been around for a while.",
        "But this is in the news again not just because of President Trump's well-known Twitter habits but also because of what his supporters are willing to do to take up his cause.",

        "But first, as we said, this has been going on long before this President made Twitter his version of a fireside chat.",

        "So this is actually a surprisingly hard question.",
        "What is a troll?",
        "I think sort of at the purest level, we're talking about someone who is just delighting in chaos, sort of utterly hateful, provocative, really wants a reaction.",
        "But culturally, we've sort of burdened trolling and trolls with so many other meanings that it has become pretty murky.",
        "And almost - it gets difficult to talk about because people can't agree with what a troll even is.",
        "Is it just someone who's mean?",
        "Is it someone who disagrees with you?",
        "Do you have to, you know, be facing a death threat for it to be real trolling?",
        "So there's this sort of spectrum and not a lot of clarity about what a troll really is.",
        "So, Anita, you make the point in your book that trolls have essentially taken over commentary sites.",
        "I mean, that's the subtitle of your book, that - you say that bigots got a monopoly on commenting about news commentary sites.",
        "Why do you say that?",
        "Yes.",
        "I say that because when you read most comments sections, the majority of the comments are bigoted specifically against African-Americans.",
        "When you read comment sections, the negativity takes over any of the positive.",
        "It outweighs any positive message there.",
        "Adrienne, I'm going to ask you, is that true?",
        "I mean, does the research indicate that the negativity outweighs the positive?",
        "I think that certainly the prevailing sense - the comment sections of many, many, many news sites, even legitimate, well-regarded news sites - it's just vitriol.",
        "Well, so, Anita, go to that point about, like, when you say bigots, what do you mean by that?"

        "But recently, with Secretary Rice and Christopher Hill, they talked to North Korea directly, and that yielded results that I support, that the international community support, that in essence starts a process of dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons.",
        "So we were able to advance the process to the point where the North Koreans gave me a commitment that a few days after the funds are unfrozen, they're going to shut down the reactor and invite the international inspectors."

        "In other words, as an ally against China.",
        "They see themselves as playing a strategic role as a buffer between the United States and China.",
        "I'm not sure how realistic that is, but it's interesting that they see themselves, one, as a major power, and secondly, as having the same interest in Asia as actually the United States and other counties, which is basically to contain China a bit."
