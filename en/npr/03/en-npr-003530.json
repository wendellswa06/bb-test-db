        "McCormack Jackson took a $50,000 pay cut to work for the mayor, and she did it because she was a believer.",
        "Filner has a history of progressive politics with 19 years as a Democrat in Congress.",
        "He was a Freedom Rider who championed the rights of the oppressed.",
        "But McCormack Jackson says behind closed doors, he was the oppressor and a man so out of touch with reality, he once asked her how he could have possibly been inappropriate.",
        "I pointed out that he had asked me to work without my underwear on.",
        "He had no comeback.",
        "That was the day she resigned.",
        "Yesterday, after she gave her statement in a small and stuffy room overflowing with reporters, she kept her eyes fixed on her lawyer, Gloria Allred, as if she was drawing strength from the woman who has made a career of taking on high-profile men engaged in anything from hanky-panky to outright sexual assault, like Tiger Woods and Roman Polanski.",
        "Allred spoke to the mayor directly, mocking him for missing sexual harassment scandals that had destroyed the careers of other politicians.",
        "Were you awake during any of those scandals?",
        "And Allred chided the mayor for his first comments after the accusations emerged when, in a pre-taped statement, Filner looked into the camera and said I need help.",
        "What help do you think that you need in order for you to stop treating women as pieces of meat?",
        "Even with an alleged victim in the spotlight, the mayor says he's not going anywhere.",
        "Allies of the mayor are jumping ship.",
        "When asked about the man who once worked with her in Congress, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi snapped: Don't identify him as my former colleague.",
        "Now, the mayor has cloistered himself in his office, increasingly isolated as those who once saw him as a champion now view him as a monster.",
        "That's a term Filner himself as used in an interview with Univision San Diego.",
        "I brought this on through my own personal frailties.",
        "And the biggest monster right now is, you know, inside me - which we will deal with.",
        "Filner's sporadic public comments veer between candid remarks just short of confession and confidence in his vindication.",
        "The only way the mayor can be forced out of office is with an expensive hard-to-file recall petition.",
        "A recall campaign is already gathering steam, but the mayor insists he is staying put.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Sandhya Dirks in San Diego.",
        "E.J.",

        "Well, the administration set a very careful standard for itself.",
        "It didn't say everybody can come at any time.",
        "They said the vast majority of users will be satisfied by it.",
        "And so I think if they meet that standard, they're going to be very happy.",
        "I think the big test, as Julie suggested, will come on December 31, and then again in March.",
        "The can this thing work?",
        "I think the experiences in states like California and Kentucky show, yes, it can work, to use an old phrase, but they've had these website problems.",
        "That's why they delayed the business exchanges, small business exchanges.",
        "Better a delay than another collapse.",
        "The test will be do they sign up a lot of people and a decent mix of people that includes a lot of young people?",
        "We'll know that by the end of the year and then March.",
        "Well, E.J., you say better a delay than another collapse.",
        "But David, another delay is not a great thing either and as we just heard, they have delayed the small business enrollment for a year.",
        "Yeah, I can't imagine a private company doing an ad campaign: the vast majority of our cars will work, the vast majority of our meals will be edible.",
        "It's not a very high standard you're setting for yourself.",
        "I sort of think there are two layers of problems here that - first, there's the implementation problems, the narrow problems of which I would say the website is one.",
        "These are the minor league problems and even the delay of the small business, that's something they can probably figure out over a couple of years.",
        "There are much bigger problems that I think will have a much bigger impact on public opinion.",
        "If you're included newly on Medicaid, but you can't find any doctors to take care of you, that would be a big problem.",
        "The employer mandate kicks in just after the next election.",
        "If people in big companies start seeing themselves dropped during election season, that could have a big impact.",
        "If the young and the healthy don't sign up, that'll produce a rate shock, big impact.",
        "And so, to me, the crucial factor to look at is when does the healthcare chaos hit the election season and what'll it do to the midterms?"

        "Something tells me this won't be the last time we talk about the website on this program.",

        "troops will be out by 2014 and the administration is now at odds with Afghan President Hamid Karzai who has declined to sign a long term security agreement after initially agreeing to sign the agreement.",
        "E.J., how does the Obama administration work with a partner like Karzai?",
        "I think they work around him as best they can.",
        "I think what they have going for them now that they might not have had going for them at other times is the loya jirga, the representation - the representative body of - 2,500, you know, tribal leaders has approved this treaty.",
        "They're angry at Karzai.",
        "They want us to make this deal.",

        "It was the rise of white supremacist groups using the Internet and Internet tools to be able to systematically create fear and intimidation in journalists, particularly journalists of color.",

        "I did and disguising myself.",
        "You have to understand, I worked on the night news desk in a newspaper with probably less than 20 people after midnight at night.",
        "And I often worked from 5 till 2 o'clock in the morning.",
        "And so safety was a key concern because these letters continued to talk about violence.",
        "Trolls are not just what our president would characterize as, you know, heavy-set people on a couch.",
        "These are coordinated groups of hackers using the Internet to organize themselves, to create attacks on people's websites and bring them offline, to do doxing, which is where they send out personal information about your home address or where you live or your family and children's names.",
        "This is activity that moves from online to the offline spaces and needs to be taken seriously by both management as well as law enforcement.",
        "So when you approached some of these news organizations about why they continue to allow these kinds of comments - because they wouldn't print them.",
        "They would never print these in their printed pages.",
        "But somehow, news organizations allow these anonymous commentators to spread things that are not true or just vitriol.",
        "Why do they have such different standards for what they kind of print in their news pages as opposed to what they would allow on their anonymous comment boards?",
        "I mean, Adrienne, do you have reporting on this?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I mean, I think the best way to think about it is to consider sort of like the utopian version of the Web and the idea of what the best possible version of sort of civil discourse online could be.",
        "And so when news organizations shifted many of their operations online, they were also sort of merging into this culture of what was already there, which was largely like blogs and people creating their own spaces, people publishing their own things.",
        "And so as readers moved to platforms, you know, in an ideal environment, you hope that you can engage with them and let them sort of have this - no longer just have the newspaper be the gatekeeper but have it be sort of a two-way publishing environment, at least in the comments section.",
        "And unfortunately, sort of the lowest common denominator rises to the top.",
        "In fact, there was a study that found that the first comment in a thread really does set the tone.",
        "And so if the first comment in a thread is very trolly or negative or racist, that it's more likely for the rest of the thread to sort of devolve into that space."

        "And so I think that's telling as well.",
        "At the same time, solving trolling is not going to be like one person at a time appealing to the reason of another person.",
