        "So he walked it back a bit, but that's still the headline.",
        "And it overshadowed some other things he did last night when he sounded like a traditional Republican candidate on abortion and guns and taxes.",
        "He was much more disciplined and focused in the debate.",
        "He does still have one inexplicable divergence from Republican orthodoxy, which is Russia.",
        "Even though he's gotten the intelligence briefings and he knows that 17 intelligence agencies say that Russian security agencies were behind the hacks of Democratic officials' emails, he still continues to take the Putin line.",
        "Well, let's take those things together - Trump going against the norm on accepting election results and going against the consensus on whether Russia hacked into American political systems.",
        "Yesterday you said that you were looking to see what Trump's strategy is.",
        "Does that give you any insight to what his strategy is?",
        "Not too much, but there is one theory out there, which is, he is sticking with the strategy that has worked for him for decades and decades, which is dominate the media; make as much news as possible; keep the spotlight on yourself.",
        "Maybe, this theory goes, he is establishing himself as the alternative to everything, the alternative to the establishment, to the media, to Hillary.",
        "If as many have been speculating he wants to start Trump TV after the election, this was a pretty good debut of someone who wants to keep the spotlight on him, and maybe this is going to be his new brand.",
        "Now, that would be a good strategy for that end, but for getting 270 electoral votes - not so much.",
        "Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, seems to be pretty confident that she's going to win the election.",

        "She has done an excellent job of being the anti-Trump and disqualifying him, but she has yet to make a real positive affirmative case for herself, present a vision, why she wants to be president and what she's going to do.",
