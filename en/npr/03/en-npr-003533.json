        "Do you think this has the potential to change the dialogue on these issues?",
        "I would like to think so and I think that it should be said - a couple of things.",
        "One is our earlier popes, John Paul II and Benedict XVI, were pretty tough on the unregulated free market also, but no one has been quite as tough or quite as insistent as Pope Francis on it.",
        "And what he said about supply-side economics was really extraordinary.",
        "He said it has never been confirmed by the facts.",
        "It expresses a crude and naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power.",

        "Capitalism really enhances the sin of pride, putting yourself and your ambition at the center of your life and not putting God at the center of your life, but that can happen if you're a capitalist, but it can also happen if you're in a faculty or if you're working in an NGO.",
