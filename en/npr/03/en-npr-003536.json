        "Celltex's Andrea Ferrenz cites studies the company has done, and some independent research, that suggests the treatments are effective.",

        "Certainly, we don't have convincing, compelling evidence that these cells work in humans; certainly not for the vast array of diseases that seem to be being treated, at this time.",
        "So what's your take on these companies that are selling this treatment as a way to cure disease?",
        "Oh, I'm deeply concerned - deeply, deeply concerned because I think they are getting way ahead of what we understand.",
        "We are not even yet completely comfortable that these cells can be delivered safely in many, many different circumstances.",
        "We know that cell preparations like the ones that are being infused, have resulted in things like clots that have led to patients dying.",
        "When they're injected in spaces of the body where they don't typically exist - like the central nervous system - we know that they can cause all kinds of damage.",
        "We're starting to see reports in the medical literature of some of the complications.",
        "So I think that the patients who are otherwise desperate - you know, they're willing to bear any risk, pay any price - they have to realize that these are experimental and in fact, the treatments could make their disease, or their condition, worse.",
        "What do you say to people who say, look - you know, I think that this is working for me; you know, it's my money.",
        "I don't think that this is hurting me.",
        "I just really think the FDA needs to get out of the way.",
        "You know, I wish that we could make medical advances by anecdote alone.",
        "We can't.",
        "The fact is that when people have a financial stake in the outcomes of clinical trials, it's very hard to see them objectively assessing the outcomes.",
        "When patients are driven and feel so inclined to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a treatment, they're bound to think that they're going to get some benefits, something we've appreciated in medicine for many, many years - a placebo effect.",
        "Do you think that it's going to be a treatment that we're going to see used normally on lots of patients, in the future?",
        "Well, I'm hugely optimistic.",
        "I mean, I direct our stem cell transplantation program at the Children's Hospital.",
        "We use primarily hematopoietic, or blood, stem cells.",
        "We do it from bone marrow; we do it from cord blood; and we use it to treat leukemias and some solid cancers, like neuroblastoma, and a variety of genetic diseases, like immune deficiency and sickle-cell anemia.",
        "We know it works there.",
        "And it's really the only established, accepted standard of care using adult stem cells.",
        "Everything else is the realm of experimentation today.",
        "I believe, truly, if we look into the future - maybe 20, 30, 40 years - cells are going to be delivered as medicines, and they will be part of our everyday practice.",
        "But it takes decades.",
        "For SammyJo Wilkinson, that may be a bit too long."
