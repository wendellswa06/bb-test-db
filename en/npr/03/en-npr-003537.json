        "But first, let's go to American entertainment in English.",
        "Last week on the program we spoke with Edward Jay Epstein, who writes Slate's Hollywood Economist column, and he told us about a big problem faced by the movie studios.",
        "It's called the `death spiral.",
        "And Edward Jay Epstein joins me now.",
        "What is the death spiral?",
        "Essentially, what happens is you have low attendance in the theaters, so you have lower profits for the studios.",
        "The studios need higher quarterly earnings to show Wall Street.",
        "So they begin moving the date and the announcement of a DVD release closer and closer to when the movie's in the theater.",
        "That begins to spiral because now people, seeing that a DVD is coming out or hearing it's coming out, decide to wait for the DVD--just a small percentage of the people, but eventually the end is the theaters go bankrupt.",
        "So there are several solutions on the table.",
        "And one of them, the first one, involves eliminating the so-called `window videos.",
        "So tell us more about that.",
        "Well, you know, there were no windows 20 years ago.",
        "Windows basically are a way that the studios release their movies in sequence to different media.",
        "So first it goes to the movie theaters, then it goes to the video shops, then it goes to pay-per-view, then it goes to pay TV, and then it goes to regular TV.",
        "And those different windows are basically delays.",
        "Now as the movie audience gets smaller and smaller--now we're back to the death spiral--the argument of the home entertainment divisions are `Why should we delay our release at all?",
        "We're a retail business.",
        "So there's tremendous pressure: `Let's do away with the windows.",
        "Let's just sell--have everything come out all at once and sort itself out.'",
        "And what's wrong with that?",
        "Well, the first thing is that it'll kill the movie theaters and send them into bankruptcy.",
        "The movie theaters are in the business of traffic: people going through, buying a ticket, and then buying popcorn and soda.",
        "And theaters have fixed costs.",
        "They have to pay rent and leases and interests and employees.",
        "If the audience is reduced by even 5 or 10 percent, they all go into bankruptcy.",
        "In 19--pardon me--2001, half the theaters in the world were in bankruptcy.",
        "So that brings us to the second proposal that you're calling the `\"\"Godfather\"\" scenario.'",
        "Right.",
        "Now what some very clever people in the studios have said is, `Look, as long as we're keeping the theaters in business, they should pay us.",
        "We should offer them a deal they can't refuse.",
        "They give us a bigger percentage of the box office, and we guarantee not to release the video for six months.'",
        "That sounds pretty good."

        "Well, it would be pretty good, except the theaters, they can have the worst of both worlds.",
        "They now pay more money to the studios, and for all they know, people are still going to wait for the DVDs.",
        "They have no guarantee, and they lose their profit margins.",
        "So the theaters are simply not going to go along with it.",
        "OK, so the third proposal is a compromise?",
        "Well, the third proposal is to have different windows for different movies so that a movie that's very successful--let's say \"\"Madagascar\"\"--and doing very well in the theaters, they keep the window for six months.",
        "And then they do a triage like they do on the battlefield.",
        "And movies that even in their focus groups and their pretestings before they're released don't look like they're going to have much word-of-mouth and much audience, they send them to the theaters for a token period--'cause that's in the contracts--and then they send them direct to DVD or video.",
        "So there are three different scenarios, but none of them seem that they could work.",
        "None of them would work?",
        "So what's Hollywood going to do?",
        "If they're talking about cable stations, which are - essentially have national schedules as opposed to local schedules in terms of what hours of the day things are programmed, something that's shown at 10 o'clock at night may well be shown at 7 o'clock at night on the West Coast.",
        "Well, it means there's a whole host of issues that they're not going to simply be able to regulate very easily.",
        "A lot, yeah.",
        "I mean, I talked to a number of people.",
        "What they're saying is that it's kind of now a cycle where people are getting laid off.",
        "And so they don't have enough money.",
        "And so there's even fewer people to buy homes.",
        "And that's, again, having this knock-on effect on other industries.",
        "I went in to talk to a woman who runs an appliance shop, and she sells flat-screen TVs.",
        "And she said that sales were so bad that now if you come in, she'll sell you a flat-screen TV.",
        "And if you buy one, then she just throws in a free refrigerator.",
        "So when you talk to these guys, you say have you ever seen anything like this in your life?",

        "This is as bad as it's ever been.",
        "Is the basic strength of China's economy - or at least what we thought China's economy would be for the future - shaken at the same time?",
        "Well, we don't know that yet, and it's a great question.",
        "I mean, what we're seeing here and why I wanted to come here is this is kind of the old industrial base that has driven the economy for so long.",
        "And what's happening is that has been trailing off.",
        "And the government does want to make that transition to a consumption-driven economy.",
        "The problem that I'm seeing here is that this is dropping off a lot faster than the government ever thought.",
        "That said, this is an incredibly diverse economy now.",
        "So, like, where I am is really, really bad.",
        "But when you go back to Shanghai, where I live, the malls are full.",
        "People have a lot of money.",
        "It's almost like flying from Shanghai to here was like going to another planet.",
        "So we now see, like, the consumption economies on the coasts and the big cities is pretty strong.",
        "But you're seeing sort of the older economy really, really sliding.",
