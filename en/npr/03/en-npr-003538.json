        "So Congress isn't going to come up with anything very soon then.",

        "Usually, it's in some kind of harmony or parallel with what the character's supposed to be experiencing.",
        "But sometimes it's a kind of counterpoint in which what the character is saying and what the character is, in fact, supposed to be really sort of feeling is revealed through the use of the cigarette, which speaks in so many ways in social circumstances.",

        "I would agree.",
        "I mean, as an artistic statement, it does make sense.",
        "And since it's prevalent in society, it would make sense that a reflection of society would have cigarettes in it.",
        "Yup.",
        "And it's also the companies who've spent so much effort trying to develop these brand images.",

        "So I wouldn't want for a moment to appear to be an apologist for the cigarette companies or to want to encourage people smoking, but I think as realists, we have to recognize the fact that it is a adult pleasure which has spread around the world.",
