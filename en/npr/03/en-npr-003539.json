        "I just - I'm a non-smoker, first of all, and I just wanted to comment that one of the movies that would probably - if they had a rating system in effect for smoking - it would probably get a PG rating, was the movie called \"\"Thank You for Smoking,\"\" because it was of course a parody and on what smoking does for society and how we push it so hard.",
        "And yet no one smoked in the movie, even though the main character that was portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, I believe?",

        "The danger of seeing someone smoking in a movie is so far outweighed by the danger of extreme, gratuitous, gory violence being glorified in movies that it is ludicrous if there's any outcry at all about smoking.",
        "Perhaps we should call it a smokescreen.",
        "Which raises a question, Richard Klein, and that is if smoking is now to be - not to be glorified along with sex and violence, boy, the movie ratings have been so successful in suppressing the amount of sex and violence.",
        "So successful in suppressing them.",
        "I mean, one of the facts that always sort of astonishes me is that if there had been television, let's say, in 1935, we could be assured that television would have been able to represent people smoking - smoking furiously, passionately, constantly in all kinds of important positions in the world.",
        "But they would not have been allowed to be seen drinking.",
        "Drinking advertisement was forbidden, of course, during Prohibition.",
        "But smoking was generally encouraged by society.",
        "And here we are, you know, some 60 or 70 years later, with exactly the reverse situation.",
        "And the only thing that it seems to prove is the inveterate sort of tendency of puritanical America to censor adult pleasure.",
        "And by making it taboo, make it attractive to teenagers.",
        "Absolutely, because that's the double bind, as it were, the -what's really, I think in some sense going on, that the more the media censors cigarettes, the more alluring it's bound to be to adolescents who see instantly the hypocrisy of the society where they look around them and they see people at all sort of levels of society smoking.",

        "And so do you think the movies will change and have characters based upon non-smoking characters and have characters developed that way?",

        "But this time, the FCC is hoping to expand its reach into cable and satellite TV, as well as conventional broadcast channels.",
        "The FCC report is a result of a three-year study commissioned by members of Congress.",
        "NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik joins us in the studio now to sort through the FCC study.",
        "David, are there any standards right now for violence on television?",
        "Well, there's, sort of, a rather tepid voluntary rating system in place that the networks agreed to allow this V-Chip to work in the remote controls.",
        "The study seemed to show that these are hopelessly ineffective, that parents don't really get it and kids probably understand it a lot better than parents and may well use the ratings to find the shows that are a little more racy.",
        "But, you know, the best gauge that networks have on whether or not something is too violent is whether or not they have good ratings for it, whether or not people decide to watch the show.",
        "So how did this report from the FCC come about?",
        "Well, a number of members of Congress actually several years ago in both parties asked the FCC to take a hard look at this.",
        "And one of the things they asked was is there a way to regulate violence, as we do other kinds of things particularly indecency?",
        "The study was, in some ways, prompted by this growing consensus by policy makers and politicians that children need to be prevented from watching violence, from absorbing it from all these venues particularly television, because they sit parked in front of TV sets so much.",
        "But, you know, also videogames and movies and other places as well.",
        "They did a broad overview of these studies at the FCC, and they came to the conclusion that there appeared to be a link between the amount of violent television that's consumed by children and the amount of aggression that these children exhibited.",
        "What was interesting is the Congress, I think, wanted the FCC to come up with the definition for violence that could harm children, and the FCC didn't come up with the definition, but said Congress can do it."

        "The cable operators, if they can force you to buy 40 channels at a pop for one fixed fee, they're happy to do that rather than allowing you to say I only want the ABC Family Channel and ESPN.",
