        "Several years ago, psychologist Karen Levine was attending a conference on Williams syndrome that was open to both researchers and people with Williams.",
        "And one of the activities on offer was a boat tour of the San Diego Harbor.",
        "And so Levine says she, her colleague Sara, and about 20 adults with Williams crowded onto this small, sturdy boat and set off.",
        "We were out in the harbor and everybody was having a good time.",
        "And all of a sudden, everybody except Sara and I looked to each other and gasped, and they kind of held their arms out to each other - like, oh, my goodness, what happened?",
        "Karen frantically scanned the boat: nothing.",
        "The water: nothing.",
        "The issue, explained the people with Williams, was a sound, a sound that only they would be aware of.",
        "Turns out, way off in the distance on the shore, there was a siren - there must've been a fire engine or an ambulance or something - and all the people with Williams syndrome had heard that.",
        "Consider this story from a Williams specialist named Barbara Pober, based out of Mass General in Boston.",
        "It was a typical clinic day, and the next patient walked in and he immediately asked me: What's wrong, Dr. Pober?",
        "You look sad.",
        "In fact, just that morning Pober had gotten some terrible news that she'd resolved to hide from her office.",
        "And all day long, none of her colleagues had any clue - none, until her patient with Williams.",
        "It's part of the complexity that is Williams syndrome.",
        "Patients are very in tune, very empathic, very sensitive to the emotions of others.",
        "It's caused by a deletion of around 26 genes on a single chromosome.",
        "This deletion produces real strengths but also serious medical, emotional and cognitive problems.",
        "For example, Prober tells me about very verbal teenager who recently came to her office.",
        "And said - and I remember it with great clarity - I've just seen a really nice reproduction of the Mona Lisa at the Museum of Fine Art.",
        "Yet, you know, this very same person couldn't navigate from the museum to the hospital, which is a straight shot with one turn."
