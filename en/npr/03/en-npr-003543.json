        "Would this be a Republican against Mr. Bolton?",
        "Well, it's certainly a Republican against Mr. Bolton, but whether he votes no is another question altogether.",
        "What he said was he believed that Mr. Bolton should come for an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor and that he wanted a chance to persuade colleagues there that this man is not the right man for the job.",
        "He urged his colleagues to send this nomination to the floor without a recommendation, which would be an extraordinary move.",
        "You normally do send them with a positive recommendation.",

        "Well, it's certainly not all right to the Republicans on the committee.",
        "It's not all right to the White House, and it's not all right to the Republican leadership, all of whom must be reeling right now because this was a devastating indictment of President Bush's nominee.",
        "What has come out in this three weeks of investigation, this delay, to look into Mr. Bolton's past?",
        "I mean, there hasn't been an absolute condemnation of him by evidence, has there?",
        "No, the Republicans certainly say there has not been an absolute condemnation.",
        "Even the Democrats will concede they have found no single smoking gun or silver bullet.",
        "What the Democrats are arguing and what Mr. Voinovich agreed with just now is that they have uncovered a pattern of conduct that Mr. Voinovich said he found seriously disturbing.",
        "He described Mr. Bolton as an ideologue who fosters an atmosphere of intimidation.",
        "He said he does not tolerate disagreement.",
        "He does not tolerate dissent.",
        "He noted that one State Department official who had worked with Mr. Bolton testified that he had never seen anyone at the State Department hate as badly as Mr. Bolton had.",
        "And also Mr. Voinovich said he'd been talking to State Department employees on a recent trip to Slovenia and they had told them they did not believe Mr. Bolton would be a good choice to represent the United States.",
        "Well, what about the rest of the members of the committee?",
        "I mean, do you think this is going to pass out of this committee?",
        "And what would happen if there were a tie vote?",

        "As I said, that would be highly unusual particularly--it's terribly embarrassing for the Republicans because this is, of course, a Senate controlled by the Republicans, and this is a committee controlled by the Republicans.",
        "And to have to send the president's pick for the United Nations to the Senate floor with no recommendation is terribly embarrassing and it means that there may be a very messy fight on the floor of the Senate.",

        "You know, some want to move on to policy initiatives and differences with the president - things like health care, wages, pay equity, the kinds of kitchen table issues that helped get them elected in 2018.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So let's talk about what we heard the president say in that clip earlier.",
        "He referenced that people out there - I'm quoting now - \"\"have done some very evil things.",
        "I would say treasonous things.\"\" Did the White House clarify who exactly he is speaking about?",
        "Well, the president and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham - you know, Graham called for a special counsel to look into this.",
        "And they're about things like the Mueller probe's roots, how the FBI handled the investigation, Democratic officials who floated the idea that there was evidence of collusion of the Trump campaign with Russia.",
