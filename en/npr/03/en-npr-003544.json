        "So there is this concept, this idea, known as a so-called suicide contagion, which is sort of a horrific notion.",

        "So suicide contagion is this phenomenon where one suicide then causes a spike in other suicides.",
        "So knowing about a suicide death in your family, in your community or hearing about the death of, say, a celebrity in the news or somebody remote to you increases the risk of somebody who is already struggling with suicidal thoughts.",
        "So, for example, in the four months after Robin Williams died, there was nearly a 10 percent spike in the suicide rate in the country.",

        "So you mentioned that just having proximity to an apparent suicide, hearing about it, can play a role.",
        "Here we are in the media talking about this.",
        "I mean, what responsibility does the media bear?",
        "I mean, how much can discussing things like this affect people who are already at risk?",
        "So it's not so much just talking about suicides but how we report an individual death.",
        "So if we talk about a death - the means of a death is difficult - that can cause - but talking about suicide as inevitable is bad but - because suicide is preventable.",
        "What can communities like Parkland and Newtown and other places that have experienced mass shooting do to prevent individuals from acting on these feelings?",
        "Look out for people who are struggling and help them get help.",
