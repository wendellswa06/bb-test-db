        "Hmm.",
        "I think she got to the point where she felt like they hadn't done much for me over the years, and my brother had spent so much money of theirs and never paid it back.",
        "And I told her that the emotional, you know, trauma that I would suffer if he was cut out of the will would be worse than if he was kept in.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So I have - you know, we got everything set up to where when she's gone, at least he does get something.",
        "What she did was she took whatever's left - she took the amount that he took away from that and gives that to me outright, and then everything else is split down the center.",
        "But I never - you know, we never anticipated being in this situation.",
        "I did have my parents write up wills, you know, to begin with and - but this has been a complete turn of events that I never anticipated.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Let me bring - ask you, Terry Hammond.",
        "Both of our last callers -we never anticipated these situations, yet we're hearing different kinds of stories.",
        "Obviously, parents - elderly parents in different kinds of circumstances, either non copus mentus or angry or, in Lisa's case, physically shot but still mentally sharp.",
        "Well, you know, a guardianship cannot start without some credible medical evidence of incapacity, and that is in virtually all of the statutes on guardianship.",
        "And so I think the first question is are the doctors properly assessing the person, the loved one, and determining their level of diminished capacity?",
        "Secondly, in each of the last two callers - or in every caller so far - we've had family disputes, and the courts are there to address the family disputes.",
        "And whatever the court's decision is, there's probably going to be one side or the other that's going to be unhappy and disaffected.",
        "We hear conversations here about wills and what's in the will and who's going to get what in the end.",
        "And keep in mind that here we are balancing the person's right - the alleged person of diminished capacity - that person's right to autonomy and self-determination versus protection that somebody wants to impose on them.",
        "And that is a very delicate issue to address.",
        "And that's awfully difficult for courts and indeed for doctors to decide when is it that you're incapacitated.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "And, you know, using the word incapacitated - that sounds like kind of an absolute term.",
        "But there are many, many cases where a person has capacity to perform many functions, but perhaps in one or two areas their capacity is diminished.",
        "And certainly in guardianship proceedings, the courts should be narrowly tailoring these guardianships to maximize the person's ability to make their own decisions and yet give them the protection in those specific areas where they need it."

        "A second thing you can do is create a durable power of attorney that will cover a whole range of other decisions - particularly financial, property, but other personal decisions.",
