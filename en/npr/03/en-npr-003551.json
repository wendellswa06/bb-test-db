        "In which case, what might be the recourse for somebody like John?",
        "Well, in which case, first of all one could call the local adult protective services agency which can investigate and see whether there is abuse.",
        "If there's money been taken or misappropriated in any way, wouldn't it be a case for the police?",

        "While the details of a file might not be public, they should be able to ascertain that.",
        "And also as part of the due process requirements in guardianship cases, ordinarily courts would give - whenever a petition is filed, courts would notify family members.",

        "And as a matter of due process there should be legal advocacy provided or ordered by the court on behalf of the person alleged to be of diminished capacity.",
        "And that attorney needs to advocate for the wishes of the client the attorney's been appointed to represent.",
        "In the case of these family disputes - and I'll add here with regard to Naomi's comment about adult protective services - the incidence of reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation is up by 20 percent.",
        "And the incidence of validations of abuse, neglect, and exploitation is up by 15 percent.",
        "And so there's a lot of bad stuff that is going on out there.",
        "And when in some of these scenarios we've heard people don't know what to do, they are suspicious of what's going on, certainly they need to call adult protective services.",
        "And, if necessary, go to the court and ask that a guardianship be initiated.",
        "In Texas here, we have a unique statute that actually allows a court to initiate a guardianship for the protection of a person alleged to be of diminished capacity.",
        "By the time that people get to the point that they are going to court on these issues, it can be very difficult indeed to extricate themselves from the court process, thus the need for that foresight and advanced planning."
