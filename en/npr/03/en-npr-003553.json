        "His sons, Justin and Ryan, are in the troop, and his husband, James Ord, is also a volunteer.",
        "Leaders, kids and the unit's chartering organization, Wasatch Presbyterian Church, welcomed Hempel and Ord even though at the time national BSA policy forbid their involvement.",
        "Hempel says everyone was just excited to have another parent involved.",
        "You don't come up to me and identify yourself, I'm a straight person in this gay troop.",

        "You floated around different parts of California working for the Panthers.",
        "I won't say - floated is the wrong word - but intentionally moved around to different headquarters.",
        "Los Angeles was known in Panther lore as the Red Zone.",
        "There were constant shootouts with the police, and 11 Panthers, one-fourth of all Panther fatalities from 1966 to 1977, died here.",
        "Explain to us what Los Angeles was like when you worked there for the Panthers, and what you were doing specifically?",
        "I guess it was the closest thing that you may experience in this country to being in a combat zone.",
        "We had to reinforce our offices; they were sandbagged.",
        "And one of our major functions there is we were organizing.",
        "We did that mainly through selling the Black Panther newspaper and organizing dozens of free breakfast programs for school children, and basically organizing young African-Americans around the issues of self-defense.",
        "Now when you talk about self-defense, you were dealing with the legalities of owning guns, marching with guns and dealing with laws that were not put on the books necessarily for black people, which made it very controversial for the Panthers to do what they did.",
        "What made you think you could get away with this?"

        "You were shot and wounded and tried to escape.",
        "Tell us about the circumstances of that day.",
        "That was in October 1977, and I was involved with the military arm of the organization and had been for about six years.",
        "I concocted a plot to kill a witness.",
        "The witness was testifying against Huey Newton, who had just recently returned from Cuba, where he had been in exile for about three years.",
        "And we had a plan to kill the witness the morning of his preliminary hearing, and the operation got botched.",
        "And I was wounded, another Panther was killed.",
        "And from that point on I became a fugitive, of which I was for the next three years.",
        "And then what happened?",
        "Well, I was a fugitive for three years.",
        "I turned myself in and I was convicted of felony murder.",
        "And I went to prison in California, and I served four years, eight months and nine days in the California Department of Corrections.",
        "Who were you as a man when you walked into prison and did it change by the time you walked out?",
        "When I got to prison I guess I was somewhat of a celebrity.",
        "Many of the people in prison knew of me from the streets of California.",
        "Ironically, when I got to Soledad I ran into almost my entire neighborhood.",
        "People I had grown up with, played Little League baseball with, Pop Warner football with, went to church with, and they were also incarcerated.",
        "But when I, you know, I guess when I got there I was still a combatant, I was an urban guerilla.",
        "And I was probably thinking about changing my life but when I, as soon as I walked into prison I realized that I was going to have to keep the same demeanor and behavior that I had when I was on the street.",
        "So what did the Panther movement accomplish in terms of considering violence or considering weapons as a tool of liberation?",

        "I just wonder a couple of things.",
        "One, do you ever regret being involved in trying to murder someone?",
        "And two, does your work now flow directly out of what you did during the years as a Panther?",
        "No, I don't regret anything that I did.",

        "Today, you know - well, you know, at one time we believed, you know, the organization was not going to last but the struggle was going to continue.",
        "So what form and shape would it take?",
        "And I think that you have a lot of people who were in the Black Panther Party who are involved in legislative practice.",
        "You have people who are urban planners, like myself, who are involved in community development.",
        "And a lot of the issues that we are promoting are very similar to the issues that were in the Black Panther Party's 10-Point Platform and Program.",

        "And that seemed to suit what we thought was the short attention span of children, that there would be these short segments, these bursts, and then what we called commercials, which were little spots to teach letters and numbers that were threaded through the hour, as if they were commercials, because children were used to commercial interruption.",
        "Where we were wrong, I think, and we were ill-advised, was telling us that two, threes and fours can't follow plot.",
        "And of course, that turned about to be totally wrong, and we do much more plot now on \"\"Sesame Street.\"\" The segments are not nearly as short as they were in the beginning.",
        "But at the beginning, though, you did something that would have been very unusual for - certainly for children's TV at that time; you put it in a distinct urban environment, and I mean, just things like Oscar the Crouch, coming out of a garbage can.",
        "Yeah, it was pretty, cutting edge, let us say.",
        "We decided not to have it in some magic house, you know, the way most children's programs are set, in a fantasy setting of some kind, or in the suburbs, as \"\"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\"\" was.",
        "And we were trying to reach all children, but the bull's-eye of the target, as we used to say, were intercity youngsters.",
        "Obviously, city children were watching all these shows set in the suburbs, though it was not their experience.",
        "So, children can move very fast between reality and fantasy, and it need not be their experience, because if you stop and think about it, very little is of their experience.",

        "Well, there was nothing near to \"\"Sesame Street.\"\" I used to listen - I don't think I listened to radio as a three year old.",
        "By four or five, my parents took me to movies with them.",
        "The only time one saw cartoons were at - when one went to the movies on Saturday morning.",
        "There would be cartoons before the feature.",

        "I don't know how it all worked, but I had a lot of adults and older siblings around me.",
        "So, I guess I was probably introduced to what one would be introduced to at that time in kindergarten.",
        "When you first started \"\"Sesame Street,\"\" or first got to thinking about it, were there moments when you were just inspired?",
        "People today would think, oh, Jim Henson walked in with \"\"The Muppets.\"\" Was that a moment of revelation, or did you not know what you had at the time?",
        "Oh, I knew; we knew.",
        "I had seen his work doing commercials.",
        "Inside the business ,it was known he was a genius.",

        "And I said, you think we could get him?",
        "We would not be around now, if we weren't self-supporting and that it was Jim Henson's Muppets that made us self-supporting."
