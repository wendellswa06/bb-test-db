        "There's an increasing shortage, plus the Chinese have been playing a little bit of hardball, first with Japan, and then with the U.S., not shipping some of it.",
        "And it's lead a number of people to look below the water for what are these kind of potato-looking rocks that contain some of these very valuable minerals.",
        "Now, is there a reason that we hadn't found those before?",
        "Or is there an issue with getting to them?",
        "They had been discovered before, if you will, by some British scientists in the 19th century, but it was thought that it was going to be too difficult to extract.",
        "And most recently, particularly some of the German scientists, have come up with new processes to not only extract these rocks that have the minerals in them, but then get access to the minerals easier and cheaper than you otherwise would."
