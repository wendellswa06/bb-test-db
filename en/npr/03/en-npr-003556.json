        "And so they're getting married quite a lot later, two-year engagement as well.",
        "And these are actually all factors that are - the good news for Will, you can tell this to your soon-to-be betrothed, is these are all factors that predict you're much less likely to get divorced as well.",

        "So, my colleagues and I, in an earlier study that came out this year, had found that physicians, attending physicians, weren't always good at picking up on cues that patients were giving about important things in their life that really needed to be attended to in order to plan the right kind of care for these patients.",
        "So we set out to find out if we could improve physicians' abilities to do that.",
        "And could you do that?",
        "We could.",
        "So in the study that just came out, we took the medical students at the University of Illinois at Chicago and divided them into two groups and trained half of the medical students with a workshop designed to sensitize them to the importance of patient context and give them some skills at listening for it and incorporating it into planning treatment.",
        "And that group did much better than the usual performance of our medical students.",
        "Can you translate to doctors, or do you have to just retrain medical students now?",
        "What about the old pros who are entrenched?",
        "Well, this is a great question, and our study focused on medical students, because we think that this problem is, in large part, a problem of training, and that it's an important thing to deal with early on in medical training.",
        "But we have another study going on now that's working with residents, and I expect at some point, we'll have a study that's looking at practicing docs, as well, and improving their skills.",
