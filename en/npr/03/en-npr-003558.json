        "What's the mood like in the center of the city?",

        "And people were definitely not filled with the joy of the season.",
        "I talked to some Christmas market vendors who said that customers were not lingering, that people would walk by and sort of glance at products, but they would hurry by.",
        "They weren't spending time.",
        "They weren't spending money.",
        "And one lady I spoke to who sold chocolates said last year had been a banner year, and this year, she just felt like the mood was definitely dark.",

        "And were these people supposedly linked to the Paris attacks?",
        "At this point, the Brussels public prosecutor tells us they are not linked.",
        "Now, they have actually charged two people with being the planners of this attack.",
        "They were arrested earlier this week, and they were formally charged today with planning of a terrorist attack, threatening a terrorist attack.",
        "Due to some extremist propaganda found in residence during searches, one of them was also charged with being a recruiter to take part in this attack.",
        "The six people arrested today - three of whom have now been released - we don't know yet what they're going to be charged with.",
        "But that said, this group of people, this plot, is not believed to be linked to the Paris attacks.",
        "Right after the Paris attacks in November, Brussels was on lockdown for a few days.",
        "Do you still get the sense of a very heightened security there?",
        "You do, and tonight is one good example.",
        "There are police patrols over the Grand Place.",
        "You've got infantrymen in the streets of Brussels guarding every embassy, in front of office buildings.",
        "And in fact, the police themselves were one of the targets of this plot that was broken up this week, and so now there are even infantrymen guarding police headquarters.",
        "So you do get a sense of a very heavy security presence.",
        "And that, of course, doesn't lend itself to joyfulness in downtown streets.",
        "The events that were canceled - these were officially organized parties.",
        "I assume private parties went on on New Year's Eve in Brussels.",
        "That's right, Robert.",
        "In fact, businesses have suffered a lot because of the terror threats and the shutdown of several days.",
        "And restaurants and hotels were very much advertising that the fireworks display may be off but they were going to be open.",
        "Hotels will be holding their own New Year's Eve festivities, and people are very much trying to make the most of it while under terror threat-level three.",
        "That's Teri Schultz speaking with us about Brussels' decision to cancel its New Year's celebration - despite that, Teri, happy New Year.",
        "Happy new year to you, Robert, and everyone at ALL THINGS CONSIDERED."

        "So this is a really great question, and the answer is somewhat, but not entirely.",
        "So we know that for two reasons.",
        "First, in our earlier study of practicing physicians, we sent actors to visit these physicians in their offices.",
        "So they didn't know they were seeing actors.",
        "They thought they were seeing patients.",
        "And in that study, we found that the amount of time they spent with patients affected whether they asked about these kinds of things but didn't affect whether they incorporated what they learned into the final treatment plan.",
        "In this study with the medical students, because we were using standardized patients at our clinical performance center, the time for each encounter was controlled.",
        "So we know that whatever difference we see here between our usual students and our trained students, it's not due to giving them more time to explore this with the patient.",
        "Now, it seems to me that it's one thing to pick up on these cues about the patient's life, but is the resulting care that much better when they do that?",
        "So that's an excellent point.",
        "If the physician doesn't get these cues, then they almost certainly won't be able to plan appropriate treatment for the patient.",
        "But even if they ask about these cues, even if the physician probes them and finds out the key information, they still may not incorporate that into their treatment plan.",
        "And our studies suggest that that's a harder thing for physicians to do when the information is information that's unique to the patient about their context than when it's information that's really about the medical situation of their disease."

        "Should the doctor just sit there and listen without interrupting?",

        "Well, we train our doctors to listen for these cues and then to explore them with the patient.",
        "So I think that the point is very well made, that physicians do need to do a lot of listening.",
        "And they're trained, I think, quite well in general to do that kind of listening.",

        "Yes, my colleague, Saul Weiner, and myself and my other colleague, Ilene Harris, who are involved in the study that just came out, have a study ongoing where we're looking at resident physicians - so they've left medical school, but they're still supervised in their practice - and applying our training to them and seeing if we can improve their ability to do this, not only with these actors, but also with their actual patients.",
        "Interesting.",
        "And as far as that point you made about firing your doctor, is that something you, as a patient, should be watching for when you talk to your doctor, that he or she is following up and listening to you?"
