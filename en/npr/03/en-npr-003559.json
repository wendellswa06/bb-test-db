        "Mvula's debut album, \"\"Sing to the Moon,\"\" comes out today here in the U.S.",
        "and critic Oliver Wang is also gushing about it.",

        "You're not sure for what but the moment is awesome, with the emphasis on awe.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"\"LIKE THE MORNING DEW\"\")",
        "On paper, \"\"Sing To the Moon\"\" may seem like yet another album by a young, big-throated British singer but it sounds like practically nothing else out there.",
        "It's not exactly pop or soul or jazz.",
        "It's all those things, yet transcends those things.",
        "Over the course of the album, you might be swept into the intimacy of an after-hours speakeasy.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"\"MAKE ME LOVELY\"\")",
        "The album's baroque, velvet textures and atmospheric ambiance perfectly complement the lush, smoky curls of Mvula's voice.",
        "But even more mesmerizing is how this former choir director sublimely weaves her bandmates' voices with her own, helping to make seven people sound like seventy."

        "But she wraps these familiar themes with enough mystery and metaphor to make \"\"Sing to the Moon\"\" feel deeply romantic while avoiding the boilerplate cliches of dime store romances.",

        "There are no over-the-top diva ballads or fist-pumping club beats.",

        "So what is full employment?",
        "Well, that phrase basically means that the number of people seeking jobs is in balance with the number of job openings.",
        "So it doesn't mean that unemployment is zero - that's never realistic - but you can get pretty low.",
        "So if economists don't mean zero unemployment when they use the phrase full employment, what do they mean?",
        "(Laughter) So - well, in their math, it's about 4.6 to 5 percent because that's where you have churn in the market.",
        "Some people are quitting, some people are getting hired.",
        "But there's churn, but not despair.",
        "And in December, we saw the national rate was 5 percent, and a lot of predictions are that it'll be 4.6 percent by the middle of the year.",
        "So bingo, we're there.",
        "But does that mean that most people who want a job can get one?",
        "In fact, we've already seen stories, for example, in the media about how certain workers are still having a really difficult time finding a job.",
        "Like minority teenagers, for example - the unemployment rate is quite high.",
        "Women over a certain age, the unemployment rate is still quite high.",
        "Is it really fair to use the term full employment when that doesn't really seem to match the reality that a lot of people are experiencing?",
        "Those words can hit hard, and they can hurt because it sounds like well, you're - you must be doing something wrong.",
        "But really, unemployment is very regional.",
        "In West Virginia, I looked at some statistics, there are counties where the unemployment rate is 13 percent.",
        "That's Depression level.",
        "You know, and meanwhile in California's Silicon Valley, there's virtually no unemployment.",
        "And as you say, you point out that the difference is based on age - black teenagers, unemployment rate is 21 percent.",
        "For women of any color, if you're over 50, studies show you have a tough time getting back into the workforce.",
        "You become long-term unemployed.",
        "It can take months, years.",
        "And besides age and location, more than anything, education determines your unemployment rate.",
        "For college graduates, it's 2.3 percent unemployment.",
        "For high school dropouts, 7 percent.",
        "So that's a huge difference.",
        "So before we let you go, is what economists now call full employment something that a lot of Americans are going to still experience as something very unsatisfying?",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "The jobs (laughter) you know, if you're a 30-year-old with a college degree and a U-Haul, you are all set.",
        "You can find jobs.",
        "If you want to go to night school and you want to move, you can be part of that full employment economy.",
        "But the reality for a lot of people is that's very hard, especially women in their 50s.",
        "They tend to be at the center of kind of an ecosystem financially, emotionally, where they have aging parents depending on them, children depending on them, grandchildren.",
        "So it's tough to move, and that's why it hurts to hear those words like full employment.",
        "That's NPR senior business editor Marilyn Geewax.",
        "Marilyn, thanks so much.",
