        "I mean, how did you go about narrowing it down to say, yes, it's because of this law?",
        "Well, we wanted to first statistically control for other things that might explain changes in the homicide rates, so we controlled for policing levels, incarceration rates, unemployment, poverty and changes to other laws that some studies show are related to homicide rates.",
