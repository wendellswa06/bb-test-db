        "People are still in shock.",

        "Yes, we did.",

        "We found, basically, a twofold increase in the proportion of guns that were being recovered from criminals in crime scenes that had been purchased after the repeal of this law when there's less accountability in the system.",
        "So this increase was 23 percent for firearm-related death in Missouri, but what was going on nationally or even in the border states?",
        "Well, the trends in the border states and nationally were in opposite direction.",
        "Bordering states aggregated saw a 2.2 percent decline in firearm homicide rates during that period and nationally there was a 5.5 percent reduction in firearm homicide rates."

        "Well, we've done studies in the past that looked at these laws in particular and their association with keeping guns from being diverted to criminals and we've found, and very consistently, that these are probably the most effective single tool for preventing diversions of guns to criminals.",
