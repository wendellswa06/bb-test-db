        "We've rushed into globalization without looking at what it meant for our own fundamentals, and so we end up with a situation where some of our bread-and-butter companies are having major economic problems.",
        "GM is not the only one, but certainly the number of jobs that they're cutting by attrition, 25,000, is extraordinarily significant, in addition to the fact that they may have some pension liability with Delphi, because that was a spin-off company.",
        "So we look at those things; it really does force us to look back at our basic economic model, which is something we simply have not done.",
        "We assume that free markets are going to take care of all this for us, and they will in the long run.",

        "If you're talking about children, you're talking about 60 percent of them.",
        "And they said that they're going to target men having sex with other men because they did, I think, a survey of about five cities--yeah, five cities.",

        "And even more troubling, 67 percent, two-thirds, didn't even know it.",
