        "...in a criminal trial, you--the standard is beyond a reasonable doubt.",
        "In a civil trial, which is a question of damages, not in terms of your freedom, the issue is: Can you prove this person did something, an act, a wrongful act by a preponderance of the evidence?",

        "I mean, I don't pay O.J.",
        "too much mind, although he was acquitted.",
        "But I would say this; we've seen ways that the various court systems, civil, criminal, federal, state, are used to reinforce that which is perceived to be wrong.",
        "We've seen it in civil rights trials and we've seen it in other trials.",
        "So it's a little premature for us to start saying, `Oh, we don't like this.",
        "Let's look carefully at whether or not we think we're talking about double jeopardy or we're talking about different standards of proof.",
        "You know that in civil rights trials, we've seen people tried, you know, acquitted by racist juries, but then, you know, reinvestigated and found guilty on federal charges.",
        "So that's not necessarily double jeopardy and we may want to be very careful before we throw this technique out the window.",
        "Well, the Supreme Court has said, with respect to federal prosecutions on civil rights grounds, when you deprive someone of their civil rights because of their race, etc., the Supreme Court has said that the federal government, which is a separate sovereignty--the federal government may prosecute independent what the state does.",
        "So if the state prosecutes you for murder and you don't get--you get off, the federal government, if there's a civil rights...",
