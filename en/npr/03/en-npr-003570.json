        "The company does go bankrupt.",

        "Yes and no. Romney's original claim was that he created 100,000 jobs.",
        "That's not a claim Romney can make because Bain Capital isn't keeping its jobs information private.",

        "It kind of happened.",

        "And there is a kind of a lot of sort of foggy thinking in the middle that it's neither clearly planned nor clearly unplanned, and what we know is that unless you're really dedicated to the notion of not getting pregnant, life happens.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And another question that I guess a lot of people have, is the media to blame?",
