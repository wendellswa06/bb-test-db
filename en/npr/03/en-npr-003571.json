        "And back then, was the pregnancy planned?",
        "Did you intend to get pregnant?",
        "I certainly did not.",
        "But then again, I didn't really take the necessary precautions to prevent such thing from happening.",
        "There was a question for a number of years as whether or not she had intentionally gotten pregnant, despite whatever minimal efforts we took to not do so, but as it turns out, that was just rumors and speculation.",
        "However, it turned out such that it did that, you know, I was a child raising a child by myself.",

        "So it did not make the couple, you and your girlfriend, closer together?",
        "In fact, we were separated before he was born.",
        "And he came to live with me for the remainder of his life after he was about five months old.",
        "So I think I've had - I don't know, sort of a unique experience with regard to a single father situation where I just basically took the reins.",
        "She wasn't able to.",
        "And that's another thing.",
        "What kid really is able to encompass something that is such an enormity like that?",
        "I personally don't know.",
        "And he is now older now than you were then?",
        "Indeed.",
        "He's 20.",
        "He's married.",
        "He's in the army and he's in Germany right now, actually.",
        "He turned out to be, despite all of our difficulties with him growing up, a wonderful person.",
        "He's an amazing young man, and I wouldn't - really wouldn't undo it for anything except to maybe wait a little while longer.",
        "Sarah?",
        "And you know, that's really a wonderful story in many ways.",
        "It sort of sounds like it had a tough beginning, but many teen parents will say, people who were teens at the time, that they did their very, very best, and many of them struggle heroically.",
        "The outcomes aren't always quite as good as yours and it's always wonderful to hear happy stories.",
        "And what we often say is, that's wonderful.",
        "For many people, it's a much tougher road ahoe(ph).",
        "But everybody agrees that waiting a little bit would have been better.",
        "Almost every teen parent will say two things.",
        "I adore my child - and we are so glad they do.",
        "Children need deep amounts of love and support - but almost invariably they'll say, I wish I had waited.",
        "And they may not be clear about exactly how old they would have been.",
        "Some of them would say married, whatever, but people understand that babies need adult parents.",
        "And increasingly, in this very tough economy, the prime value of education has never been greater.",
        "It is essential that people not only graduate from high school now but actually get training beyond that or their chances of staying out of poverty are minimal.",
        "It's a very tough time now to get an education interrupted.",
        "In fact, I have a few friends who were in the same situation a little bit later in life and some of them are really struggling, even much more so than I did, and there are two parents in the household.",
        "I would say that most young people are just not prepared for that kind of thing."
