        "No.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And I feel like, you know, some of the decisions about - or some of the things that are included in the kit you could actually do without.",
        "You know, if you break your arm falling in the middle of a flight, I suppose, you know, do you really need a splint emergently or could you wait until you land and not something bulky?",
        "Whereas having, you know, a glucometer to check somebody's blood sugar, to me that's something that would be useful to have.",
        "We're talking about what happens on aircraft and of course, the situation - you're at 35 - 40,000 feet.",
        "That alone creates some conditions.",
        "It does.",
        "So you do have a drop in your oxygen saturation.",
        "You have lower pressure of oxygen in the cabin.",
        "And for most people, you don't really notice the difference.",
        "You feel basically the same.",
        "Maybe a little more tired than you might usually.",
        "But for somebody who has heart or lung disease, that change in pressure can be significant.",
        "And one guideline, sort of, rule of thumb you can use if you're going to travel and you have a history of heart or lung disease, is can you climb a flight of stairs or walk 50 yards or so without getting short of breath?",
        "And if you can't, that lower level of oxygen on the plain is probably going to affect you.",
