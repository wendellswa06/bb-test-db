        "He writes: These protests were historic in a number of ways in that they appealed to the president in advance of the start of the war, and that they were utterly ignored by him despite their global scale and that ultimately, the protesters' misgivings about the war proved to be correct.",

        "Either way, I think the loss of so much innocent life, irrespective of nationality, deserves more airtime than the number of barrels of oil produced or megawatts of energy output."
