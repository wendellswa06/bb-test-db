        "Well, during the normal part of the season in March, we might see 20 to 30 people a day.",
        "Now, the last seven, eight days of the season, we'll see anywhere from double to triple that.",
        "So 70 to 100 people a day or clients a day.",
        "In Ivory Coast today, after months of violence and political turmoil, Alassane Ouattara has been officially inaugurated as the new president of that country.",
        "Ouattara defeated Laurent Gbagbo back in an election in November, but Gbagbo refused to step down, prompted months of violence between military factions loyal to each man, and at least a thousand Ivorians were killed in the fighting.",
        "Gbagbo was arrested last month, and now the new president, Alassane Ouattara, has to figure out how to unite a divided country and military."

        "Things are much calmer in that people aren't being killed in the numbers every day, as we saw in March and April in Ivory Coast.",
        "But, of course, now you've got this myriad soldiers, former militias, former rebels who were meant to be part of the national army.",

        "Is there talk of reconciliation, some kind of process, or are there whispers of retribution?",
        "You know, whichever figures you take for the results of the elections, Ouattara and Gbagbo got about 50 percent each.",
        "Yes.",
        "Ouattara, 54, Gbagbo, 46, give or take.",
        "So about half the nation supports him, and half the nation supports Ouattara.",

        "Ouattara has pledged to set up a dialogue, truth and reconciliation commission.",
        "But at the same time, he says that those who were responsible for the violence and the killings in Ivory Coast will be investigated.",
        "That has started.",
        "And now there's also talk of Ouattara saying that the International Criminal Court should be involved.",
        "So we're talking about international justice and justice at the local level.",
        "There are also questions, I gather, about whether he can wrangle what has been a pretty fractured military.",
        "He does have a prime minister with some influence in some parts of the military.",
        "You say that might actually make things more complicated, having a prime minister with ties to the military."
