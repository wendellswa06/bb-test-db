        "In that case, as in New Orleans, the levees were designed by the Army Corps of Engineers and then turned over to a local government entity.",
        "In New Orleans, it's the Orleans Parish Levee Board that owns and maintains the levee system.",
        "In cases he's been involved with, Rogers says it's typical that it's not just the levee authority that is sued but also insurance companies, contractors, state entities--in short, any group or individual with any possible connection to the levee failure.",
        "Because Louisiana's governor appoints members to the levee board, lawyers expect the state with its deep pockets to be at the table.",
        "As a federal agency, the Army Corps of Engineers is mostly immuned from lawsuits, but Rogers says that doesn't mean that they won't be named.",

        "And the second cross-section adheres to the first, and the third to the second, and so forth.",

        "So when the build process is finished, the parts are inside, in this case, the powder, and you remove the powder, and then your parts are inside.",
        "There are systems that will print a polymer, a plastic material with an inkjet print head, and so it deposits layer by layer in the same fashion.",
        "And then at the end, there's some extra material that you have to remove, because it can have overhanging features that need to be supported.",
