        "It's really a fundamental way of thinking of manufacturing, because in the past - well, even today, a lot of products are built in the thousands or millions at a big organization where you have hundreds of thousands of people coming to that location, and now, if you can imagine an individual having a personal factory in his or her home or dorm room or small office somewhere.",
        "But is that going to mean fewer jobs?",
        "I mean, it's some people take advantage, and other people get hurt by this.",
        "I mean, what's this going to do to China?",
        "Well, I think if you're wanting to buy a trashcan or equip a stadium with stadium seats, you'll go to China or someplace else to get those because they're big, basic in shape, inexpensive items.",
        "But if you want more specialized, custom or semi-custom, limited edition products, or even small quantities of some type of product for aerospace, medical, some consumer products, then this makes a lot of sense.",

        "It put out the parts, and then assemble it, and it played.",
        "And it was pretty amazing what the capabilities of this equipment is.",

        "Well, we're already seeing companies in aerospace, such as Boeing, they're flying 22,000 parts made in this way on 10 different types of aircraft, both military and commercial."

        "Yes.",
