        "And yet, you know, there are some projections in this report that actually are really good news, that the world is increasingly becoming a middle-class society, that poverty is declining, that democracy, democratization is on the increase, that individuals are becoming more empowered.",
        "Those are some, you know, really positive trends.",
        "And so let me turn to Mathew Burrows.",
        "Buried in even some of those positive trends - I've been in the news business a long time - we can find some gloom.",
        "That development of tripling the size of the middle class from one to three billion, as some of the scenarios project, well, that includes people who are going to want to buy cars and eat meat.",
        "That's going to drive up demand for water, for fuel and for energy.",
        "Yeah, you put your finger on the real problem.",
        "One of the scenarios that we have in there, which is the most optimistic, and it's really where you get these huge strains on the resources.",
        "Now, there is somebody who can come to the rescue, and that is technology.",
        "But as the scenario points out, you need, actually, a lot of cooperation, a much higher-level of cooperation between countries, actually, to achieve, I think, those breakthroughs, and also, more importantly, the implementation of those new technologies to deal with those strains.",
        "And if the unipolar moment is over - the period of time in which the United States was predominate - that suggests, as you note in the report, we're going to have to reinvent the international system.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think this is - the big message for the U.S.",
        "is not that you're going to be replaced by another power.",
        "You know, I don't think that was the case, and certainly when we were in China, we got lots of pushback saying, you know, we are not your peer competitor.",
        "Don't look to us, either, for shouldering a lot of these responsibilities.",
        "So it's really going to be up to the U.S.",
        "to put together, as we talk about, these coalitions of state and non-state actors, really to pull together and deal with these global challenges.",
        "And that's extremely difficult in this world where, actually, power is being diffused.",
        "And Tom, there's obviously a lot - as we look ahead to the future - that's utterly unpredictable.",
        "We're not going to know.",
        "Technology, for example, as Mathew Burrows just pointed out, could change in unpredictable ways.",
        "Yet some of the trends seem inevitable: the graying of populations in places like Europe, for example, the explosion - what's going to happen to that big bulge of youth that's currently in parts of Asia and in Africa.",
        "Like all predictions, though, it can only be so precise.",
        "Critics point to inaccuracies and missteps in previous reports: failure to predict the attacks of September the 11th, the 2008 financial crisis, the Arab Spring, and wonder about the value of such reports.",
        "Can - what can you tell us about G.V.?",
        "Right.",
        "Those are basically immutable trends, but the title of the report is alternative worlds.",
        "And I think that this is one of the things that struck me is that depending on - there are a number of events that Dr. Burrows and his staff call game-changers that will dictate whether the trends move in a positive direction or in a negative direction, because these are such momentous and decisive developments, and we don't know yet which way they're going to go."

        "You know, the global economy is more vulnerable now because of all the interconnections.",
        "The global economy is more vulnerable to globally wide crises.",
        "And another global economic crisis could change the game in a pretty dramatic way.",
        "There is the impact of new technologies.",
        "I mean, one of the things that really struck me about this is that individuals - while individuals will be empowered, and that is part of the democratization movement, the impact of new technology is also negative in the sense that there is technology that is lethal, that has potentially lethal effects.",
        "And individuals are now going to be more capable of carrying out destructive acts.",
        "And we saw - I mean, we saw what one deranged individual in Connecticut did last week.",
        "We saw what one radical anti-Muslim figure in California was able to do by posting a video online.",
        "I mean, these are impacts that would not have been possible before we entered into this new era of technology.",
        "And there's another list - you mentioned game-changers - it's called black swans.",
        "These are individual things that could change dramatically: there's a severe pandemic, for example, the collapse of the eurozone as Greece exits messily and things get worse from there.",
        "There's, we should say, Mathew, a couple of good ones: reformed Iran and that China becomes much more democratic.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, I think on that list, the predominates are more on the negative side.",
        "And, obviously, I mean, this is one of the big trends is what Tom has been talking about, is the empowerment of individuals, but also the empowerment of bad guys who, through terrorism, through criminal activity and the fact that these disruptive technologies - like cyber, and then the very destructive, potentially, like bio - are much more accessible to the individual.",
        "And...",
        "Delivery systems like drones, which could become accessible to individuals.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I'm a longtime listener.",
        "I wanted to just, I guess, get the guests' comments on the availability of free Internet in much of the world, and I guess how that effect has already had on the Arab spring, and what effect do you think that's going to, I guess, play out over the next 18 years.",
        "Increased access to communications and the Internet.",
        "Mathew Burrows?",
        "Well, you know, this is back on the positive side of the ledger.",
        "I mean, this is incredibly beneficial, and certainly, we take this draft, before we publish it, on the road.",
        "We went to Africa.",
        "Here you find a continent, five years ago, we would never have thought that you'd have the proportions.",
        "And now you're up to 50 or 60 percent who have smartphones and then have access through smartphones to the Internet.",
        "And there, they're doing a lot more innovative things than we do, a lot of banking.",
        "A lot of NGOs use it to monitor health conditions, very remote areas.",
        "I mean, this is a spectacular change.",
        "Now, you know, you can get gloomy on this, and when I also presented the report in various places, there was a lot of pushback, saying OK, this is, you know, this connective-ness through the Internet, it's going to reinforce people's ethnic, religious identity.",
        "You're going to get a lot more conflict and tensions in countries.",
        "And that is true.",
        "I mean, that's probably the other side of the coin.",
        "But on balance, I think this is, you know, really positive and also something that five, 10 years ago, we really didn't understand just how quickly this was going to spread.",
        "You know, one thing, Mathew, when I talked to you when your report came out, one of the things you acknowledged was that having foreseen the democratic uprisings, in a sense, of the democratization move in the Middle East, you underestimated how rapidly it would develop.",
        "And you also, I think, underestimated - even though you saw the vectors of change, the direction of change in a number of places - you underestimated how fast these changes would take place.",
        "And I'm curious, you know, whether, in fact, technology like access to the Internet has accelerated.",
        "Is - how far does that go in explaining the fact that change is happening even more rapidly than you foresaw three, four years ago?",
        "It does.",
        "It is a big factor in why, previously, we've underestimated the rate and speed of change.",
        "I think, you know, particularly in the - when you're looking at development, I mean, this is a way for education to be really disseminated across, you know, well, whole continents now, I mean, where people can connect through the Internet and really find out what's going elsewhere.",
        "This is actually something I think that's putting enormous amount of strain on authoritarian states, and you see their efforts to try to control the Internet, and, you know, that in itself shows just how powerful an instrument it is.",

        "Perhaps the best advice comes from the editorial board of the Christian Science Monitor, which recommends the president read it in the Oval Office with a pinch of salt handy.",
        "On the other hand, on a day when many worry whether we're going to get through another day, we're talking about 2030.",
        "So what's the global trend you have on your radar?",

        "Well, I'm struck very much by how similar some of these trajectories are, and I appreciate the adoption of a scenarios(ph) type of view because of course none of us can predict the future, but it's certainly reasonable to project some long-term trends should current activities continue as they are now.",
        "And we've talked a lot about technology, but the report really hits on some very deep, fundamental things like demographic changes, like demand for natural resources that are so critical to shaping our future.",
        "And they've always shaped the course of human history in the past, and they will certainly continue to do so in the next 17 years."

        "And I wanted to ask you about one of the black swans the report includes - much more rapid climate change, dramatic and unforeseen changes already occurring faster than expected.",
        "Most scientists are not confident of being able to predict such events.",
        "Rapid changes in precipitation patterns, such as monsoons in India and the rest of Asia, could sharply disrupt that region's ability to feed its population.",
        "And Mathew Burrows, a lot of people think they're seeing some of these things already.",
        "Yes, I think this is the - in terms of the black swans, this is the scariest because we know in the past that climate change has tended to be very abrupt and fast.",
        "And so if that follows that pattern, then it opens the question whether you can adapt very easily and quickly to it.",

        "That's the easier part to model.",
