        "You know, so it's going to make it very hard to support, really, the - and have the same standard of living without huge increases in productivity.",
        "Laurence Smith, the - of course Europe, Japan, we think of those, but the one-child policy in China creates an unusual situation there as well.",
        "This is the really fascinating thing about the demographic aging trend around the world.",
        "I think many of us assume that this is an American or European problem.",
        "But in fact the U.S.",
        "and Europe have already completed much of their aging process.",
        "And this graying of the planet is now unraveling and unfolding in a very rapid and uneven way around the rest of the world.",
        "For example, China is definitely aging.",
        "It's projected - looking out to 2050, the median age is going to go up by a decade, from 35 to 45.",
        "But some other countries that we think of being useful sources of labor for the global labor market, for example, like Mexico and Vietnam, those countries are aging even more quickly, projected to increase 16 and 15 years respectively, out to the middle of this century.",
        "So ironically, the median age in Mexico by mid-century is projected to be older than the United States, as they'll be in their early 40s.",
        "So this is a global phenomenon and happening very rapidly in some surprising places around the world.",

        "And that is the prospect of what a solar storm, a really severe solar geomagnetic storm would do to electronics around the world and specifically in the case of Sonny's point, to the Internet.",

        "Yes, we found ways to increase the efficiency of agriculture, but there's come a point.",
        "And when we're having all this climate change, that gets pretty dicey.",
        "Well, the - it's certainly - I certainly don't want to get into the Malthusian argument, which seems to get delayed time and time again.",
        "But there's no question that the rising prosperity of the middle class, as had already been discussed, will significantly increase food demand around the world, out of proportion to the actual number of new heads and mouths to feed on the Earth.",
        "Because as people become wealthier, they tend to eat further up the food chain, which - well, it takes about pounds of grain to produce a pound of cow, for example.",
        "So we're on track of roughly doubling our food requirements by the middle of this century.",
        "And in many cases, water is the limiting supply.",
        "When we tend to discuss water issues, we think about shower heads and low-flush toilets.",
        "But, in fact, over 70 percent of human water consumption is for the production of food.",
        "And furthermore, water is a critical ingredient in the fracking revolution and the extraction of many of these unconventional energy sources that were just discussed.",
        "So this competition for water between food and also energy production is clearly one of the most pressing environmental challenges of the century.",
        "I wonder if you wanted to expand on that, Mathew.",

        "And if your panelists there believe that such a companion piece is useful, would be useful to decision-makers and policymakers, then who should be responsible for that kind of companion piece?",

        "For example, while there may not be a direct mandate in this case, they are widely read by think tanks such as the RAND Corporation, for example, which will use them to guide them in their planning and their pitches, essentially, to government sponsors.",
