        "We are getting back, in terms of state tax revenue, probably somewhere in the neighborhood of $25 million dollars a year, maybe even not that much.",
        "So it's roughly a four to one loss ratio.",
        "That seems like a pretty big loss ratio.",

        "We've been doing quite well.",
        "In the post Katrina and Rita hurricane environment, we've had quite a bit of a boom here, spending boom, reconstruction boom, federal money, insurance money has been in here, and we've actually been running surpluses.",

        "Now, we may be thinking a little more along those lines in the coming months.",
        "Lawyers say they believe tens of thousands of New Orleans residents could be represented in class-action flooding suits, and if those suits are successful, damages could run into the billions.",
        "Because of that, some who are filing lawsuits want Washington to create a victims' compensation fund similar to the one established by Congress after 9/11.",
        "Lawyer Mark Wasser was involved in lawsuits that followed the 1986 flooding in California.",
        "He says elected officials may be hesitant to create yet another victims fund, but without a fund, he says, battered New Orleans court system could break down under the strain of post-Katrina lawsuits."

        "So far, there are only local studies of the cat predation problem, according to Parr, and estimates of the number of animals killed by the average cat each year range widely.",
        "From just a few birds or mammals being killed by each cats, up to - in one study there was one cat that killed over a thousand small animals.",
        "To fill in some of those data gaps, the American Bird Conservancy is now asking the public to help them keep track of all the animals pets leave in front hallways around the country.",
        "The conservancy has created a Web site called Project Predator Watch, and Parr says the basic principle is simple.",

        "What we'd like to find out is exactly what's going on not only in our backyards but across the broader landscape and, ultimately, what can we do about it.",
        "All kinds of minor details could turn out to be important, says conservancy spokesman Gavin Shire, like whether a cat is wearing a bell, or whether it's been de-clawed, or whether it's got brightly colored fur."

        "That is the state with the worst graduation rate for black males, according to your study, just 25 percent.",
        "What's going on there?",
        "Well, I think you have to ask the question whether or not the state is putting in place the types of policies to provide black males the opportunities to learn, meaning access to early childhood education, highly effective teachers, college-bound curricula and equitable instructional resources because our data clearly indicates that when provided an opportunity to learn, black males perform well.",
        "There was an interesting statistic in this report with respect to the city of Detroit, its school district.",
        "It showed that there, the black male graduation rate was similar to New York, about 27 percent.",
        "But the white male graduation rate was lower.",
        "It was 19 percent.",
        "What accounts for that, do you think?",
        "You know, black males perform the best in places where they are small in number - North Dakota, Vermont - places where they can't be relegated or isolated to under-resourced schools.",
        "And when they are in places where they have the opportunity to learn, they perform on par.",
        "Likewise, when white males are in poorly resourced schools, they don't perform well.",
        "The message there is we've got to provide all students an opportunity to learn.",
        "There's an interesting sort of countertrend that you highlight in the report.",
        "It's about New Jersey.",
        "So in 2003, about 48 percent of black males were graduating from high school in New Jersey.",
        "Five years later, that number has jumped to 75 percent, which is quite extraordinary.",
        "Yeah, I think you hit on the tale of two states.",
        "In New Jersey, they were met with a lawsuit from parents and advocates, challenging the opportunity to learn.",
        "This is the Abbott versus Burke court case where essentially parents of primarily African-American kids, kids from poorly resourced schools, sued the state, and the judge found in their favor, that their schools were not receiving the same kind of funding and resources as other schools in the state.",
        "Right.",
        "And they made the tough decision to equitably distribute their resources, but not just give more money, but targeted in the areas where the dollars are most needed and in the areas that we know work."
