        "The second thing is, I think people who have been suffering from two illnesses are often terribly demoralized.",
        "They've been trying to get well for a long time, and they've not been able to do so.",
        "And so, giving them hopeful messages is really important, and it sounds like Angel got that also from the doctor that he encountered.",
        "And then the third thing is just to make sure people get both kinds of treatments at the same time, and that the treatments are tailored for somebody who's got co-occurring disorders, rather than a single disorder.",
        "When it comes down to practical issues, and just briefly, where do people turn particularly if they don't have the money to go to some big, fancy rehab center, specific organizations like New Directions, which Angel is a part of, do certain things for certain people, but if you think that your family member or yourself has part of this kind of confluence.",
        "Where do you turn?",
        "Well, most people get their treatment in the public-addiction or the public-mental-health system, if they have long-term disorders of any kind.",
        "And the problem there has been two-fold.",
        "First that these systems are grossly under funded, and second, the systems have been silo'd, that is the - tend to provide only mental-health services or only addiction services, and it's only been in recent years that there's been wide-spread recognition that these programs need to focus on co-occurring disorders, because about half of the clients that we see in either system have got co-occurring disorders, rather than single disorders.",
        "Angel, you are now someone who helps other people, and what do you tell them about the path, people with, you know, what we're calling co-occurring disorders or dual diagnosis.",
        "What do you tell them about the path they have to walk, and what they need to do to walk it successfully?",
        "I believe that there is - you know, it's just like somebody else told me that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and that people do recover from dual disorders, and that one of the things that I believe is that being medication compliant helps a lot, and having a support group which I'm part of, and also our program, what it does is that we - you know, we turn around veterans.",
        "In just the last year, we had 40 veterans that was - that were placed in jobs, and not only were we placing jobs, but we were able to, you know, assist them in - you know, in other ways.",
        "So, yes, that would be one of my main things, is that we do recover from mental illnesses, and find support groups and be medication compliant.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, Angel, Dr. Drake, thank you so much, and I just want to say we've been speaking with Angel, recovering addict who now works with New Directions and Robert Drake, professor of psychiatry at Dartmouth Medical School.",
