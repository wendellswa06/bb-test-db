        "Maybe another way to phrase that would be that in that situation, rather than exploding her marriage, she chose to defend her husband and her husband's political career.",

        "How do you think those religious beliefs have shaped her politics?",
        "I think she believes, and she said it many times, do all the good you can, at all times you can, in all the places you can.",
        "Many of her aides, however, came to think that that represented a kind of self-righteousness, as if she were leaning, you know, the less enlightened to the Promised Land.",
        "And other people, there's one very high official of the Clinton administration that I quote anonymously - most of them are quoted by name, but this is anonymously - as saying that she used it to justify her own actions in regard to her marriage, as well as her own actions if the greater good was to get health care.",
