        "Well, there are two main issues.",
        "The first issue is whether or not there were specific covert prisons on European soil.",
        "The second is whether suspects were transported illegally, through European air space to face interrogation in any of these centers.",
        "Now, tell us a bit about a scandal that seems to be brewing in London over a secret memo that was leaked that indicated that Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, may have known about these extraordinary renditions.",
        "This has prompted calls for more investigation and for a statement from Tony Blair to make exactly clear what he knew and when.",

        "That's normal after groundbreaking surgery, but in this case Ms. Dinoir's doctors were also defending themselves, charges that they cut ethical corners and rushed the surgery.",
        "Then there was applause after the doctor's report.",
        "Also present was Dr. Joseph Murray, who won a Nobel Prize for the first organ transplant ever."

        "Can you talk about the name?",
        "Because not only was the album controversial, but the name \"\"Bitches Brew\"\" was controversial, right?",
