        "The problem with that common definition is that it's an oxymoron: An inert pill can't have an effect.",
        "So what our team says is that the placebo is also hiding a very important phenomena: the clinical encounter.",
        "We think the placebo effect is the - a surrogate marker, or a way of measuring the effect of just caring for a person, the act of caring for a person.",
        "We think that it's - the placebo is about the words, the gestures, eye contact, warmth, empathy, compassion that a physician exchanges with a patient, a doctor-patient relationship.",

        "waiting, talking, disrobing, being examined and being treated by pills or surgery.",
        "Ultimately, we think the placebo is about the power of the imagination, trust and hope in the medical encounter.",

        "Well, that's what my work is, and that's what our program at the Beth Israel Deaconess and Harvard Medical School is trying to do, is that this is usually considered the art of medicine.",
        "It's in the background.",
        "People are mostly concerned about drugs, procedures and surgery, and our job is to quantify what's been hidden in the background and move it to the foreground, to make the human aspects of health care more prominent and optimalize them once we understand what they can do and how they work.",

        "And when I got there - my original training was in Asia - they talked about we have to find out whether this intervention, be it acupuncture, herbs or other kinds of alternative therapies, is more than placebo.",

        "The clear standard of ethics is transparency, respect for person and informed consent.",

        "A third aspect of my job is to figure out ways of lowering placebo effects, because one of the problems for drug development is that sometimes the drug may be effective, but it competes with the placebo effect, and it's very hard to detect the difference.",

        "And we brought them in every few days at one session, and at different times, we gave them an active bronchial dilator, albuterol, which is an effective drug for relieving asthma.",
        "Three times we gave them fake inhalator.",
        "Three times we gave them fake acupuncture, and three times we gave them no treatment, just sitting and doing nothing, because sometimes people get better by just sitting and doing nothing.",
        "We want to make sure that it's this - the placebo that's doing something, not just sitting and waiting.",
        "And we had a very interesting finding that actually we didn't expect.",
        "We found that when we looked at objective measures, the amount of air that's pushed out of the lungs in one second, we found that the real medication was - showed a great improvement.",
        "The two placebos - the placebo inhalator, the placebo acupuncture - had a little bit of improvement, and the sitting there and doing nothing had a little bit of improvement.",
        "There actually was no placebo effect at all on an objective measure on the pathophysiology of asthma.",

        "The fake inhalator was very effective, and the fake acupuncture was very effective.",
        "And just sitting there for two-and-a-half hours was - is very, very little.",

        "And it - we inferred to this, at least in this situation, that the placebo effect is mainly about how we experience things: symptoms, complaints, how we react to the underlying pathology.",
        "Whether this applies across the board I think is too early to say, but I think it can say - at least in this experiment - it looks like the placebo is about the experiences that patients have, not necessarily about the underlying pathology.",

        "Yeah.",
