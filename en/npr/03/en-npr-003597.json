        "And you're just putting it into a nice, big, clear, glass mixing bowl.",

        "And the big bowl is really important because this takes a long, slow rise, it will really, really puff up.",

        "So through the magic of radio, we happen to have, right here, a risen blob of dough, ready to be popped into the oven.",
        "Baggett pulls out a pot, a Dutch oven, any Dutch oven, that's been preheating, and she tests it to be sure that it's warm enough before tipping in the dough.",
