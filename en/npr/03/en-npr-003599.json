        "Lynn Dudley works for the American Benefits Council, an advocacy group for corporate benefit plans.",
        "Some will leave because the combination of funding and competition will force them to do it.",
        "Although most people think the accounting rules have to change, Dudley insists that Congress is going too far.",
        "She says the new rules would leave companies vulnerable to the ups and downs of the financial markets.",
        "It could also force them to set aside more money than is actually needed.",
        "And it makes it much harder from a business perspective to take money and invest it in jobs or invest it in research or in product development if you're having to set it aside in case you need it.",
        "Traditional pensions - which pay a fixed amount of money each month -were once the bedrock of the American retirement system.",

        "And he's being sued not because what he said was unflattering, because that's protected under the First Amendment, but they're now saying it wasn't a strip steak, that it was a rib-eye.",
        "And is this just a target of someone who has some power and the ability to change the business model of a restaurant by what he or she writes or what do you think is going on there?",

        "Can a restaurant critic really make or break a restaurant?",
        "Well, I think there are two things on that as well.",

        "Well, you know, you talk about the democratization, a word I wouldn't have chosen to say out loud on the radio, on - with blogging about food and the increase education of the average diner.",
        "On the other hand, do you think that there is, you know, a place for someone who's been to culinary school or served in the kitchen themselves to have an angle on this that the average diner doesn't?",
