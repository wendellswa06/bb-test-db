        "You know, hiking is one of those things where people either love it or they don't get it at all.",
        "It looks like it's glory or it's just a strenuous walk.",
        "We're asking our listeners to share with us, you know, why hiking has mattered to them and what did they discover out there, so I'm going to put that question to you.",
        "What do you find out there, you know, on the trail that really gets to you?",
        "John, I found a life.",
        "After a couple of years of hiking on the Appalachian Trail, I finally made it out to a place called Crestone in the Colorado Rockies.",
        "And high up on a hike, after a strenuous 4,000-foot elevation gain, I saw the most magnificent sunset of my life.",
        "It turned the western slope of the Sangre de Cristos a brilliant orange like I've never seen before.",
        "And I could only see that sight from where I was standing, which means you had to do the work to get the view.",
        "And it was an epiphany for me.",
        "I thought that, wow, if I can see this now, I'm going to see as much of this as I can.",
        "And from that point on, I hit the trail.",
        "And my reward has been a life of interesting travel.",
        "It's been the privilege to see some of the most beautiful sights in the world.",
        "And it's given me a fresh perspective on life.",
        "When we all stay in town and we work everyday and we do what we have to do to live, Taking a walk, taking a five-day backpacking trip can change your perspective.",
        "And not only that, John, but it can also restore your health and it can keep you healthy all your life.",
        "There just simply isn't any better exercise for your heart than walking uphill with a pack.",
        "So for me, it was a life-changing experience and one that I'm looking forward to another 20 or 30 years of doing.",

        "The temperatures down in the teens and it's cold, and I get back to the primitive me and I just love it.",
        "And I feel closer to God when I do that.",
        "So is it - Michael, is it the primitive you that your finding out there?",
        "Is that what draws you out?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And just like your guest just said, it's a time to get away from all the cares of the world.",
        "I don't go - I'm quoting someone here that - but I don't go to the woods to rough it.",
        "I go to the woods and snooze it.",
        "I get it rough in the city.",
        "Oh, interesting way to put it.",

        "What it does is it makes your life come down to eating, sleeping and hiking, and you just can't get much more simple than that.",
        "And that restores the spirit, in my humble opinion.",
        "It's work, though - or is that the word for it?",

        "I think that it does require some physical effort, but that's not the same as work.",

        "We couldn't walk as far every day as we thought, and we really wanted to go home and we couldn't.",
        "We had to stick it out.",
        "And so we learned that we could go far beyond what we ever thought, emotionally, we could survive.",

        "And on one of the notebook he wrote, I eat rocks for breakfast.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",

        "Janet, did you go on to continue hiking?",
        "I don't mean on that trip, but did you become a full-time hiker?",
        "Well, I was a full-time hiker before then.",
        "And the other thing I found out when I was on the trail, I was over 30 years old and I was pregnant.",
        "And so I've only done short hikes since then, but I still do a lot of hiking, day trips.",

        "No, I don't think I did because I sort of work up to it gradually.",

        "We all start out going too heavy.",

        "But through that, you have to find local fruits and local indigenous fruits.",

        "The only way you can find them is if you go hiking deep in the woods.",
        "And the only people that ever get them are people like us, people like - that are hikers, and showing my kids papaws was just absolutely one of the most funnest things I've ever done in my life.",

        "Sure.",
        "I've never backpacked on a trail, but I did a lot of plant collecting up in the Shenandoah National Park.",

        "I - one time, I flushed a quail or a pheasant or something that scared me to death.",
        "Another time, I came about nose to nose with a deer, and the deer really didn't move, and that was pretty cool.",
        "I came on a loaded bear trap - a barrel trap, and I was about a quarter mile down a fire road and backed very carefully back up the road and didn't frequent that part of the park again.",

        "Yeah.",
        "So I would concur, John, there are just so many surprises that one's going to encounter in any wilderness excursion, and a lot of them present a problem.",

        "If we flip it open, are we seeing maps and tips or photographs?",
        "How do you use a hiking book?",
        "In my books, John, I try to give everybody everything.",
        "I try to inspire them with beautiful images, with stories of my own hikes on those trails.",
        "I try to make it easy for them to go.",
        "My whole deal is to get people off the couch and into the wilderness, so I tell them where to go, how to go, where to start from, if you've got to fly.",
        "And I encourage people to do these hikes because I think that giving yourself the tantalizing appeal of an extraordinary hike is going to make it more fun to go hiking.",
        "So I try to encourage people, go to the Grand Canyon.",
        "Take that cheap flight to Las Vegas, drive to the trailhead an experience you'll never forget.",
        "The other side of that is if you can't do that, if you can't get out to one of these extraordinary hikes, do a hike in your local park.",
        "Just get out, and if possible, get out overnight, cycle through a sunrise and a sunset, remind yourself what the night sky looks like.",
