        "Being locked up for four months and not knowing whether it might actually be 18 months is an extraordinary thing, the psychological pressure of hundred hard days of solitary confinement with people who are ready to talk about killing you is an extraordinary thing, you know.",

        "After taking control of Gaza by force last month, Hamas turned up the pressure on the kidnappers and repeatedly demanded Johnston be released.",
        "I'm pretty sure that if Hamas hasn't come in and struck the heat on in a big way, I would still be in that room.",
        "His Islamic Army captors held the darkest view of everyone in the West, Johnston said, and were a horrible aberration from the hospitality and warmth he'd experience from ordinary Palestinians during his three years living in Gaza."
