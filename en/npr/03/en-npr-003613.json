        "The administration says it's reunified all the families it considers, quote, \"\"eligible.\"\" That's more than 1,400 children reunited with their parents, as you said.",
        "But it still leaves more than 700 children who are not reunified because their parents are considered ineligible, including more than 400 who are no longer even in the U.S.",

        "ACLU - the - excuse me - the American Civil Liberties Union which brought the case in the first place argued that the parents should get at least seven days after reunion with their kids before being deported so that they could weigh their options together, whether they wanted to be deported together or to leave the children here in the U.S.",
        "to pursue their own immigration cases.",
        "And the ACLU argued that was too momentous a decision to make in just a day or two.",

        "Indeed, in most states, one company has 80 percent to 95 percent of the market.",
        "Basically, consumers have one choice, and it's a take-it-or-leave-it price.",
        "So Shadegg came up with a simple idea.",
        "Why not let individuals in one state buy health insurance from companies regulated by other states?",
        "Not only would that create some competition that could force premiums down, he says, it would also let individuals decide how much coverage they want.",
        "This will let people in the individual market have the choice of buying a kind of a basic policy that covers the big things that they're really scared of, but does not include everything that their state currently mandates as a benefit.",
        "So if their state mandates hair replacements, they can say, `You know, I'm just going to hope that I don't get a disease that causes my hair to fall out, and if I do, I'll buy my own wig.'",
        "But Democrats, who spent more than eight hours debating the bill at a committee work session last week, say the measure would do more harm than good.",
        "The problem isn't hair replacement, says Congressman Sherrod Brown of Ohio, but ailments that can be much more serious and that may not be covered by cheaper policies.",
        "People want to know if they buy an insurance policy, if they have a health problem, whether it's diabetes or whether it's cancer or whether it's any kind of disease they didn't expect to get, as most people don't, that they will in fact have insurance for it.",
        "If this bill becomes law, all kinds of Americans are going to find out at the wrong time that they don't have the insurance they thought they had."

        "Does it mark a purge of gay priests?",
        "No. In fact, it says nothing about already ordained gay priests.",
        "The Catholic theology is that once you're ordained, you're ordained for life; you cannot be unordained.",
        "And so this does not in any way affect the status of currently ordained gay priests.",
        "It is, instead, an instruction addressed to bishops and seminary rectors, that is men in charge of training future priests, telling them what kind of men they ought to ordain and what kind of men they ought to exclude.",
        "And as you said, the heart of its message is that men who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies should not be ordained priests.",

        "No, but I think probably that's caused a bit less controversy because although we don't know precisely what it means, I think in practice, if would mean if you have a candidate who is taking part in gay pride parades or who is going to gay bars, that that ought to be a subject of concern.",
        "And I think most seminary rectors or bishops would take that as a matter of common sense, and so it's not something that's generated much debate.",
        "Nor is the question, the other provision of the document's three provisions, that someone ought to be celibate for at least three years prior to ordination.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Again, I think most rectors or bishops would say that's sort of a commonsense rule of thumb.",
        "The hard part of the document, of course, is this question of deep-seated homosexual tendencies.",
        "And because the document itself doesn't define the term, it has left some degree of ambiguity, I suppose, as to exactly what it means.",
        "There would be one school of thought that would take a fairly strict constructionist reading, so to speak, that would say it essentially means anyone who has a kind of permanent identity as a homosexual ought to be ordained--or ought to be excluded from ordination, rather.",
        "And then there would be another camp that would have a slightly more liberal reading, who would say, `No, deep-seated means something like someone who is fixated on their sexuality, incapable of being mature about it,' but would leave open the possibility that someone who has a kind of enduring homosexual orientation could still be considered.",
        "And we've seen very prominent people in the church give voice to both readings in the wake of the document's issuance.",
        "Is that going to leave it up to essentially local control as to how this is interpreted and applied?",
        "Well, I mean, all church law in a sense is.",
        "I mean, it is a kind of standard feature of Vatican documents that they leave some room for local interpretation because, of course, the Catholic Church has got 1.1 billion members worldwide.",
        "It is very tough to make detailed policy that will make sense in every nook and cranny of the planet, and I think this document is probably no exception.",
        "I think what you will find is that bishops and seminary rectors who want to take a very strong sort of sweeping stance against the admission of homosexuals probably were already doing so, certainly will continue to do so in the wake of this document, but those bishops and religious superiors and seminary rectors who are inclined to take a bit more of a case-by-case approach will probably find enough latitude in the document to allow them to continue doing that.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, there's a team of bishops that's visiting all the seminaries in the United States to examine, among other things, whether or not homosexuality is pervasive in those institutions.",
        "Is there any word yet back on what they're finding or what they plan to report?"
