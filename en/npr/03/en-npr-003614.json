        "The issuance of this document, is it at all related to the sex abuse scandal in that--are homosexuals being blamed for the sex abuse scandal?",
        "I mean, is there any research to indicate that homosexuals are more likely to commit these acts?",

        "Yeah.",
        "John Allen, some gays have objected that they feel they're unfairly being scapegoated for this.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now it probably should be noted that work on this document actually began in the mid-1990s, that is well before the most intense period of the crisis.",
        "I think at the time, the original impulse for the document was the perception that there is a disproportionate percentage of homosexuals in the Catholic priesthood, at least in the United States and potentially other places, and so the original motive was to address that.",
        "Now obviously, the sex abuse crisis, I think, probably lent a new degree of urgency to the support for this document in some quarters.",
        "How do you interpret this document?",
        "How's it change your job?",

        "To be fair, I have, of course, been talking to Vatican officials about this document for--quite literally for years.",
        "I don't know anyone who would--at least in the Vatican who would blame homosexuals for the crisis.",
        "However, I think the view that they would take is this, that the study that the US bishops commissioned found that 80 percent of the accusations of abuse in the United States involved same-sex contact; that is contact between a priest and an adolescent male or a younger male.",
        "And they would deduce from that, I suppose, that gay priests in an all-male profession and in a line of work where you are much more likely to have unsupervised time with young men than you are with young women, that gay priests face special pressures and that, therefore, it requires a much higher degree of vigilance from bishops and from seminary rectors to make sure that men they're going to ordain can handle those pressures.",
        "I think that's the feeling.",
        "Now I understand, of course, that that's a debatable proposition, but I think that's the sort of climate of thought that produced the document.",
        "And, of course, psychologists, many psychologists would say that there's no connection between one's sexual orientation and one's attraction to children sexually.",
        "No.",
        "And, in fact, the Vatican convened a scientific symposium on pedophilia in 2003 where their own scientific advisers told them that.",
        "So again, I say I don't think that the assumption underlying the document is that gays are more likely to be sexual abusers.",
        "I think the assumption underlying the document is that a gay priest who has those impulses is much more likely to find occasion to act on them than perhaps a straight priest would.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And it's also fair to point out that a lot of people would say a considerable portion of the sex abuse scandal was, of course, not only the incidents themselves, but the fact that the hierarchy covered it up.",
        "Well, that's, of course, a separate question.",
        "And you're quite right.",
        "I mean, there is still a very lively debate on that point.",
        "The US bishops have adopted a very--some would say almost a draconian set of policies for priests accused of sexual abuse, of course, the one-strike-and-you're-out policy.",
        "Right.",
        "There is no comparable policy, strong policy, in place for what to do about bishops who should have known better, should have intervened, but failed to do so.",

        "And in the translation from the Hebrew to the Greek to the Latin to the English or native language, there's even debate on whether the word in its literal Hebrew even was referring to what we would call as homosexuality.",
        "So certainly, there's a lot of debate.",
