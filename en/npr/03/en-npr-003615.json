        "I think the Roman Catholic Church is shooting itself in the foot.",
        "They definitely need people to be priests and nuns, and they also really should consider ordaining women.",
        "It's the wave of the future and they're running short on people as it stands.",
        "Well, let's leave the issue of women for another program.",
        "But, Father Daley, certainly there is a shortage of priests certainly in this country.",
        "There sure is.",
        "And also, there's a significant number of priests and certainly bishops who are gay.",
        "I always sort of joke if all the gay priests of the church in the United States decided to boycott this coming weekend, the church would be paralyzed.",
        "And so, yeah, I think focusing on orientation is the wrong thing to focus on.",
        "The church has every right and responsibility to make sure that those preparing for priesthood are ready, but they should be focusing more on, across the board, is a person able to integrate his sexuality, is a person able to commit oneself to celibacy, does one have the capacity to do that without causing violence in their lives, is a person able to relate with others.",
        "So all those issues, I think, affect whoever is applying for priesthood right across the boards of orientation.",
        "So to zero in on one particular part of that scale, I think, just doesn't make a lot of sense.",
        "Hmm.",
        "John Allen, I wanted to ask you--John raised the point, the caller from Flagstaff--would this presumably apply also to lesbian orientation, deep-seated lesbian orientation, for women who wanted to be nuns?",
        "No, because what's in focus in this document is ordination to the priesthood.",
        "So there actually is no official Vatican statement of policy, aside from a very brief reference in a 1961 document on religious life, although the principle scope of that was also priestly ordination.",
        "So while, I think, in religious life generally there probably would be a commonsense bit of wisdom that if someone is sexually active or struggling with that question, that certainly ought to be a note of caution.",
        "Officially speaking, they don't have a policy on the question.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Father Daley, let me ask you before we let you go.",
        "How different is this policy towards homosexuality and the priesthood from policies towards heterosexuality and the priesthood?",
        "Well, certainly, the first point made in the document, that a person must show the capacity to live a celibate life for about three years, certainly that--anyone looking for the possibility of committing themselves to celibacy, that would be across the board.",
        "So again, why centering in on just gay seminarians on that question is a question to me.",
        "The bottom line, I think, is, heterosexual and homosexual, bisexual, anywhere in that spectrum, is the person mature psychologically, sexually able to integrate sexuality into his life?",
        "Those are the big questions.",
        "And no matter where a person's at in sexual orientation, that would seem to me to be the healthy approach.",
        "Father Daley, appreciate your time today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Father Fred Daley is the priest at the St. Francis de Sales Church in Utica, New York, and he joined us today from the studios of Vermont Public Radio in Norwich, Vermont."

        "The task of enforcing Vatican rules on homosexuals in the priesthood will fall mostly on those--or at least in large part, on those who recruit and screen applicants for the seminary.",

        "Father David Nuss is the director of vocations for the Diocese of Toledo, Ohio, and he joins us now from the studios of WKSU at Kent State University in Ohio.",

        "So nice to have you on the program, Dave.",
        "Neal, thanks for having me join you.",
        "I'm not sure that the change is going to be noticeable for me in the Diocese of Toledo.",
        "The focus of the document itself, I don't find it so much to be on homosexuality itself--in fact, there's even a disclaimer to that in the introduction of the document--but rather is to provide insight, criteria, if you will, for vocational discernment.",
        "And it really draws special emphasis to the capability that has to be demonstrated on behalf of a man that he can live a chaste, celibate lifestyle.",
        "And that's got to be in place prior to going into the seminary and prior going into the priesthood, and that's true for all men who express a desire for a priestly life in ministry.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yet it does talk about those deep-seated homosexual tendencies.",
        "How do you ask about that?",
        "How do you find out about that?",
        "How do you go about it?",
        "Well, you ask it very directly.",
        "I'm very interested in a candidate's history, personal history, family of origin, sexual history, academic history, employment history if it's applicable, a history of life of living the faith in a particular parish or diocese and wherever.",
        "In addition to that, there are other people that I work with collaboratively--priests, sisters, lay people, psychologists--and the attempt is to put together a profile that genuinely and accurately reveals who that person is so who the man says he is indeed matches with all of the evidence and all of the other information that's collected.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Is this issue of homosexuality in the priesthood--does it come up when you talk to young men and presumably to their families, as well?",
        "I think it depends on the individual.",
        "I think it depends on the family.",
        "It depends on the location.",
        "I don't find it to be a prominent issue in my dealing with young people, which I do extensively with the responsibilities that have been entrusted to me.",
        "I would have to say that the issue itself is raised infrequently.",
        "There are other issues that seem to be more in the forefront of young people's minds than homosexuality.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Does the issue of--and again, there is this investigation going on about homosexual cliques in various seminaries in the United States.",
        "Does that issue come up?",
        "Well, it does in that I visit seminaries where our men are studying to be priests.",
        "So we have partnerships arranged with five different seminaries in the Midwest.",
        "In that particular case, the apostolic visitation is, indeed, at the forefront of seminary officials and seminarians' minds and topics of conversations as I visit those respective seminaries."

        "There's not an easy answer to that.",
        "Indeed, there is a call from God, and there has to be a capability that the church needs to discern that that man has so that the call itself is authentic, that it's real, that it's genuine, that that man can succeed in a healthy and in a holy way.",

        "Well, yes.",
        "Now it would be stressed by the people who worked on this document that they are not making a statement about what would be known in Catholic parlance as sacramental theology--that is, they are not saying there is something inherent about homosexuals that makes them unworthy of ordination.",
        "This is instead what's known as a prudential judgment, that in the cases outlined in the document--that is, the three instances: someone not capable of being celibate for at least three years, someone participating in the gay culture, someone with deep-seated homosexual tendencies--that's it's simply unwise at this point for the church to ordain them.",
        "Neal, I wonder if I could ask your other guests a question.",
        "Sure.",
        "Father, I heard you say a moment ago that as you approach this document, you see the concern not so much as homosexuality itself but as the capacity to accept the demands of the priestly life.",
        "I'm wondering does that mean that if you had a candidate who had a kind of stable, fixed, same-sex orientation but who, nevertheless, seemed psychologically mature, seemed capable of accepting in an integrated way all of the demands of the priestly life that despite this document, you would still be willing to take a look at that person?",
        "Well, the Vatican, as you know, is prudent not to have any kind of a ban on the admission of men with homosexual tendencies to the priesthood at all, homosexual inclinations.",
        "And so sexual activity is something that needs to be studied and that needs to be revealed and that needs to be discussed.",
        "But the tendencies or inclinations towards homosexuality in and of itself is not a prohibition for admittance into the seminary or ordination.",
        "We're talking about the issue of homosexuality in the Catholic priesthood.",
        "Well, I think again it depends on to whom you put the question.",
        "I think there are certainly many, including some of those who were involved in putting this document together, who would read it in a slightly more restrictive fashion, who would make a distinction between what they would call transitory homosexual tendencies or experiences--that is, someone who struggled with their sexuality in their teens, for example, or somebody who experimented in college--but certainly would say that anyone who has a fixed homosexual identity--that is, a fixed orientation to the same sex--as they would read it--and this would include a number of Vatican officials; this would include some US bishops; certainly some who've been commenting on this document--they would say that person ought to be excluded.",
        "On the other hand, I would say that in conversation with many seminary rectors, with many vocations directors, with many other religious bishops and superiors around the world, I hear them saying things closer to what Father just said, which is that as far as they're concerned, homosexuality in and of itself is not so much the concern as how integrated that is into the whole of someone's life and how prepared they are to accept and live the demands of Catholic priesthood.",
        "And so again, I think that the implementation of this document--in other words, what concrete difference it's going to make on the ground in diocese in religious communities--I think that very much remains to be seen.",
        "Well, Father Dave, do you anticipate getting further instructions?",
        "Would your bishop say, `We've gotten this document and here's what it means in terms of what we do here in Toledo'?",
        "Well, it's certainly appropriate for me to have ongoing conversation with my bishop, as I'm an agent of my bishop in Toledo.",
        "And then also with the group of people that I work with collaboratively in the diocese who assist me with screening and assessment, including professional people as well--psychologists--I'm going to have discussion with them about this.",
        "I think it's prudent and I think it warrants that."

        "It's vague in its wording, and it's intentionally done that way because I think it takes serious the individual.",
        "I think it respects and it reverences and is sensitive to treating people as people and not having general absolute edicts of particular behavior, so that what might be considered inappropriate, say, action between men in a Mediterranean community--keep in mind this is a worldwide ecclesiastical document--may indeed be interpreted differently in downtown Toledo, Ohio, and the church prudently respects that and in doing so respects each individual.",
