        "Today we're talking about the document released by the Vatican this morning aimed at deterring homosexuals from entering the seminaries and becoming priests.",
        "Still with us is John Allen, Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, and joining us is Bishop William Skylstad.",
        "He's bishop of the Diocese of Spokane and president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops.",
        "He's with us by phone from his office in the Catholic pastoral center there in Spokane, Washington.",
        "Nice of you to joins us today, sir.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "Glad to be with you.",
        "This document that's come out--and obviously this has been the subject of discussion for a long time now--how will you actually implement it here in the United States?",
        "Well, I think in many ways, Neal, there's nothing particularly new in the document, although it certainly, I think, offers some clarification about the screening of candidates.",
        "I think the screening process for candidates for priesthood has been in development over the years--certainly far, far greater and much better than when I entered the seminary over 50 years ago.",
        "This is an ongoing process, and this document from the Holy See I think will tend to make even clearer the screening process that needs to go on to make sure that we have people in ministry who have an effective maturity and who lives their lives responsibly with regard to their own sexuality and ministry.",
        "A lot of confusion is centering around the interpretation of the phrase `deep-seated homosexual tendencies.",
        "Again, it doesn't give you a lot of guidance on how to interpret that phrase.",
        "Would you agree, Bishop Skylstad?",
        "And people were probably celebrating that (laughter).",
        "Well, Neal, I think really the important statement in the document is in the earlier section, the first section, which says that the entire life of a sacred minister must animated by the gift of his whole person to the church and by an authentic pastoral charity.",
        "And then it goes on to the need for an effective maturity.",
        "That has to be the primary in a good candidate for priestly ministry.",
        "If, however, this bridges over to a deep inclination towards homosexuality then that's another matter and the judgment of the church says that a person who has this, even though it's not clearly defined--when that impedes his ministry, with that impedes his relationship with people, when that becomes principally his orientation and identification in life, then I think the statement from the Holy See saying this could be an impediment to--is something that would not allow a person to be a good candidate for priesthood",
        "We were speaking earlier with Father Fred Daley, an openly gay priest in Utica, New York, and he was saying that one of the things he has some problems with that are being described as objectively disordered, among other things, and also the sense he says he comes away with--what he describes as a mean-spirited document, that his ordination was a mistake."

        "Well, in the earlier part of the document and in my own statement that I released this morning, I state that the church affirms the dignity of all human beings and the respect that should be shown to all people irrespective of their sexual orientation.",
        "But then I also go on to say in my statement that what about those who, for example, are homosexually inclined priests and who are presently priests today?",
        "And I go on to say that the answer lies in the lives of those men who with God's grace have truly been dedicated priests seeking each day not to be served but to serve their people, faithfully representing and word and example the teaching of the church in its fullness.",
        "So I think that's--you know, that's--there are those who have a homosexual orientation who are doing I think really fine work in the church.",
        "And as I stated initially a moment ago, we have a deep reverence and respect for every person no matter what their orientation, whether it's in ministry in the church or whether it's, of course, in the larger society itself.",
        "Let's get a caller on the line.",
        "This is Jim.",
        "Jim, calling us from Denver, Colorado.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I had a question and a comment.",
        "It seemed the previous priest from Ohio had mentioned that, in answer to your question as to whether or not homosexuals are called into the priesthood, and he commented that, well, that may be the case but then it's up to the church to see if they're capable, and I'm not sure that squares with what someone's belief in God would be that if they're called in service that should be suitable enough for them to pursue that, and yet why should it be left to some administrator to determine whether or not they're capable of being a priest.",
        "I think they probably have a better perspective on some of the real issues that people face if they've had that kind of experience.",
        "So I'm just kind of curious as to what the bishop would comment on that.",
        "Well, the document itself is meant to be helpful for the discernment of vocations to priesthood and it's meant to be helpful in clarifying the issues for the bishop, for the diocesan vocation director, for the spiritual director and for the candidate himself.",
        "So it's the--even though a person may be called to a certain life, it's really the church who calls someone, deeming that person capable of ministry and having the necessary prerequisites for ordained ministry.",
        "It's the church ultimately that calls the bishop who calls that person to ministry.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks for the call, Jim.",
        "And I wonder do you worry, Bishop Skylstad, that, again, there are--there is a problem with the numbers of priests in this country.",
        "Are you afraid or do you worry that this will further diminish, A, the number of applicants and, B, maybe some priests who are in the priesthood now might feel alienated and think about leaving?",
        "Well, I've already stated actually some weeks ago that the church is not into witch-hunts or gay bashing.",
        "I think that there are priests out there who are doing good ministry, very good ministry, and are living very chaste and celibate lives.",
        "I think that the thrust of the document in the main I suspect has already been pretty well integrated into the screening process for dioceses and seminaries.",
        "I think that's probably a reality already.",
        "So I don't personally think there's going to be a decrease in the number of candidates coming forward.",
        "This document asks for openness about sexual orientation and the need of appropriate qualifications for vocations to priesthood.",
        "We want our priests to be the best possible in terms of their own sexual integration and effective maturity, so that they minister to people in a very loving, responsible way without violating boundaries that are very inappropriate according to church teaching and church practice.",
        "And one final question; I wanted to bring John Allen in on this as well, the Vatican correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter there in Rome.",
        "We're, of course, talking about this application to the Catholic Church here in the United States.",
        "This is obviously a document that applies to the Catholic Church worldwide.",
        "Is this seen, John Allen, as an American problem?"

        "I mean, this is something that is being--that is generating controversy and generating conversation largely in Western Europe and North America.",
        "Now I don't by that mean that anyone in the Vatican believes that it is only Western Europeans or Northern Americans who produce gay priests.",
        "I think there is a recognition that homosexuality is a part of human experience and therefore there are undoubtedly gay priests in all parts of the world.",
        "But in terms of the kind of open discussion and debate over the question of admission to seminaries and in the status of gay priests, I would say that is largely a Western phenomenon.",
        "Well, I think that's probably true, but we have to remember too that I think human sexuality is a gift that we all have whether it's here in the states or in Southeast Asia or anywhere else in the world.",
