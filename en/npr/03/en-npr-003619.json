        "We're still in mourning.",

        "But during this time period, nothing takes precedence over helping the people who lost their loved ones and starting to heal those that have been injured.",
        "I think that as we start next week, we get more broad in our support of our Jewish community in making sure that they understand that we love them and that we will protect them.",
        "When you look forward at how to prevent these kinds of events in the future, I know that you disagree with proposals to put armed guards at schools or places of worship.",
        "What kinds of steps do you think Pittsburgh and other cities can take to prevent this from happening again?",

        "We're going to have to solve them ourselves.",
        "And do those solutions involve limits to gun ownership?",
        "Do those solutions involve - what sorts of things are you thinking about?",
        "Well, there's different rules for different states, right?",
        "A lot of states, like Pennsylvania, preempt local governments to have the ability to put limits on guns.",
        "Public discourse in this country has gotten to the point where somebody can feel that they should go to a synagogue as people pray and murder them simply because of the way they pray.",
        "But you don't just get from step one to step 10.",
        "So at the local level, we have to change the political discourse and the way that we discuss things in this country.",
        "Finally, Mayor Peduto - and I hesitate to ask this question for fear that it sounds insensitive - but given that we are one week from a midterm election, as we talk about a presidential visit to Pittsburgh and a debate over public safety and extremism, do you think there is a political overtone to all of this?",
        "I can tell you that with all the evil that I am seeing, there is something that is a strong goodness.",
        "What I can't tell you is, as a political prognosticator, what that means on an election day.",
        "I can only do what I can do as an individual.",
        "And I would hope that every American would go out and vote, no matter what party you're in, and be a part of the democratic process and work to eradicate hatred.",
        "It is what divides us.",
        "Mayor Bill Peduto of Pittsburgh, Penn., thank you for speaking with us today.",
        "And my condolences on what your city is going through.",

        "That's true.",
        "That's fascinating.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Likely, they'll have the same--they may come from the same box of paper, in which case they all can be put end to end.",
        "But the thing is they were all taken about the same time, so you can--you know, that'll help you with who's in them and when they were taken.",
        "Can this same approach of, you know, thinking of things in terms of detectives, looking for things that you might not ordinarily see, does that apply to things other than photographs?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There's all kinds of things.",
        "You know, there's some, you know, of course, written records, you can go through them.",
        "There's tons of city directories going back a couple--a hundred years in some cases.",

        "I got fascinated with old hospital records and old insane asylum records and through that I was able to deduce a lot about the Irish coming in for the famine.",
        "I was able to deduce that the hospital had--sometimes had quite a few people checking in and sometimes didn't have any at all in an--I'm looking at 1851.",
        "So what I did was I graphed how many people checked in the hospital every day during that year and I found, you know, there was big wells of admissions and then there was, you know, real lulls and I was able to tie that to the weather conditions and it turned out there was a three-week lag between heavy rainfalls in the admissions to the hospital, and that was because that's the breeding cycle of the mosquito.",
        "And since most of these people checking in were Irish, I was able to link that to Irish history, because when the immigrants came to New Orleans, it was a city of a hundred thousand people and there were 250,000 immigrants that came through that city and some stayed there, some didn't.",
        "But they had to drain the land to accommodate all of these new people, these new inhabitants.",
        "And the Irish were sent into the swamps to drain the land because slaves weren't used because they were very expensive.",
        "But Irishmen were free--they were cheap.",
        "So, you know, one died, they just got another one.",
        "So these men would work in standing water all day being bit by mosquitoes and they'd bring the yellow fever home to people living in shacks.",
        "And so sometimes whole buildings would die with yellow fever.",
        "And I was able to tie the big epidemic in 1853 to the three-times-normal rainfall they had that year.",
        "And the--also so that gives you a lot of background in Irish history there, and there's also spikes on those records every now and then where, say, instead of 50 people, 150 people check in.",
        "And I was able to coordinate that against the ships arriving.",
        "It's not the Irish already living there; it's the Irish arriving.",
        "And they would arrive with typhus epidemics onboard.",
        "So they would be immediately brought to the public hospital because nobody had any money; it was, you know, free medical care.",
        "And I was able to tie that.",
        "So you see that's another chapter in Irish history right there.",
        "So what I'm saying in this part of the book is that, you know, look beyond when your grandmother--what day she was born on.",
        "You know, she lived in a context.",
        "She lived in historical, political background.",
        "You know, she had her daily life as well.",
        "So all of these techniques, I'm telling, help you put your family in a historical context, you know, a background, you know, where they lived and died.",
        "And so you have to think beyond--I mean, a hundred years from now, I would imagine, I'd want people to know more than--about me than my birth date.",
