        "Well, it depends on what kind of test you take.",
        "The most popular is one that's called Y-DNA and that's used mostly for surname studies and so you can get tested and you can test any other--you know, a hundred other fellows with the same surname and you'll be able to tell which of you have common ancestors and which of you don't.",
        "So it's kind of like the game of Clue, you know, Colonel Mustard in the library, sort of thing.",

        "Don't waste your time with the ones over here.'",
        "How specific does it get, though?",
        "The Y-DNA is very specific 'cause it's passed intact from father to son down through the generations and there are very rare mutations.",
        "So pretty much--if you or I had a common ancestor through our straight paternal lines, if you lived 500 years ago, we're probably still sporting identical signatures.",

        "In the research that I've conducted, primarily with customers who've taken the African ancestry tests largely in the area of identity.",

        "What have they told you they found out?",

        "There are only four Smolenyak families in the whole world, and we all trace our roots to one little village over in Slovakia.",
        "And we kind of assumed we had common ancestors because we all have these same roots back to the 1700s.",

        "Well, Megan Smolenyak, we'll begin with you and also get Colleen Fitzpatrick in on this.",
        "If that's the kind of thing--I hope that's the direction we're heading in.",
        "It's not that specific yet.",
        "This is like traditional genealogy in the sense that the beefier our databases get, the better for all of us and the more specific they'll be.",
        "But right now, most of the results will cut in fairly broad swaths.",
        "Yes, you can find broadly Europe, say Scandinavian origin, that kind of thing, kind of Viking stock.",
        "But you have to remember, these roots predate the existence of the countries and so forth, so it's not as if you're going to find a test that's going to tell you that you're of Austrian heritage.",
        "And, Colleen Fitzpatrick, would you agree that very broad strokes but don't get too excited about the prospects of finding lost cousins?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I think Megan did a real good job at telling--scoping out how this works.",
        "What you wind up doing is a snip test.",
        "There's certain parts on your DNA which are like little markers to tell you what broad population groups you come from.",
        "And as more snips are discovered, you get more and more refined picture of where you come from.",
        "But they go back really long ways.",
        "It tells you your deep roots.",
        "And in that time, any geographical association that particular population would have had is now kind of homogenized, you know, in the last, say, 7 to 10,000 years.",
        "So now 'cause people move around, you know, you can only trace yourself to very large populations.",
        "And, of course, as Megan said, the more snips we find and the more refined we can get, we'll get those populations smaller and smaller and smaller.",
        "But once again you're not going to necessarily pin yourself down to, like, French or Austrian or Italian."
