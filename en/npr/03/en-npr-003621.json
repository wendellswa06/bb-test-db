        "They talk about how taking the test has really helped them in terms of identifying where they're from, giving them a sense--one person in particular said that taking the test gave them a sense of freedom and power, particularly around identity issues.",
        "Well, what do folks do with the information?",
        "Often, people talk about how they share it with family members at family reunions and other types of gatherings.",
        "And then there are other people who actually have gone to Africa where their actual lineage is drawn from.",
        "And so one of the individuals who has taken the test, in fact, has done a documentary on the experience.",
        "But you can see the power of this information, as you say, not simply knowing you're African or West African but from a specific area, if you will.",
        "Right.",
        "From a psychological perspective, identity is one of the most important psychological struggles that a person has and this, for African-Americans, has enabled them to fill a void in their identity construction."

        "I live not too far from there now, but I just want to know what could you do to help us out, because this is just last weekend we had a family reunion and we talked about hiring someone to help us do more research to help us find out more about our ancestors.",
        "Well, Cynthia Winston, is this somebody who might get some information from DNA testing?",
        "Right.",
        "I can answer that.",
        "One of the most important things that you can do is go to AfricanAncestry.com and find out about the process for taking the DNA test, because the DNA test is a test that will enable your family to trace their roots using a scientific process.",
        "So it enables you to pinpoint the particular place in Africa where your family comes from.",

        "And also, in terms of the research question that you had, you can also get a companion book; once you get your results, you will get a book written by African Ancestry that will tell you more about the particular group where you share ancestry with."

        "Yeah.",
        "He faked his suicide and ran away, but he fathered four children, one of which went on to become a--her name was Mary Carr and she became a famous Hollywood movie actress."
