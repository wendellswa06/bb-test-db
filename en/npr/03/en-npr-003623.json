        "When you were Homeland Security secretary, you worked with a bipartisan group of senators on an immigration overhaul bill that would have addressed these issues, you know, in a bigger way.",
        "That bill ultimately failed.",
        "So do you think this Congress has any more appetite to move forward in that way than they did when you were serving in government?",
        "Very few people I've met actually argue that, on the merits, people who came to this country when they were 2 years old through no fault of their own turned out not to be legal but now have lived here their whole lives.",
        "I've met very few people who want to have them kicked out.",
        "At the same time, I understand that there's a desire to balance that with funding and support for increased enforcement.",
        "I think that's a reasonable request, so it strikes me you could get a fairly narrow bill that addresses a couple of relatively non-controversial issues and get that done within a very short timeframe.",
        "And that might, by the way, be a very good inspiration for the possibility of tackling a broader set of issues over the longer term.",
        "Before we let you go, is there a national security argument to be made about addressing this apart from making sure that people are who they say they are?",
        "Let's say that they are who they say they are, but is there a national security aspect to this that you can describe for us if Congress can't come to a resolution on this?",
        "I would say this.",
        "I would say, first of all, of course, if we can't get a resolution and the DREAMers are forced to leave, there'll be a loss, first of all, to the employers and for those who are actually serving in government or doing something that benefits the government, there's going to be a loss there.",
        "There's going to be a very negative message about the way the U.S.",
        "views people who are not born here, which is going to have a ripple effect around the world in terms of the way people view us.",
        "And then I think if we can't get this done properly, you're going to be distracting from enforcing against serious bad people by having people run around trying to round up DREAMers or expel them.",
        "And just from the standpoint of having an orderly, well-prioritized enforcement process, that would be a mistake.",
        "That's Michael Chertoff.",

        "Great to be here, thanks.",
        "And first, Jeffrey Goldberg, in your article, \"\"A Point of No Return,\"\" you catalog the risks Israel would take in launching airstrikes at Iran's nuclear facilities, that includes possible full-scale regional war, claiming possibly thousands of Iranian and Israeli lives; a crisis for the U.S.",
        "that could dwarf Afghanistan; and conceivably not actually destroy Iran's nuclear program in the process.",
        "What is the Israeli calculus that says all those risks are worth it?",
        "Well, they haven't actually worked through all of these problems yet.",
        "They're aware of the potential catastrophic downsides.",
        "The reason that they're thinking about this at all is that they think that living with a nuclear Iran is near impossible for Israel.",
        "They believe that Iran poses an existential threat to Israel.",
        "And that even if Iran didnt use the nuclear weapons against Tel Aviv, or transfer a nuclear weapon to one of its terrorist proxies, the mere fact that these terrorist proxies could operate under the safety and protection of the Iranian nuclear umbrella means that Israel would be in danger of becoming an unlivable place.",
        "Is it your understanding that President Obama or his national security advisor, given advance warning of an Israeli airstrike, would likely say to Israel - dont do it?",
        "Or would likely say, it's your choice, go ahead?"

        "On the other hand, the Israelis are in fact very cognizant of American interests and desires in this area.",
        "And if the president of the United States gave an absolute red light to Israel - said do not do this, this is going to be disastrous for us - the Israelis would think twice and maybe even three times.",

        "Sometimes, it takes a decade for records to drop by that much, and he's doing it in one race.",
        "How does he do that?",
        "First of all, going back to the 2004 Olympics, he had a great performance: eight medals, six of them were gold medals.",
        "And then shortly after, he had a back injury that really slowed him down.",
        "His coach wanted to incorporate some weight training into Phelps' preparation, and they waited.",
        "They didn't do it right away.",
        "So that was one factor that kept a performance like this in abeyance.",
        "And then he went to the World Championships in 2005 in Montreal, won six medals, which was more than anybody, but he felt he had a bad meet, and so he was angry with himself.",

        "How is Michael Phelps handling all this success?",
        "You know, he handles it really, really well.",
        "He talks often about changing the sport of swimming and elevating it from a sort of niche sport as it is in the United States to the type of sport where people will have opinions about it at water coolers and on street corners.",
        "I mean, he wants to see that for his sport.",
        "So he isn't necessarily looking at what can this do for Michael Phelps, and that's the kind of perspective that's very unusual for someone his age.",
