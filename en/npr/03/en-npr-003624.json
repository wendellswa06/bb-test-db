        "So, this situation in Massachusetts, what's the effect of that going to be for students in Massachusetts this year?",
        "Well, it - this is going on all around the country and it has been for the past few months.",
        "About two months ago, the Secretary of Education announced a plan to help avoid this from happening, and to some degree it has.",
        "But there are still lenders who are deciding that they still can't make it economically.",
        "The key problem for them is that they - in order to loan money to students, they need to get money from somewhere, and where they have to get money is out on the market like everybody else.",
        "And the market, as you know and have referred to, is getting tougher.",
        "So, for some lenders, it's a lot more difficult.",
        "What the department then agreed to do was to help that by providing some money to some lenders and to help - buying up loans from the lenders after they loan the money to the students.",
        "That's helping some, but the Massachusetts agency, for one, and some others are not able to still make it on that, in part because they just don't have the money to start the process going to lend initially to get more money going.",
        "Your question is, what are students in Massachusetts and elsewhere going to do when this happens?",
        "What they can do is go to other lenders, and right now, it looks like there are plenty of other lenders.",
        "To be clear, there's two types of student loans out there.",
        "One is the government-backed loans, which banks give, but they're government backed.",
        "And then there's private loans in which the lenders just give to the student without any guarantee of federal repayment.",
        "And that's, as you might assume, a little bit more expensive.",
        "And that's the ones that a student gets after they've maxed out or borrowed as much as they can under the government program.",
        "What the Massachusetts agency announced this week was that they aren't going to be giving out private loans.",
        "They already announced a month or so ago they wouldn't be doing government-backed loans.",
        "So, students in Massachusetts will have to look elsewhere, but there are still plenty of other lenders out there.",
        "But just to clarify, so, the students in Massachusetts would already have their loan for the coming semester.",
        "I mean, the kids wouldn't have to - aren't finding out now that they're not going to get their loans for September, or are they?",
        "They are, in fact.",
        "They are.",

        "Well, you know, it's - yes, you're right.",
        "It is because, I mean, a lot of the - generally, they think of the loan cycle as beginning this month, which is - now we're at the end of the July.",
        "So, it's been about a month into it, another month or so.",
        "But it doesn't generally take that long, and loan companies they can do it pretty quickly if they want to.",
        "So, it's a surprise to some but it shouldn't - at least on the federally backed loans, it shouldn't be so much of a problem.",
        "The real - the bigger problem is, again, this is what happened with the Massachusetts agency, is the private loans, not so much the fact that the Massachusetts agency isn't going to be doing them or some other agencies isn't going to be doing them, but the fact that they're going to be more expensive, because just borrowing on the market right now is more expensive.",
        "So, you have to think a lot harder whether you want to borrow beyond the amount that you can already borrow under the government program if you want to go to a particular college.",

        "But in a recent debate with Owens, Love insisted that she only wants more state and local control of student loans.",
        "I am convinced that an unlimited flow of federal dollars into colleges has caused the rate of tuition to rise far faster than the rate of inflation, making it very difficult for middle-income families and lower-income families to receive a higher education.",
