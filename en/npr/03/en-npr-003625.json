        "Exactly.",
        "And get it passed year after year.",

        "And so there was a good impulse there to break it apart.",
        "The problem was instead of actually doing something populist and breaking it apart and reducing the ag subsidies, they caved in to their interests and kept the ag subsidies while not even funding, so far, the food stamp program.",
        "So they look like they're helping their interests - rich corporate farmers - while ignoring poor people who do rely on food stamps.",
        "So it's the worst marriage of bad instinct, bad institutional respect, bad politics.",

        "The answer is yes.",
        "There's - again, as I explained, there's two kinds of lending.",
        "There's the government-backed lending and there's the private lending.",
        "But within the government-backed lending, there's again two divisions.",
        "One is the one that I've been discussing now, which is where the banks lend you money and then they get a subsidy payment from the federal government to do that kind of lending.",
        "Separate from that, the government - the U.S.",
        "Department of Education loans money directly to students.",
        "And when it - I don't know which schools - I know that more students have been - more - sorry - more colleges have been signing up for the direct-lending program because of the uncertainty in the banking market.",
        "And if you sign up, the college signs up with the Department of Education, then they've got a guaranteed source of government-backed loans, and it sounds like that's what your school has done.",
        "So, what your school is telling you is that if you want a government-backed loan, you need to go through the Department of Education and get your loan directly from the Department of Education instead from Sallie Mae, which is the nation's largest student-loan company, or any other private loan company.",
        "Is there any more legislation on the table as things get more uncertain and as the credit crunch scrambles (ph), is Congress - is there any more legislation pending that's going to help us borrow at cheaper rates to stay and get our degree?",
        "Well, in fact, just last night, the House and Senate conferees - that's - when the House of Senate pass a bill, you have conferees that negotiate the differences between them, and they settled that last night, and they're apparently going to pass it in both the House and Senate tomorrow, which is a Higher Education Bill.",
        "It's this Higher Ed policy for the entire government, and that contains in it some provisions along the lines you're talking about.",
        "It requires the lenders to be more upfront with the students about the terms of their loans.",
        "It requires the colleges to be more upfront with students about the cost of their loans.",
        "But in addition to that, in the past year or two, Congress has also - part of the reason why the loan companies are in the bind they're in is because what Congress did last September was they cut the subsidies that they give to the banks, and they took that money to savings and they transformed it into grant aid for students.",
        "So, it's the government giving money directly to the students.",
        "So, in a sense, that's better for the student overall.",
        "They (unintelligible) instead of using the money to pay for subsidies to the banks, they're instead just taking that money and giving it directly to the students.",
        "So, there's hope that that will help.",
        "But you know, we're going to find out this year, you know, how much that washes out.",
        "OK.",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Unfortunately, for students that made too much - I made 12,000 dollars in my sophomore year and I was unable to qualify for the program and had to start taking loans.",
        "So, the grants, it seems, are few and far between for, you know, middle-class students, at least.",

        "Thank you.",
        "How bad is it really for students right now who need to get a loan?",
        "Well, again, on the government-backed program, which is what most students use, there is no real change.",
        "You're going to have to - you may have to get a new lender, and you may - what loan companies had been doing was giving students some extra benefits and fee reductions beyond the minimums they're required to give under the government program.",
        "But by and large, most of those benefits weren't really materializing for students anyway.",
        "The conditions that you need to do to meet them were pretty stringent.",
        "So, there's really - shouldn't be any fundamental change on the government-backed program.",
        "On the private lending, it is a problem, and we - or it's potentially going to be a problem.",

        "We don't know what the rates will be.",
        "We don't know what the conditions will be.",

        "Well, I think it was - we had, like, a 5,000-dollar line of credit.",

        "How common is that?",
        "Are you hearing that people are using their credit cards to pay tuition these days?",
        "It's been a big issue, and Congress has looked at that as well.",
        "I mean, the situation she's describing, it sounds like more of an emergency situation.",
        "But it's - there's certainly cases where students are doing that and it's - I highly recommend against it.",
        "You will get some college administrators to admit that at private schools, if a student needs to do that, they should really think of going somewhere else.",
        "To what extent are Israelis talking-up the likelihood of an airstrike to get Washington's attention and to get Washington to maintain a very tough line, or not get a tougher line on Iran sanctions?",
        "Down somewhat.",
        "The credit card issue more - what it gets into more is after the students get there, they get credit-card offers, and they get solicitations, and they don't really have the experience to know what it means to handle a credit card.",
        "That's somewhat different, in a way, from kind of the general issue we're talking about with student lending.",
        "But it certainly plays into it, because if the student, you know, goes through four years in college and ends up with a lot of debt on a credit card, it doesn't really matter whether they did it as sort of part of a calculated strategy to pay for college or a sort of a - you know, something they kind of fell into.",

        "Right.",
        "Yeah, sure, that's what I was - I mean, I'm kind of been saying it all along.",
        "What I would say is really think hard about whether you really need to go to - I mean, one thing you look at, at a private school, you kind of look at it and say private school is obviously more expensive than a public school.",
        "And therefore, it's a no-brainer, if you're having trouble, go to the public school.",
        "Go to a community college.",
        "Maybe go to a community college for two years and then transfer to another school later on.",
        "That said, though, there's certainly a lot of private schools that are doing a lot to try and help get students in.",
        "There's a lot of competition to get students in.",
        "So, you might be surprised sometime where private school might work out for you because the amount of discounting they do.",
        "I mean, some - like, GW here in D.C., George Washington University.",
        "is the most expensive university in the country.",
        "But you know, it's around 50,000 dollars, but the average that a student really ends up paying is much less than that, because they build into that the knowledge that they're going to give a lot of grant aid to the students.",
        "So, you need to - if you really want to go to a college that looks more expensive, then just talk with the aid administrator and really try to get, you know, down as best you can what exactly they can give you and whether you can make it go.",
        "And then you have to think about what it's - how long it's going to take you to pay that off and what job you're going to be taking - it's going to be getting you, and seriously whether you're going to be able to afford it and make a hard decision based on that.",
        "And if it means, you know, working for a year first, going to community college first, choosing a different school, then you need to think seriously about that.",

        "Hi, John.",
        "Hello, John?",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, actually, I just have a comment on just the way - like, what I have to do personally to take on loans.",
        "I'm actually about to attend a new school and it's going to cost me a lot more.",
        "But in order to actually get enough funding from the school, or just to even take out loans, I actually have to move out of my parents' home and take on a lot of extra bills and a lot of extra money on myself just so that they can help fund me just to go to the school that I need to go to in order to get, you know, what degree I want and whatnot.",
        "So, it kind of - it's not really a good position to be in just because of how much money I have to take on now just to get loans that I have to pay off later.",
        "So, people are making very tough choices now, it sounds like.",
        "They absolutely are, and in doing it - I mean, part of the problem is that you're asking a student, somebody coming out of high school, to make one of the most massive financial decisions imaginable in your lifetime, and you're making it with, you know, very little experience.",
        "I mean, this is a decision that an adult with, you know, 20 years of experience in the workforce might have trouble evaluating, you know, what's the right thing to do, and you're asking a high school student to try and make that decision.",
        "That's a lot to ask.",
