        "OK, thanks.",
        "Yes, sir, it is.",
        "It's - if I've got the numbers right, I believe it's 6.8 percent.",
        "I mean, there's different programs.",
        "There's a parent loan.",
        "There's undergraduate loans.",
        "There's subsidized.",
        "But the general rate right now, I believe, is 6.8 percent for a government-subsidized loan, and it's supposed to drop to 3.4 percent over the next five years and it's on schedule to do that.",
        "One of the things, of course, is that after those five years - you know, Congress writes legislation that lasts, you know, sometimes that long, five years, but then they don't write what's going to happen after that.",
        "So, the understanding would be that it would pop back up to 6.8 right after that unless Congress does something.",
        "But yes, the answer is yes.",

        "I graduated in 1996 from Ohio University, and I had to take out all kinds of loans.",
        "And I remember even back then that the loans that the government subsidized, they were not enough to cover the cost of tuition.",
        "And we went, my brother and I, who were going to Ohio University together, went through all kinds of appeals to try and get more money and we just couldn't.",
        "And I was wondering, do we need to look at why loan amounts are so low?",
        "Because it seems like so many students need to go to a lot unsubsidized loan, which is causing so many problems for them.",
        "How is that determined what the limit is that a student can borrow that the government will back?",
        "And maybe with the cost of tuition, do we need to review that?",
        "I remember only paying 3,000 dollars a quarter at Ohio University, which I believe, they're still on quarters.",
        "And now, the cost of higher education is staggering for a four-year degree.",
        "Well, the answer is that it's set by Congress, and Congress, in fact, just did increase those loan limits.",
        "It's - there's argument on both sides to that question, as to whether they should do it.",
        "The loan limit, up until recently, had been, if I'm getting these numbers right, I believe it's 3500 dollars a year for a freshman, 4500 for sophomore and then it goes up to 5,500 a year after that.",
        "And they just increased all those by 2,000, and maybe some - I think roughly that's what the numbers are.",
        "In any event, the question is, you know, yeah, I mean, there's this sort of, like, yes, one solution, especially as private loans get more difficult and more expensive, is to simply increase the amount you can borrow into the government program.",
        "One of the problems with that is that that encourage - you know, that could lead to inflation in costs, and there's a lot of concern already that the cost of college is too high.",
        "And if you simply allow students to borrow more then you could be putting, you know, upward pressure on colleges to raise the prices even more.",
        "That doesn't help anybody in the long run either.",
