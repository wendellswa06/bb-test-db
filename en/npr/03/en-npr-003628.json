        "I came away feeling quite depressed, actually, from this trip to Iran.",
        "I felt that they are under the misapprehension, based upon Ahmadinejad's really telescopic, or I should say periscopic, notion of what the West is and of U.S.",
        "thinking, based upon these annual trips he makes to the U.N.",
        "General Assembly, where he holds kind of roundtable but, you know, rather stilted roundtable discussions with handpicked academics and a few members of the media, and these one-on-ones we've become familiar seeing with various American anchors.",
        "And in which he feels he has taken America's measure.",
        "And I do feel that they have lived so long in this bubble that theyve passed the moment at which Iran actually is at threat from the United States and Israel.",
        "I came away very worried that because of that, that we were more likely to go towards confrontation than come away from it.",
        "I hope Im wrong.",
        "But thats the feeling I was given, through my interviews with Ahmadinejad and his officials when I left Iran.",
        "I want to turn back to Jeffrey Goldberg and ask you, Jeffrey, about a criticism that I've read thats lodged against you, which is that your article, \"\"Point of No Return\"\" in the The Atlantic, this is Iraq: Take Two.",
        "This is the season of beating the war drums to magnify, let's say, a very nasty regional player into a country that poses a strategic threat to the United States.",
        "How do you answer that?",
        "Well, A: Im opposed to a military action against Iran -certainly for the moment.",
        "So I dont think reporting on what other people feel about this is magnifying or increasing the chances of war.",
        "Actually, I think that if people focused on this now we might be able to avoid war in the future.",
        "I'd like to hear from both of you about what youve been able to glean either in Israel or in Iran, for that matter, about how leaders foresee a war, what they think a war would be.",
        "Jeffrey Goldberg, you have a fairly vivid description of what kind of airstrike there might be and what sort of regional assistance the Israelis would count on to pull off such airstrikes.",
        "We always forget when we talk about this: This is not a binary; this is not Iran and Israel.",
        "Iran is opposed in the Middle East by most Arab states.",
        "With the exception of Syria, every other Arab state opposes Iran's reach for hegemony.",
        "And most of them oppose Iran's reach for nuclear weapons.",
        "So it's been speculated - and again, this is - we're entering the wilderness of mirrors here, where you dont really know what the intelligence is.",
        "But there's a chance that Saudi Arabia, other Gulf countries, would provide covert assistance to Israel if Israel were going to try this.",
        "Going back to one point that John Lee raised - this delusion on the part of Ahmadinejad that the U.S.",
        "is powerless to stop the Iranian nuclear program; it's beyond delusional.",
        "The U.S.",
        "has the technical capabilities, of course, to destroy whatever it wants to destroy on the ground in Iran.",
        "This is a political issue in the United States.",
        "I dont think it's a technical issue.",
        "Well, John Lee, what did you hear about the prospect of being bombed in Iran?",
        "And do they figure they would retaliate via Hezbollah at Israel, or fire missiles at Israel?",
        "What would they do?"

        "This was a matter of policy.",
        "And I pointed out that Israel had nuclear arms.",
        "And they said Israel may have nuclear arms, but its entire territory will come under the barrage of our missiles.",
        "So there was a very - kind of very robust, bellicose response, which of course as with everything with the Iranians - as Jeffrey put - the kind of the hall of mirrors, one has to sift bluster from real intent.",

        "And so in the course of these talks, there has to be the moment at which an all-encompassing solution is offered.",
        "Now, will it be, you know, like the JFK-Fidel deal after the Cuban Missile Crisis, in which the United States offered essentially a non-aggression pact in return for the withdrawal of Soviet missiles from Cuba?"

        "I don't know that the Obama administration could go there, but I think there is at least the possibility now that Ahmadinejad could possibly sign to some kind of deal in which Iran is vouched safe, a peaceful nuclear energy program in return for giving up its possible quest for nuclear weapons.",
        "I say possible because, of course, we haven't proven it, but we suspect it.",
        "However, this is what everybody's guessing at this moment.",
        "And the negotiations, or the talks have yet to begin, followed by negotiations.",

        "Compulsory Optimism 101.",

        "These are core values of the Islamic Republic of Iran.",
        "On the other hand, I have personally been very impressed with the Obama administration's program on this to date.",
        "I think that they are trying to build off-ramps, dignified off-ramps for the Iranians to take.",
        "I think that Obama's maybe his greatest foreign policy success so far has been building an international coalition that is imposing very, very harsh sanctions on the regime in Iran.",
        "And it may be that the sanctions program concentrates the attention of the Iranians in a way that their attention has not been concentrated to date and that they actually decide to seek an alternative path.",
        "Again, it's hard for me not to see a crisis developing over the next year, but I think the Obama administration is seized by this problem, and they're dealing with it in a very serious and deliberate way.",
