        "They'd be leaning up against each other, touching each other, sharing a book, reading aloud to each other.",
        "And the white families who lived in that area knew this, that a decision to integrate Covert school was a decision to live in intimacy with African-Americans.",
        "So through omission and subterfuge, the Covert schools were integrated.",
        "In other ways, Covert was like any frontier town - young, the majority under 21, attractive to itinerants, like those who worked in its logging camps.",
        "Life was incredibly hard.",
        "In other words, it was exactly the kind of frontier town that easily turned on blacks.",
        "Only in Covert, that didn't happen.",
        "One spring, as the ice thawed and the roads muddied, a remarkable thing occurred.",
        "There was an election.",

        "In April of 1868, farmer Dawson Pompey, nearly 70, reputed to be the son of a slave and her master, set off to make history.",
        "For reasons only he may have known, he decided to run for public office.",
        "He wanted to be a highway overseer in the Covert Township, where roads were raw and hacked through the forest.",
        "Now, it was illegal for a black man to vote in Michigan, much less stand for office.",
        "Near Detroit, not very long before, a man just one-sixteenth black was arrested for merely attempting to vote.",
        "But in Covert, dozens of white men raised their hands in the air - or perhaps, raised their voices - to elect Dawson Pompey a highway overseer.",
        "Yet there would be no black suffrage in Michigan for two more years.",

        "Yes, they would have been.",
        "In fact, if you'd been a traveler through the Covert area in 1869 on horseback, through this frontier community, you could have come upon this astounding sight of a black man overseeing the hard labor of white men in his district to build roads.",
        "And Dawson Pompey wasn't the only one elected in Covert Township.",
        "Through the years, there were black highway overseers, black election inspectors, black township board members, a constable, a drain commissioner and in 1875, the first black justice of the peace elected in the state of Michigan.",
        "But blacks never dominated Covert.",
        "They were, at most, eight percent to 10 percent of the population.",
        "Perhaps it was the rural passage of the seasons, the stark winds and losses of rural life, but friendships grew on the frontier, though it wasn't always easy.",
        "We spoke with Sandra Lundie, who is white and the great-granddaughter of a man named Chapin Reynolds.",
        "There's a story in her family about Reynolds's friendship with Douglas Pompey, one of the black Pompey family.",
        "Of course it was in the horse and buggy days, and the Pompeys would come and visit.",
        "Douglas Pompey happened by the Reynolds home one day.",
        "This story occurs in about 1890.",
