        "Now, whether that's the case is probably not for me to say, but that is the suggestion and the theory behind this.",
        "But why do you think it hasn't really caught on here in America the same way?",
        "Because kids do it.",

        "And, gradually, that is translating into a greater interest in the professional game of soccer in this country.",
        "So one of the attractions of this job coming now, for me, is that if you look at the context of league soccer in this country, it began, effectively, in 1996.",
        "So this is season number 24 that begins over this weekend.",
        "If you translate that into the English game, league soccer there started in 1888.",

        "It's just borrowing money is the two-by-four.",
        "By doing that, you're able to lever up your profits.",
        "And an easy way to think about that is, you know, this is not a good idea, but, you know, you could go to a casino and use a credit card to gamble, you know, and you're not really gambling with your money.",
        "You can make a lot of money because you can take, you know, $5,000 off your credit card or something.",
        "But you can also lose a lot of money that you don't have, and that's what was basically going on on Wall Street.",
        "A lot of these firms were levered 30-to-one, which means they were on the hook for 30 times more money than they actually had."
