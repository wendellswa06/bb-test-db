        "The government's going to buy up a lot of this stuff now, at least that's one of the plans.",
        "And it has to be very careful about how much it pays for these securities because if it overpays, you know, the government could lose a lot of money, and, you know, Pimco, Bill Gross is an expert at kind of figuring out how much stuff like this is worth, so he could be very helpful.",
