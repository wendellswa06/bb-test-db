        "I'm not an expert really in anything, other than maybe '80s music.",
        "And so my thoughts are reflective on my experiences and the experiences of people around me and my observations after living 46 years as a dude.",
        "What do I mean by boys are broken?",
        "I think it means that there is something going on with American men that is giving them the permission and space to commit violence.",
        "And one of the main things we focus on correctly is guns and mental health, but I think deeper than that is a problem, a crisis in masculinity.",
        "You wrote in this that the last 50 years redefined womanhood.",
        "Women were taught that they can be anything.",
        "No commensurate movement for men, who are still generally locked to the same rigid, outdated model of masculinity.",
        "And it's killing us.",
        "When you say that there's this rigid masculinity, what do you mean by that - that men aren't able to express themselves?",

        "And I wonder, while you were researching this film, while you were doing interviews, did you have an opportunity to talk to anyone involved in the investigation or the prosecution?",
        "We made the opportunity available to them to speak with me, and many refused.",
        "Some did speak to me and asked that it not be revealed that they did.",

        "How did they react when they saw this dramatization of their lives on screen?",
        "A lot of tears, a lot of relief on their part, I think, feeling that their story was finally going to be told and seen and heard and just a very intimate, personal, emotional moment that, I think, outweighs anything that I've experienced as a filmmaker up until this point.",
        "My goal was to tell their stories.",
        "And to, you know, get the well done from them with tears in their eyes was everything I need.",

        "She didn't really even say anything, but \"\"duh duh da da, duh duh da da.\"\" You know what I'm saying?",
        "And I think that's something that I wanted to mimic in this song.",

        "Well, I don't think I, like, really made a conscience attempt to try to balance anything.",
        "I think maybe it sounds old school because it's the truth, and I think that a lot of the older music, you know, they dealt with everyday life situations because that's what was popular at the time.",

        "And what's interesting to me in thinking about these ideas is you hear those similar thoughts being expressed by, like, the trans community, where they would say, I just didn't feel like I was living in my own skin.",
        "And I feel like for me, sort of embracing my own version of masculinity has been similar.",
        "And it's taken me a really long time to just feel comfortable being me.",
        "And is part of that embracing of this expanded view of masculinity taking responsibility for some of these issues?"
