        "You do not shoot somebody in the back if they are not a threat to you.",

        "O'Brien notes that the law gives police the benefit of the doubt and says Rosfeld's lawyer will argue a number of factors.",
        "TIM O'BRIEN: That the officer's ability to observe wasn't as clear because it was dark, because of where he was standing, that he misinterpreted something that he saw and that it was a mistake.",
        "This case also reveals something we've seen in other police departments across the country - the lack of a policy on when to use deadly force.",

        "You might think you just have to fill it with water and see what happens, but the water would only be inches high, not feet high, as it was during Katrina.",
        "So to really recreate the force of the water and the weight of the walls on the ground, engineers have to subject the model to 50 times the normal force of gravity.",
