        "You could implement any number of what I would argue are half measures - no-fly zones, demilitarized area safe zones, humanitarian corridors.",
        "You could supply more sophisticated weapons to the rebels.",
        "You could attack Assad directly.",
        "And I think the one question I would ask is Putin, Assad, the Iranians, Hezbollah, are prepared to die in defense of their national interests in Syria.",
        "And the question, really, Scott, is are we?",
        "If in fact Congress is willing to empower the president, the American public is prepared for a major investment in another Middle Eastern war in the wake of Iraq and Afghanistan, then sure, make Syria a major priority - perhaps the priority.",
