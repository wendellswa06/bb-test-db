        "And I have to admit, I don't know that they have come out yet from the...",
        "I don't believe so, yeah.",
        "...we've seen anything, but it's part of the dance.",
        "And we could get a nominee quickly, or it could still be a little bit.",
        "Well, Mara, the White House said today - by the end of May.",
        "Yes, I think that they want to keep to the schedule they felt worked for them with their first nomination, Sonia Sotomayor: Get a nomination up to the Hill late May, early June, and then try to get him, her, whoever it's going to be, confirmed in pretty short order.",
        "I think the White House has some interesting things to balance.",
        "They want someone young, who's going to be on the court for a long time.",
        "They want someone who is a powerful enough personality and force on the court that could create some majorities, could negotiate with the swing vote, Anthony Kennedy, to make some five-to-four majorities.",
        "And also, they have to decide how big a fight they want, how liberal a justice to send up, how big a fight do they want with the Senate?",
        "And also, the reverse of that is if they want to be safe, obviously they'd pick a more centrist candidate, but this might be their last chance to have a liberal because their majority is going to shrink, for sure, and possibly disappear altogether after November.",
        "Their majority in the Senate.",
        "In the Senate.",
        "So in other words, if youre thinking that you are at the high water mark of the number of Democratic votes you have in the Senate, you might as well go for the most liberal one you're ever going to get because you're never going to get a chance like this again.",
        "Let me ask you, though, about a curious incident involving the woman many regard as the leading candidate here.",
        "That's Elena Kagan, currently the solicitor general, formerly at Harvard.",
        "And a blog appeared last weekend which said if nominated and confirmed, she would be the first openly gay justice of the Supreme Court.",
        "Yes, which kind of breached a taboo to talk about that.",
        "The White House reacted angrily and, I thought, a little bit mysteriously because they said they pushed back against that blog, but they said it wasn't true, the blog was false, unless they mean there already is an openly gay justice on the court I don't think that's what they meant."

        "That she is not a lesbian.",
        "So they, in effect, were saying she's not a lesbian, which I thought was mystifying because I thought the position you want to take is, this is irrelevant; someone's sexual preference should be irrelevant to their qualifications for the court.",
        "Now, CBS did pull down the blog.",
        "The blogger did kind of say, oh, I was trafficking in rumors.",
        "But I found that kind of curious, their reaction.",
        "This week, President Obama went to the West Coast to campaign and make a speech for Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer, who - of course - is up for re-election.",
        "And in his speech at the fundraiser, was interrupted by a protester who yelled out: Don't ask, don't tell.",

        "We can talk about that.",
