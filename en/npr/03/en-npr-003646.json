        "And the other part of this is - well, I wonder how the polls show he would fare in a three-way race.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "There was a, sort of a well-timed poll for him just this week, that showed pretty much a dead heat between - if he ran as the independent, Marco Rubio as the Republican nominee and the likely Democratic nominee, which is a congressman from Miami, Kendrick Meek."

        "Well, first of all, this investigation is something that Crist has been using like a cudgel against Marco Rubio.",
