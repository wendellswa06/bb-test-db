        "And how close is this race?",
        "Well, that depends, right, on which poll you're looking at.",
        "But my best guess, paying pretty close attention to this race, is that it's still double-digits, but just barely.",
        "Double-digits in favor of the incumbent?",
        "In favor of the incumbent, that's correct.",
        "And this is a challenger who's being coming at the incumbent from the left.",
        "Interestingly, for the most part, yes.",
        "Bill Halter is perceived as more liberal.",
        "It's difficult to say, you know, how much that's measurably true.",
        "But it's also to say that, you know, in some ways, the perception is that it's not difficult, at least from some Democrats, it's not difficult to be on Senator Lincoln's left - although again, empirically, I'd say that that's questionable.",
        "But much of his challenge is coming from the left, and even more than that, sort of an anti-Beltway populist train, but this time inside the Democratic Party."

        "And I have to ask, though, is being attacked from the left a bad thing for a Democrat in the state of Arkansas?",
        "I would say that it's really not.",
        "There certainly are some liberals in the state, and they certainly have been frustrated with Senator Lincoln.",
        "There are also the usual forms of frustration that she has become too distant and hasnt been home a lot.",
        "I would say that the latter is more prevalent.",

        "But in a sort of sick way, I think that his challenge from the left has really served to her advantage, assuming she survives it.",
        "It's allowed her to position herself where most Arkansans are, which is squarely in the middle.",
        "And some of the language she's used - you know, I'm the rope in this tug-of-war...",

        "You know, she kind of carved out a space for her left on this one because it is economically to the left and therefore, populist.",

        "And my comment being, in the past year and a half, I believe, Blanche Lincoln has really come on to the radar in the kind of more left-leaning area of Arkansas in her approach to the health-care bill and how she kind of - not necessarily stalled progress, but was one of the major deciding votes in whether or not that would go on.",
        "And also, I believe that in Arkansas, if you notice, a lot of the Democratic voting seems to go fairly in line with the labor unions.",
        "And as I see it right now, it doesnt seem as though the labor unions - the stronger ones here in Little Rock - are really behind Blanche Lincoln.",
        "Sorry, slow down.",
        "Slow down.",
        "She is - oh no, not as much as 20.",
        "There are a couple - there is sort of a quote-unquote internal poll.",
        "There's an independent poll run by a liberal site that still finds her within double digits.",
        "You know, it's anywhere, I think, from, you know, 12 to maybe 15 points.",
        "But there was another poll and it was automated telephone calls, but also from an independent source, that had Halter within seven points of her.",
        "So you know, we're probably somewhere in that range.",
        "It's still a lead, but I'm sure not the lead that she would like to have at this point.",
        "And in terms of, you know, the trouble that she's had, particularly in central Arkansas, that and in Fayetteville - where I live; are the more liberal places to be in Arkansas - I think it's interesting because certainly she was high profile as being in the middle.",
        "She both voted for and against public option, health care in general, she voted for - excuse me against public option, but for health care in other ways.",
        "She let it continue, she let it not continue.",
        "And the conventional wisdom has been that - that that made, you know, Democrats and conservatives - Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives, angry at her.",
        "On the other hand, I would argue it positioned her where most Arkansans are, when you looked at any of the independent polling on health care.",
        "And I guess the other thing I would say to some of the liberals, that I found a little bit puzzling, is if you look at her ADA scores - you know, kind of that established mark of liberalism in American politics today - she tends to, you know, other than Vic Snyder, for the Arkansas Democratic delegation, she tends to do better than any of the others, consistently - again, according to the ADA.",
        "In 2009, for example, she was at 95 percent congruence with ADA scores.",
        "So she's doing what's worked for Arkansas politicians who are Democrats for a while, which is toe the party line and be a loyal Democrat on fairly low-profile issues, but then carve a middle path or move to the right on the high-profile stuff, which is where the electorate is.",
        "Well, thanks very much, Janine Parry.",
        "It sounds like it's a tactic that may work well in the primary.",
        "It could be a Republican year, though, in Arkansas, Florida, and in some other places, too.",
        "But thanks very much for your time today.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "Thanks so much.",
        "Janine Parry, an associate professor of political science at the University of Arkansas, with us today on the line from her office in Fayetteville, also director of the Arkansas Poll."
