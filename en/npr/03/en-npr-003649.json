        "There was a process in your family that you described, I think, when you put together that book of poems for your mother a few years ago, that you and your brother growing up were asked every holiday - or big holidays and birthdays - to present a poem to the family.",
        "Well, we had to pick out a poem for my mother.",
        "She had to buy us presents.",
        "So I just want to make clear that this was a one-way deal.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But she really wanted for us to have us pick out a poem that we liked.",
        "And I think it was a wonderful way of just opening up an exploration and discovery that was completely self-motivated and no homework, no pressure.",
        "And we just had to pick out a poem and copy it over and memorize it if we wanted, but we didn't have to.",
        "And so she saved all those poems and put them in a scrapbook, which I still have.",
        "And I've tried to continue that with my own children.",
        "And looking back over the poems that we chose at different ages is almost like looking at photographs, because from the handwriting and the illustrations and just the poems themselves, I can just see so much about each one of us at different ages.",
        "And, of course, we became very competitive about this process and whose poem was going to be better and whose poem she was going to like more.",
        "But I think it really gave both of us just a confidence that we could understand poetry, that we - there was nothing, really, to be afraid of, and there were so many poems out there.",
        "So I think it was a wonderful way of inspiring that curiosity in us, and I think it's a great family tradition that people would really enjoy.",
        "Has that tradition been easy?",
        "You mention your kids now in adolescence.",
        "Has it been easy to continue it when they enter their teen years?",
        "Well, no. But, of course, they know that if they give a poem, you know, that's just such a homerun that they're happy to, you know, to throw us a bone.",
        "That and they make a play list for my iPod, and then I'm happy."

        "But actually my middle daughter gave me a poem that she had chosen - she translated one last year, and then she gave me one this year for Christmas.",
        "And it's - actually, I was able to put it in the book.",
        "It's the last one in the book, by Elizabeth Bishop, \"\"The Colder the Air.",
        "And so, for me, that gives this book a special meaning, because it has poems in it that, you know, that my mother loved, as well as that my children have chosen.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "We had Billy Collins on the show last week, and he was talking about part of the problem in our adult appreciation of poetry is that when we're teenagers in high school, the way it's taught, we learn to put up our poetry deflector shields, as he described it, because we know if the teacher starts reading a poem, the next thing we're going to get is a bunch of questions.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, that was good.",
        "We never had that.",
        "But I think people get intimidated by poetry, and it just makes them feel like they can't understand it.",
        "And I think that that's really unfortunate.",
        "And, in fact, I've been working in an after-school poetry program in the Bronx, and the kids there are writing poetry much more than they are reading it.",
        "And I think that the spoken-word movement and the confidence it brings and the self-expression and the self-discovery that come along with writing poetry for adolescents is really a wonderful thing and hopefully will bring back some of the accessibility of poetry.",

        "And we'll start with Peter, and Peter's on the line with us from Berkeley in California.",
        "Well, I just think it's a time when a lot of people are sort of reflecting on their lives and where they've come from and what they want to do the same or differently going forward and there's still enough time to be able to make some of those changes and decisions.",
        "Hi, great topic.",
        "Yeah, I mean, I've had a poem by Robert Frost that's been kind of the credo for my life.",
        "During the 1970s, I refused to get a regular day job in order to promote and teach transcendental meditation, even despite great odds.",
        "And now it's getting mainstream.",
        "And from the mid-1980s to the present, I've refused to get a day job in order to promote common peace ideals for our planet."

        "You know, we just celebrated the 50th anniversary of the inauguration a couple months ago.",
        "And he invited Robert Frost to read, and I think that really kind of elevated the importance of the arts and language and ideas and rhetoric and showed the kind of central role it was going to play in his presidency, and connected that ceremony back to its kind of classical origins.",

        "No.",
