        "I never, ever, ever, ever think about how the poems will impact people.",
        "That's not something that you can anticipate.",
        "That's something that, in fact, if you start to wonder about it, corrupts the process of writing the poem, which, after all, is a process of going very deeply within to terrain that even we don't know what it's going to turn up when we go excavating.",
        "So once it's a done thing and out in the world, then audiences find what they will in it.",
        "Here's an email that we have from B.Z.",
        "Smith(ph) in California: At 16, I memorized \"\"The Road not Taken,\"\" and little did I know that it would become my life's anthem: quitting college, divorcing, remarrying, babies, death of my husband, going back to school.",
        "Always, I've been on the road not taken.",
        "Now, at 61, I work with my local arts council, helping with the national poetry Out Loud program that introduces teens to classic poetry.",
        "And that's one.",

        "I'm an architect, and we loved it.",
        "It was one of our prized gifts from the wedding, and it has come to represent our marriage.",
        "We read it to each other at our anniversary every year.",
        "And, well, I'd be interested, both of you: Weddings seem to be a moment when most people seem to embrace poetry."

        "Well, absolutely.",
        "And all of the occasions and crossroads of our lives, I think, called for distilled language with which to mark those moments with which to remember, with which to put a jumble of feelings and emotions into something that's crystal clear and that you can hold in the palm of your hand.",
        "And I think, Neal, you and Caroline were talking earlier about people's fear of poetry, and I just wanted to second or third the call not to be afraid of poems.",
        "And I think that actually evidence is to the contrary.",
        "I think that everywhere, people are finding that to have heightened language that they can hold onto in the middle of their lives is something profoundly human and ancient, actually.",
        "Heightened language?",
        "Heightened language.",
        "So I think that even when poetry is plainspoken - that is to say, even when it means to - for example, the poem that I read is a relatively direct and plainspoken poem.",
        "But the language itself is much more distilled than if I told you that story over the course of a longer period of time.",
        "So I think finding the best words, even when they're simple words, and putting them into a kind of a small jewel is what - one of the things that we're trying to do when we make poems.",
        "And...",
        "I think, also, you mentioned weddings.",
        "Obviously, that's a time when everybody runs for the poetry books and tries to find the right poem or the right verse, Bible verse, to capture that moment, which is obviously one of the extraordinary moments in our lives.",
        "But I think - or least what I hope would come out of some of this is that there are so many ordinary moments in our life, and that poems can make them extraordinary.",
        "And I think they give you a new way of looking at the ordinary moments.",
        "They bring emotion and they bring history and they bring wisdom or insight or clarity, and really can transform our daily life.",
        "And so hopefully, by putting other poems in the book, along with love poems that are maybe good for weddings, people will, you know, turn a couple pages on and find something that helps them look at their own life in a different way.",
        "Because I think poets put into words the thoughts and feelings that we all have, but we can't quite say them.",
        "And they take the time, and they have the insight to be able to, as Elizabeth said, to distill or to heighten those.",
        "Let's go next to Sara(ph), Sara on the line from Fairbanks in Alaska."

        "Your children are growing up.",

        "And it really spoke to me about that sort of - when you're a child, and you have that special time with an older person, as well as - as a mother, it spoke to me in terms of how important it is to take the time with an individual child to do something special and make some special time.",
        "So I think that depending on where you are in your own life, you do come back to poems, and they have these layers of meaning.",
        "Or if you have a poem that you know meant something to your mother or grandmother or grandfather, then that -you pass those memories and feelings along to whoever you share the poem with.",
