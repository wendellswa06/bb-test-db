        "And there are those who think of the government as them, that it's a force kind of outside the body politic, should be kept at arm's length, sometimes does more harm than good.",
        "In this current political climate, do you see that underlying mistrust of government as being at least part of the reason for the anger that we're seeing?",
        "Yes, I do, and well, I do think that some of the people at these open meeting are orchestrated.",
        "I mean, especially when they're reading from note cards, but the outrage that many Americans were expressing and the anger is a really long-standing American tradition.",
        "I mean, it's built into the political DNA of the United States, almost like no other country in the world.",
        "We're one of the few countries where patriotism is often expressed as a love for country and a hatred for government, and presidents from Jefferson to Ronald Reagan have campaigned for the presidency on the principle that they will dismantle the government once they get in office - although they seldom do that.",
        "It's, as I say, built into the political DNA, all the way back to the American revolution.",
        "That's the wellspring.",
        "That's where it starts, which you'll recall was an attempt to leave the British empire - successful attempt - based on the principle that parliament and the king represented an arbitrary form of government that imposed itself without the consent of the American colonists.",
        "And so the notion of a distant government, far away, not under your eyes, as a leviathan that devours your liberties and that you can't let it in just an inch because once it's in, it expands and takes away all freedoms.",
        "This - and if you read the Declaration of Independence, it has absolutely nothing good to say about government and everything good to say about the sovereign individual, not the collective, but the individual, and the government only exists at the consent of the citizenry."

        "I think the fact that it's about a life-and-death issue ups the ante, but I think it's because we've got a health care system that is clearly bloated and very expensive and needs to be fixed.",
