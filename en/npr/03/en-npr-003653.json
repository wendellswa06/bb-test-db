        "Is every individual case unique or after a while do you start to see patterns?",
        "There certainly is a pattern, but each individual has their own story.",
        "And we cannot ignore their differences.",
        "Each person has similar stories and then the differences for what they have experienced.",
        "The experience you develop over time, though, can help you, learning from some victims, how to help others.",
        "That is true.",
        "But also, we want to make sure that we pay attention to the details and individualized reactions because not everybody is the same.",
        "And you've had a lot of experience in Africa, not just in the Democratic Republic of Congo but earlier in Rwanda and other places as well.",
        "Is there something special about what's happening in Congo?",
        "I think many people had heard that rape and sexual violence is quite high in Congo.",
        "And that is a pattern that we do see among our clients.",
        "And what is your job exactly?",
        "What do you do to help them?",
        "Okay.",
        "My position is the country director, so it is administrative position.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I make sure that the program is operated accordance - in accordance with our own policies as well as in accordance with the government, the host government's policies.",
        "And that could range from human resources to finances, but also oversight of the program."

        "Do you find yourself in conflict with the government from time to time because they might be, well, among those conducting this torture?",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And let me turn to you, Darrin Waller.",
        "You're based in Jordan.",
        "And one presumes you're not dealing with victims just who were tortured in Jordan but those arriving in Jordan primarily at this point from Iraq, I would think.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Neal, indeed, the majority of our clients were actually Iraqi refugees that have fled Iraq to reside in Jordan.",
        "We do have a few clients that are Jordanian and other nationalities, but mainly Iraqis.",
        "And what kind - again, is there a pattern that you see or is every case unique?",
        "Well, in, of course, in one sense, every case is unique and people deal and respond to that in very different ways.",
        "But yes, there are also patterns to the torture in terms of what we've seen with the sectarian violence and some of the methods that have been used on people and some of the reasons that people are fleeing from Iraq.",
        "And sadly, for the Iraqi people, they've now seen torture over - or have had to deal with torture over many decades.",
        "So we're dealing with recent torture and torture that's happened previously to...",
        "Back in the old Saddam Hussein regime.",
        "Absolutely, and going back to the Iran-Iraq war as well.",
        "But mostly, our clients have been the victims of torture due to the sectarian violence that broke out.",
        "And again, you're obligated to work with the government because you're a resident in that country.",
        "Nevertheless, there have to be some questions that you as administrator might have from time to time about the Jordanian police and their policies.",
        "Yes.",
        "Absolutely, you're correct.",
        "And we have a good relationship with the government.",
        "We obviously have to keep a professional distance, as well.",
        "But what we endeavor to do in certain cases like you're alluding to is to advocate on a one-to-one basis in terms of changing attitudes and changing policies.",
        "And, indeed, part of our mandate, as well, is training other NGOs, raising awareness of torture, working with different groups such as the police or border police or security services.",
        "And that takes time, Neal.",
        "That's not going to happen in one year, five years.",

        "Or is your job to try to prevent the cause of torture?",
        "I think what we could actually do - actually say that it's both.",
        "But our program is pretty much focused on the treatment.",
        "So it is an assistance, but in a way that it is going to be empowering.",
        "It is to bring the survivors to recognize their own resources, their own strengths that they can draw on, and then continue to seek assistance themselves.",
        "And by doing so, we are hoping to break the cycle of violence.",
        "It is well known that if you are a victim of violence, then you are likely to commit violence yourself.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So what we are trying to do, then, is to provide healing services so that they can then - do not have to repeat the violence themselves.",
        "And do you find some people are resistant to getting help?",
        "Some people want to say: I am determined to use my anger to find justice, revenge - however they might want to put it.",
        "I would say we have not seen that among our clients.",
        "There has been a lot of hesitation in terms of seeking services.",
        "This is a mental health service.",
        "So in - just as in other countries, there are certain resistance, even certain stigma.",
        "But we conduct a lot of psycho-education sessions, both in the communities, and we also radio, actually, to inform them about what could happen if you have experienced trauma.",
        "So, with that, they do actually recognize the symptoms that they're actually experiencing are normal, and that they can seek assistance so they can get better.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's not their fault that they were tortured.",
        "That is correct."
