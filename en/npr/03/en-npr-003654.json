        "They're both victims and perpetrators.",
        "Correct.",
        "Briefly, Darrin Waller, as you look ahead maybe to the next 25 years, what are your biggest problems?",
        "I think there needs to be a process of healing and reconciliation for - certainly in the area that I'm working, that the Center for Victims of Torture is working in Jordan.",
        "That's going to be a very, very difficult process.",
        "The other thing that the center wants to achieve is just for torture to stop, and we need to get that message across loud and clear - and in terms of people being held accountable for this happening.",
        "So if there's anything that we want to see over the next 25 years is for this type of horror to stop.",
        "Hear, hear.",
        "Thank you both very much for your time.",
        "Maki Katoh, country director for the Center of Victims of Torture in Democratic Republic of Congo, Darrin Waller has the same job for the Center for the Victims of Torture in Jordan.",
        "They were both kind enough to join us here in Studio 3A.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "Divide and conquer works.",
        "You tell them, no. You tell them Wisconsin has never been about that, never will be about that, by electing Tom Barrett governor.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, the truth is that, you know, insurance companies currently stand between them and their doctor, and many of the people who are so terrified are receiving a Social Security check and are on Medicare.",
        "So there's something kind of irrational here.",
        "But nevertheless, the chord it's touching is an authentic one, and I don't think that the bulk of the people at these meetings are disingenuous.",
        "They might be misguided, but they're speaking from the heart."

        "And I think you said earlier, that perhaps some of the anger is being orchestrated.",
        "Do you think it's being manipulated?",
        "I think that certain right-wing groups and certain mostly Republican groups on a state level have lists of their conservative activists that they've called.",
        "They've given them texts and scripts and asked them to show up -although many of the people share - I mean, they don't have to be persuaded.",
        "They share those convictions.",
        "But in that sense, at some of these meetings are places in which what you see before you is not an accurate reflection of general American public opinion.",
        "Does it de-legitimize the concerns of some of the people who are there, though, if they are…?",
        "No, no. I mean, I think that democracy is a messy business, and when you see it in operation, it's like watching sausage get made.",
        "It's not a pretty sight, but I think that - I don't want to - I don't think you can dismiss the concern and the fear that exists out there in the country because - just because, there is some partisan politics being played with this.",
        "I mean, I do think on the right wing of the Republican Party, this represents an issue in which they feel that because Obama has invested his presidency in the passage of this legislation, if they can defeat it, that's a major blow against Obama, and that's something they very much wish to do, and that's their priority.",
        "But I do think that there's an abiding fear out there about the health care system of the United States and what it's going to look like.",

        "Now in an op-ed in politico.com this week, you wrote that something has unsettled the national psyche.",
        "What did you mean by that?",
        "What's unsettled the national psyche?",
        "Well, I think there's a boiling point that the nation has undergone with - as I indicated in the piece, you know, you've got car-company takeovers, you've got bank takeovers, you've got stimulus packages that really haven't been too stimulative.",
        "You've got unemployment that hasn't gone down very much.",
        "It's better than it was, but it's still bad for an awful lot of people in the country.",
        "And so my point was that I think all these other issues are boiling up, and they're testing the patience of the electorate - of Republicans, Democrats, independents - and that's why I think you're seeing these major turnouts at these town hall meetings to confront their elected representatives and ask and expect some answers."

        "And my other points in that piece were that, you know, come on, Mr. or Mrs. Congressman or Congresswoman or Senator, your job is to meet with the public, answer their questions, explain why you haven't read the bills that some members of Congress are saying they're not going to read and don't need to read, and some of the - you know, with the communications being what it is today, a lot of citizens, just ordinary people, are getting online.",
        "They're looking at these bills that are being considered.",
        "They're listening to hearings.",
        "They're watching C-SPAN.",
        "And they come armed with knowledge to these various town hall meetings, and they expect answers.",
        "They haven't been getting them, I don't think, and so, you know, you have thousand-page bills that people don't read.",
        "That upsets the public, and then you compound that with the whole personal nature of the health-care debate and the fear that what they have is not going to be what they have later, they get with a new government-run program that is proposed by those in power.",
        "And it just boils up in people's psyche, and they say enough, and they're expressing their outrage.",
        "As Professor Ellis said, this is genetic in our history.",
        "People - the citizens have the right to stand up and be heard.",
        "And you know, you have a post office that's having financial problems.",
        "You have Medicare that's struggling.",
        "You've got Social Security that's struggling.",
        "And so there's a lack of faith in the institutions of government that's compounded when a congressman or senator gets up and says I haven't read the bill, I can't answer your questions, and by the way, quit shouting at me, and I don't like to be confronted like this.",
        "That's wrong.",
        "Also, in terms of the number of programs that have been approved within the first six months of this administration and the size of debt that's been accrued, is it the size of the debt, the amount of money we're spending, or is it the pace at which the money is being spent that you think people are worried about?",
        "I think it's a bit of both, Lynn, but I think it's the cumulative debt that is driving people crazy, and I think - you know, I remember running for office back in 1994, and you know, my opponent was the speaker of the House, a fine person, but I disagreed with him, and I said, you know, Mr. Speaker, you know, the debt for every man, woman and child in the United States today is $18,000, and that's outrageous, and we - you know, you've been in charge for 40 years in the House.",
        "Yes, sir, ma'am, wanted to thank you for your guests.",
        "They've really hit on it well.",
        "I talked to farmers in eastern North Carolina every day, all day long, about this particular issue for the past six months.",
        "Health care, you're saying.",
        "UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #1: Please enter your passcode then press pound.",
        "You know, now the debt is, I think, approaching $50,000 per man, woman and child in the country.",
        "So that gets on people's nerves.",
        "And you know, I have a foundation that brings young people back to Washington, let them learn about government.",
        "And we just finished a session of civics education with our students for two weeks back East, and to a person these students were concerned about responses from the members of Congress who would say, yes, we're spending this money, and they'd say who's going to pay for it, and they'd say you're going to pay for it.",
        "And so you have these college students who are saying, wait a minute, this is a whole lot of debt and you want me to pay for it, and I'm not even out of college yet.",
        "So it's felt at young people's level, it's felt at seniors' levels, it's felt all across the spectrum of Americans.",
        "And I think people are fed up, and that's why they go to these town hall meetings and ask their questions."

        "as a whole, very childish and insecure, and that will have repercussions.",
        "Let me just ask you, Kaylee, why you think that the government may not be stable enough.",
        "Why do you have that sense?",
        "Well, I think that, you know, as the guest was saying, there is a lot of turmoil within our country, you know, the economy and all the other things going on, and it just seems that at this moment there's a lack of a cohesive leadership to really get us all back on the same page and that things are not being handled in a rational, democratic fashion."

        "Well, I think that maybe the comment - the caller is reflecting the fact that the evolution of American society over time has reached a point where we're facing major problems that are only soluble at the federal government level, and we've been creeping that way for most of the 20th, into the 21st, century, but the fiscal crisis we face, the environmental crisis we face, especially global warming and the health care crisis we face require a collective response best represented by government.",
        "We're not as good at that, we're not as used to that.",
        "I also think that we're different from most other countries that have a single-payer system because we're much more ethnically and racially diverse.",
        "So when people in England and Canada think of us, they think of people pretty much like themselves.",
        "In America, there's tremendous ethnic diversity and racial diversity, and I think that makes it more difficult for us to think of government as representing all of us at once.",
        "I wonder, George Nethercutt, if you were at all surprised to hear this young woman say that she thinks there's concern among people her age, younger people, that the government's not stable.",
        "Not too surprised, because I think that's what happens when the public loses faith in the leaders of the country.",
        "I mean, I know Mr. Ellis has written about our founders, and I've done a lot of study about our founders too, and my sense was that as the founders created this country and made decisions for it, they were less focused on themselves and more focused on the good of the people and the happiness of the people of our nation.",
        "I sense today that, without being critical of either party or any president, that the public service is more about the servant than it is about what might be best for the people.",
