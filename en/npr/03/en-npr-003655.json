        "I sit down with them and ask them what they think about this idea of changing our health care system, and almost to a man they are against it, though they do see the need for reform of some type because they see their premiums going up, you know, 10, 15 percent a year.",
        "They're paying, you know, more for health care than they are for their house, but they are A) fearful of government, basically just fearful of government intervention.",
        "You know, they are very independent-minded people who have, you know, been on their own, worked the land generation after generation and generally just afraid of government getting more, getting bigger and more involved in their lives.",
        "And they're also, the other flip side of that is responsibility.",
        "They see the Americans who are getting this free health care per se as not taking responsibility for their lives, and these guys are very big into responsibility.",
        "So they're making the assumption that the health care, whatever the health care reform is, will be somehow free for some and not for everyone.",
        "Let me ask Joseph Ellis to respond to that, because what I heard our listener say here is that there's a fear of government out there, and that seems to go to what you've been talking about, I think, Professor Ellis.",
        "Right.",
        "You know, I won't repeat.",
        "This is a long-standing tradition that's not one political party or one political persuasion.",
        "It spreads across the spectrum.",
        "But I do think that for white males in rural areas, that's where a lot of the militia groups come from - and I'm not suggesting that the majority of rural white males are militia people - but there's a fear.",
        "The population of the United States within 50 years is - whites are going to be a minority.",
        "The face of the government is that of an African-American.",
        "People aren't used to that, and it plays at very deep racial fears which are often quite powerful but quite unconscious, and I think it provokes mistrust in a way that is difficult for them to comprehend.",
        "So we've got a lot of problems, there's a lot of proposed changes going on, it's all happening very quickly, and our leader is our first African-American president.",
        "George Nethercutt, to what degree do you think racism plays into this?",
        "I don't think it's as much as some may think.",
        "I really think it's more policy-oriented.",
        "I think that the nation was proud to have the first black American, African-American president in the history of this country.",
        "It speaks volumes about this nation being an equal-opportunity nation, and I mean that.",
        "But I also think that, you know, that doesn't give license to change the government in a way that is uncomfortable for the nation as a whole.",
        "We are an independent people.",
        "We do respect, you know, hard work and self-sufficiency.",
        "To have this sort of massive, apparently a massive government takeover, as I said, indicated by banks - you know, bank control.",
        "You've got 35 different czars making decisions about pay for corporations, and corporations are people with jobs.",
        "And it's not so much the racial background of our president.",

        "Well, let me ask you this.",
        "Are you at all concerned about some of the rhetoric you're seeing out there?",
        "I mean, because I've seen even, you know, conservative columnists like David Frum expressing concern about the level of anger that's out there, that it could be a prelude to violence, that maybe some of the conservative media, for example, should be pulling back somewhat.",
        "What's your take on that?",
        "Well, I think there's an element of that in our country, and I think it's the job of a president and congressional leaders to not say that because someone comes to a town hall meeting and raises the dickens that they're un-American or that, you know, we've had enough talk about the health care issue; let's not talk about it anymore, let's just do it.",

        "If it's an African-American president who does it, people don't like it.",
        "I think the president's obligation is to quell those fears, to give calm to this country, to be reasoned in his approach - as opposed to saying, I got a plan, I'm going to run it through, and I don't care what you all say.",
        "And I think that backlash is starting to build.",
        "And heaven help us if turns into violence.",
        "I would deplore that.",
        "But people are very independent in this country, and they care deeply about our essential values.",
        "And they don't want to see them eroded.",
        "And health care is so personal that I think, you know, 1,000-page bills, who knows what's in them.",
        "And, certainly, the elected officials going to that, then says to the public, you don't know what's in it.",
