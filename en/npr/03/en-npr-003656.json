        "George Nethercutt, we just heard another listener say that he feels that the people at these town halls are trying to have a referendum on our presidential election and there's concern that people in this - as we've heard, about race here.",
        "You've already addressed the race issue, but what about this idea that people are trying to Hitlerize our legitimately elected president.",
        "Well, I guess I'd - there's going to be extremes on both sides of the political spectrum.",
        "You're going find nutty people in the right; you're going to find nutty people in the left.",
        "But to categorize everybody who disagrees with the president's health care policies or other policies in government, I think, just misses the point.",
        "You know, Mary makes the strong point about race.",
        "You know, you have to remember, this country elected Mr. Obama as president, and after the election, he had something, like, close to seven out of 10 Americans thinking he was doing a good job.",
        "Then they learned about his policies, whether it's the banking or the stimulus package or unemployment representations and other things, and now, health care, and his numbers are dropping like a rock.",
        "And I think that says less about race and more about policies, and that's my point.",
        "I think we can find - seek to find racial divide in everything we do.",
        "You can always argue that, but that doesn't make it right.",
        "And I don't agree with it.",
        "I think it's less race and more the country's disagreement with this president's policies and the Democrats in charge in Congress.",
        "I don't say that politically.",
        "I just say that that's just an agenda that I think most Americans don't agree with, and they're expressing themselves.",
        "Some…",
        "Dawn, I'd like you to address that issue of the Congress because I have an e-mail here from Roger in Colorado.",
        "And he says it's my personal view that the anger expressed at town hall meetings reveals a basic distrust of Congress.",
        "Congress, whatever administration is dominant, has consistently shortsightedly voted to increase entitlements for Social Security and Medicare, so that these programs are virtually bankrupt.",
        "Why should we trust Congress to create a viable plan to save the health care system?",
        "Their track record is abysmal.",
        "Now, Dawn, you've already said that you do see race in this, but what are some of the other concern?",
        "Is this a legitimate concern?",
        "Or just…",
        "Well, let me just back up a little bit because I do agree that Congress - that there is this - often this odor surrounding Congress.",
        "And the track record has been abysmal.",
        "But I do think that it's important to point out that Obama won in the election 44 percent of the white vote.",
        "And the reason why a large percent - he won an overwhelmingly large percent of the vote of people of color.",
        "And so, it's - I mean, to say that the country elected that - you know, that the country elected a black man, I mean, that, indeed, happened, but the vote was much more nuanced along racial lines.",
        "And I think that that's extremely important because there are still a lot of white voters who did not vote for Obama.",
        "And we can't say that that was the case because of his race, but that there was some evidence of that.",
        "And back to the question of Congress.",
        "Yes.",
        "There is - there - when we talk about the TARP funding, how the money was spent months ago and, I mean, just the track record that we - excuse me - that we've seen, I mean, there is not this great record.",
        "And voters are - taxpayers are tired of not knowing exactly where their dollars are going.",
        "And I think that those are very legitimate concerns."

        "Hopefully, it would be a bipartisan solution that would be embraced by Republicans and Democrats, but it hasn't so far.",
