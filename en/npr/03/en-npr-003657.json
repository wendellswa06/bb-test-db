        "And that's not to say that it can't work, but I do think that it will take that.",
        "But the race element, here, is - we're talking about this angry knot of people who for whom there is very little that can be done to really kind of calm things in that regard.",
        "And so I think that we, you know, he has to - the president and Congress have to find a way to get beyond the politics of it, the racial aspect of it - I mean, those are huge mountains - and really get to the business at hand.",
