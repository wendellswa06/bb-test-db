        "Yes, he had 37 years in power.",
        "He shouldn't even be there for another 37 seconds.",
        "This is really a battle over who succeeds Mugabe, who's 93.",

        "Everyday a new story - let me just first tell you, Rachel, that President Mugabe - can you believe the man who is under house arrest has actually called a cabinet meeting today?",
        "He called his ministers or those who are remaining to come for a cabinet meeting.",
        "None of them has because the governing ZANU-PF party which ousted Mugabe as leader last week has begun impeachment proceedings against him because he has refused to resign.",
        "So they've been meeting, we're told, now to find out how they're going to go about this because it's a difficult process.",

        "President Mugabe is not a fool.",
        "I mean, he is the ultimate political survivor.",
