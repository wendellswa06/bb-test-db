        "OK.",
        "Three Democrats came to dinner last night, along with some Republicans.",
        "But this outreach to Democrats is different than the true bipartisan approaches on tax legislation in the past.",
        "In those efforts, you'd see the Republican and Democratic leaders of the tax writing committees working on a bill together from the beginning.",
        "But this time, Democrats have been pretty much shut out of the process so far.",
        "It seems that what the administration wants to do is try to pick up a few Democratic votes, and they're targeting Democratic senators who are up for re-election next year in states that Trump won.",
        "And all three of the senators who were there last night fit that description.",
        "OK, so he wants their votes.",

        "Now, the White House and congressional leaders say details will be coming soon, possibly by the end of this week or month.",
        "They have to vote on a budget resolution first.",
        "And some House conservatives are saying they want to see the details of a tax plan before they vote on the budget.",
        "The reason they have to vote on the budget is that is the way that they can unleash something called reconciliation that will allow them to pass this with only 51 votes in the Senate instead of 60.",
        "OK, so a really complicated process, during which you would imagine the president is going to need to try and keep that Republican caucus together in Congress, which has been no certain thing so far.",
        "What is the White House relationship right now with Republicans on the Hill?",
        "Well, Republicans - relationships with Republicans in Congress - a little shaky.",
        "It's not just that the president blindsided Republicans with his snap decision to make a deal with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer last week, but also, looking ahead to 2018, the White House will not commit that the president will stay out of the primary process.",
        "In other words, he could get involved and support Republican primary challengers to Republican incumbents.",
        "You got a hint of that in Arizona, right?",
        "I mean, when he went there."
