        "In this specific case, they're being accused of publishing hyperlinks, as you mentioned, to past donors.",

        "Is this a part of a bigger crackdown on civil society right now in Russia?",
        "Well, Russian NGOs have been saying for the past five years, since massive anti-government protests, that it's already become a lot more difficult for them to work because of new legislation.",
