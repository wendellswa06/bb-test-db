        "In the most recent years, in the last, oh, you know, four, five years of this decade, we've seen a real stagnation in people's wages and salaries.",
        "The only big gains were among the 0.1 percent at the very top",
        "So if you look at employers, and you have a lot to say about our largest employer in your book.",
        "A lot of people are talking about, we have to find ways to make service jobs, which are the jobs that most people have in this country these days, to make those jobs the same kind of job you were talking about, the Ford jobs, where people could afford to buy the products of the companies that they worked for.",
        "Is there a way to do that",
        "Well, we'd have to reverse a lot of things we've been doing.",
        "We'd have to have, you know, more protection of worker's rights, so that they can organize, for example.",
        "That's the traditional American way of kind of bootstrapping your way up, was to have a union.",
        "We'd have to have more living-wage legislation and higher wages than we now do.",
        "We'd have to raise the federal minimum wage above the measly seven dollars and change - it's going to go up to in 09.",
        "All kinds of things, yeah",
        "And, but it takes a huge reversal of policy",
        "Yes, it would take a big reversal, because everything has been going the other way.",
        "Look at, you know, the last eight years' tax cuts for the wealthy, cuts in various services for the middle class and the poor and the elderly and children.",
        "So, yeah, we'd have to turn all that around",
        "You write, at one point, and you're a sarcastic writer, so I'm never quite sure what you mean, but do you feel betrayed by your country",

        "I wouldn't use that word.",
        "But I feel ever more angry and determined to get America as we used to know it up and running again",
        "And do you see any prospect - now that we're in this economic situation, where everybody's deeply concerned about what's been going on, the stock market falling and the house values falling and unemployment going up, though still much lower, well, than it was in the 1970s.",
        "Nevertheless, with the economic situation as it is, do you see any prospect for some of these changes to start happening",
        "Only if we make them happen.",

        "My comment is about the statement was made earlier that the American standard of living has gone up, and I just wanted to say I think that there is a strong relationship between the appearance of that and the availability of credit, and also the marketing of credit to people who can't afford to pay it back.",
        "Why start now, Peter?",
        "And I think that there needs to be much more strict regulation of markets that have been taking advantage of people by making them believe that they are able to afford more than they are through the extension of credit.",

        "You know, you couldn't hope to save enough for that house, but boy, did they have a mortgage for you, you know",
        "And then you could take out a home-equity loan, even putting yourself further in the whole",
        "Oh, yes",
        "Exactly, and I have many friends in their mid-30s who are losing their houses and who will have a very long-term issue in terms of their credit standing because they were promised that they could just skip all the steps of saving and everything else and just buy on time for things that were just way beyond their means",

        "Many of the people that I went to college with didn't have any financial education until college, and that personal money management, which is a very basic overview, was like a shock to their system.",

        "I think it becomes incumbent that we demonstrate that personal responsibility, particularly when we don't have that much money to manage.",
        "Which actually wasn't my point, but I felt I had to respond to that.",
        "But what I was going to say was one of the things that seems to have gone unnoticed is that up until and including the Reagan years, whenever there was an increase in the productivity in the workforce, particularly in manufacturing, that increase translated to increase in pay and or benefits to the workforce.",
        "But beginning in the 1990s what happened was we saw, in some cases, dramatic increases in productivity.",
        "Manufacturing productivity in the last 10 years has gone through the roof.",

        "But part of the problem, and I think the fundamental problem, perhaps, is that now money chases its own tail, and we no longer talk about the purpose of money, which is to help develop the initiatives and the creativity of the individual.",
        "And I think that's something that's lost from our discussion, and I think when we don't include that, then it makes it all too easy to start thinking about people and paper clips and go merrily on our way discussing economics and high finance without including the human element and indeed ultimately the spiritual element",
        "Joe, you make a really good point - I couldn't emphasize this more - is that one of the disturbing and fascinating thing that's happened in recent years, like the last five years, is the decoupling of the major economic indicators from how people were actually feeling and living.",
        "You had plenty of economic growth, that didn't translate into wage increases."
