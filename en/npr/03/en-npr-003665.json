        "It sure does.",
        "Four percent, that can't be right",
        "Absolutely, and I think one of the things that sometimes gets lost is we make the statement, it's not personal, it's just business.",

        "Thank you.",
        "I just wanted to ask the author, I'm a small business owner, and she talks about raising the wages for workers.",
        "That's fine and I understand, you know, it sounds good, but the problem is that if you raise the wages, then the cost of the good produced will go up.",
        "So therefore, the goods will go up along with their wages and they'll cancel each other out",
        "Well, you know, we've had an experiment in this since about 1998.",
        "Twenty-nine states have raised their minimum wages above the federal minimum wage",
        "You write about Washington, the state of Washington",
        "Yeah, the state of Washington, for example, you know, getting up to eight dollars an hour.",
        "And so the question was, all these predictions were being made, Nate, saying well, when that happens, you know, the states that raise their minimum wages, they are going to go downhill right away.",
        "Nobody will live in them.",
        "The company - you know, restaurant and hotel industries will shut down.",

        "People, they were doing better in Washington.",
        "Business was booming.",
        "Now more and more small businesses are saying, yeah, we want a better - we want a higher minimum wage, but we want it for everybody",
        "Yeah, I see that point, I guess, just personally speaking, I just know for my business what it will do and I just - I think there should be a better way.",
        "I just think that across the board mandating that wages go up sometimes is shortsighted.",

        "What's going to get fixed first?",
        "Well, the first thing we have to understand is Barack Obama has teams of people in place.",

        "Every statistic, every study suggests that long-term investment in education and educational access will improve the economy, will expand prosperity, will help raise the floor upon which all Americans stand.",
        "The cap in trade not only improves our energy policy but it also ultimately generates the tax revenue necessary to support a health-care project.",
        "So there is this way which these things are all interrelated and it's almost disingenuous or naive of Jack Welch's suggest that he has too many irons in the fire.",
        "And also Jack Welch has already demonstrated a lack of understanding of politics.",
        "He made an attempt to move in to EU as his last effort as president I believe with GE, and his failure to understand the political situation in EU preventing him for being successful in that.",
        "He doesn't understand politics.",
        "So I'm confused as to why they even have him up there speaking on political issues.",

        "But those are two different skills set.",
        "Those are totally different skills sets.",
        "They overlap.",
        "No wait, the president of the United States needs to have that skills set right now, and the bottom line is this isn't about politics and this is about this country moving forward.",
        "And if you look at the bills that have been presented that the president is going to sign, they are riddled with spending that has nothing to do with either the short term or the long term health of this economy recovering and creating jobs.",
        "It has nothing to do with it.",
        "I think that kind of speaks to my point because, he is the president.",
        "The Congress controls the earmarks.",
        "Although he hates the earmarks, or doesn't want those earmarks, he has not choice if he wants that bill passed in a reasonable amount of time but to sign that.",
        "So those compromises are required.",
        "And if your just looking at the bottom line like a CEO and that's OK, but if you're president and you have all these different issues to focus on, you can't afford to be as pure in ideology as a businessman.",
