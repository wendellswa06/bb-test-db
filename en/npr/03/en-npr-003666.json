        "As of last month, a record five African-Americans are leading state legislative bodies and the number of black state lawmakers has reached record levels.",
        "Do you think that Obama's ascendancy paved the way for a new path - paved the path, I should say, for a generation of black leaders, and is this part of the coattail effect, Sophia?",
        "No, I think that they're separate.",
        "I mean, I think that we have seen a positive trend in the state legislatures, for example, particularly in the northeast and some other regions where they're heavily populated groups of African-Americans and people of color in the South.",
        "So, we've seen those trends at the county and the state local level and this was - it's generational.",
        "We've talked about this before, Gen X which is my generation is coming in to power now.",
        "Obama is kind of sort of Gen X.",
        "He's a little older, he's not old enough to be a boomer, but I think that the presidency is something that is separate and apart because I still think all of us are beaten awe and shock - I know I am - that we still have an - that we have an African-American president.",
        "I still I'm grappling with, wow, that's real.",
        "And I think that was something that happen a little bit quicker than we all expected that it might but I think the trends in the state legislatures are - have been going in that direction so I'm not all surprised by this.",
        "Well, Marc on the other hand, on the other hand, while Mr. Obama is getting all the love except for from Jack Wells at the moment now, other black leaders are suffering publicly like GOP national committee chairman Michael Steele, former Detroit mayor Quamy Kilpatrick, New York governor David Paterson.",
        "Are these men being measured against Obama, do you think?",
        "I don't think you have to be measured against Obama, necessarily, to fail.",
        "I mean, Michael Steele measured against the chair I'm sitting in would be a failure based on its performance.",
        "Quamy Kilpatrick just got out of jail.",
        "I mean, you know, you don't need a sort of world historical figure like Barack Obama to make these guys look bad.",
        "I think these guys are doing well on their own.",
        "I think that people will ultimately be measured against Barack Obama but I think the current cadre of particularly Republican black leadership is more about our GOP reactionary tactics than it is anything to do with Barack Obama.",
        "Well, I wonder, Brandon.",
        "Do you think there's any legitimacy to the thought that the president's - I don't want to say survival - but the president's just existence in that chair as a black person has changed the dynamic at all for other black politicians, and those who don't live up are going to pay a price?"

        "And so it is emotional and I think all of us should be much more emotional about the topic of domestic violence, particularly in the black community.",

        "People are worried that if Rihanna takes Chris Brown back that young black girls would think that an abusive relationship is acceptable.",
        "And the other thing very quickly which is disturbing is the way when people keep looking for exculpatory narratives for Chris Brown.",
