        "It seems like the challenge with a high-level election security czar is that elections are really run at the state and local county level.",
        "So what kinds of proposals have there been, and would they actually make a big difference?",
        "That's right.",
        "Well, one proposal is to restrict the way social media networks can operate or what declarations they have to make because of the role they played in social media agitation in 2016.",
