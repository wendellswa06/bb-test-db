        "It was a very harsh welcome back to the United States, back to San Jose.",
        "The immediate reaction, there was a lot of booing in the stands, and there was a demand that they remove their medals and throw them out.",
        "The Olympic Committee did expel them.",
        "They did get to keep their medals, but they were ostracized.",
        "On campus, there were death threats constantly, and they were receiving death threats before the games as well, but they obviously intensified afterwards.",
        "And they really had more or less to go into hiding, even though they wanted to continue their studies and really continue to be athletes as well.",
        "It really affected their lives deeply on a personal and professional level even to this day.",
        "One of the things that was odd was some of the other athletes who were black who were at the Olympics at that time did not participate in that.",
        "Talk briefly what the impact of that was?",
        "I'm thinking now - I believe George Forman was there in '68.",
        "I hope I'm correct about that and...",
        "You're very correct",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I remember seeing him holding the American flag at the same time.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That happened after the protest, and there were several events, obviously, that black athletes were participating in before that there at the games.",
        "In track and field, as a matter of fact, several gold medals had already been handed out, and all of them had the option of making some sort of statement, and they all decided not to for various reasons.",
        "Largely because they feared the backlash they would have on them personally, and how they'd be viewed by other Americans and others within athletics because they wanted to protect their careers and futures.",
        "George Forman was actually handed that American flag after winning his gold medal in boxing by his coach, who was vehemently against the things that Tommie Smith and the other members of the Olympic Project for Human Rights were standing for.",
        "So George Forman, and he's admitted this later on, was sort of unwittingly part of that, and he waved it in the ring.",
        "And he became an American icon, and he's said since then that, when he came back to the United States, he thought he would be the hero among black Americans.",
        "And he found that he was the outcast, and that Tommie Smith and John Carlos, among black Americans, were the heroes.",
        "So here we are, 40 years later.",
        "John Carlos, Tommie Smith about to be given the Arthur Ash Courage Award - in fact, they were given that at the Espy's, and are being honored again in Mexico City on the 40th anniversary.",
        "Do they say, if you've been in touch with either of them, do they say that it was all worth it as they look back?",
        "They've always said it's been worth it, and they've suffered some terrible trials and personal setbacks.",
        "The death threats, not just to themselves, but to their families.",
        "Their careers have been affected.",
        "Their livelihoods have been affected.",
        "A lot of - both of them have had to move around several times, and they've even had their own personal struggles with each other.",
        "But during this year, when receiving the Espy's and in making appearances all over the country, to talk about what happened 40 years ago, and to look toward Beijing just this past summer, they've come together and talked about how they've had no regrets.",
        "If they had the opportunity, they would do it again.",
        "And if anybody today was so inspired to do the same thing, they would highly encourage it.",
        "David, thank you very much."

        "It's a shock to us, you know, to have to be in the position where we're talking about her in the past tense, because she seemed to demand to be remembered by her vibrancy, and her joyous reflection of life itself, and even given the challenges of this crippling disease, a few weeks ago at a benefit we threw, and there she was, you know, in her condition.",
        "I think she was perhaps wearing a wig or something like that, you know, because she had lost her hair, but she was in a gown at a table, and she was laughing and applauding other young performers.",
        "Her sense of always being there for the theater was a way she would want to be remembered, I think.",
        "Can you take us back to the time, this is probably before your days at Williamstown, when Christopher and Dana would have met, and think of the young actors who are coming there for this year's season, and how this death might affect them.",
        "Well, I thank you for thinking that.",
        "I mean, the sense the continuance in the theater is, I think, the thing she was trying to celebrate with her life.",
        "And yes, they met when they were apprentices.",
        "And Apprentices at Williamstown, they paint the scenery, they make the costumes, they sweep the stage, they remove cigarette butts from the lawn outside the theater, and also, they sometimes get too act alongside very famous people, and they get directed by wonderful, wonderful directors, and get lit by famous lighting designers, and stand in front of very beautiful scenery made by the very best people in the business."
