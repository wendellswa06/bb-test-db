        "Yeah, I think the deal that was accepted by the Italian government is a very wrong message to hostage-takers, because it means if you want to free one of your colleagues, that if you want to free someone or even that has blood in the hand, you can kidnap a journalist, you can kidnap a humanitarian worker and you can put pressure on a government, and if the government is ready to accept this type of deal it might create more problems in the future.",
        "It's quite worrying.",
        "And I just spoke with some journalists who are now in the south of Afghanistan and they had to take extra security measures because they really care that - I mean they are very afraid of what can happen now.",

        "But what is true is that this crisis is - I mean, first of all I think that we have to say that the Taliban has - we have to blame them on what they did.",
        "And this mullah (unintelligible) is a notorious killer and he committed so many atrocities in the 90's…",

        "And it seems to me pretty obvious that the answer to that is yes.",
        "And of course the problem is - is integrity going to be part of that communication process?",
        "But I think we have to try.",
        "And I think the greater the scope of our attempt and the more persistent we are in trying, the more successful we're going to be in generating mutual understanding and teasing out the legitimate needs that are hiding behind illegitimate needs.",
        "And I think we should do this at a global level as much as possible, and of course TALK OF THE NATION is part of that process.",
        "Well, yes, but is there a distinction between saying what are your political demands in broad term and saying negotiating the release of kidnapped reporters."

        "Vincent Brossel, what Peter's suggesting, of course, is ongoing discussions between the sides in Afghanistan, and I'm not sure that is not going on.",
        "Nevertheless, to do it openly gives the opposition who has been routed just a few years ago from their capital in Kabul gives the opposition claim of political legitimacy, and particularly this one group of Taliban.",
        "I think I quite agree with your listener, because I mean in this type of crisis and situation you can negotiate with the Taliban.",

        "That's one thing, but not under the circumstances of kidnap.",
        "Yeah, I mean I think that the Taliban also expected sort of international attention on them, and we have to take all this in account, into account.",
        "And also that in Pakistan or in Afghanistan you have many people who can have sort of influence on them, and in the past there have been some cases of journalists or humanitarian workers kidnapped by the Taliban and they were released after appeal from some mullahs from Pakistan or from some journalists from Afghanistan and Pakistan.",
        "So I think the mistake that was done is to refuse a dialogue at the beginning, and after you have to give everything, because finally you were - I mean the Italian government was under so much pressure because the driver was killed.",

        "It's unusual for a deal like this to be made so publicly, but how common is it for these sorts of quid pro quo agreements to be made more quietly?",
        "I think the issue of negotiating to save the life of a citizen is incumbent upon any government to try to.",
        "The question is, what are the principles within which this negotiation takes place and how far anybody's prepared to go.",
        "It's interesting; in this conversation nobody ever mentioned, in my view, what is a very discriminating element of this case, and which is where this five Taliban's already been sentenced according to a due process of law.",
        "Because if that is the case, we are speaking about one situation.",

        "Many years ago I found myself exactly in that position.",
        "It was in Lebanon.",
        "It had to do with German hostages, and I was asked to switch two German hostages, which are clearly innocent bystanders, so to speak, for two Lebanese individuals who had been sentenced for terrorist activities in Germany.",

        "It took longer time but eventually they came out.",
        "I think the issue here is not the question of negotiating with the kidnappers.",

        "Let's be very clear.",
        "There are some individuals who take hostages around the world and have been doing so for long time who simply are not taking hostages because they want something back or because they want to give them back; that's a different kind of individual.",
        "They take hostages because they have a conversation going on with their potential supporters.",
        "And then there are those who take hostages because they want to talk to us on the other side.",
        "And one has to understand first who they are.",
        "And the difference being - well, you know, I guess in a way a videotaped beheading posted on the Internet is a conversation with potential supporters as well as, I guess, a message to the opposition.",
        "In this case, one man was beheaded and another man was then negotiated and released.",
        "Yes, but again, I think there's got to be consideration being given to the fact, number one, every single situation is different.",
        "And number two, the individuals or the individual or the institution who undertakes the negotiation will always be put in a very, very hard position.",
        "But let me tell you something, whatever decision is taken by the negotiator, he or she will live with that decision forever.",
        "And that is a real consequence of this.",
        "This is not an easy decision to take.",
        "And again, I think the word humility was used by your participants earlier on, and I think it's a good word to use.",
        "But also, equally, to be clear, if somebody has been - has gone through the due process of law, to exchange that person for innocent hostage, I think that's a serious issue.",
        "And again, for those who joined us later, Ian Fisher, the New York Times reporter in Rome who reported this story, I asked him that question and he said he did not know where in the judicial process these particular five prisoners who were released were.",
        "So we'll have to wait further details on that."

        "I think the issue is not so much to contact with the hostage holders, but is within what frame would you prepare and how far you are prepared to go.",
        "Because I would agree in this particular case, if I was today a journalist in Afghanistan, I would feel more in danger.",
