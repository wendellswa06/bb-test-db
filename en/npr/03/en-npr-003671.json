        "I didn't want to see any troops coming in to try to save us, or rescue us, or anything like that to save my sorry butt.",
        "And that didn't happen and we were eventually released to the hands of the international committee of the Red Cross, after about a week.",
        "So far as I know, no demands were made and no recompense or reward of any kind was made.",
        "But all cases are individual, and I have to say that I'm also glad that my company put pressure on the government to do something because something worked.",
