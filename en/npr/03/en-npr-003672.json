        "That was not the only bad news on Wall Street last week.",
        "The U.S.",
        "economy grew at a lower-than-expected rate in the last months of last year, and Alan Greenspan, the former head of the Federal Reserve, mentioned the possibility of recession.",
        "But China started the sell-off, and many were understandably nervous this morning when Shanghai, Tokyo, and London looked shaky overnight.",
        "So far, stocks are actually up today in New York, about 30 points or so.",
        "This leaves some big questions about the importance of the Chinese market, global markets, and the effect on the U.S.",
        "economy, and smaller questions about what all this means to your portfolio.",
        "You can call us with either.",

        "Edmund Harriss joins us today from the studios of the BBC in London.",
        "Nice to have you on the program.",
        "Hello.",
        "And is last week's big sell-off a sign of more to come, or was this just a one-week event?",
        "I suspect there probably is more to come, but I think this is more a case of last week's events causing, I think, market participants to have more of a collective gulp and realize that there are possibly other risks that need to be considered.",
        "And I think we've had a sort of a re-pricing going on in the markets, rather than there being any firm indication that there is something fundamentally wrong with the global economy.",
        "So in the terminology we've I guess gotten accustomed to, this is a correction.",
        "Yes, I think that's right.",
        "I think it is a pull-back based on a realization that not everything is well with the world, that there are one or two risks out there, and that for the last three, four months or so, markets have really been only going one way.",
        "And particularly in relation to the Chinese market, you did a piece of analysis last week that pointed out the Chinese market has been not merely rising but zooming the past couple of years and was probably overdue for a correction."

        "Yeah, I think so, but I don't want to sound too glib about this.",
        "I thought that last week's events were fascinating on a number of levels, but most particularly that a stock market which really doesn't represent the domestic economy of China - it is ring-fenced, and it is very non-representative - should suddenly be taken as a leading indicator for prospects for the world.",
        "And I can't think of too many examples where the U.S.",
        "has looked outside its own country and followed a stock market in the way that it did.",
        "So it does seem that, at least if markets are telling you in an unvarnished way, that China really does matter.",
        "First of all, explain a little bit what you mean about the nature of the Chinese market.",
        "Why does it not represent the Chinese economy?",
        "I think - well, the first point to make is that participants in that economy are domestic Chinese, and they are unable to convert their local currency into overseas currency.",
        "So therefore they cannot invest outside China, and so effectively that stock market is, for all intents and purposes, closed.",
        "And therefore in that sort of environment, you can find valuations and market behaviors to be quite extreme.",
        "It is also true that companies which you would normally expect to be using the stock market as a source of capital on an ongoing basis in fact do not.",
        "Most of these companies in fact use bank lending, and the stock market is in a very embryonic stage of development.",
        "So there aren't any - you know, there are few big players in the Chinese stock exchange, too?",
        "I've heard that this is the home of the individual investor.",
        "Certainly there are an awful lot of individual brokerage accounts, but the markets tend to be dominated by some very large players who are few in number.",
        "And these will be some funds, some state-owned enterprises, banks, one or two high net-worth individuals and then a very large group of retail investors who are a good deal less sophisticated than you would find in international markets, bearing in mind these markets were only started in 1990.",
        "And so they are on a learning curve.",
        "And you said it was peculiar for the U.S.",
        "markets to sort of follow this lead, but it wasn't just the Chinese lead, it was followed by Hong Kong, Tokyo, Paris, London.",
        "All those markets went down, too, on Tuesday.",
        "Well certainly.",
        "I think that Asia, in fact, sold off a bit, but I think Asia has become used to volatility in Chinese markets.",
        "When you do see a big move like that, it is a pause for thought.",
        "But I think the reaction that we saw in Europe and then the U.S.",
        "was a source of great surprise to Asia, and so when Asia followed the next day, then it sold off very heavily.",
        "But it represents, I think, a fundamental misreading that the fact the Chinese stock market sold off 10 percent in no way indicates a change in the economic environment in China and simply cannot be used to extrapolate global trends.",
        "But I think it was - just because of the size of the move and because China is so much in the forefront of people's minds, there was an instant reaction which then got exacerbated with cross-currents of further information, further economic data and comments from policy-makers."

        "Whether or not you move this way or that way is a complex question.",
        "The real issue is, of course, whether or not a deep and protracted stock market decline - which I don't see, nor does anyone else see happening - could begin to affect the real economy.",
        "There's a real economy, and then there's a financial side to the economy that is connected, but the connections sometimes are not that tight.",
        "So I don't think that there's any concern at this point that what is going on on Wall Street will have any effect on the rate of economic growth or other elements of the real economy."

        "And Edmund Harriss, let me check back with you.",
        "As far as I understand it, the Chinese are still projecting, what, eight percent growth next year.",
        "It's not as if their economy is exactly going into the tank.",
        "Indeed, indeed.",
        "The rates of investment, loan growth, are all on track.",
        "And I think we're likely to see an easing of some of the monetary tightening that we saw over the last 18 months or so.",
        "So from a Chinese perspective, no growth is well on track.",
        "And we can see that if we're looking for what's going on in the commodity markets.",
        "I mean, I know that outside Australia there are a hundred ships waiting to collect coal and iron ore to feed the construction industry in China.",
        "Right now, as we speak, it's pushing up domestic shipping rates and creating tight capacity in the dry bulk shipping market.",
        "But Howard Wachtel, I guess the reason people are concerned is because the two economies seem to be so integrated.",
        "We're of course China's best customer for all those products they make so cheaply.",
        "And of course, China - we borrow a large amount of money from China.",
        "Well let me add also, I think the most important link is the fact that major American international companies are heavily invested in China.",
        "So the rate of foreign investment is several hundred billion dollars a year now from American companies investing in China and then selling products back to the United States.",
        "So these are the same flagship in a sense.",
        "So that could be a worry.",
        "But the issue of China I think is very, very interesting.",
        "China has had this incredible rate of growth, as we know.",
        "And everyone is looking as to whether or not there will be a soft or a hard landing for China.",
        "It can't keep growing more each year.",
        "The trick is in order for investment to keep coming in and everything to be working smoothly, China has to keep growing faster every year.",
        "So even though they may have a rate of economic growth of eight percent, that's a bit of a slowdown.",
        "It's kind of like driving your car up a hill.",
        "If you take your foot off the accelerator you lose speed.",
        "And that's I think the concern.",
        "Secondly, the Chinese banking system is very fragile.",
        "Everyone knows that their banks have on the books a great number of, in effect, bad loans that can't be collected.",
        "So long as the rate of growth is high enough, that's masked.",
        "It's a Ponzi scheme.",

        "That's right.",
        "It's like Japan was in the '70s and '80s.",
        "So, you know, what we're looking for, I think, in the world is that the rate of economic growth in China will continue but will gradually begin to slow down and that the Chinese government will take seriously the problem of the fragility of their banking system.",
        "That's the real threat.",
        "But let me ask you - and by the way, Michael, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "I forgot about you.",
        "The point that Edmund Harriss was making that - and forgive me for paraphrasing - but he seemed to say: Given the nature of the Chinese market, a lot of what happened last week was psychological rather than economic in terms of looking at the actual value of what happened in China.",
        "Would you agree?",
        "I would agree with his analysis, although I'm reminded of the fact that every year we hear about and Asian flu epidemic and never hear about European flu or African flu or Oceana flu.",
        "So the contagious effect of these things we've had before - ten years ago, we had another example of Asian contagion - and so it seems as if we are now morphing between financial and medical metaphors here."
