        "Hi.",
        "I was listening to some of your guests saying - Mr. Harriss saying that it seems like at the epicenter for the sell-off could have been placed at Shanghai, but everyone scratching their heads as to the source of maybe the sell-off or coming up with an explanation as to why that would have such an impact on world markets.",
        "I was wondering if either of the guests would comment on maybe the fact the day before the Bank of Japan had raised its rate and that that might be unwinding the carry trade and having more of a global effect than perhaps what the Shanghai markets do.",
        "Edmund Harriss, what do you think?",
        "Well, now that is a very interesting point because there is plenty of talk about this yen carry trade.",
        "Japan has the lowest interest rates in the industrialized world.",
        "They're only half a percent, compared to five and a quarter in the U.S.",
        "and in the U.K., and three and a quarter percent in Europe.",
        "So it is a game that some investors are playing to borrow in yen and then to reinvest those proceeds into other high-yielding assets.",
        "And following the Bank of Japan's rise in interest rates and potentially a belief that the Japanese economy is starting to strengthen, there is also the possibility that the Japanese yen may start to appreciate, and that will make this cheaper borrowing rather more expensive.",
        "And so could that slow economic growth is what you're saying?",
        "Well, I think what has - what this means is that it's symptomatic of a belief that if the risks are now perceived to be somewhat higher than the perceptions were, say, last week, which is what appears to have happened, then it would make sense to draw back from some of those riskier trades, to sell off some of these high-yielding assets to repay some of those yen borrowings.",
        "And that is something that could have an impact on financial markets and could go on for a little while.",
        "The difficulty is trying to establish how extensive this yen carry trade actually is and how much leverage has been employed in the process.",
        "But I still feel that this is an ephemeral sort of number to try and get a grip on, just the same way that liquidity is difficult to get a handle on.",
        "And I think we're still in a process whereby investors are still trying to recalibrate where the risks lie.",
        "And it's now very important for investors and try and take a step back and think, has anything fundamental changed in the economy this week compared to last week, and is there a clear indication that I should now be getting out of equities?",
        "Or is this something that is a technical correction that is maybe being exacerbated by one of two factors?",
        "It's very easy to get caught up in the maelstrom in the short-term.",
        "And I think if you're a mutual fund investor or investing over the longer term, you really need to have your eyes set at least on - well maybe not on the horizon, but looking out two, three, six, twelve months hence and saying, has anything fundamentally changed?",
        "If I could just add to that.",
        "Go ahead, Howard Wachtel.",
        "There was a rumor - and perhaps it was more than a rumor - that the Chinese government was going to be - was raising the tax on capital gains.",
        "If that was the case and I was an investor in stocks, I would want to cash out before the tax came on because I would avoid that tax.",
        "That was withdrawn or the rumor was not correct, but - and that happened in China so that that would be also a much more direct, easier to understand for me, explanation as to why somebody sitting there in their apartment with some yuan invested in the Chinese market might go down the street and say, I'm getting out before the Chinese government taxes me.",
        "If I may add…"

        "Quickly, if you would.",
        "Sorry, I was just going to add that at least as far as the Chinese stock markets are concerned, they halved over the last four or five years before rebounding very strongly in the past year.",
        "Effectively between 2001 and 2005, those stock markets weren't functioning.",
        "And the Chinese authorities have been worried that a sharply rising market could lead to a severe crash and another four or five years of a dysfunctional stock market, and they really do not want that.",
        "Good point.",
        "Joining us now is nationally syndicated columnist Ilyce Glink.",
        "She's written many books on money matters, including \"\"50 Simple Steps You Can Take to Improve Your Personal Finances.\"\" She's with us today from the studios of Chicago Public Radio.",
        "Nice to have you on the program.",
        "Nice to be here.",
        "And we're talking about, you know, taking the long term, looking out two to three months down the road, seeing if anything fundamental is changing.",
        "A lot of people don't have that kind of patience when they start seeing headlines like this on Tuesday.",
        "Well I think that's really one of the problems is that they don't have the kind of patience that they need in order to really play in the market.",
        "You know, the timeline you want to be looking at is 20 years, not 20 minutes.",
        "Twenty minutes, you're a day trader.",
        "You know, and that's not a winning game for almost anybody, although I'm sure your distinguished guests know a few successful people.",
        "But for the rest of us out there, we're looking at, you know, 20 years to fund a retirement, or 30 years.",
        "And I think that the emotional need is to sort of say, wow, look at this big dive.",
        "I'm going to sell now because I'm scared.",
        "When really, in effect, if you didn't have to sell today, you haven't lost any money.",
        "On paper you've lost some money, but in reality you don't have any less cash in your pocket or in your 401K.",
        "This is the time to sit tight or even look at what else you've been wanting to buy that was a little too expensive.",
        "So this could be an opportunity in some respects.",
        "Yet you - in order to shoot this kind of footage, you have to plan your shot - each individual shot I would think - exceptionally carefully.",
        "And then all of a sudden, when you're trying to improvise in the middle of a hurricane, it's not so easy.",
        "Well, I definitely think that any time you have a pullback it's a buying opportunity.",
        "I mean, it's hard, though, to make yourself buy in because what you have to do is get yourself over the hurdle that, oh no, it's gone down; and if I put money in, I'm going to lose more money.",
        "And you have to get yourself over that emotional hurdle to say yes, but in any 20-year period, starting in any day of that period over the last hundred-plus years, somebody ended up better on the other side of that than they did when they started, and that's what you have to keep in mind again, that longer view.",
        "Let's see if we can get some listeners on the line.",
        "Andrea's(ph) with us.",
        "Andrea's calling from Jacksonville, North Carolina.",

        "Hi.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "My question was - I'm in an investments class and we've been following the market every day, and the day after this happened I was telling my husband, I wonder if this would be a good time for us to look into getting, like, an international or an emerging market mutual fund.",
        "And then a few days after that, you know, the market continued to drop.",

        "And you can go more specific.",
        "You could have had a China fund or you can have an Asia fund or a Latin America fund.",
        "You can even go down to the country to do an India fund.",

        "These - when we talk about emerging markets, we add them into our portfolio at small percentages: 10 or maybe 15 percent for an average person like myself.",
        "You don't want to put too much in because, as we're seeing now, it's very volatile and there are traders out there that live and thrive on the volatility.",
        "But, you know, frankly, I like to sleep at night.",
        "So just a small piece of your investment portfolio - 10, 15 - gosh, if you're a huge risk taker, 17 percent - go for it.",
        "No more than that, though.",
        "We're in our 20s so…",
        "You've got a long way to go.",
        "So if you want to do a little more, fine.",
        "But remember the volatility that you're seeing here, this is a great example of why big risks, big rewards doesn't always work out, depending on what your horizon is.",
