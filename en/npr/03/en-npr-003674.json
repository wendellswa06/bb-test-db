        "So my question is in relation to that.",
        "In the global community, what - I would like to - each of your opinions on just that, the psychology of this jitters and the drop in this market.",
        "How will - how do you think that will affect - you know, just philosophically speaking -how will that affect our future as looking back - as history has told us all, has told me - there is then more, you know, (unintelligible) about the great stock market crash back in the early 1900s versus like, the black plague or anything like that.",
        "It seems that the history of that psychology that - and the language of that, that is - has transferred through the years and has been more pronounced than say, you know, the deaths of thousands of people due to some illness or something like that.",
        "Right.",
        "Money is a very big, very big thing in our - in our culture.",
        "Right.",

        "It's a fascinating question.",
        "And I think that if anyone knew the answer, they'd be very rich.",
        "What happens is that on Wall Street and in the sort of larger community, journalists and others that talk about it, the same information gets interpreted differently, depending upon which side of the psychology you're on.",
        "Two weeks ago, for example, we would have gotten information about the slowdown in manufacturing orders, and Wall Street would have said collectively, well, that's a good thing, because it means that the Federal Reserve probably will not raise interest rates.",
        "We're heading for a smooth, soft landing, and everything looks nice.",
        "But five days ago, when they got that information, it was, oh, my God.",
        "This is just another indication of the problems and the overextension of risk and this, that and the other thing.",
        "So the psychology is the fact - is what you have to watch for is how it turns on a dime.",
        "The same information gets interpreted 360 degrees differently.",
        "And Ilyce Glink, I was just going to ask you about this.",

        "recession like your caller, I think, before this one was sort of intimating at - you know, you really just have to chart your own course.",
        "And so I always counsel my readers and my listeners to sort of pay attention to what they - keeps them up at night, and then your own time horizon.",
        "And if you've structured your portfolio properly, whatever happens, you know, in sort of the larger reinterpreted sense, it doesn't really affect you on a day-to-day level.",
        "It's in your 401(k) and in 25 years, hopefully, that's going to grow and change and support you in your old age.",
        "And, Edmund Harriss, how many of us are going to be waiting up in the middle of the night to check the figures from Shanghai?",
        "Well, I think the figures from Shanghai will look okay.",
        "I think things are going to slowly steady down.",
        "I think that what - the question was asked about behavior and at one point it tips over and took panic is an interesting one, and one that's been written on pretty widely.",
        "But I think, certainly, information gets, as the other guests have said, interpreted in fairly different ways.",
        "But the key problem, when it turns into panic, is when you discover that there's excessive leverage at the bottom of it.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Here we are shooting a documentary, all life, true life adventures, and doing it with an IMAX camera makes it even doubly difficult.",
        "You know, you try to plan - as you mentioned - try to plan things out and do a ton of research.",
        "We usually spend about a year doing our research to try to determine exactly who to shoot and how to do it.",

        "These films are generally shown in places like natural history museums and the like of that.",
        "And how does that affect the way you produce and write the film?",
        "Quite a bit.",
        "You know, besides being G-rated and completely factual from beginning to end, you want to give the audience an experience of being there, because that's really what they come to these gigantic screen theaters to feel.",
        "And so you write a film.",
        "The films are generally only 40 minutes long.",
        "So you write a film that has a very well rounded story, perhaps follows four characters, as we did in \"\"Hurricane on the Bayou,\"\" four musicians, and try to weave an engaging story involving people but also involving experiences that those people go through so that the audience can feel what kind of life they lead.",
        "And it's a different kind of filmmaking than I used to do when I worked on Hollywood features or doing films in 16 millimeter for television.",
        "We're talking with Greg MacGillivray.",
        "He's the director and producer of \"\"Hurricane on the Bayou.\"\" You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."

        "Well, music is such a big thing in New Orleans and in the Bayou area below New Orleans.",
        "And it's one of the distinctions that makes that area such a treasure of our nation and so worthy of saving.",
