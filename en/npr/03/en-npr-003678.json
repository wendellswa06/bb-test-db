        "The refrigerator was too big to take along, so how could he get the vaccine into the villages?",
        "And the only think I could think of was to get a ball of twine, white string.",
        "And to use that twine to transfer the live virus of the vaccine from one person to another.",
        "Here's how it worked.",
        "He enlisted some local boys, vaccinated them with the imported vaccine, and then had them travel with him to the distance villages.",
        "When you vaccinate someone for smallpox, it forms a little harmless pox, a sore that would substitute for refrigerated vaccine.",
        "We touched the twine to the boys' pustule, then we touched it to the arm of the next person coming up and pricked his arm so that he that would get the virus.",

        "So they - older women later brought the younger women all dolled up in ribbons and cleanly washed and so forth and they tried to push them forward.",
        "And I mean somehow I got rid of them the first night, but the next morning when we opened our clinic no one came.",
        "We'd insulted the village.",
        "So Dr. Moore turned to Shiva(ph), his Gurkha translator and friend, and asked what they should do.",
        "Shiva said you might think its offensive, but tell them you're too good for them."

        "Well, first of all, in the 1960s when I was a student, it was a very heady time for the civil rights movement, at least in 1964, and a lot of Northern white students thought of incredible opportunity, in some sense, improving American culture and society.",
        "Kenneth Clark, of course, when he was at City College, where I was a student, was in some sense the luminary who we all looked to as someone who we saw really--the incredible intellectual who was, in some sense, at the base of understanding what segregation and racism had done not only to black children but also to white children as well.",
        "So we all flocked to his classes because we saw in him, in some sense, the last best hope for American society and the hope for integration of that society in the mid-'60s.",
        "Did--tell us a little bit about his research into racial discrimination and how it was received at the time.",
        "Well, originally, he and his wife in 1939--actually, his wife, her master's thesis--when Mamie Clark, Mamie Phipps Clark, was a student, she did a very innovative study in which she looked at the ways children perceive themselves through looking at dolls and using dolls as objects of scorn or love.",
        "And what she found, which was very disturbing and we're told to believe was expanded on by Kenneth Clark, was that children, black children particularly, tended to look down upon themselves and to, in some sense, have a lot of self-hate.",
        "And that was shown by how they perceived black and white dolls, which black children often saw a black doll as ugly or not attractive, and a white doll as being very, very attractive and very nice.",
        "So this was kind of breakthrough social psychology at the time.",
        "And it ultimately ended up in the 1954 Supreme Court decision as kind of what was called the social science brief, the brief that showed that segregation, even though it was supposedly separate but equal, was actually harmful and very unequal, very damaging.",
        "Kenneth Clark, of course, lived long after that Supreme Court decision that he played such an important part in, Brown vs. Board of Education.",
        "Looking back on it, I wonder if he thought it accomplished what he thought it might.",
        "Well, I think that's really the shock that I had when I was a student, when I took his class, because I expected him to be optimistic the same way that white students were at that time.",
        "We had all essentially accepted the idea that racism was a Southern problem.",
        "And at that point, in 1964, '65, when I was taking his class, he had already written \"\"Dark Ghetto,\"\" and he was seeing racism as a much more insidious and much more damaging issue, and especially an issue for Northern cities and Northern communities as well.",
        "So he was not very sanguine at all.",
        "In fact, he was, I think, pretty depressed at that point when he had realized how entrenched racism and the fight against integration would be not only in the South but also in the North.",
