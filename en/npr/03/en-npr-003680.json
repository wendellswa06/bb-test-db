        "He was pretty depressed.",
        "The course we took was a course really in kind of existential pain.",
        "It was a very strange course that made deep impressions on all of us, but it was exactly the opposite of the course we all expected because we had all expected a course about the bright future of American integrated culture.",
        "And he was in this course talking about how basically this existential dilemma of racism and hatred of communities of themselves was so entrenched that there was very little that we would be able to do about it.",
        "And so it was a very eye-opening and very sobering course.",
        "One of the things that he did do about it was open the Northside Children's Center.",
        "It was founded by him and his wife.",
        "That's right.",
        "Yes, he opened a center in Harlem with his wife Mamie Phipps Clark that's still going today and is still a very, very vibrant place.",
        "And it was mean to be the first really integrated child development center, child psychology and psychiatry center in really the United States at that point, where both black and white children would go.",
        "And he set it up kind of on the border of white and black neighborhoods in the hope that black and white children would all be served by the center.",
        "And while it's still a very vibrant place, unfortunately the resistance to integration even at the level of mental health services was so strong that basically white children refused to come or would not be sent there by the social service agencies.",
        "So it, too, was, you know, really kind of a product and a victim of the very racism that he was identifying through all his work.",

        "One is the Chinese leadership has been pretty klutzy.",
        "And that's undermining global confidence that they can steer their economy through a period of slower growth, a transition to an economy that relies less on exports and more on domestic demand.",
        "Secondly, they've been letting their currency fall, presumably to help boost exports because they're worried about the economy.",
        "This has created a lot of confusion about what they had said they were going to do, which is let markets determine the exchange rate.",

        "It's really slowing a lot, and that means less appetite for imported commodities with effects in Africa and Latin America and Australia.",
        "And basically, it's leading people to think that maybe the world economy is going to be in for a rough patch.",
        "OK, so we have, in the United States, people worried about the behavior of the Chinese government, worried about the health of the Chinese economy.",
