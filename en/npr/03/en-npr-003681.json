        "That was really scary.",

        "And it's sort of a stretch, but my experience in Afghanistan - I'm a civil affairs sergeant, so it was very much involved with the people.",
        "And the culture in Afghanistan is - well, it's not like it's food-based, but food is an important part of it.",
        "And so I had a lot of really good experiences with Afghans surrounding food.",
        "And so I pitched this story to Edible Wasatch, and they accepted it, and I wrote it.",
        "And it published in the spring this year.",
        "And the whole experience was - it surprised me how important that was to me, like, it was very therapeutic, and it was a lot harder than I expected it to be.",
        "But it was good for me.",
        "And then they actually got feedback from soldiers in the area, thanking them for running the story.",
        "And actually, a soldier from my unit read it.",
        "I didn't tell my unit that I had done that, but they found out about it, and they really appreciated it.",

        "And as you were writing the story, did you work out some emotions, do you think?",

        "I think I did.",
        "It was hard, and actually even - I'm not really happy with the story myself.",

        "He was a decorated Marine captain in Vietnam, and that is a story that deals with battle and very traumatic things.",
        "But like your previous caller suggested, not everyone's - in fact, I might even argue most soldiers' experiences are not necessarily traumatic and difficult.",
        "Many people who serve come out with - feeling very good about themselves, feeling very good about what they've accomplished.",

        "Well, I guess the question is really whether writing about it would help or hinder you personally, or society at large.",
        "I mean, writing about it may - and this is always true when you write a story from your own experience - may create issues in your own life with those that you're writing about, because you're offering, you know, your interpretation of that experience.",
        "And they may not like the way you see things.",
        "But in a larger perspective, it's extremely beneficial for society at large to hear these stories if you had, in fact, difficulty dealing in your service with men.",

        "It's very split.",
        "I had great experiences with some of the people that I worked for, and very negative experiences with those who really felt that women did not belong there.",
