        "And it's - well, if you look at what's going on.",
        "You have 52 scripted shows that production has ceased on.",
        "The shows are much more elaborate.",
        "A lot of other things going on.",
        "So the industry is much larger in the scheme of things than it was in 1988.",

        "So the industry has created a piece of jargon for it.",
        "It's called dwell time at the airport, in the point of you might show up two to three hours before your flight because you never know what's happening with the security or anything else, and of course in the perfect world you've flown through security and you're sitting there with two hours to do nothing before your flight across the country with no food, so you go looking for something to eat.",

        "I mean if you come to Washington, there's a chain called Five Guys, which is a burger and hotdog and french fry place, but you know, the burgers are hand-formed and the meat is never frozen, so you could still get a great burger at the airport if that's what you're looking for.",

        "Most polls show the yes vote ahead, but one survey this month predicted voters would reject the peace accord.",
        "That probably would not mean a return to fighting, but Llorente says it could derail post-war reconstruction.",
