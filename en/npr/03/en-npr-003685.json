        "Walker's proposing record cuts to the University of Wisconsin.",
        "To cope, he suggests faculty might teach more classes.",
        "As Wisconsin Public Radio's Shawn Johnson reports, the governor has reignited a public versus private sector debate in the state.",
        "Scott Walker has signed hundreds of bills into law since he became governor, but there is one particular law - one act that's so controversial here, it's referred to only by its number - Wisconsin Act 10.",
        "People know it as the governor's signature collective bargaining law.",
        "They remember the protests and political chaos that preceded his successful effort to all but eliminate collective bargaining for most public employee unions.",
        "So it turned some heads last week when Walker unveiled his University of Wisconsin budget and made a calm, nonchalant comparison to the controversial union law.",
        "In many ways, will be very much like an Act 10 for the UW.",
        "Scott Walker's budget would cut the University's state funding by 13 percent and freeze tuition - a one-two-punch that campus leaders say amounts to the biggest cut in UW history.",
        "Wisconsin Public Radio also gets some of its funding through the university system.",
        "But the governor is stressing another part of his budget that would give the university more freedom to decide how to spend its money and ask its faculty to work more.",
        "Things are simple as, in the future, by not having limitations and things like shared governance, they might be able to make savings just by asking faculty and staff to consider teaching one more class a semester."

        "That's very similar to my thinking.",

        "Well, right.",
        "And I mean, you know, in the male world, I think, you know, the ego is more celebrated.",
        "In fact, I was reading a book on women's spirituality that said just that - that you know, in sort of prayer experiences, men might be drawn to kind of sublimate their ego, where women actually may be invited to actually celebrate themselves more.",
        "So this study actually makes sense, as much as we don't want to generalize about the sexes.",

        "Does it correlate with your own experience as a clergyman?",

        "One thing I was surprised on this survey - you know, it's done according to the Seven Deadly Sins.",
        "But the sin I hear a lot from women, without breaking the seal of the confessional, is gossip; that comes up quite frequently in women's confessions, whereas men are more likely to turn to the sexual sins first."
