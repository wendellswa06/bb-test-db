        "To examine how heavily companies market to young people, Cantrell sent field researchers out to about 750 small grocery and convenience stores in Washington, D.C.",
        "She found stores in areas dominated by young people had far more ads for little cigars.",
        "They were outside the store, and they were clearly targeted to a youthful eye.",
        "They're almost indistinguishable from candy packaging.",
        "Some ads that we've seen on the outside of stores, it almost looks like a big box of colorful crayons.",
        "And the price is right, too.",
        "Unlike cigarettes, which cost about $6.50 a pack and can't be sold individually, little cigars are wrapped in packages of one, two or three and average about 99 cents per cigar.",
        "The Altria Co., which makes one of the most popular cigarillos, says they market to adult tobacco smokers, not to children.",
        "Even so, Mayo Clinic researcher and public health advocate Mignonne Guy says little cigars are easier for kids to access than cigarettes, but no less harmful."
