        "My concern is about the privatization of charities.",
        "There's a lot of members of the conservative movement, the Grover Norquists, a lot of the conservative evangelical movement groups, that believe that charity is not the place of the government, and this greatly concerns me.",
        "It ought to shame our government.",
        "The problem I have - the major problem I have with it is that this is one person controlling a lot of money, and his priorities may change.",
        "He made decide he's concerned more about gay marriage, say, than AIDS.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "That could happen.",
        "It's - really we need to maintain the focus of charity from our government that will allow the voters, also, to decide how our government contributes, and that was my comment."

        "I think it is the beauty of a democratic democracy in which philanthropy plays a role to provide a check not only to business or the commercial sector, but provides a check to government, and so that by the fact that its primary role is really advocacy for something that you believe in that the median voter may not agree with.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And therefore we have the discourse of the ideas, and we have the experimentation, and then it is often taken over by government.",
        "And so - and philanthropy can play that role much better, because it can experiment with addressing a particular issue where government doesn't have that - in democracy - doesn't have that freedom to do because, you know, the officials are - have to, in some sense, manage the interests of the average person.",
        "Right.",
        "So, therefore, they allocate tax dollars for those purposes that the majority agree upon.",
        "So...",

        "It could be the other case, that we could have, in a very wealthy foundation, folks or family members who are not so responsible.",
        "And as you get bigger and bigger foundations, mega-foundations, as you will, with 25 billion, 50 billion, maybe 100 billion, you find a very few family members or wealthy members controlling a vast amount of money without any public discourse, with very little public accountability, and really controlling budgets that are larger than the size of almost all but 30 countries in the world.",
        "That's a disturbing aspect for democracy.",
        "It does raise a question, though, and, Dwight Burlingame, let me ask you about this, those foundations, precisely because they're not accountable to the public, or at least not in the same way as governments, they can do things that might be initially unpopular that might be good in the long run.",
        "That's true.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes.",
        "And certainly, when you think about the fundamental principle of pluralism and providing for activities, you always take - I mean, a foundation is fundamentally a moral decision in the - when we think about democracy, it's a moral decision mechanism, if you will, where someone is making - interfering when - because we call philanthropy, let's say, if we use the definition of voluntary action intended for the public good, we're (unintelligible) - the individual whereas the foundation is interfering into the lives of others without their permission in the interest of the public good.",
        "And so determining what that public good is and how you represent that becomes a really important point.",
        "So I think, you know, Pablo is right when he makes note of how do you assure the representation of the objects of your philanthropy being in this feedback mechanism, if you will.",
        "And one way to do that would be to have representatives of the representative groups that are being served by the philanthropy in your foundation board structure.",
        "That's one way.",
        "But there are - I think there are other ways to do that, and that's what most foundations, in fact, do is try to take assessments.",
        "They hire experts, what we call philanthropods, if you will.",
        "I mean poids, philanthropoids.",
        "And they go about trying to assess this and get that kind of information, and so I think there are some other ways to try to accomplish this.",
        "I think it's always a concern, though..."
