        "Who watches these private institutions?",
        "And because of the enormous tax benefits that foundation donors derive in setting up foundations, there is an obligation to be publicly accountable.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And the trustee of that accountability is the government, both the federal government and the state governments, through their attorney generals.",
        "Given the fact that there have been so many scandals over the last five years brought out in the media about the way a number of foundations have been run, charging - or giving trustees huge fees for just sitting on boards, numerous examples of self-dealing, excessive compensation, inappropriate expenditures, there is a need for government oversight and better enforcement.",
        "And that, unfortunately, is an issue on which many, many foundations are opposed to tighter regulations and tighter enforcement.",
        "Let's turn to somebody who knows a little bit about that.",

        "Well, it's nice to be here.",

        "What kinds of guidelines do they have to follow?",
        "Well, accountability is an issue, particularly for private foundations.",
        "And it's an issue that Congress has been aware of since 1969 when it enacted laws that imposed restrictions on private foundations that don't apply to public charities.",
        "The distinction between a private foundation and a public charity, for example, would be comparing the Gates Foundation, which is not publicly funded and therefore Congress concluded not publicly accountable, or as publicly accountable.",
        "If you compare that, for example, to the Red Cross.",
        "If the Red Cross does something that the public doesn't like, which has happened a few times recently...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...the public stops giving money to the Red Cross.",
        "That doesn't happen in the private foundation arena.",
        "If you don't like what Bill Gates is doing, absolutely nothing is going to happen, but - as far as what the foundation can do.",
        "So the government, in 1969, enacted rules, at least at the federal level, and what they do is to set up the Internal Revenue Service as the policer...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...of the border.",
        "Where the public can police public charities, they can't police private foundations.",
        "And the sorts of restrictions that these rules, which are implemented through the Internal Revenue Code, impose on private foundations are limitations on activities that private foundations can engage in.",
        "For example, they can't lobby, whereas public charities can engage in a fair amount of lobbying.",
        "There are restrictions on the types of investments that they can hold, and there are restrictions on transactions between people who control private foundation and the private foundation.",
        "And let me just ask you, and I'm sure there are others, but given these mega-foundations that we're talking about now, and 60 billion is certainly - fits that description, do you think the rules need to be rewritten?"

        "Jill Manny, this is a tax break if you give this money away, right?",
        "Well, it's a tax break, but it's very unlikely that they're getting any significant amount of income tax deduction.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "That they're getting very - any significant amount of income tax deduction for their contributions, because of the internal revenue code limits the amount of charitable income tax deductions...",
        "There's a cap law.",

        "So my guess is they're not getting any meaningful income tax deductions.",
        "This is altruism.",
        "It's altruism, and they do get some gift tax breaks.",
        "In other words, they don't have to pay the transfer tax on the gift because they're giving it to a charity.",
