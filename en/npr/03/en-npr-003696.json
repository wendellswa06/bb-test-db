        "Certainly Mr. Buffet was considering this move, you know, in the last several months.",
        "I don't think he was aware himself of the recent move on the part of Bill Gates, Jr. And the more important, I think, event was really the fact of the - Susie's death, who - that is his wife, Warren Buffet's wife.",
        "Susan Buffet, yes.",
        "Yeah, Susan, who died before Warren, obviously.",
        "And his, in their plan, she was going to be running, you know, the foundation and distributing his wealth upon his death, because women live longer than men.",
        "And I mean that was the rationale.",
        "And while that didn't work out in this case, and I think ever since that's happened, which now I think is about two years ago, he's been thinking about how he's going to - what he's going to do.",

        "He looked at problems like malaria, for example, and decided what would be the best way to handle that problem.",

        "Pablo Eisenberg, is there any push to get government more involved?",
        "Well, the point is that Bill Gates, like - and his folks at the foundation, have an obligation just like every other foundation, to be publicly accountable, to be transparent, and to - because of their tax benefits, to obey the rules and regulations that apply to foundations.",
        "And that's an obligation also that the U.S.",
        "government has, to make sure that the Gates Foundation is run properly.",
        "There's no doubt in my mind that it's not run properly, that's it's doing exceedingly good job, but it still has to play by the rules.",
        "That was a double negative in there meaning there's no doubt in your mind that they do a operate properly?"
