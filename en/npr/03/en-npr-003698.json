        "And could that potentially include some sort of protest or some sort of statement at an Olympic venue at the Olympic Games?",
        "It's certainly possible an athlete could make that stand.",
        "I feel like in some ways I sort of tried to make that stand although at the time it was not perceived as a political stand at the Turin Olympics.",
        "If someone feels strongly enough about it and I believe it's a cause worth of feeling that strongly then, of course, I would help support them in whatever way possible.",
        "However, it's not my intention to try and, you know, pressure anyone or - you know, this isn't like we want to try and ruin the Olympics or make it this a very contrarian viewpoint.",
        "We just think that the Olympic spirit really entails using your position to help others.",

        "Thank you and hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "And would you agree with what Joey Cheek just said that part of the spirit of the Olympic Games is to help make life better for people in other places?",
        "Well, the Olympic Games belong to the world, and we select hosts for those games.",
        "It happens that Beijing will be the host of the games coming up.",
        "What happens is during the games is that people come together, living in the Olympic village was the most amazing place on the face of the earth where there are 10,000 people, all successful who have been selected by their countries to represent them at these games.",
        "And they come away changed just as Joey.",
        "He was changed after the games and he talked about providing his resources to help back one group of folks.",
        "There's immense suffering throughout the world.",
        "Darfur is one of the many places right where there's immense suffering.",
        "And I know that Olympians are people who care.",
        "And I hope that Olympians are able to follow their own path before and after the games.",
        "But the games belong to the world.",
        "And it's our duty as athletes to protect the opportunity for athletes to come after, to have that experience which is so powerful.",
        "Can you understand what critics who'll take that a little further and say it seems to us what you're doing is protecting the host country against criticisms.",
        "The host, as I say, is just the host.",
        "The games are - belong to the world and they have to be host to some place.",
        "Some community has to take a responsibility and it's a great honor.",
        "It's true.",
        "It's a great honor to host those games.",
        "And we expect that the games will be treated well there.",
        "And most of all we expect the athletes will be treated well and have their opportunity just as Joey ha to have a test with history.",
        "It's very important."

        "But I remember how I felt when I heard that President Carter had denied my friends - a lot of my friends - the chance to go to the Olympics, and I was really angry.",
        "I mean, my first reaction was just tear and unmitigated anger and…",
        "Well, Anita DeFrantz, you were one of those of people who has denied the opportunity to participate in the Olympics in 1980.",
        "Yes, and it was stunning that this nation which I believe have valued very much the right of the individual to make decisions.",
        "Remember that the government had nothing to do with training the athletes or sending the athletes.",
        "It was all individual choice as the caller has just said.",

        "And I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that anyone is less deserving of any of the same rights, and that's what sort of led me over the years to this sort of social consciousness.",
