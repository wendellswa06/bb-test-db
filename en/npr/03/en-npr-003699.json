        "Well, yeah, because boycott - every time there's been a boycott of the Olympic Games, the athletes are the ones that are hurt.",
        "Nothing changes in the world except those athletes who are denied the opportunity to experience the games, to share, and perhaps be great ambassadors in the future.",
        "You know, boycotts are purposeless and certainly even in 1980 - nothing changed - not a thing except the lives of the athletes where somehow diminished.",
        "So we need to get away from that.",
        "Yeah, there are a lot of athletes who have social consciousness and are doing things before, they become Olympians.",
        "Not every Olympian wins a gold medal has a podium to say anything.",
        "And again, there's immense suffering throughout the world so I understand why some people think it's important to focus on Darfur and I do hope there's something that can be done there.",
        "But I do also believe that we need to make certain that the games endure and flourish.",
        "And to do that is very, very important.",
        "We have to have more people experience being at the games and we need to have more people, the spectators to see what happens, to see the extraordinary performances.",
        "It's interesting we have so much on television now, you really don't - now, unless you're there, you have no idea, for example, how long the long jump really is.",
        "You don't know - you see it on television - you just don't have an idea how high the high jumpers are jumping or, you know, what it takes - the distance of 2,000 meters across the water in the race which we did in my sport in rowing.",
        "But it's just the extraordinary things that happens, and so I guess, you can tell my goal is - I understand people have a lot to say about things before the games and it happens every time.",
        "It happens at every time.",
        "Before the L.A.",
        "games there were (unintelligible) to the folks and you can see the mountains join the time of the game.",
        "It's - that's why keep having the games so that there could be more experiences.",
        "So I hope the athletes, especially the athletes on the U.S.",
        "team understand that they'll be able to compete.",
        "And the things that they do outside of the games are certainly important as well but during the games, you get to commit to your competition there which you cannot come again after four years if ever.",

        "And what I've found is that in some way, you know, there's always going to be some sort of scandal that media is going to be looking for in trying to find and there's always something they can harp on and this is bad or this is bad or whatever.",
        "I believe that, you know, when Anita speaks enriching the Olympics, if athletes are able to be as brilliant off the field in their efforts as they are on the field, I think that's a story that can make a big difference.",
        "And when we say, you know, well, I really hope something improves in Darfur, really.",
        "I hope something improves in terms of environmental concerns.",
        "Well, if you're able to be an athlete and have the eyes of the world on you and compete brilliantly and be able to use that platform for something then you go a step beyond.",

        "I think sometimes we don't fully understand that (unintelligible) of the world, it was primarily in the United States.",
        "Each athlete has a probably a platform in their own country.",
        "There might be an international media there at the press conference.",
        "But, you know, everyone wants to hear about their own athletes and what they have to say.",

        "That is just so profound, it resonates with me, the strength that that statement made and then when you think about the Munich incident and the statement - and the strength of that statement completely other side of the spectrum, Mr. Smith and Mr. Carlos - God bless them and all the forces behind them that helped them to make that stand.",
