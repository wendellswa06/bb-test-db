        "Absolutely fine.",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "Quite frankly, I take issue with your posture in 1968 and basically I believe that you disrespected the country and it really a bad place, sir, and I don't understand why you chose to make your stand - why you chose to make your decision at that point in time.",
        "And I'll take my comments off the air, sir.",

        "Well, they maybe getting more than they are bargaining for and what they are allowing to happen here, but let's take a close look at what they're putting out is what athletes can and can't do.",
        "They are merely limiting exactly what constitutes a blog and what the athletes are allowed to do.",
        "On the commercial side, their instructions are pretty clear.",
        "You can't infringe on the broadcast rights of the media that have paid to cover the games, the television and radio networks.",
        "Right, so that means no video, no audio, therefore no podcast and there's still limits on still photography, as well.",

        "Well, the same penalty that Tommie Smith just described applied to the athletes in Athens and Turin, leaving their credentials, theoretically, legal or monetary damages against the athletes, but none of that was enforced in the breach.",

        "However, if you look at that situation in the '60s, Tommie was expected to the go to the Olympics.",
        "Mr. Smith was expected to go to the Olympics, represent our country, you know, make America look great and then come back home and once again be relegated to second-class citizenship.",

        "And now, although it's may not be known but if you go to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, there's a massive picture of him on the medal stands and the stands and there stands in all of the Olympic literature from that picture because it's such a powerful picture.",
        "And you know, what was perceived at the time as a grave affront and an affront to the Olympic Committee and the U.S.",
