        "The president's overstating that trade deficit a bit.",
        "It was at $347 billion last year, 310 billion if you add in services, which is a smaller deficit than in 2015 but, to be sure, still a pretty big number.",
        "China was a frequent target for Trump during the campaign, and he threatened to crack down on what he described as unfair trade practices.",
        "Well, what's he actually done so far?",
        "Actually not very much.",
        "He did not label China a currency manipulator as he threatened to do.",
        "He hasn't slapped big tariffs on China.",
        "The only thing he's done so far really is order a study of the factors contributing to the trade deficit, which could be seen as a 90-day stalling tactic.",
        "But economist David Dollar of the Brookings Institution says that go-slow approach from the Trump administration is actually a good thing.",
        "I think so far the Chinese are pleasantly surprised, and they're hoping this summit and other discussions will, you know, convince the United States not to move ahead on some of those harsher protectionist ideas.",
        "Trump will be encouraging Xi to open up the still heavily protected Chinese market to U.S.",
        "exports, but even the White House is signaling, don't look for any big announcements on tariffs or the like to come out of this first face-to-face meeting.",
        "Scott, Donald Trump's America First approach to foreign policy has created some openings for Chinese - for the Chinese leader to play a larger role on the world stage.",
        "Is that something that they're likely to talk about in Mar-a-Lago?",
        "You know, this is another area where there's been a bit of a gap between candidate Trump and President Trump.",
        "During the campaign, Trump complained about the burden the U.S.",
        "was carrying in protecting allies like South Korea and Japan, even going so far as to suggest they should develop their own nuclear arsenals rather than relying on the U.S.",
        "military umbrella.",
        "But as president, Trump has reaffirmed those alliances, and he's also begun to view North Korea as a potential threat to the United States itself, not just our regional allies.",
        "So he will certainly be urging China to do more to crack down on North Korea.",
        "This Trump-Xi summit also comes on the heels of the chemical weapons attack in Syria which the president has acknowledged has actually changed his thinking somewhat.",
        "How?",
        "If you go back to 2013, you know, Trump argues strongly against U.S.",
        "military intervention in Syria.",
        "But this week, after the attack on innocent civilians, his secretary of state said it demands a serious response.",
        "And Trump talked about this with reporters on Air Force One when he was asked if the U.S.",
        "should try to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad."

        "But there's a problem - anthropologists hate to give away any of their precious bones.",
        "We've been recently trying to explore new sources of potential archaic human DNA as the fossil record is very limited.",
        "So Meyer and his colleagues began to wonder, what if you don't need an intact bone at all?",
        "Many of these interesting bones come from caves.",
        "What if, over the millennia, some of the bones just degraded into a kind of dust and fell to the floor of the cave?",
        "It would be easy enough to get at.",
        "You just take a shovel with some dirt, and then you look for DNA.",
        "And it's actually been shown in the past that there's DNA from plenty of species can be preserved in caves - in sediments in general for long periods of time."

        "You have to develop methods to be certain that it came from an ancient bone and not a more recent human cave explorer or some contaminating bacteria.",
        "And the DNA they'll get will be tiny snippets of all the DNA in an ancient human ancestor.",
        "Piecing together the big picture will be tricky.",

        "I can feel that.",
