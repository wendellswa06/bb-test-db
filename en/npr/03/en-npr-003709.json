        "Right, and also one thing unique about his research is his research really covers multiple areas.",
        "That is not everybody can do.",
        "And as I understand it, a distinguished professor, an Israeli citizen, but had he been teaching at Virginia Tech a long time?",
        "As far as I know, yes.",
        "At the first day I get to the university, he was there, and when I left, graduated and left, he was still there.",
        "His smiley face is always in my mind.",
        "The accounts we're hearing about the way he died, as the gunman tried to barge into the classroom, he urged his students to get out through the window on the second floor classroom there and tried to prevent the gunman from coming in and was shot to death in the process.",
        "Does that sound like the man you knew?",
        "That's something I knew today, and that's something also struck me deeply.",
        "It's hard to - hard for anybody to imagine that a 76-year-old professor threw himself fighting against this gunman and while those young kids are running away.",
        "This is something - it struck me very, very deeply, and I feel so sad.",
        "Thank you, Min, very much, and we - condolences on your loss.",

        "He was always very professional in the class, but I knew that he had a family.",
        "He, you know, wore a wedding ring.",
        "And as a professor, he was, actually, a big inspiration for me to pursue sort of an academic career, and he was just a great man that always had time in his office for any concern you might have with all the stuff you were studying.",
        "He won, I know, several awards for excellence in teaching there at Virginia Tech.",
        "I suspect that comes as no surprise to you.",
        "Oh, no. He actually, I think, won the semester that I was taking the class, and I know that actually the class that I took from him was what he was teaching yesterday.",

        "...so that the guy couldn't get back into the room.",

        "But for 15 years as my role in the high school that I taught in, I was a sponsor of an organization called Peer Mentorship.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
