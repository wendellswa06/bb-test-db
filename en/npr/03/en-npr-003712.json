        "This is something any member of the House should want, to make certain, among other things, that we have a chance to review legislation before we vote on it, and also that extraneous items don't get slipped into legislation without the House taking due notice.",
        "Let me ask you about lobbyists because a lot of them obviously are former members of Congress, so they have privileges.",

        "But of course, they're going to be disinclined to do so, precisely because there is interconnectedness throughout the world, and we are the biggest market in the world for Chinese goods, and the last thing in the world they want to do right now is to bankrupt the United States.",
