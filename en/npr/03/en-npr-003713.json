        "And if you don't inject yourself sufficiently, then you let the candidates run the show, and - you know , I think Jim Larry is particularly skilled and gentle doing this kind of thing, but neither one of them - I mean, just think how many times he tried to get Senator Obama to specify precisely where he would cut back budgetary expenditures.",

        "I - one of the things that I was most disappointed by in the debates was the lack - neither candidate really talked about what they would change in the way that we talk to other nations.",
        "And they sort of touched on it when they were talking about Obama's statements that he would hold talks with Iran.",
        "But really, my concern was more with the nations that we already talk to.",
        "Nations like North Korea, where we're holding talks, but I feel a lot of times due to the Bush administration policies, we're not really saying anything substantive, and we're not hearing what they're saying, and that's really hurt our position in the world, and I would have liked to hear a lot more about how these candidates would have changed the way that we talk to other nations.",

        "The fact of the matter is that Republican and Democratic presidents over the years have always continued to negotiate with, and discuss with, and on occasion, even have summit meetings with countries that were perceived to be our greatest adversaries, as with the Soviet Union over many years.",
        "It's foolishness to suggest that very much is achieved by not having any contact at all.",
        "And I'm not sure that one can point to very many examples where the United States has been able to extract anything.",
        "I mean, Iraq was just one further example where a great deal was made of - on economic pressure and in the final analysis that was deemed to have failed.",
        "The notion that somehow you are giving into the other side by acknowledging that some kind of negotiation is worthwhile, I thinks is a foolish notion.",

        "It's not as though the issue of China was debated.",
        "Frankly, I don't think any real foreign-policy issues were debated, and that's where I think that particular debate with quotation marks around it failed.",
        "You're quite right, Matt.",
        "I think they more or less agree on Iraq right now.",
        "If you'll listen carefully, there's not that much of a difference anymore between what Senator McCain is saying and what Barack Obama is saying.",
        "Senator Obama clearly is conceding that a number of troops are going to have to remain behind.",
        "What number, of course he wouldn't say, for how long, of course, he wouldn't say.",
        "And quite frankly, neither will Senator McCain.",
        "So, the difference now between the two of them is not whether there'll be a total withdrawal or whether we'll remain, but simply how many men and women remain behind, and to what end, and for how long?",
        "Is there fundamental disagreement?",
        "Another issue that did come up was Pakistan, and that this was mentioned - not necessarily Pakistan as Pakistan, but in relation to the war in Afghanistan."
