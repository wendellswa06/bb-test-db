        "Because we did it.",
        "She says her family once hid things from the police on another case, and now she's seeing people clamming up about her husband.",

        "So which is it?",
        "Are murder clearance rates down because of the no snitch culture, or are they down because solving murders has become less of a priority?",
        "Criminologist Charles Wellford says maybe those two things are connected.",
        "He says you have to think about the fact that since the 1960s, there have been more than 200,000 unsolved murders.",
        "Those homicides tend to occur in poor communities, minority communities.",
        "What is the impact of an unsolved homicide when those unsolved homicides are primarily in the very communities we're trying to build stronger relationships with law enforcement?",
        "In other words, what happens when people in high-crime areas start to think that their murders aren't being solved?",
        "Wellford wonders whether that's been eroding the trust between the public and police, the very trust the detectives rely on to be able to solve their next murder.",

        "People with Down syndrome represent the world's largest population of individuals predisposed to getting Alzheimer's disease.",

        "One of the genes on chromosome 21 happens to control the production of something called amyloid.",
        "And amyloid is what forms the sticky plaques associated with Alzheimer's.",

        "And in the very last year, it's completely blank.",
        "People like Irma used to be rare because the medical problems associated with Down syndrome meant they usually didn't live long enough to get dementia.",
