        "And we see that in poll after poll, suspicion of government, moving to the right.",
        "And so, it's not the specifics of any particular bill, frankly, I don't think is causing all this.",
        "It's all of them in total have caused this recoil and this turn toward the Republicans and even toward the Tea Party on the edges.",
        "Democrats are in trouble because employment is at or near 10 percent.",

        "Do you think the country is actually as incapable of agreeing on what should be done with the health care system as the two parties in Washington are, David?",

        "Researchers don't know exactly why this is, but speculate abdominal or visceral fat interferes with the body's ability to process sugar.",
        "Visceral fat increases insulin resistance, which increases the levels of insulin floating around in the body, which increases the amount of glucose in the body, which eventually leads to diabetes.",
        "And diabetes increases your risk for heart attacks and strokes.",
        "So to keep abdominal fat down and to maintain or build fitness, the federal government recommends 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day.",
