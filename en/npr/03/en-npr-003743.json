        "We have to ensure that we don't take enough risk where ethno- sectarian violence is able to continue, for example over Arab-Kurd tensions or that we don't allow al-Qaida and some of the outside external influences by Iran and others to cause violence inside of Iraq that will cause the Iraqi political system to fall.",

        "And then they also had a company that turned those into active pharmaceutical ingredients that they used, I believe, for their own drugs as well as other companies.",
        "So the state says that through that, they essentially had a role in all opioids that were hitting the market.",
        "But then separately they also have two of their own products.",
        "One is a fentanyl patch called Duragesic that they launched in 1991.",
        "And they still make it, but they don't actively market it.",
        "And the second is called Nucynta, and they had a few versions of that, and they sold their interest in it by 2015.",
        "As we just heard, the case that Oklahoma is making is a public nuisance case.",
        "How unusual is that as the legal strategy to sue a major pharmaceutical company?",
        "It's fairly unusual.",
        "Public nuisance has been used in many other contexts with mixed results.",
        "But the state said earlier today that just because it hasn't been used in a case like this before doesn't mean that it can't be used now.",
        "So they're already trying to preempt the company's arguments that will say this is not the use of public nuisance; it's used more for, you know, an overgrown shrub or a loud neighbor that is causing a nuisance and making it, you know, so that your property is less valuable and that kind of thing.",
        "So it's definitely a unique and novel approach, and it will be interesting to see what kind of case law might come of this.",
        "And how exactly Johnson & Johnson attorneys go about trying to counter this case in court - but what is at stake for Johnson & Johnson in this trial?",
        "Yeah, so Johnson & Johnson faces quite a few litigation matters over various drugs and products of theirs.",
        "So this kind of territory is nothing new for them but somewhat robust set of lawsuits that they're challenging.",
        "So this case, as we've said, is the first of a couple thousand of lawsuits that various jurisdictions have brought against pharmaceutical companies.",
