        "Wake Forest University Law Professor Robert Chesney has written about this and other cases where defendants are charged with providing support to terrorists.",
        "One reason this has turned out to be such a tough case for prosecutors, he says, is because the government intervened in the alleged plot so early, before the men from Liberty City had done little more than talk and snap a few photos.",
        "At the time of their arrest, Justice Department officials talked about this early intervention strategy, saying they were intent on being proactive and preventing terrorist attacks.",
        "Chesney says that strategy can make prosecutions difficult.",
        "When you do intervene at a more remote point in time from the actual attempt to carry out some plot, there will be greater and greater questions about whether these defendants really were ever going to attempt to carry out the plot.",

        "The leader of the Liberty City group, Narseal Batiste, also agreed to shoot photos of federal buildings in Miami - buildings Brother Mohamed said would be targeted for bombings.",
        "But Batiste turned out to be a key witness for the defense, spending more than a week on the stand, steadfastly maintaining that he and the other men never had any intention of committing violence, that they were just playing along with a purported al-Qaida representative in an effort to get the money.",
        "The question now is whether the government will take its chances with a new jury and try the case a third time.",
        "The Justice Department says it will decide next week.",
