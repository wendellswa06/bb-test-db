        "Let's get to your prescriptions to curb immigration.",
        "You make two primary recommendations - to limit immigration quotas to pre-1990 levels and to focus on technical skills, rather than preference for family relationships.",
        "Why?",
        "I don't think most Americans understand how big the numbers of legal immigrants coming to the United States are and how recently this has changed.",
        "In 1990, the United States doubled its intake of legal immigrants from about 540,000 a year to 1.2 million.",
        "There wasn't really a compelling reason to do that back in 1990.",
        "And as it is today, all these years later, it remains kind of an arbitrary decision.",
        "But what's the problem with that?",
        "Like, what's the problem with having that many legal immigrants?",
        "And the social and political costs, we see all around us.",
        "Brexit, Trump, the crack of the European Union, the drive to authoritarian populism worldwide - those are political and social costs that have to be assessed.",
        "He didn't really want to go there.",
        "I mean, he said, he can't really talk about the intelligence he's received.",
        "And you know, he had one of these presidential daily briefs that's going to be part of his daily routine now.",
        "And President Bush often talked about how sobering that news was every morning, about the threats around the world.",
        "The subject of Iran did come up, and Mr. Obama talked about the letter he received from Iran's president, Ahmadinejad, congratulating him.",
        "And you know, this was a big topic during the campaign.",
        "John McCain sort of mocked Mr. Obama, saying that he wanted to sit down with the leaders of rogue nations.",
        "And it was interesting, that was never Mr. Obama's position during the campaign.",
        "He did say that he would never sit down with leaders of nations like Iran with no preconditions whatsoever.",
        "But how he dealt with it today - so carefully, now that he knows, you know, he's going to be the president saying that he'll respond appropriately to that letter dealing with Iran.",
        "It's not something that should be done in knee-jerk fashion.",
        "You want to think it through and he reiterated again that he is not the president right now.",
        "So, he does not want to send any mix signals to the world.",
        "We should supply a bit of a visual here.",
        "Mr. Obama spoke and behind him there were even more economic advisers than there were American flags.",
        "I think so.",
        "Incredible, wasn't it?",
        "And that that was really the message today.",
        "There were some lighter moments but I think they wanted to make sure that he was coming across as serious and doing something very presidential.",
        "Having that large group - gaggle of advisers behind you to show that you're very serious and talking to a lot of people who are experts.",
        "And we should just note that this was not a case of the president-elect saying, I'll stand here and take all of your questions until all of your reporters are satisfied.",
        "This was a briefing that was brief.",
        "It was very brief, and I think if that's going to be the length of his news conference once he gets to the White House, you're going to start hearing those complaints come very quickly from that press core.",
        "OK.",
        "Thanks.",

        "In this village, the land has been divided up into such tiny plots that, in fact, farming here is extremely inefficient.",

        "Chinese farmers don't actually own their land, but they do have land use rights.",
        "And these reforms make it easier for farmers to lease these rights or sell them to agribusiness.",
        "(Chinese spoken)",
        "It wasn't difficult to decide to sign the form, says 24-year-old Huang Qing.",
        "She left the village six years ago, but she's back for a holiday.",
        "She likes the fact that she'll be able to return to the city without worrying about the land.",

        "It's tough for the old people left behind to do the farming, she goes on.",
        "This is a better way.",

        "Land has traditionally served as social security for China's peasants, and some fear these reforms could potentially create millions of landless farmers."
