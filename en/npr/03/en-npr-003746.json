        "Right.",
        "Is that a bad feeling or a good one?",

        "We finished this project up a while back, so it's so of a distraction for us to, you know, when the thing is actually broadcast.",
        "I'd say we were sincere about trying to do something as a television entertainment that was not an entertainment.",
        "That's not to say we didn't have an obligation to make it entertaining; but Ed, myself, the other writers, we had a lot of opinions about our city or the city we were writing about and what has gone wrong over the last couple of few decades and what continuous to go wrong and we took our shot.",
        "And ultimately, if it was just about making a television show to entertain people, I would feel as if we weren't.",
        "You know, we didn't have grown-up jobs.",

        "Ed Burns, how do you leave it?",
        "Well, I think we kicked up a little bit of dust and that was good.",
        "What I really got out of it was a chance to - along with David and the other writers - was to personalize it most often are just stereotypes.",
        "So to see guys, you know, like Prop Joe and Stringer and Avon and D'Angelo in a way that is not normally seen, I think, was something that we did.",
        "Well, there's a lot of loose ends wrapped up last night, and I won't get into all the details, because one of the unique things about the series is how many people I meet who are in various stages of watching it.",
        "I'm personally somewhere in this third season in terms of watching, but I meet people who have just started beginning watching it, some people who have watched it religiously before it even aired on HBO looking at On-Demand.",
        "So wherever you are on the series - I think a lot of people want to know how mapped out it is?",
        "I mean, do you have your own version of Lester's organizational chart on the corkboard where you knew what was going to happen from the beginning?",
        "From the very beginning, I don't think we knew we were going to get more than a year.",
        "But from very late in season one when we were filming the first season, Ed and I spoke on with Bob Colesbury - who was one of the other executive producers at the time, the late Bob Colesbury - and we talked about slicing off a different piece of the city with each successive season.",
        "And, you know, once HBO gave us additional seasons, we started doing that and then we had to think about which season should follow what, how the characters should move around each other, how they should orbit the story.",
        "And then, you know, when you've got sort of a gross schematic, then you sit down in the writers' room.",
        "And yes, we have the different colored three-by-five cards and the butcher's paper up on every wall with every episode charted out and that's where the heavy lifting was.",
        "Well, how did you decide the fate of your characters?",
        "I mean, I picture you both sitting there with a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.",
        "I mean, did you sit there and consign them to death or at least a somewhat happy afterlife?"
