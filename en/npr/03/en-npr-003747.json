        "The shotgun versus the briefcase - that sort of sums up neatly the many ways in which you believe that people are failed by the war on drugs, David Simon.",
        "In an open letter to Time magazine, you both come out with a modest proposal.",
        "Why don't you tell us about that?",
        "It was something that the writers discussed and thought that if there was one overt act that we could collectively get behind, it was the idea that a - of jury nullification on nonviolent drug cases.",
        "The drug war has not only not achieved any of its goals - and in fact failed dramatically over four decades, it's also really damaged the law enforcement.",
        "It has broken the back of the deterrent.",
        "And, you know, you'll meet a lot of rank-and-file police that have come to this awareness as well.",
        "If you are chasing a street-level drug arrest which, you know, in a place like Baltimore are almost the most fundamental arrest - you just go down the corners and grab people and go into their pockets - chances are, given the lack of resources in a place like Baltimore and other American cities, other things, more complicated things, more essential things to keeping neighborhoods safe, are not being done.",
        "And while drug arrests in Baltimore have doubled and doubled again over the last 20 years, the clearance rates, the arrest rates for all major felonies - you know, rape, robbery, murder - have declined dramatically.",
        "That's telling.",
        "And what it suggests is there is no correlation between fighting the drug war aggressively and making cities safer.",
        "In fact, the opposite.",
        "Now, you wrote that this came because a lot of people were feeling despair a little bit from the series and asking you what can they possibly do.",
        "I mean, they probably ask if they can send money for a clothing fund or something somewhere.",
        "Did you find people desperately wanted something that they could do?",

        "So given that fact, the only thing that individuals can do - you know, you can pretend you can work within that system, but I don't believe that you can.",
        "And I think the writers don't believe you can anymore.",
        "So we were basically trying to argue that individuals - if you want to speak of what we can do as individuals, well, if all these refused to collaborate in this disaster, if all these refused to do anything but acquit nonviolent drug offenders, if it makes it hard to impanel a jury at some point, that's exactly what happened with Prohibition back in the '30s.",
        "Yeah, our original plan was to have bouncy balls so that it would bounce, but then it wasn't weighted enough and...",
        "And, you know, at some point, you know, you have to look at the macro.",
        "It's nice to talk about clothing drives or saving a life a here or intervening there or, you know, updating the textbooks in these inner city school.",

        "Yes, in every post-industrial city, in those places in America that have been left behind by the economy, by the service economy and by the post-manufacturing economy.",

        "And he said, what's the solution?",
        "I mean, we just came out with this book that said the drug war is dysfunctional on the street level.",

        "We said, look, you've been building a separate America, disconnected economically, politically, socially, in your inner cities for decades.",
        "And what's the solution?",
        "It's to start taking down that construct.",
        "I don't know if it's going to take 30 to take it down, but it took 30 years to take it - it's going to be complicated and long and ornate and it's going to be a struggle.",
