        "We have a call on this and has question.",
        "Robert - Robert is calling us from Philadelphia.",
        "Yes, on that topic I guess I was curious on your ideas on how much this would hurt, and more generally on whether the timing is going to help Mr. Weldon at all with the sense that around Philadelphia these things always seem to be timed very close to election time, these FBI investigations?",
        "And Mr. Weldon certainly did raise questions about the timing, but this is a federal question, isn't it Ken?",
        "Well, yeah, both sides have made that case.",
        "Yes, it's a federal investigation, but why two, three weeks right before the election?",
        "It reminds a lot of Republicans about, you know, the fact that George Bush was arrested for drunk driving in 1976 but it came out like five days before the 2000 election.",
        "So Republicans are suspicious about last-minute charges.",
        "But the point is the FBI is not part of a political organization, it's part of a federal investigation.",
        "Robert, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Let's - are the Republican standing behind Weldon?",
        "Well, they are.",
        "They really don't know what to think.",
        "But again it's another - this is again another Republican seat that a few weeks ago was not thought to be in jeopardy at all, but now is another one just like Don Sherwood, another Republican of Pennsylvania who's now running ads above the fact that he apologized for strangling his girlfriend, you know.",
        "The married Mr. Sherwood.",
        "He apologized for the affair.",
        "He didn't apologize for strangling, because he said it didn't happen.",
        "That's true.",
        "But in other words, there's a bunch more House Republicans that we're adding to a list.",
        "It looked like a few weeks ago, maybe a few months ago, that maybe the Democrats would get 15 seats, but more and more Republicans are in these vulnerable seats.",
        "Curt Weldon is now one of them.",
        "There are now four seats in Pennsylvania alone, four Republican-held seats that are now considered a toss-up at best.",
        "At the same time, Republicans say, look, it's not just us, what about the Democratic leader in the United States Senate, the senator from Nevada.",
        "And we just have a few seconds left, but Democrat Mark Warner, former governor of Virginia, announced he would not be running for president in 2008.",
        "He wants to spend more time with his family.",
        "That's what they always say.",
        "Should we believe him?"

        "I would hate to see people in our party emphasize that fact and perhaps jeopardize our general election in such a way that we would lose.",
        "I would hope that that wouldn't happen and I would hope that all of us would recognize that we have two exceptional people here.",
        "And during this primary campaign, the last thing we want to do is destroy whichever one is nominated - destroy their opportunity to be elected president.",
        "Both candidates have said that they want to focus on issues going forward, so let's turn to some of these key issues in Pennsylvania.",
        "Polls show that Hillary Clinton has a slight lead overall among voters.",
        "But on some of the key issues, such as the war and the economy, the margin between the two candidates is very, very slim.",
        "Among voters who are most concerned about the economy, 55 percent of them favored Clinton.",
        "Again, that's a very slim margin.",
        "Last question - and I'd like each of you to answer briefly, if you could, and I know it's dangerous to ask a politician to give a brief answer, but I'm going to ask anyway.",
        "That's right.",
        "I'd like you both to briefly explain why voters in Pennsylvania should expect that their financial outlook would improve under first an Obama administration?",
        "I think a Barack Obama - if you look at his life history, when he got out of college, he went and worked with unemployed steel workers.",
        "When he got out of law school, he was certainly, probably, the premier law student in the United States.",
        "He could have written his own ticket.",
        "What did he do?",
        "He went back to Chicago and worked with people who were out of work.",
        "I think you have someone here who understands the problems of the average person.",
        "And I think the disaster that George Bush has made of our economy is going to take a lot of work and a lot of getting out of, but you would have someone in that position who can relate to the average working person in the economic hardships that currently exist for them.",
        "Michael Nutter, why would Hillary Clinton be a better steward of the economy?",
        "Well, I think at the same time, again when we talk about the experience issue and the life experiences, Hillary Clinton, you know, came out of Yale not exactly without prospects herself but decided to go and work and open a legal clinic to help the poor - her work with the Children's Defense fund, in looking after children and families.",
        "Well, her experience whether as first lady of Arkansas or first lady of the country, and certainly as a United State senator has always been looking out for other people.",
        "She, I mean, in my conversations with her at least, I mean, it's very clear to me that Senator Clinton, she gets it, she understands what cities and metropolitan areas are about, and how best to serve people.",
        "So, I think, it is again the experience -and which I refer to as experience and good judgment.",
        "Michael Nutter is the mayor of Philadelphia.",
        "Richard Gray is the mayor of Lancaster in Pennsylvania.",
        "Thanks to both of you."

        "And the banks that have extra money lend it to the banks that need money.",
        "This happens every day.",
        "These are very short-term loans, just overnight loans, and it's that constant process of lending extra cash that provides the liquidity, the ready cash that funds the entire global economy.",
        "Now, this normally works very fluidly, very easily, but what happened this last week is what's called a liquidity crisis.",
        "Basically, a few key banks around the world announced to everyone's surprise that they had a lot of these subprime mortgages.",
        "That their assets were worth much less than anyone thought they were.",
        "That got banks worried.",
        "What if there are other banks that aren't telling us how much their assets have shrunk because panic among banks - they stop lending as much money to each other.",
        "And suddenly, other banks that needed the money didn't have the ready cash, that liquid cash, to pay off the people who needed it.",

        "They don't actually print $100 bills.",
        "It's all done electronically.",
        "But basically, when they lend $30 billion or $70 billion, that's new money entering the system, returning that liquidity, returning that ready cash into the systems.",
        "The banks get it.",
        "They can give it to people and companies and it allows the market to function again.",

        "Now, what's happened, obviously, is that the new voters who have registered in the last 15 or 20 years particularly have been overwhelmingly independents.",
        "Independents now are close to 20 percent of the overall electorate.",
        "Now, you didn't see many of them yesterday, because they could only vote in the Democratic primary and the data indicates that relatively few of them did that.",
