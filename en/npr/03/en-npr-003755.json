        "Well, as it seems with everything these days, it all goes back to this global credit crunch that we're in the midst of.",
        "Back in June, Home Depot agreed to sell its construction supply unit to a group of private equity firms, including Bain Capital and the Carlyle Group.",
        "And the price they agreed on at the time was $10.3 billion.",
        "Now, the way these deals work is that the private equity firms borrow money from investment banks who then repackage those loans and sell them to investors in the form of bonds.",
        "And as you know, in the last few months the demand for any kind of debt that isn't backed by the federal government has really fallen off because of the subprime mortgage meltdown.",
        "And investment banks have become wary of taking on that kind of debt for fear they'll get stuck with it.",
        "So reports say to keep them from walking away from the deal, Home Depot agreed to cut the sale price by 18 percent and to guarantee some of the debt used to fund the deal.",
        "So does this mean that the private equity boom might be dead?",
        "Well, not entirely, according to one professor I spoke to.",
        "Andrew Metrick teaches finance at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
        "He says these private equity firms have raised billions of dollars and keep raising it.",
        "For example, the Blackstone Group recently closed the biggest buyout fund in history - more than $21 billion.",
        "And Metrick says the terms may change but the buying spree isn't over.",
        "There's a tremendous amount of the equity capital that the private equity folks control now.",
        "And there's an awful a lot of companies out there for them to buy.",
        "What it means now is that the price that they're going to be willing to pay and the amount of leverage that they're going to be able to put on the deals is going to be lower.",
        "You know, some see the Home Depot deal as a sort of bellwether.",
        "There are an estimated $400 billion worth of buyout deals that are in the pipeline right now.",
        "And some analysts predict more companies are going to have to accept lower prices and make other concessions.",
        "And so what does all of this mean for Home Depot?",
        "Well, Home Depot has been wanting to sell this division to focus on its core retail business.",
        "But the sale was also meant to fund a $22.5 billion stock buyback program.",
        "And so analysts say the company was really anxious to get this deal done, even at a discount.",
        "Thank you so much, Amy.",
        "Amy Scott of public radio's daily business show, MARKTETPLACE, which is produced by American Public Media.",
        "Now to the Supreme Court, where this morning protesters had a message for the newest justice."

        "Hey, Carrie.",
        "Hi, Mary Louise.",
        "So we heard the protesters outside the court.",
        "What was it like inside today?",
        "Well, there were really a number of reasons why we thought that it was appropriate to have the conference now, to have it in New York City, and to have it in a way that it involved voices other than the usual voices we hear today in academia, in policy circles, and in the media.",

        "It's not like a corruption case.",
        "But, again, it's too soon to say what's going to happen with that.",
        "Now as we enter the home-stretch of this election season, both Republicans and Democrats are directing some of their party's funds tactically, moving some away from races that were previously competitive and into races that are suddenly competitive.",
        "To tell us more, we're joined now by Sheila Krumholz, the acting director of the Center for Responsive Politics.",
        "And she's been kind enough to come and join us here in Studio 3A.",

        "Well, it sounds like they're putting in some money, but not as much as they could and certainly not as much as Senator DeWine would like them to put in.",
        "But this is now a race that is called Democratic leaning, something that would have been unheard of, to think of, just a few short weeks ago.",
        "So DeWine joins Santorum and Chafee as the underdogs, which is again just adding to the list that you were discussing previously about surprising - how quickly fortunes change.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, unfortunately, we as watchdogs on the money are always kind of hamstringed by the reporting deadlines.",
        "And so unfortunately we're not going be able to see exactly where the money goes in the 11th hour until well after the election.",
        "But we do know that these dollars that go in at the end can be critical for taking advantage of late-breaking opportunities and for the Democrats for nailing that majority in the few races they absolutely need to get.",
        "And as you look at patterns, what can you derive from what you see?",
        "Well, what we're seeing is what we've heard all year, and that is that the Democrats are having schisms at the top in their strategy, not in agreement.",
        "The DNC and Dean is arguing with Emanuel and Schumer, chairs of the DCCC, the Democratic Congressional and the Senatorial Campaign Committees, about how they should strategize during this final push.",
        "And it sounds like there is - they're feeling the heat and not able to direct the money in a kind of cohesive way in the same way that the Republicans have done for so long."

        "But since that incident, since the macaca incident, since Allen's, you know, various missteps, a lot of money has come into Jim Webb's campaign.",
        "As a matter of fact, I think in the last quarter he has raised as much money as George Allen.",
        "Allen probably has more now, but money seems to be attracted to winners or perceived winners.",
        "And if the Democrats are perceived to either winning the House, which they could do, and coming close to wining the Senate, then the money will go their way, and that's what seems to be happening.",

        "Money is always a critical factor, but it is never the only factor.",
        "You also need to have good campaign organization, name recognition, campaign skills.",
        "And in this cycle in particular, you know, a scandal can eject you from the lineup very quickly.",
        "So that isn't the case I think with Allen.",
        "He's had a lot of missteps and the personal financial disclosure, the lack of disclosure of options at a couple of companies on which he sat on their board, was just another one in a long list.",
        "So that - it isn't one issue that happened there, but it's enough for the DNC to take out a loan, a line of credit for sending some last-minute dollars toward the VA race.",
        "And, Ken, we were talking last week when we were in Ohio with the vice chair of the Republican National Committee who points out money really helps with those Get Out the Vote efforts that were so crucial to Republicans in 2004 and that they hope to duplicate this year.",
        "That's right.",
        "It can't pay for enthusiasm, and we don't know how enthusiastic the Republican base will be.",
        "But it can produce the kind of organizations that if they can get out to vote, the money will help.",
