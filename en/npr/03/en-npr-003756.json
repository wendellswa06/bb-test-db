        "He's pretty much a strong candidate running against Vernon Robinson who - he calls himself the black Jesse Helms.",
        "And I think there's a lot of money going into his campaign from out of state, very similar to Katherine Harris in Florida.",
        "I was wondering what you thought about whether or not the national Republican Party is backing him financially and what you think about that particular race.",
        "Vernon Robinson is a very, very controversial candidate.",
        "To say he's the black Jesse Helms is really understating his appeal.",
        "He's really come out with some extreme ads, extreme positions, and it's not a seat at all that the Republican Party thinks they can win.",
        "So I think Brad Miller seems to be pretty safe in that district.",
        "It's not on anybody's list.",
        "But, you know, you mentioned Katherine Harris in Florida.",
        "Greg Allen, our correspondent in Florida, just sent me a note that she just announced that she's selling her house in Washington to put the money towards her campaign.",
        "She keeps talking about spending the $10 million (unintelligible) to defeat Bill Nelson in Florida.",
        "I think the real reason she's selling her house in Washington is she's going to be soon moving back to Florida.",
        "Greg, thanks for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "E-mail, this is from Dave in Madison, Wisconsin.",

        "So is there a leader in this contest?"

        "Well, it's a Republican seat.",

        "Well, I love that question.",
        "Because every time in the past we've seen big Democratic victories - 1982, 1974, 1964 - there are still Democratic incumbents who go down to defeat.",
        "Even if it's just one or two members, Democrats go down.",
        "It looks like right now, if the election were held right now, not one member, not one Democratic member of the Senate or the House is going to lose his or her seat.",
        "And that includes open seats as well.",
        "It seems like the Republican Party has once upon a time talked about going after Democratic seats, like John Barrow in Georgia or, you know, Jim Marshall of Georgia, or winning the Ted Strickland seat.",
        "What about Debbie Stabenow, is she…",
        "Well, again, that was a seat that the Republicans wanted from the beginning, Debbie Stabenow…",

        "Right.",
        "Jennifer Granholm of Michigan.",

        "And again, if there's a Democratic wave, and that seems to be the sense out there - again, there could be a last-minute Republican great Get Out the Vote effort as we saw in 2004.",
        "But if there is a Democratic wave, and it seems to be going that way, more and more Republicans seem to be puling back and trying to defend what they have, rather in going after Democratic seats."

        "We issue a cone, which is based on our longer-term average forecast errors that show that maybe some two-thirds to three-quarters of the time the track of the hurricane will lie somewhere within that cone and not necessarily follow the exact track because, again, there are uncertainties and there are forecast errors, particularly at two, three, four and five days in future.",
