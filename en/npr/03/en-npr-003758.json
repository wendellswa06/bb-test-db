        "We always look at the pictures from above that your agency's issued, those tremendous pictures of the storm revolving around the eye, but the water beneath the storm is just as important, is it not?",
        "Yeah, that is correct.",
        "This year--and, particularly, in--the season, something we saw early on was that very warm waters were occurring over the Atlantic basin, including the Gulf of Mexico, and there are these pockets of extremely warm water that extend to greater depths.",
        "They're called areas of high ocean heat content, and--or warm 80s, as we call them, and, unfortunately, Katrina did traverse one of these on its way to the coast and that certainly could have fueled additional intensification or maintained its great strength.",
        "Was it a--in terms of the--you talked about the track, but in terms of the intensity of the storm, again, Category 1 as it went across south Florida, but then developed into a Category 5 before weakening slightly before it hit land.",
        "Yes, and, of course, Category 5 hurricanes are very rare.",
        "The conditions just were there.",
        "The atmospheric conditions were very conducive to strengthening the ocean, again, with--the high heat content was present.",
        "There was generally low pressure in the surface air surrounding the storm.",
        "All of these factors helped to contribute to strengthening and creating a very powerful hurricane.",
        "You guys are, of course, not in charge of designing, developing or executing the response to the storm, but I wonder, do you have concerns about the number of times people say, you know, `How many times can we evacuate if nothing happens,' about crying wolf?",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "And, of course, that was the case in a lot of areas along the coast, including here in Florida and the Florida Keys.",
        "We've had evacuation orders for a couple of storms which--like such as Hurricane Georges in 1998 where we certainly did not get the people out of the lower Florida Keys and the storm was--in fact, close enough so that some people did learn the lesson that they should have evacuated.",
        "It's always a problem getting everybody to respond."

        "Well, I think there, of course, were a number of issues to be concerned with, primarily--although back-up plans were certainly in place.",
        "This storm was the magnitude--and the results of the storm just reached magnitudes that no one, I think, really expected.",
        "Of course, the wind damage--the initial wind of the storm itself damaged some of the public safety communications infrastructure.",
        "But one of the biggest damages--damage came from the flooding that occurred actually after the hurricane had more or less passed through the area.",
        "That flooding caused the destruction and interruption of a lot of the public safety networks which is really--that really caused the problem.",
        "So that knocked out all of the facilities that relay calls and the generators that were used to--were there generators there to power these systems?",
        "Yes.",
        "The centers, to my knowledge, all had back-up power supplies, and that, of course, was an issue.",
        "They lost power.",
        "The problem was that when the waters began rising, the water got into their generators, caused them to become inoperable and then the generators that were in operation--actually, they had difficulty getting fuel to them.",
        "Of course, they have a supply of fuel for a certain amount of time.",
        "Some of the generators were powered by natural gas, and, of course, natural gas service was disrupted.",
        "The ones that were powered by diesel, some of those remained operational, however, they had difficulty getting diesel into them.",
        "The area was totally flooded.",
        "They had no way to get the diesel fuel to the generators.",
        "I spoke to one center, in particular, that had their--and I can't pull the name right quick, but they had their generator actually like 15 feet above the ground so it should have been protected but they--this surge of water just was more than what anybody expected."

        "Yeah.",
        "And in retrospect, should that have been?",
        "Should people have anticipated this somehow?",
        "I mean, because, again, we talked to some of the people who talked about, you know, well, if this fails, you could have flooding as much as 20 feet deep.",
        "Yeah, we all, in public safety communications--we all--we try very hard to plan for survival in the worst-case scenario but I just don't know that it's possible to plan for every scenario.",
        "I think that the operational plans that the guys down South had were probably sufficient, in their minds, at least, to, you know, carry them through a situation like this.",
        "This was just very phenomenal.",
        "It was just more than anybody, I think, ever expected.",

        "As different people come in, different--you know, it got very confused.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "Yes, it's my understanding that Motorola, for instance, has had actually sent to the area, and my numbers may be slightly off because this is not firsthand information, but at least three complete 800-megahertz radio systems, and I believe a 700-megahertz system, as well, along with technicians to install so they mobilized rather quickly to get systems into the area to replace those that were damaged or totally out.",
        "Nextel--and I know this firsthand, they actually provided some of their portable units, and I understand that they set a portable repeater site on the Superdome, which actually let some of our departments--we had 25-member teams rotating in and out of there, and they actually used the Nextel devices early in the event to communicate among themselves and coordinate their efforts.",
        "So, yeah, vendors are stepping up to the plate, obviously, and trying to help recover from this disaster, and that's greatly appreciated by those people down South.",
        "One of the things that we all learned after 9/11 was that even within the city of New York, all the different services used different frequencies and had great deals of difficulty talking with each other.",
        "We just have about 30 seconds left with you but did that turn out to be the case in and around New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast, so far as you know?",
        "I believe from what--the indications that I'm getting, interoperability was an issue.",
        "Some of the departments were unable to talk to other departments.",
        "Fire, police and EMS were not necessarily in all cases able to talk to each other, which does--that always complicates the situation.",
        "Interoperability is a critical issue for communications, especially in public safety.",
        "Four years after 9/11.",
