        "And years ago, I saw the article, the long, multipiece article in The Times-Picayune, about what would happen after a Category 5 would hit New Orleans, and so being completely frightened by that series of articles, I constructed my own personal evacuation plan and business preparation and so that my little business--and the people who are supported by it--might continue to do so afterward.",
        "And did it work?",
        "It has worked incredibly well.",
        "And even though my staff had to execute that in my absence, I was away doing shows around the country.",
        "I exhibit my work at arts fairs, craft fairs.",
        "They executed it in my absence, according to the plan that we had rehearsed through several other preparations for previous hurricanes.",
        "So principal parts of my staff were able to close the building up and escape with inventory, essential records, data, computers, etc., and we are all scattered to the wind in Houston, out in Cajun Country, and I'm in Michigan, and we have already re-coordinated and so we can keep exercising our business even though we don't have our home studio to work in.",
        "Now that was some years ago, that article in The Times-Picayune, that series of articles.",
        "Did you execute this plan in the past for hurricanes that it turned out did not hit New Orleans that badly?",
        "Exactly.",
        "We had a lot of practice getting ready for--every other hurricane that has threatened New Orleans in the past five years.",
        "And did that cost a bunch of money?",
        "In other words, were you worried about the effects of crying wolf effectively a few times?",
        "Well, my staff thought I was nuts, and--but I said, `It's OK.",
        "You can think I'm nuts.",
        "You're getting paid to do this.",
        "And I had full preparation to keep this business safe would take 10 people 10 man-hours a day for four days to really get it--lock it down tight.",
        "What we had to do in this case, there were only three people to do it, so they had to do it in--they had to take--they had to prioritize everything.",
        "And they escaped with enough stuff that we can keep going, and as soon as we can get back in, we'll go back in and pull more out, to be able to reestablish our jewelry manufacturing studio and business elsewhere.",
        "Well, Thomas, thanks very much for that call; we appreciate it.",

        "Well, we--I actually back in May met with Secretary Chertoff and subsequently with director of FEMA Michael Brown.",
        "And we were talking about the--some of the concerns I had as the secretary was looking, and that's before he'd proposed his reorganization for the Department of Homeland Security, but I wanted to emphasize the need to keep preparedness and the preparedness function next to or with--very close to the people that had to respond and recover.",
        "In preparedness, you develop the plans, whether it's a plan to evacuate or the plans to shelter or set standards for shelters or looked at the capabilities of search and rescue, plan for how you're gonna do search and rescue.",
        "All of those things are--the preparedness that you would do so you're prepared to respond and then recover from a disaster.",
        "And my concern to the secretary, and I expressed the same to Michael Brown, was we need to be sure that that piece of preparedness--and there's other preparedness.",
        "That's not the only preparedness.",
        "But that piece of preparedness needs to stay very close to the people who have to execute those plans, and that's the people that are going to do the response and recovery.",
        "And I expressed that concern because I did--I have seen over the last few years, with the implementation of Department of Homeland Security and the incorporation of FEMA and all the other agencies, some degradation, no major, nothing I think that led to where we're at today with Katrina, but was leading that way a little bit of reducing FEMA's capability to respond and recover because not all the planning functions were close enough to them.",
        "Some of them, particularly the funding for state and local planning, had been removed from FEMA, and sent over to another undersecretary within the department, and so you have some dysfunctional things going on there when the people who are telling the states and local government what the requirements are to be prepared and what the requirements are to execute the funds we get to do preparedness aren't the same people that we're going to be working with in the response and recovery.",
        "So left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing, that sort of thing.",
        "Little bit of that, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Well, for all the criticism, I think they responded quite well.",
        "We need to recognize that while we knew the hurricane was coming, and the people go `Well, why weren't they there when the hurricane hit?,' well, had they been there when the hurricane hit, there would have been nothing left of FEMA.",
        "They'd all be evacuated and in shelters themselves.",
        "So you can only move up so close to that thing and then you got to let it go through and then come in afterwards.",
        "And, yeah, there are some--probably some findings that will come out of it.",
        "I don't know if it will be findings that were a problem with FEMA or findings that will be a problem with the cities or the counties or with the states, particularly, I think the big one they're looking at, New Orleans and Louisiana.",
        "And what I'm betting is it's going to be a combination of things that didn't work right at all those different levels to some degree but I think when you look at we're only about 10 days after the hurricane, and there's a tremendous amount of--going on the primary--the bulk evacuation of the areas is completed, the people are relocated, either into hospitals--there's been 10,000 patients moved, there have been hundreds of thousands of people either self-evacuated or evacuated by the government into suitable shelters now for life-health-safety issues.",
        "And that's a big undertaking, and when you consider that it's being moved all over the nation.",
        "So it's not a very simple thing, and I can think of other types of events around the world where this kind of thing would have happened and you think about Sumatra and the amount of time it took to get help to those folks, we're nowhere near in that kind of a situation.",
        "Yes, there are improvements to be made, but I think it's gone pretty well considering the kind of event we had.",
        "There were things that--the planning for this has been criticized, though, the idea that this--the city was only ready for a Category 3 event.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I don't know.",
        "I haven't looked at their plans.",
        "I would be out of line to sit here and say the plans were inadequate.",
        "I think there probably have been some assumptions made that need to be looked at again, the assumption that the--say the Superdome was a suitable place for sustained evacuation.",
        "That didn't prove true in this situation.",
        "Maybe there--I don't know what the assumptions were made about the levees around Lake Pontchartrain.",
        "Having not looked at those plans, I can't say, but it would appear that all of that--the impact of all of that wasn't completely accounted for but maybe it had been and I just--there was some--always when you plan, always when you look at things, you make some assumptions, and sometimes those assumptions are wrong.",
        "Somewhere there's--at some level, there's been some wrong assumptions, I would assume.",
        "One thing more before we let you go is you know there's been proposals to take FEMA back out of the Department of Homeland Security and remake it into its own agency again.",
        "What do you think of that?",
        "Chicago, Daley was reluctant to deal with this because of other racial, political implications of dealing too forcefully with crime, but he was pushed into it largely black ministers.",
        "And Chicago wasn't - began to adopt these methods and has had some success.",
        "I think that might be a little extreme.",
        "I think that there's a lot of advantage for FEMA being in the Department of Homeland Security and the coordination they have to do with those different agencies within that department.",
        "I--what I do believe needs to happen is the functions that were FEMA, that FEMA brought into the Department of Homeland Security, when they were moved in there, need to be better identified and closer correlated with FEMA, if not put back with FEMA.",
        "FEMA leaving the Department of Homeland Security is not really a necessary thing, I don't think, but I think the department needs to pay attention to making FEMA a little more whole or those functions like preparedness and whatnot need to have a much closer tie, i.e., the right hand and the left hand need to start clapping and holding one another to make sure that that all works well.",
        "I think a good example of bringing an agency that was a very well-functioning agency, and continues to be, and was left alone by--when it brought it--when it was brought into the department was the US Coast Guard.",
        "They were a great agency, they still are.",
        "They're doing their job.",
        "FEMA came in as an outstanding agency but it got picked apart and there's some thought that it may further be picked apart, and that--it should be put back together, not picked apart.",
        "But I don't think it's necessary that it become a stand-alone because once that happens, it loses the back-up of the whole Department of Homeland Security that it now enjoys during one of these mass disasters.",
        "David Liebersbach, thank you very much for being with us.",
