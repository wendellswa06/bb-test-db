        "People don't understand, we had a huge percentage of the population that left the city of New Orleans this time, more than has ever happened before.",
        "And, indeed, this comes immediately after a poll that predicted that there could only be maybe 50 percent of the people getting out.",
        "So that part of it worked pretty well.",
        "Where everybody has failed still is with those people who live in the city of New Orleans who do not have transportation out.",
        "And, you know, everybody has thrown up their hands about this problem for years and everybody's known about it, that it's--you know, it's an impossible problem to solve.",
        "The mayor does not have the finances or the ability to have a huge fleet of buses available to take people out.",
        "Amtrak can't keep, you know, 20 or 40 trains down here just so that New Orleans can pull people out at--you know, in a four-day notice.",
        "It's very, very difficult to deal with, and I think that's what one of the key problems is, is that, you know, when you go up the ladder, nobody looked at that and said, you know, `This is going to happen, we have to deal with this problem.",
        "What they said was, `Well, this might happen, and we're going to try to continue working on it.",
        "And they had been working on it.",
        "We talked earlier with a businessman in New Orleans who had an evacuation plan for his people, his company, and did it several times through those hurricanes that veered off, as you mentioned, and his employees thought he was crazy.",
        "Yet this time around, they did it again and it all worked.",
        "And that was what the mayor and the state were trying to do.",
        "They were attempting to go out to businesses and say, `Look, guys, you need to take respo--there has to be personal responsibility here.",
        "You need to take responsibility for your employees.",
        "Not everybody bought into that.",
        "The mayor also sent out faxes on Saturday morning to all of the ministers in town asking them to have their congregations pair up with people who didn't have transportation and get them out...",

        "He writes, `It's now been documented by news services that Mayor Nagin refused to order an evacuation until Sunday despite officials calling him days earlier and begging him to do so.",
        "Moreover, the city of New Orleans had an evacuation plan for the poor and elderly; they simply didn't follow it.",
        "Yet instead of blaming everything on one man, doesn't this indicate that evacuation orders should not be left up to individual leaders, but rather should come from agencies such as the National Hurricane Center?",
        "This would require some legal wrangling, but that seems the most obvious solution and could have saved thousands of lives in this particular tragedy.'",
        "Do you think that's fair?",
        "I think the last part is a good start.",
        "One of the problems here is that we have elected officials who have the final say in what's going on, and they are not the people who are the experts on what is going to happen.",
        "So that's a problem.",
        "But again, in this particular case, the mayor did what has become the routine in advance of these kinds of hurricanes as they move towards New Orleans.",
        "Everybody knew what was going on and, indeed, the evacuation was probably the best ever from New Orleans.",
        "The problem continues to be that, even if he had ordered a mandatory evacuation two days before, where we was he going to get the vehicles from to take people out?",
        "They didn't exist, unless one of the federal agencies agreed to do it.",
        "And they certainly didn't, or else the vehicles would have been there, right?",

        "And again, you know, everybody--because of what has happened in previous evacuations, there basically has been an assumption that getting those people out just is not going to work, and so that resulted in him focusing on how to get those people to the refuge of last resort when it is opened.",
        "And again, I use that term `refuge of last resort' because that is exactly what the mayor said it was.",
        "It was a place where people needed to bring their own food and water, where they would be, for a brief period of time, hopefully, until they were rescued and pulled out of the city.",
        "It was not a shelter.",
        "The American Red Cross several years ago made it clear that they would not open a shelter as we know it outside of the area anywhere south of Interstate 12 and Interstate 10, which includes most of south Louisiana, because of the danger to their employees.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And the reason for that is because it is, indeed, one of the very few public buildings that can withstand Category 5 hurricane winds.",
        "The Louisiana State University Hurricane Center did a study a couple of years ago looking at wind potential for buildings, for public buildings throughout the New Orleans area, and it really found that none of them could.",
        "And as we saw, part of the roof blew off of the Superdome.",
        "Of course, the reality is that people could have been rushed into the interior if more of the roof had blown off, but the reality also is that there are very, very few buildings in the city that either won't be flooded or will be able to survive Category 5 winds.",
        "So it's--everybody's known about this for years.",
        "I mean, they've known about it for at least 20 years, that this city has a problem with a population that is not going to be able to get out.",
