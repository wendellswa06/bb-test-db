        "Absolutely.",
        "We did a study after some of our earthquakes and clearly a number of studies after the civil unrest in 1992, but I've been rethinking all--many of those assumptions in light of this because this is more akin to the 1906 earthquake situation.",
        "And that's been fairly well historically documented.",
        "And I think we all...",
        "1906--you're talking about San Francisco.",
        "The San Francisco earthquake.",
        "I think we all need to look--take a step back, that haven't been affected by this directly, and say, `How does this affect our states and our ability?",
        "And I think we do have to really be prepared to step up to that catastrophic level when you just can't reconstitute your local resources, when everyone is so affected that they can't stay on the job any longer, that they can't remain to do their jobs.",
        "And we have to be prepared to cry uncle, as we've said for years, when you just have to give.",
        "But then the federal government needs to be able to step up and do the things that are in the national response plan that they say they're able to do.",
        "And do them quickly.",
        "Again, that's been the concern here in Katrina, that now resources are arriving as of last Friday, I guess.",
        "That's when National Guard troops first went into the city.",
        "But those forces would've been much more useful two, three days before that.",
        "Well, and I think particularly in the law enforcement arena, there's a difficulty there in that in this country, we've always been concerned historically about a federal police force.",
        "You know, we have federal investigative agencies, but we don't have a grand-level federal police, as they do in many of the other countries around us.",
        "There's no RCMP Mounties here to ride to the rescue.",
        "There's a concern about a federal presence, then there's concern in our laws and the Posse Comitatus Act, passed back after Reconstruction in 1878, about soldiers acting as police officers.",
        "So the difficulty that that presents is that FEMA, the other federal agencies, and all of us, as the states and locals, need to prepare to assist each other.",
        "Indeed, in the new National Response Plan, there's finally recognition that an emergency support function exists where the federal government needs to facilitate the provision of direct law enforcement assistance to the states.",
        "Then there's interstate compacts through the EMAC agreement between the states, although even that--there's a lot of difficulties in the law enforcement arena about peace officer authority in going into another state or the authority of a federal peace officer to enforce local laws.",
        "Michael Guerin, thanks very much.",
        "All interesting questions.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Her work helped uncover the fact that swathes of the Arctic were once home to deciduous conifers - trees, lots of them - 45 million years ago.",
        "Her book - part memoir, part meditation on the lives of plants - is fittingly called \"\"Lab Girl.\"\" Hope Jahren's earliest, happiest memories were of a laboratory - an escape from the silent stoicism of her Norwegian-American family.",
        "Here in this reading, she writes as if she was back in the lab as a child next to her scientist father.",
        "(Reading) In the cupboard by the door, there was pH testing tape, which was like a magic trick, only better, because instead of just showing a mystery, it also solved one.",
        "You could see the difference in color, and thus pH, between a drop of spit and water and root beer and urine in the bathroom - but not blood because you can't see through it, so don't try.",

        "This district almost always goes Democratic, but that's not quite as certain this year with a couple hundred thousand residents who still haven't returned to the city.",
        "Lavigne believes Katrina has upended the old political conventional wisdom, and he says the storm also shook up voter complacency.",
        "Not so far away in Detroit, however, as city government literally decomposes, the crime rate continues to explode.",
        "Part of what happens is cities have expectations, Philadelphia is famous as a city of low expectations, so the prior mayor, John Street, allowed crime to run out of control and he wasn't - he's never held accountable.",
        "In Detroit, similarly, the current mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, has not been held accountable - he was reelected despite soaring crime rates.",
        "When that happens, what you do is you push more of the middle class out of the cities.",
        "And the crime rate then will go up.",

        "Now, if it happens in 2017, 2018 and 2019, are we going to know whether that was something that may have happened anyway or it happened because people have been fertilizing the North Pacific for 10 years?",
