        "We get reaction now from two guests who are regularly featured on this program on our Roundtable.",
        "Marcelo Suarez-Orozco is co-director of the immigration studies at New York University and co-founder of the Harvard Immigration Project.",
        "And Pedro Noguera is a professor in the Steinhart School of Education, also at NYU.",
        "Both men helped to lead a conference in New York yesterday titled Rethinking Global Migration: New Realities, New Opportunities, New Challenges.",
        "Gentlemen, welcome.",
        "Hello, Ed.",
        "Hi, Ed.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "We'll get to the conferences in just a moment, but let's talk about this Senate bill.",
        "Pedro, let me start with you.",
        "Voted on yesterday, 62 up, 36 down.",
        "A lot of concern given, quite frankly, on both sides.",
        "Talk to me about the measures and what you think of the bill.",
        "I think, given the rhetoric in the country that we're hearing, you know, in terms of - given the extreme kind of measures that are on the Congressional bill - that the Senate bill ends up looking far more moderate and reasonable.",
        "Although, it contains several problems as well because of, you know…",
        "I think the Guest Worker Program really doesn't begin to resolve the ongoing dilemma about the undocumented in this country.",
        "But, it still looks more reasonable.",
        "I think Bush is even looking more reasonable these days, in terms of his approach.",
        "The real question is, can he lead his own party?",
        "And can he begin to change the kind of very extreme measures that we are seeing now coming from Congress and elsewhere?",
        "Marcelo, proponents will suggest the House version has more teeth.",
        "Critics will suggest that it is too harsh.",
        "The Senate bill has a border security, a guest worker program, a provision that back taxes have to be paid, a fine will have to be paid, as well as the idea of, you must learn English.",
        "That is the case, Ed.",
        "And as Pedro suggested, now the devil will dwell in the details of how precisely moving forward we're going to - for example, deal with the perhaps, up to 5 million people, that under the Senate bill, would really have to either check - leave the country and check in port of entry before re-entering the United States.",
        "And including up to about a million people who would have to go back to their countries and apply from overseas.",
        "And it's not at all clear how that would be managed.",
        "So the good news is that there is more of a broader opportunity here to address immigration systemically, as an issue, rather than the House bill, which would have only introduced new border control measures.",
        "So…"

        "Pedro, the dirty word, if you will, that's been thrown up consistently, at least from critics, is amnesty.",

        "Well, in a way, it's not amnesty.",
        "It's called an amnesty-light.",
        "There are several processes, several steps that will need to be taken before the up to 7 million people that have been in the United States over five years, who can pass the language exam, a security check, who pay their taxes, who pay their fines… So it really is a complex process, and how this will be managed will require really careful thinking, careful planning.",

        "side?",
        "And given the reality that today we have 11 to 12 million people in our country without papers.",
        "Pedro, the idea that many are concerned about a provision that talks about the number of years you've been in this country, and whether or not you'll be allowed to stay.",
        "There are concerns of breaking up a family.",
        "There are concerns as to whether or not people will be able to afford the $3200 plus, beyond the back taxes that they'll have to pay.",
        "How much of this becomes problematic when trying to make sure that it is fair on both sides?",
        "Well, the reality is if they, if Congress makes the restrictions on becoming a guest worker to heavy, if the fines and the penalties are too great, or if they make it too difficult to legalize those who are already here, then they will just continue to live as undocumented people in this country.",
        "Which is not a good situation - neither for them, nor for the rest of the country.",
        "So you know, there's a lot of - there's an unwillingness upon the Congress to confront the reality that we have 12 million undocumented people in this country - with children - and they're going to stay.",
        "They're not going to leave.",
        "They're not going to be able… The government has no ability to round them up.",
        "Mike Bloomberg, the mayor of New York is one of the few people who's willing to acknowledge this reality and talk about, well, what do we do, given that?",
        "So, I think there's a real disconnect between the reality on the ground, of undocumented people in this country performing needed jobs, and what this government is willing to do about it.",
        "And that's part of what your conference was about.",
        "Again the title, Rethinking Global Migration: New Realities, New Opportunities, New Challenges."
