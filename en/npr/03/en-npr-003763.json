        "His two daughters skipped school to attend.",
        "Retired Justice Anthony Kennedy was there, too.",
        "Of course Kavanaugh replaced him on the bench.",

        "I counted more than 10 questions from him to both sides, mostly technical questions about the state of the law.",
        "The court today heard two cases about what kinds of crimes should trigger the Armed Career Criminal Act.",
        "Congress passed that law to take dangerous people off the street.",
        "It sends them away for mandatory prison terms if they have prior violent crimes in their past.",
        "The question for the court today was whether certain kinds of robberies or burglaries counted or not.",
        "Sounds like neither of those cases today are ones with big political or ideological divides.",
        "But when are cases going to come before them that would test this new 5-4 makeup of the court?",
        "Yeah, the docket is not super-polarized so far, but there's a good chance the high court will consider whether to accept some cases that could wind up being blockbusters, cases that, say, have to do with President Obama's DACA immigration plan, cases that might pit religious liberty against the rights of LGBT people or cases about the power and reach of the executive branch.",
        "At least one of the justices today appeared to be playing a long game.",
        "That's Elena Kagan.",
        "She was appointed by President Obama, but she and Brett Kavanaugh go back a way.",
        "She hired him to teach at Harvard Law School when she was a dean there.",
        "They behaved very warmly together today, laughed a lot.",
        "And he shook her hand as he left the bench.",
        "The issue is whether she is trying a charm offensive on this new justice to get him to be a more moderate figure on this bench over time.",
        "But what about the fear that Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle was so partisan, was so rancorous, I think is the word you used, that there would be this cloud of partisanship hanging over him and hanging over the court?",
        "Did you see any sign of that?"

        "And those were the most precious things that were handed down in my family from my grandmothers to my mother, etc. Those were the nice things that they had, you know?",
        "And to juxtapose that against the scientific work that I did - it's very natural to me, but it's arresting to the reader.",
