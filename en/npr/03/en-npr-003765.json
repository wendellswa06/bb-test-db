        "As a onetime political prisoner in Egypt, Saad Eddin Ibrahim is all for America's democracy push in the Arab world, but the secular opposition figure says the only way for the US to be credible is to talk to the Islamists.",
        "He made this call at a small luncheon recently at the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute.",
        "My advice to Americans is to engage the Islamists, not only in Egypt but in the region.",
        "Sooner or later, they will have to deal with them.",
        "Some of the US officials, Hill staffers and analysts on hand seemed skeptical, but Ibrahim persisted, arguing that America seems to have a myopic view dealing with Islamists in Iraq but not elsewhere in the Arab world.",
        "As for the poor showing of Egypt's secular opposition, Ibrahim blamed that on the Egyptian government, which he says has squeezed the middle.",
        "Any liberal alternative, no matter how modest it may be, even a moderate Islamic alternative is fiercely resisted by the regime.",
        "The regime wants to have frightening Islamists as the only alternative to them.",
        "The Middle East and North Africa program director for the International Crisis Group, Robert Malley, says this is a dangerous path for Egypt.",
        "That's a strategy that has worked perhaps so far but that has a real risk of backfiring if the dominant party loses credibility and if all discontent and frustration gets expressed through the Islamists.",
        "Malley, a former White House aide, sees a message for the US.",
        "Not necessarily to support one party or the legalization of a party but rather to support an open democratic process and the conditions under which a number of parties could emerge."

        "But, for Smith, the diamonds' Tupperware quality was key.",

        "That's twice as deep as normal diamonds.",
        "So that in itself is pretty amazing.",
        "The second thing is that the diamonds had formed inside patches of liquid metal.",
        "The idea that there may be liquid metal 200 miles beneath us is at odds with the old view that the Earth's interior is a uniform rocky mixture.",

        "Macedonia is not in the European Union, and it claims it's following EU policy by differentiating economic migrants from refugees.",
