        "Somehow in that laugh, you suddenly realize Maurice Sendak looks kind of like a wild thing--curly hair and a balding head, a glint in the eye, yet a softening smile around the mouth.",
        "His pop-up book is still a year away, but Sendak has a new work just out, \"\"Bears,\"\" and it hearkens back to \"\"Where the Wild Things Are.\"\" No grinning monsters, but the star is Max, that little boy in the white wolf suit.",
        "The new book is a tribute to Sendak's mentor, the late Ruth Krauss.",
        "Her best-known work is \"\"The Carrot Seed,\"\" and her husband, Crockett Johnson, known as Dave, wrote \"\"Harold and the Purple Crayon.\"\" Krauss and Johnson took Maurice Sendak under their wings at their home in Rowayton, Connecticut.",
        "When Ruth Krauss first met Sendak in 1950, he was 22, painting window displays at FAO Schwarz in New York.",
        "He'd already faced years of rejection from publishers.",
        "The commonest criticism was `They're too foreign-looking.",
        "And the advice always was, `Go look at a typical American children's book.",
        "These don't look like'--and of course, the question is, why would you want another typical American children's book?",
        "You already have so many.",
        "But by that they meant generic, blond, tip-nosed children, where I had Jewish immigrant children, which was all I knew, who had way too-big heads and odd little features and dumpy bodies.",
        "But children do have big heads and dumpy bodies.",
        "No, he didn't say that, but you've got it.",
        "Decisions that would lead to several brushes with the law and eventually leave Tullar homeless.",
        "He's like a lot of vets who land in prison.",
        "They have higher rates of substance abuse and mental illness than others.",
        "And the VA is looking at new ways to reach them.",
        "We've got the tools that can help these veterans get back on track.",
        "It's just a matter of helping make sure that they're linked to the right services as early as possible and that they have the supports they need.",
        "That's Sean Clark, national coordinator for Veterans Justice Outreach at the VA.",
        "The idea is to catch these vets while they're in jail.",
        "What we're trying to do is to ensure that when veterans do have contact with the criminal justice system that there are effectively off-ramps into needed treatment.",
        "That's why each VA Medical Center in the U.S.",
        "has at least one person who has to reach out to vets behind bars.",
        "The VA's not everywhere.",
        "But they do have access to nearly half the jails and prisons around the country.",
        "When Shaun Tullar walked out of jail in September, Joy Villa Vicencio of the VA was waiting for him."

        "So there's a lot of moving parts to actually get somebody out of custody into my care, basically, and then taken to wherever they need to go.",

        "I don't want to tell her that, you know, I went to jail to come back to the realization that I need to get my life together.",
        "But it's the truth.",
        "They don't have programs like Veterans Village everywhere in the country, and the VA hasn't done enough research to discover whether this type of outreach actually keeps veterans from ending up back in prison.",
        "Shaun thinks that it will.",
        "And it's been a smoother adjustment to civilian life than when he first left the military.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Steve Walsh."

        "A discovery about memory in rats could lead to better treatments for Alzheimer's disease.",
        "The finding involves a type of memory that is especially vulnerable to the disease.",
        "NPR's Jon Hamilton explains.",
        "It's called episodic memory, and Jonathon Crystal of Indiana University in Bloomington says it lets us review the events in our lives.",
        "Retrieving an episodic memory is about going back in time and recalling the specific event as it happened.",
        "But Crystal says people with Alzheimers often lose that ability.",
        "So for example if somebody goes and visits his or her grandmother who's suffering from Alzheimer's, that grandmother isn't going to remember that you were visiting a couple of weeks ago and what you described about things that are going on in your life.",
        "Crystal and a team of researchers thought rats might have some version of episodic memory, so they've been testing the animal's ability to remember odors like basil and banana.",
        "They need to keep track of the different odors and where they encountered them in the past.",
        "In the team's latest study which appears in the journal Current Biology, the rats sniff different combinations of voters in different places.",
        "Crystal says the question was whether the animals could remember smelling a specific combination in a specific place.",
        "And what we find is that the rats are really adept at this.",
        "They remember well over 30 items in context.",
        "Which adds to the evidence that rats do have some form of episodic memory.",
        "Bruce Lamb of Indiana University in Indianapolis says the research could improve testing of experimental drugs for Alzheimer's.",
        "These drugs are usually tested in genetically modified mice, but Lamb says including rats in some drug studies might provide important new information."
