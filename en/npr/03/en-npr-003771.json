        "Well, how did we get from the 9/11 shock to the 17-year war and the stalemate we're in now?",
        "And particularly, how did three administrations now but primarily the Bush and Obama administrations in my history wrestle with the complexity of the war and fail to solve it?",

        "I mean, just to pause there, that's a stunning thing to say - this idea that in 2018, after 17 years of fighting, it's still a question who the enemy is.",
        "That's mind-blowing.",
        "Yeah, I mean, today we're fighting two wars in Afghanistan because the enemies are different.",
        "And one is against the Islamic State, which we do identify as direct threats to the United States and our allies in Europe.",
        "And then the second war against the Afghan Taliban is an advise-and-assist war where we support the Afghan Security Forces in their civil war against the Taliban.",
        "And we basically function as their air force and their intelligence service."
