        "This one, called \"\"Bears,\"\" is a re-illustration of a simple little book Ruth Krauss wrote in 1948, two years before she met Sendak.",
        "The original drawings were by Phyllis Rowand, but the publisher decided those are now out of date.",
        "The difference between what I did and what Phyllis did is a generational thing.",
        "What she did was literally take what Ruth said, `Bears on the stairs,' and drew them on the stairs.",

        "You're not just--I don't like the word `illustrating.",

        "But, really, there is no substantive details beyond that, that they're going to meet at 9 a.m. President Trump was asked how he would know if Kim Jong Un is serious about denuclearizing.",
