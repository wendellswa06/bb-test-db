        "He says that when she was in her last years, she was suffering so much from cancer - more than she cared to admit even to herself - she would go into the studio and she'd try and record things which she'd been able to play perfectly well earlier in her career, but now there were grunts and sighs and gasps of pain.",
        "And so he started patching in little bits and pieces from other recordings from pianists whom he thought sounded rather like Hatto.",
        "And interestingly, he says that Laszlo Simon had the same teacher as Joyce Hatto.",
        "And then once he got the habit, as it were, it became more and more, longer and longer, portions.",
        "He stops in the letter just short of admitting that he lifted whole discs, although we have beyond any reasonable doubt, so they say, proof that he did that.",
        "But he does admit to, quote, that he has acted - I think the quote is, \"\"I have acted dishonestly, stupidly and unlawfully.",
