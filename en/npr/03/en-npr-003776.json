        "Tell us about that.",
        "Yes, he went early.",
        "The first time he went there in 1989 and trying to reach the frontlines in Afghanistan to fight with other jihadists.",
        "Unfortunately, the war was over when he arrived, and so he retreated in Pakistan where he became a poor(ph) journalist there.",
        "He then came back to his country, Jordan, and was imprisoned because he tried to mount terrorist attacks in Israel and Jordan, and was caught and was imprisoned for five years.",
        "So he was jailed in Jordan for attempted terrorist attacks?",
        "Yes.",
        "And what happened then, when he was in prison?",
        "In prison, in reality, he became a leader and imposed himself as a leader toward other cellmates and he really shaped his personality as a violent criminal leader.",

        "It's a very complicated relationship, since the beginning.",
        "When he came back in Afghanistan in 1999, he had been jailed, as I said, for five years, and so most of the high-ranking al-Qaida leaders viewed him as someone who could have worked with the Jordan intelligence.",
        "So he was not viewed as someone to trust.",
        "He had to run his own training camp apart from other training camps, other al-Qaida training camps, to prove that he could become a leader for al-Qaida, and that's what he did.",
        "How was he able to become a top al-Qaida leader?",
        "This was given to him by the circumstances of the offensive coalition forces in Iraq.",
        "Without that, obviously he would have remained a second-class terrorist in the region and nothing else.",
        "This gave him the power to impose himself, impose his view, including to Osama bin Laden himself, in terms of the strategy he used in this country.",
        "He is thought to have been behind beheadings, such as the one of American Nicholas Berg - he was that, the young businessman from Pennsylvania.",
        "What was his strategy in carrying out these beheadings and this violence?",
        "Was he fomenting anti-American violence, or was he interested in fomenting a Sunni-Shia civil war.",
        "Both.",
        "I mean his strategy was to create chaos inside Iraq, for months he entertained his campaign of beheadings to become the most respected by all the others.",
        "He received the most funding from outside, also most of the Arab fighters were joining the ranks of his group, so he turned to be in reality, the principal insurgency group.",
        "I wonder if anything, intelligence-wise, is lost with his killing.",
        "If he could have provided a lot of useful information if he had been captured alive.",
        "Given the complicated relationship that he has with al-Qaida leadership, he wouldn't have been able to provide usable information intelligence, for the purpose of tracking down, you know, high-ranking al-Qaida leaders such as bin Laden or Zawahiri.",
        "It would obviously have provided a lot on the functioning of his group in Iraq, but we know that there are many groups acting in Iraq and that he's just one of them.",
        "Well, thank you very much."
