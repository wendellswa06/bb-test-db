        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "The initial analysis that's been conducted of the events that were reported overnight is not consistent with North Korean claims of a successful hydrogen bomb test.",
        "Coming up, we'll speak to a former State Department official about what North Korea hopes to gain by conducting the nuclear test.",
        "First, joining me in the studio is NPR science correspondent Geoff Brumfiel to talk about the claims from Pyongyang.",
        "Geoff, welcome to the studio.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The White House sounds fairly confident there that this was not a hydrogen bomb test.",
        "What are they basing this on?",
        "Well, when a nuclear weapon is tested, it sends off a shockwave through the earth.",
        "It's basically like an earthquake.",
        "And seismic stations around the world can pick that up, and they can make some sort of estimate about the size.",
        "Based on what was observed, the unofficial estimates by the Pentagon say this was under 10 kilotons.",
        "That's 10,000 tons of TNT-equivalent explosives.",
        "But the bottom line is that seems too small to be a hydrogen bomb.",
        "Just for comparison here, the first hydrogen bomb was 10 megatons.",
        "That's 10 million tons of TNT - a thousand times more powerful.",
        "It would make this thing look like a firecracker.",
        "Ariel died, and then subsequently Elizabeth with two friends, DeLaurentis and Suzie Zeegen, created the foundation, really to be sure that children were kept in the forefront.",
        "In those days, certainly in the early 1990s, the focus at that time in the United States was on the gay community and the spread of the disease, and children were barely an afterthought.",
        "So Elizabeth created the foundation, and when she died in 1994, many of us have been able to keep that legacy alive by continuing to work with children.",
        "Gloria, why did you choose this organization?",
        "Of all the organizations you could have chosen to work with, why this one?",
        "You know, when I was first on \"\"E.R.\"\" and when the story line that I did at that time through Jeanie Boulet, who was an HIV-positive physician's assistant, I, as is often the case with people who are on television shows, you get invited to support numerous foundations.",
        "And that what when I was first introduced to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation.",
        "I've been an activist on the issue of HIV-AIDS for quite a few years now, but it was earlier this year in New York when Pam and I had met each other at an event that the foundation was having, and we immediately clicked.",
        "And from that moment, we had talked about, you know, South Africa and about the possibility of a pending trip, and then a short while after that, they so generously asked if I would like to, you know, be an ambassador for the foundation.",
        "And of course, you know, how could I say no?",
        "It's really an honor to be associated with the foundation."

        "So you recently visited Kenya and South Africa.",
        "I'm going to ask each of you, what stayed in your heart from that trip?",
        "I was in both Kenya and South Africa, one of the eight to nine trips I make a year to Africa.",
        "And a wonderful question you just asked, and I had an immediate visual what stayed with me.",
        "So consider that I go quite often, and I must tell you, I always have those moments that stay with me, no matter the country, no matter how many times I go.",
        "And in this particular trip with Gloria, we were in a hospital in South Africa and as we were standing in one of the lobbies, one of the midwives came out and was so excited.",
        "We had met her earlier in the day and she said, you must come back into labor and deliver.",
        "One of the moms from the Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission Program has had a baby, and the mom is very excited and the baby is negative, and the mom is sitting up and she would love to see you.",
        "And so Gloria and I went back in.",
        "and I must tell you, the joy on the part of the midwives who were there as well as the mom will always stay with me.",
        "That's amazing.",
        "I was going to choose that very same story.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's so true what Pam just said.",
        "The joy on her face, it was truly, truly inspiring.",
        "I know that that word is used a lot, but this really was very much so.",
        "What about the coordination between a foundation like this one and government?",
        "Because there is the PEPFAR program, and do you work with government programs that are trying to put this into action as well?",
        "We work with governments in each one of the countries.",
        "In fact, we only work in a country where we're invited to work there by the ministry of health.",
        "And again, I think Gloria saw that with us on the visit.",
        "I'll let Gloria speak to that.",
        "But we don't create new clinics and new hospitals.",
        "We work in the ministry hospitals, and we train those midwives, our midwives who are there employed by the ministry of health.",
        "It's the backbone of the existing system, and what we're trying to do is to train, enhance and build the capacity to be able to deliver these services.",
        "And that kind of work being done, particularly in a country in South Africa, you know, when Mbeki was in, because, you know, we'll see how the new leadership handles it.",
        "But being able to do that kind of work with the challenges that that particular administration had in terms of even acknowledging that HIV causes AIDS, you know, says a lot that the foundation was invited in and that this kind of work is happening there."

        "Well I tell you, the first segment of my trip to South Africa was with Kerry Kennedy (ph) and human rights work.",
        "And I believe that both are very much intertwined, human rights and the HIV-AIDS pandemic, in any country.",
        "And a big part of that issue is because of the gender inequality and because of the disempowerment that women feel.",
        "There's just kind of a powerlessness that women have over their own lives sexually.",
        "And there's also this element, poverty plays a huge key.",

        "I think I'd add to that, Gloria, the issue of stigma.",
        "Often we're asked what may be significant barriers to being able to treat women or to make sure that we can offer services to as many women as possible, and stigma is certainly a part of that.",
        "Gloria, I want to ask you about celebrity, because one of the things that's really come in to the public discourse the past few years is about celebrity can be leveraged for major social issues.",

        "You work areas of humor that are controversial.",

        "I mean, it's such kind of a frivolous kind of silly thing in a way to be an actor.",
