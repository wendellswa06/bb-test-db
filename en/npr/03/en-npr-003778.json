        "Well, I think there have been a number of instances when bias has been demonstrated within the Mueller probe; also, the manner in which the team has been put together, the relationship between Mr. Mueller and Mr. Comey; and then finally, some of the details of the intelligence memo that we hope is made public this week would seem to indicate that no prosecution could ever be brought from the Mueller probe.",

        "By all accounts, of course, this is one of the most technologically advanced planes ever built, and Boeing took their time designing and building it.",
        "So how do they get it into operation - and it starts springing a fuel leak?",
        "Well, what Boeing would say is gosh, this stuff is complicated.",
        "And of course, it is.",
        "And it has six electrical systems; you know, hydraulic power's now been switched to electrical power; and it's got computers and batteries, and so on and so forth.",

        "Well, it is - you know, it is three years late.",
        "It was supposed to come to market in 2008.",
        "It came to market in 2011, and a large part of the reason for that delay was precisely because it was really complicated, and it was not unlike any other airplane that had ever come before.",
        "It has, you know, lightweight parts, and it has - it's fuel-efficient; and it's this, that and the other thing.",
        "And I should also point out, Scott, that these problems have had zero effect on Boeing's sales.",
        "Well, that's important.",
        "What's your estimation of that?",
        "Has the company just addressed it so powerfully?",
        "No, that's not the reason at all.",
        "The reason is that we have an aging fleet worldwide, and so companies need airplanes.",
        "And Boeing and Airbus made very different bets on what the world was going to need.",
        "Airbus bet on - giant aircraft that hauls 6- or 700 people.",
        "And Boeing made a bet that the world wanted smaller planes that went point to point, that had 200 to 250 people.",
        "As a result, Airbus's backlog is about 250 airplanes.",
        "Boeing's backlog is about 850 airplanes.",
        "So if you cancel a Boeing order 'cause you're mad about these problems, or you want them sooner, you don't have any other place to go.",
        "And what is your estimation of how Boeing has handled the problem so far?",
        "Well, they're in a tricky spot.",
        "On the one hand, in their heart of hearts, they believed that these problems are really small; that it's not putting anybody at risk; and it's just kind of a teething process, as they like to say, with a brand-new aircraft.",
        "But they can't say that out loud because then they sound callous and uncaring.",
        "And so when the Department of Transportation and the FAA say, well, we're going to investigate the electrical systems, you know, Boeing can't say, don't worry, we're going to fix all this.",
        "They have to say, we're on board.",
        "And so it's basically been a headache that they think is not quite justified, but they can't say that out loud.",
        "Now that - you've, of course - have covered these kind of cases before, where corporations have to handle questions from the public.",
        "And this is a hard line to finesse.",
        "On the one hand, you have to be concerned about the problem - but not so concerned you leave people to be alarmed about it."

        "But the surge and also the change in the tactics, in 2007 in particular, pushing the troops out to combat outposts, or what they call \"\"COPS,\"\" has been very effective in generating intelligence which has been used to target terrorists, and also the civic-action programs have been very effective.",
