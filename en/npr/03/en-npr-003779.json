        "I've heard of a lot of, you know, political litmus tests being applied to folks in the Justice Department, and in Iraq reconstruction teams and so forth.",
        "And I think there has been an attempt to identify the troops with a certain political platform by people who are standing on that political platform.",
        "I am wondering if you saw an erosion or if you've seen any pressure to conform to a particular party line during your time with the troops.",
        "They don't really talk politics much unless, you know, maybe sometimes somebody cusses at the president or something.",

        "So they don't really get into the nitty-gritty.",

        "You mentioned, of course, violence has gone down considerably since the start of the surge, but a contributing factor to that was the ceasefire ordered by Muqtada al-Sadr, the Shiite cleric who controls the Sadr army.",
        "Things have seemingly heated up over the past several weeks, as the Iraqi government and U.S.",

        "That pushed al-Qaeda out of Anbar into south Baghdad and Arab Jubur and Baqubah and places like that.",
        "Al-Qaeda in particular was trying to foment civil war and they were successful.",
        "And I was the first to report that, in fact, in February of 2005.",
        "It didn't really kick off big until 2006.",
        "But al-Qaeda also helped strengthen JAM or Jaish al-Mahdi, the Sadrists, by actually attacking them.",
        "And so we've tried al-Qaeda so much at this point that they are still effective, they are still killing people daily.",
        "But there's not a lot left of them compared to yesteryear.",
        "So the biggest issue now is JAM and the special groups, in particular, who seem to be supported by Iran, for instance, who seems to be supplying them with EFPs, which is a certain type of bomb that's very effective.",
        "And these would be Shia groups.",
        "Shia groups.",
        "And supported by Iran, and so there's an intra-Shia conflict underway here between - well, the prime minister is a member of the Dawa Party and he, of course, that party has its own militia.",
        "There is the Skiri(ph) group that's got their own militia, the Badr Brigades, and you mentioned the Mahdi army.",
        "Is this going to be resolved anytime soon?",
        "Well, a lot of this is obviously political posturing.",
        "It's unlike al-Qaeda, so this is a very important thing to keep in mind.",
        "We cannot negotiate with al-Qaeda.",
        "You just have to fight them.",
        "But with the JAM militias, generally speaking, you can negotiate.",

        "So when they hear that 60 percent or two-thirds of the American public now thinks the war was a bad idea, they just shrug?",
