        "The biggest planets in the rest of the solar system are The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, The Hill and to some extent Huffington Post on the left.",

        "Breitbart attacked other media sites on the right when they battled with Donald Trump.",

        "And I don't want to - I say standard.",
        "That kind of downplays it.",
        "I mean, this would still be a bomb roughly the size of those used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, so this is still a very serious thing.",
        "But there is another possibility, which is that North Korea put a little bit of hydrogen at the center of their bomb, and then they used that hydrogen to enhance the fission bomb.",
        "That would allow them to claim they had conducted an H-bomb test even though it wasn't quite what we would consider a hydrogen bomb.",
        "We know what the White House thinks, but in the end, how will the international community verify what happened?",
        "Well, we may never be able to say much more, but there is a possibility that radioactive gases will leak out.",
        "These tests are conducted underground, and so we have to wait for that to happen.",
