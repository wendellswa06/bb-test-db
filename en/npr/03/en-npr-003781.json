        "The immigration law, until Hart-Cellar, made it very, very difficult for Asians to get into this country - and a lot of other people not of North European background.",
        "And so all of the sudden, in the '60s and certainly ever after, there was an avalanche of legal immigration, and these people were very sophisticated, who were coming over to be students and engineers.",

        "That started with Julia Child and Jim Beard, people who were really serious explainers and educators as well as authors of recipes.",
        "And then people traveled after, say, 1960 in a way that they never had before.",
        "And a lot of them discovered that gastronomic travel was something you could do between visits to museums or skiing or whatever you went abroad to do.",
        "And so they saw what authentic food was in foreign countries and weren't so interested in kind of fraudulent copies of it when they came home.",
