        "The message was stay united.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that demand failed on Thursday.",
        "In a rare bipartisan rebuke of this White House, 12 Republican senators broke from their party.",
        "They aligned with Democrats and blocked the president's efforts to divert funds for a border wall.",
        "Here's one of those senators, Republican Rob Portman from Ohio.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Congress, not the president, has the sole authority to determine how to spend taxpayer money.",
        "The vote was 59 to 41.",

        "So how big a setback is this for President Trump?",
        "Well, policywise, it's not really a huge setback.",
        "You had 12 Republican senators voting with Democrats.",
        "But that's not enough to override a veto.",
        "Trump tweeted right after the vote in all caps - one word - veto.",
        "(Laughter) So that's where this is headed.",
        "But it's a setback in the sense that a dozen members of Trump's own party went against him on his signature issue - immigration.",
        "To have that many Republicans rebuff this declaration in the face of Trump actively lobbying members to hold the line, it's a sign that Republicans are pushing back.",
        "Now, obviously, Republicans are going to stick with Trump overall.",
        "There's no doubt about that.",
        "But this shows that there may be some limits.",
        "And why were the limits here?",
        "We're not talking about one or two Republicans.",
        "I mean, this is a sizable number of Republicans.",
        "Why did they decide to take a stand on this issue?",
        "What many of these Republicans were saying is that they support Trump.",
        "They support the wall.",
        "But they're against this idea of using an emergency declaration to access funds that Congress refused to appropriate.",
        "They said they wanted to protect Congress' authority.",
        "Here's Republican Senator Lamar Alexander making that point.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Our nation's founders gave to Congress the power to approve all spending so that the president would not have too much power.",
        "This check on the executive is a source of our freedom.",
        "So what these senators seem to really be getting at with these votes is that there will be life after Trump.",
        "And if you approve this sort of authority for Trump, then you open the door to when a Democrat, at some point, gets in the White House, using this authority, potentially, to kind of take on issues like climate change without including Congress.",
        "And that's what these Republicans didn't want to happen.",
        "Which is an argument that did not persuade President Trump or the White House.",
        "And, you know, Ayesha, this is a president who does not hold back in going after people who stand in his way.",
        "Is - are there going to be consequences, potentially, for being a Republican who voted against this president?",
        "We can all see that the current trajectory of how things are going is not actually in anybody's interest, and so it is worth this major diplomatic effort to bring the parties to the table, to achieve a transition at the top in Syria so that we can make the change that country needs."

        "I mean, he's still talking about John McCain not voting on health care all those years ago.",

        "And then what happens after that?",

        "So, Ron, what are the Senators McCain and Obama saying about how exactly to deal with high gas prices?",
        "Well Alex, of course they agree that it's just terrible and people are hurting.",
        "And they're trying to show that they feel your pain, even though, of course, it's a little hard to imagine either one of them at the corner gas station pumping gas into his own Chevy or Ford.",
        "Now the surprising thing about these two candidates is that they actually agree a fair amount on what we have to do.",
        "Now of course John McCain in general is a supporter of free market principles and a supporter of encouraging oil and gas exploration.",
        "But he's not for drilling in Alaska.",
        "He's voted against that as opposed to most Republicans.",
        "And he considers himself a conservationist.",

        "So where do they differ?",
        "They differ on this short-term solution of having a gas tax holiday - of taking off the federal tax on a gallon of gas.",
        "Now that does not go up as the price of gas goes up, so it's a shrinking percentage of the price we're paying at the pump.",
        "But John McCain says why not give people a little relief?",
        "Especially the people who need it most in rural areas who have to drive long distances, who have to drive to work, and also the poorest people and the people with the oldest cars that are least efficient.",
        "Why don't we give those people a break by taking off the 18 cents?",
        "Barack Obama says that's not even going to be noticeable.",
        "When we've tried that before, we tried in Illinois, he says, people didn't even see any benefit because the price just went up to cover the difference.",
        "Ron, there was a recent Pew poll that found voters preferred Senator Obama to Senator McCain by 15 percentage points when it comes to improving the economy.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "I'm going to suspect it has less to do with the differences between these two individual men and their views and more to do with the difference between Democrats and Republicans right now.",
        "Because that closely tracks the generic question about the two parties when it comes to the economy.",
        "People are disillusioned with the policies of the Bush Administration across the board perhaps, but particularly with respect to the economy.",
        "And they feel that the free market emphasis has not necessarily delivered.",

        "It has not kept jobs growing as fast as people would like to see - the unemployment numbers are disturbing to them.",

        "Minnesota has shown, as you point out, a willingness to let people reinvent themselves to some degree.",
        "Yeah, Jesse Ventura had to drop the pink feather boa, but they were willing to make him governor.",
        "And for that matter, Norm Coleman, who came from Brooklyn, New York and broke into politics as a Democrat has been allowed to reinvent himself in Minnesota as well.",
        "So this may be a sterner test.",
        "There's a lot of stuff on the record that Al Franken has said and written and for years he made his living by being outrageous and offensive.",
        "But he got the Democratic Farm Labor Party's endorsement on Saturday, after first winning the support of the Feminist Caucus within the DFL.",
        "That was big for him because many of the things that he had said were considered offensive to women.",
        "If the Feminist Caucus is willing to support him strongly and if the DFL is willing to support him strongly, it looks like he will be the nominee.",
