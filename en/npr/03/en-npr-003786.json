        "Now we have certainly radical elements on the ground, including those associated with al-Qaida on the one hand, and you also have deepening sectarian tensions that suggests that while you may end up bringing some parties to the table, it's still far from clear that those parties will be able to in fact wield significant influence on those who are fighting out the battles on the ground.",
