        "I don't think that was there.",
        "I don't think that was specifically what it was said, but that was certainly one of the underlying goals.",
        "What about teenagers - teenage girls, particularly - with respect to this?",
        "Those who are covered under their parents' health insurance, do they apply, or are there other rules with regard to having parental consent?",
        "I believe there are other rules.",
        "Now, the Title X program, the federal Family Planning Program, does have rules in which teenagers are required to be given services confidentially.",

        "I'm wondering the effect that taking away the - if it levels the playing field, excuse me - it takes away one more way for companies to be competitive with each other and offer these as possible sales points.",
        "Interesting question.",
        "Thank you very much, Darryl.",
        "What about that?",
        "I don't know the answer.",
        "Oh, I think there's a - you know, states have had insurance mandates for years.",

        "Some states have a few.",
        "But there's certainly nothing new about insurance mandates, about having certain services be covered by requirement.",
        "What's new, obviously, is having federal mandates, and that's something that's been a debate that's gone on since the late 1990s.",
        "This is part of what's called the Patient's Bill of Rights, which was included within the health law.",
        "But there had been a separate debate about having a Patient's Bill of Rights since the late 1990s.",
        "But as I mentioned, states have long had insurance coverage mandates, and they're for a wide variety of things, including, you know, some of them - the insurance companies complain about - include, I think - you know, some states require hair transplants to be covered under health insurance.",
        "We're talking about health care reform and some new provisions that will go into effect in a year that will allow women to get birth control without having to pay deductibles or co-pay.",

        "Hi.",

        "Thanks for the call.",
        "What he's saying?",
        "I've, you know, I've always wondered about that, and everybody always raises the question.",
        "You know, it obviously costs a lot less to provide birth control than it does to pay for a pregnancy, and then the ensuing child.",
        "But obviously, the health insurance industry has a lot of actuaries.",

        "There is.",

        "The medical - most of the medical community disagrees with that.",
        "That's more of a belief-system issue.",
        "But those two - those morning-after pills would be included as part of this mandate, and that is a problem.",
        "I should also mention - we glossed over it for a moment - that within this mandate is an exemption for religious organizations that provide health insurance.",
        "They would be able to opt out of offering this contraceptive coverage if it violates their tenets.",
        "That has caused a bit of a backlash on the other side, from women's groups, who say, well, what about the people who work for those religious organizations who might - whose tenets it does not violate and who want the birth control?",

        "I mean, gosh, religious hospitals - Catholic hospitals, in particular - are the largest private providers of health care in the United States, the largest private providers to women, to the poor, to single women.",

        "And, you know, the word Catholic, in particular, it means universal.",
        "They really do believe in the equality of all humanity, and they've always thought that they're hiring and serving people of all faiths was an asset.",
        "And now the federal government is saying this is a liability.",
        "If you do this, if you hire and serve non-Catholics, you can't abide by your conscience.",
        "It really could have drafted a broader conscience exemption.",
        "We've had them around in the United States since the beginning of our nation, and this was a deliberate attempt.",

        "They don't wish to require, obviously, people who don't believe in this to have to offer it, but they want to be sure that people who do want to have it are able to get it."

        "As a clinician who works on the frontline dealing with the end result of the difficulty assessing birth control - namely providing abortion care - I can attest to the fact that this new policy will be welcome.",

        "You know what?",
        "I would just be so grateful if that person would send those studies to my attention at George Mason.",

        "When you have a preventive service, it's encouraging language.",
        "All the data I've ever seen shows that since the federal government - and state governments, too - have gotten into encouraging and normalizing the notion that, you know, unprotected sex makes babies.",
        "And you've seen a rise in the number of uncommitted sexual encounters, a rise in out-of-wedlock pregnancies, a rise in out-of-wedlock births, a rise in abortions, a rise in STDs to the point where one of every four girls has got one in their adolescence.",
        "It just seems to me we can all understand why people would think, logically, contraception will prevent a pregnancy.",
        "And at the level of an individual person ingesting it, it seems to make scientific sense.",

        "It's tricky.",
        "Very quickly, since the Smith decision in 1990 by the Supreme Court, a neutral law of general applicability, one that applies to everybody does not usually allow religious employers to make a guaranteed free exercise claim.",
        "This religious exemption was tested in a California Catholic Charities' case, and it didn't win over a free exercise claim.",
        "So they might try and I think there are some creative arguments that have been developed since 1990, but the federal government knew it was putting the religious employers in a position of choosing between serving the public and maintaining their integrity.",

        "And having listened to the conversation earlier, one of the things that we were so enthusiastic about was in general prevention has focus in health care reform in addition to broadening access.",

        "So you're paying it but this is not being called a co-pay because now your premium has gone up to include that.",
        "Well, actually, what will happen is that the cost will be spread more broadly, so I think the estimates from even the insurance themselves will be rather modest increase, certainly nothing like the 20 to $50 per month that some women are now paying, for example, to take advantage of a family planning.",
        "And our recommendation was that the broad array of FDA-approved medicines and devices be available.",
        "So I think the problem that you face as we know it's not just for the services we've recommended but for other preventive services.",
        "And that's why the Affordable Care Act change that was that preventive services, when there is a financial barrier to them, often means that they're not use.",
        "And, again, the benefit long-term, it's not on short-term, is to approve not just health but also to reduce cost.",
        "So I believe that the barrier is a real one.",
        "We have lots of evidence of women not - and we heard a caller who said that not taking advantage of services that might be available to them and what we call first-dollar coverage should increase the availability of the services to the woman working with her physician who chooses to utilize this."
