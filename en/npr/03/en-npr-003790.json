        "Good question.",
        "Do we know the answer?",
        "Well, certainly there's an enormous amount of data that the Department of Health and Human Services collects both through - well, everyone is moving to electronic medical records, that's one of the reasons to move to electronic - into electronic medical records is to be able to collect that data.",
        "And certainly, there are many surveys that are done every year.",
        "So there's an - a lot of data collection that's built into this law to find out, in fact, how well these things work.",
        "Do you have anything you'd like to add to that, Doctor?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think the tracking of any of these interventions is going to be important.",
        "We know what we know.",
        "But, for example, as I mentioned, if you avoid a problem now that, let's say, you find diabetes in a pregnant women which often means that she's a risk for diabetes beyond the pregnancy and you treat it and you avoid cardiovascular disease 20 years later, which we have evidence you would, that's a benefit that's hard to judge right now.",
        "But as we track issues over time, I think we have a full and better sense of not just whether this is improving health but the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.",
        "The topic no deductible, no co-pay birth control under the new health care form bill.",
        "We are talking with Julie Rovner, NPR health policy correspondent, and Doctor Linda Rosenstock, dean of the UCLA School of Public Health.",

        "There are, I believe, medical conditions that are helped by birth control pills.",
        "How do the new rules respond to that issue, Doctor?",
        "Well, our view would be that once these are on recommended on preventive service that it would likely be covered as well.",
        "The first-dollar coverage for these medications will largely go for avoiding unintended pregnancy.",
        "But as this listener has identified, there are medical reasons beyond unintended pregnancies that call for these interventions."

        "I also wanted to mention something else that hasn't been said.",
        "There's been a lot of talk about the unintended pregnancies, and we all know that they are the largest cause of abortions in this country, so that's an indirect benefit if we do some(ph) unintended pregnancies.",
        "I should - a symphony orchestra.",
        "But another reason to undertake family planning is to get optimal spacing of children.",
        "Lots of evidence coming that having children, space close beyond 18 months has better health effects for not just the mother but as well for the newborn.",

        "This restriction applies not just to the people working for churches, but to their children and family members.",

        "I'm 23 years old, need birth control for both sexual reasons and health-related reasons and cannot afford it.",
        "Unfortunately, I won't see the benefits of this law.",
        "Julie Rovner, what's your reaction to hearing that?",
        "Well, that, you know, I - there are many polls out there that show that 98 percent of American Catholic women have used birth control that the Catholic hierarchy does not approve of.",
        "So it's not - it is definitely an issue.",
        "And as we said earlier, that's sort of what the government is grappling here with these opt out provisions.",
        "They, you know, they don't wish to require the religious organizations to violate their belief in providing it, but they also don't want to - they want that, you know, women, like the author of this email who would like to - whose beliefs are not being violated in using it to be able to get it.",
        "So it is a difficult line to parse.",
        "Absolutely.",
