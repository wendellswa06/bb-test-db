        "Good morning, Renee.",
        "You know, according the World Bank, Mongolia is one of the hardest-hit countries in East Asia.",
        "But let's talk a little about Mongolia and its economy for the many of us who don't know that much about it.",
        "Well, Renee, it's about the size of Western Europe, but its population is just under three million people, and unofficial estimates put one in four people out of work.",
        "So to put that in context, that's similar to the situation in the U.S.",
        "at the height of the Great Depression.",
        "And in the capital city, Ulan Bator, figures from the labor market indicate that wages are down by 60 percent.",
        "And in the rural areas, which make up most of the country, herders are barely able to get by.",
        "To get a better understanding of why things are so bad in the countryside, I paid a visit to one Mongolia herder.",
        "Delantai Khatanbaatar and his seven-year-old son canter across the windswept Mongolian plain, rounding up their animals.",
        "Along with 40 percent of Mongolians, Khatanbaatar is a herder.",
        "With 250 sheep, 80 cashmere goats and 50 horses, he regards himself as middling-poor.",
        "Cashmere is his main source of income, and he had depended on prices staying high, driven up by the seemingly insatiable desire for the luxury wool in the West.",
        "But after the financial crisis hit, cashmere prices halved.",
        "And facing illness in the family, Khatanbaatar was in financial trouble.",
        "He's just taken out a $350 loan.",
        "(Through Translator) I wouldn't have to ask for a loan in normal circumstances.",
        "Normally, when raw cashmere sells at $28 a kilo, I can easily raise $700.",
        "But now it sells at half that.",
        "It's really affecting our everyday lives.",
        "On average, Mongolians in rural areas have taken out two loans per household, and many are struggling to pay them back.",
        "It's perhaps a sign of the times that Peter Morrow, the American CEO of one of the most popular banks, Khan Bank, is a household name across Mongolia, and particularly in Khatanbaatar's tent, in Rashaant, 160 miles from the capital, Ulan Bator."

        "The man himself, Peter Morrow, says his bank is doing all it can to help herders pay back their loans.",
        "But many are unable to do so right now.",
        "Well, you know, it's not entirely clear that this thing was an offer.",
        "It may well have just been a statement of where the White House stands, in which case that would have made Democrats happy.",
        "Because this proposal was very similar to his budget from months ago.",
        "It contains $1.6 trillion in new revenue, mostly through tax increases on the wealthy, $400 billion in cuts, some stimulus spending.",
        "The president even wants the power to raise the debt ceiling without getting congressional approval first.",
        "What do they want?",
        "What would actually move them to support a compromise?",
        "Well, what they say is that they want the president to come to them with an offer they like.",
        "They want more spending cuts.",
        "They want changes to entitlement programs, like Medicare and Medicaid, and they don't want at least tax rate increases on the wealthy.",

        "So, have they?",
        "Have the Republicans offered specifics in a counteroffer?",
        "Not really.",
        "You know, they say they want entitlement reforms, but when the speaker was asked about what reforms he wanted or what the timing would be, he basically said how about the House GOP budget?",
        "In some ways, it seems like both sides are waiting for the other guys to make the first concession.",
        "And this time in negotiations the president has an advantage.",
        "Because if everything expires, then he mostly gets what he wants and then he'd be in the position in January of coming to Congress asking them to lower taxes on most people, and that's a much easier sell.",
        "The intrepid Tamara Keith keeping tabs on Congress while combating a nasty cold.",
        "Tamara, thanks so much.",
        "Thanks for putting up with my voice."
