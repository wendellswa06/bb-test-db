        "And fights broke out on the fairgrounds, and the fights were between the kids themselves.",
        "But at some point, the fighting spread outside of the grounds of the fair - and at that point became a racial incident with black kids basically targeting and attacking and in some case, robbing predominantly white fairgoers.",

        "I can't explain it.",
        "Now - and since then, he denied it very strongly to newspapers around the world.",
        "And I spoke to him yesterday finally for about 40 minutes about this letter, and he confirmed that he'd written it and stood by what was in it.",
        "And was his wife - Joyce Hatto, the pianist herself - was she aware that this was going on?",
        "Well, this is why he says he's written the letter.",

        "But the thing which really got to him was some people were saying that she was in on it.",
        "She was part of a huge confidence trick.",
        "And he said no. In fact, he did it for her legacy, and he couldn't stand to think of her name being tarnished in that way.",
        "Yet there is a relatively modern quote of Joyce Hatto in which she's asked about her ability to, you know, do all these recordings in a single go -one take, as it were.",
        "And she says, yes.",
        "I do all my practicing at home.",

        "And William Barrington-Coupe seemed to suggest that first it was just a few passages here and there, and then slightly bigger, but the expert that you hired to look into these recordings seems to come to conclusion that every single one he has looked at has been tampered with.",

        "Yes, that's absolutely right.",

        "And by coincidence, he just noticed that a Hatto disk was the same as another.",
        "So we have it from various different fields of proof which corroborate each other.",
        "But, as far as we're concerned, as far as the music lovers are concerned, of course, the big question are A: did he did it to deliberately deceive the record-buying public.",
        "Well, he's now given an explanation that he did it for very emotional, very tragic reasons in many ways, which gives almost a melancholic, romantic, extra dimensions of this whole story and I would like to believe that.",
        "But what we also want to know is, well, will the real Joyce Hatto stand up, you know, which are her recordings.",
        "And a lot of us have spent a lot of money on these CDs, let's not forget.",
        "And I think in many ways, he owes us that.",
        "And there could be legal ramifications.",
        "As you suggest, there was fraud.",

        "It would only takes one listener to say, I bought this CD, it was sold to me under false pretenses, this is fraud.",
        "And, sadly, we also now know that -and it's unrelated in terms of the details of the case - but we know that Mr. Barrington-Coupe has been in prison before so he's not a stranger to these sort of things."
