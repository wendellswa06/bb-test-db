        "So the summer feels good and everybody's out, and the animals will be, you know, fed and sold in the market, and there will be cash coming in.",
        "But as soon as winter starts hitting, that's when you will see, I think, in my view, the full brunt of this crisis.",
        "The International Monetary Fund also says the chances of a near-term recovery in Mongolia are weaker than previously foreseen.",
        "But Khan Bank's Peter Morrow says Mongolia is in a unique position.",
        "But Mongolia is perhaps the only country in the world that has a fix for its economic problem, an immediate, available fix in the form of very large mining projects.",
        "One particular project, the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine, would bring investment roughly equivalent to the country's entire economy.",
        "But the deal has been tied up in parliament for the best part of a decade.",

        "Watching his wife ladling hot milk, he's worrying about the present.",
        "Lured in by low interest rates, the 59 year old took out a $700 bank loan to buy a motorcycle and a new tent, or ger for his son.",
        "But then came the financial crisis, and interest rates and his repayments went up.",
        "Meanwhile, commodity prices plummeted, and food prices rocketed, leaving his family of six struggling.",

        "I mean, not only have they got these immediately economic worries, but they're also facing a lot of long-term worries, as well.",
        "And the biggest one is really about the desertification of the grassland.",
        "Now the Mongolian government just did a survey, which they released, which found that seven percent of the grassland is already desert, and that one really big reason for this is the overgrazing by cashmere goats.",
        "They're really bad for the grasslands because they tear up the grass by its roots.",
        "And traditionally, Mongolia herders have flocks that were 30 percent goats, 70 percent sheep.",
        "But when cashmere prices started going up, driven by demand from Chinese buyers, herders though of changing the balance of their flocks, and that's worse for the environment.",
        "They might seem very far away to you, but those Chinese buyers are making low-cost cashmere sweaters of the type that you might buy in Wal-Mart and Costco.",
        "So every one of those sweaters in your closet may have contributed in a tiny way to the desertification of the Mongolian grasslands.",
        "And we'll be hearing from Louisa all this week.",

        "And we coupled it with coaching and counseling to help those businesses to be successful, grow their business and create jobs.",

        "So that kind of advice is the second piece that small businesses are lacking.",

        "She employs almost 20 people.",
        "She just got $150,000 investment from a venture capital company, 'cause they want to help her grow Voltage Coffee to something even bigger.",
