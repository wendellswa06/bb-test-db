        "The abrupt resignation of Porter Goss as head of the Central Intelligence Agency was a surprise yesterday.",
        "Mr. Goss had led the CIA for just under 20 months.",
        "He gave no reason for his departure.",
        "No successor has been named, but administration officials say that Air Force General Michael V.",

        "Was he pushed, or did he jump?",
        "What I hear is that he was pushed.",
        "Goss was unpopular to the point that it may have become clear he could no longer run the CIA.",
        "Under his tenure you saw dozens of very experienced CIA officers walking out, resigning early.",
        "And Goss' supporters said this is a much-needed shakeup, we need to see this change.",
        "But I think the hope was that there would be a shakeup and then that there would be a period of rebuilding, of strengthening the agency, and that rebuilding period never seems to have arrived.",
        "Instead, the resignations have continued.",
        "I was speaking with several people who have just recently left the agency who tell me morale is worse than ever, and in their view the CIA is probably weaker today than when Goss arrived back in 2004.",
        "Ned Helm says the amazing thing to him here is that the heads of government just sat down and hammered something out.",
        "I think it is perceived differently.",
        "I think most people are outraged about it, black and white.",
        "I think what happens, though, in the black community is that there becomes a sort of shared sense of shame and finger-pointing at young black youth - which to be honest, Milwaukee, like a lot of major cities, has a lot of black-on-black crime anyway.",
        "But yet when their trouble kind of spreads out to the white community, then it becomes a much more sensational story.",
        "So I understand that because there are a lot of white communities that have never seen this kind of violence before whereas in the black community, there are some black neighborhoods in Milwaukee that go through this kind of stuff all the time.",

        "Do you think the fair should become more diverse?",
        "Well, I think part of the problem in Milwaukee - and a lot of communities with these young black kids who act out - is because, I think, they really do find themselves in these unfamiliar situations.",
        "And it's like anything else.",
        "I mean, they are just as ignorant about white people as white people are about them, in some respects.",
