        "Well, there're four factors in my theory of gullibility.",
        "And my hope is - and so far, psychologists and certainly all the investors who've emailed me have - feel that this framework, which was in the Wall Street Journal piece last Saturday, helps to explain it.",
        "And there are four factors, and in any given individual or situation, it might be a little different, but I believe these explain, pretty much, the Madoff phenomenon.",
        "What factors are there?",
        "One is situations.",
        "What has been described by Robert Shiller as the feedback-loop theory of Ponzi schemes, as well as investment manias in general, is that when everybody you know is saying this is a great deal; it's tremendous pressure.",
        "It's sort of \"\"The Emperor's New Clothes\"\" phenomenon.",
        "In fact, I start off my book by talking about folktales, such as \"\"The Emperor's New Clothes,\"\" as sort of the archetype for gullibility.",
        "And cognition, very few people have the skills to see through something this complicated, and that certainly explains my - part of my trust.",
        "And then, I happen to be a somewhat trusting person and also somewhat impulsive, and that's not a good thing to be when you're talking about your lifesavings.",
        "And finally, emotion enters into it.",
        "Not necessarily greed; it could just be fear of losing money.",
        "And people who invested in the Madoff scheme - I don't think they were truly greedy.",
        "What they wanted was the safety and security, and that's sort of the irony here: by seeking something safe, they wound up losing everything.",
        "And I guess you can apply these four factors of gullibility not just to the Madoff scheme, but to other kinds of gullibility, other kinds of situations.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, I devote five pages in my book to financial gullibility and about another 200 pages to many other different kinds of stories about gullibility.",
        "And the theory, this four-factor theory, of gullibility applies to all these situations.",
        "In fact, what really got me interested in this topic, Ira, had to do with the problem of false confession to murder, particularly in young people and also in people with cognitive disabilities.",
        "My primary reputation as a scholar is really in the area of intellectual disabilities.",
        "And I got into this because of the case in 1982 in Connecticut involving Richard LaPointe, the man with the congenital brain malformation, who, in a very stressful interrogation, confessed to a murder that nobody - none of his friends, of which I consider myself one - believes he could have possibly done.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And you...",
        "And the situations involved are simply, when you're in an interrogation, they use extremely effective techniques - they have something called the Reed method, which can break down anyone.",
        "Anyone listening here could be broken down by that method.",
        "And the cognitive aspects of it, people - police officers pretend to be your friend, they want you to come in and help them solve the case, or they tell you that they want to help you, but in fact, that's not really what they have in mind.",
        "Very people - few people, including a very educated friend of mine, doesn't understand, you don't have to talk to the police.",
        "When they suspect you of a crime, you have the right to walk out of there.",
        "It doesn't matter what - whether they like that or not.",
        "Stephen Greenspan is emeritus professor of educational psychology at the University of Connecticut and author of \"\"Annals of Gullibility: Why We Get Duped and How to Avoid It.\"\" We're going to take a short break.",
        "And this is something you can believe to be true: We're going to come back after this break, I hope - if everything works out - and switch gears and talk about new advances in diabetes research.",
        "So, stay with us.",
        "We'll be right back.",
        "And then personality, people with cognitive impairments, including the elderly - to cover up their limitations, they tend to become very compliant and willing to participate.",
        "And finally, emotion enters in because there're few situations more terrifying than being interrogated for a murder.",
        "And also exhaustion; these interrogations typically start late at night, and they go for hours and sometimes for 12 or 20 hours.",
        "And we've known from research that when you're exhausted and sleep-deprived, you'll agree to anything, and you don't think very straight."

        "Yeah.",
        "But we can - can't we be gullible as a society, too?",
        "As a mass of people and we think something is true or not, like you said, \"\"The Emperor's New Clothes\"\"?",
        "I mean, there are some people who say we're gullible to believe that $700 billion is going to solve this financial crisis.",
        "Possibly, but I mean, here are two good examples: Mark Twain wrote a novel called \"\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\"\" about the gullibility of a whole town that believed that an African-American child was white.",
        "And of course, he was the great genius of gullibility in his fiction, all of his books, certainly, Mark Twain - certainly \"\"Tom Sawyer,\"\" with the fence-painting scene, certainly \"\"Huckleberry Finn,\"\" which is all about gullibility.",
        "And then of course, look at the political situation in this country.",
        "After the second victory of George W.",
        "Bush, a huge headline in London's Daily Mirror said, how can 92 million people - whatever the number was - be so dumb?",
        "A lot of people consider the belief in weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is a form of mass gullibility.",

        "Well, actually, it was a famous philosopher - I think it was Epictetus who said, if you use clear thinking, you won't be hoodwinked.",
        "I mean, children are more gullible than adults.",
        "That's the reason we don't allow them, as a society or as a legal system, to marry or to sign contracts or to be interrogated, for that matter.",
        "And Richard Dawkins, in fact, says that gullibility is something that's built in through evolution, because if there's a gullible gene or a meme, you're less likely to be run over or touch a hot stove because you tend to listen to your parents when they tell you not to do these things.",
        "The problem is, where's the turn off system?",
        "And in fact, there are some people who argue, such as Stuart Vyse and others - he's a professor at Connecticut College - who would argue that a lot of the gullibility of adults is a function of being conditioned through these memes, which Dawkins calls toxic memes, rather than - a meme is a unit of information that's imparted socially, and that's how we learn to be competent in society.",

        "Because I heard you talking, and your didn't discuss the financial situation that you fell for and lost your - some of your retirement savings.",
        "Thanks for asking that, Maya.",
        "Actually, my situation is even more complicated than just investing with Madoff, because I don't remember even being told - Madoff's name even being mentioned when I invested.",
        "In fact, when I got a call from my financial adviser saying - telling me that this Ponzi scheme had happened, and he mentioned Bernie Madoff.",
        "I said, who is Bernie Madoff, and what does he have to do with me?",
        "I was invested in one of the 15 feeder funds.",
        "Mine is the Rye Fund, which is part of the Tremont, Oppenheimer, MassMutual, so it's a very reputable fund.",
        "And that's another situational aspect that kind of sucked me in, because I was dealing with, you know, extraordinarily reputable companies, and they were getting management fees.",

        "He's sort of the father of astrophysics, wrote the initial book on astrophysics.",
        "He went to a demonstration by a spiritualist from New York and - named Slade - and he did all these amazing things, like making a rope tie and untie itself and a tablet with writing appearing, and he was so persuaded by this that he went out and wrote a book on spiritualism as involving a fourth dimension that only certain sensitive people can tap into.",
        "And what Hyman's explanation is that great scientists, such as this one, are intuitive; they're not rational.",
        "They're - all the great breakthroughs occur through intuition.",
        "The problem is, when you're intuitive and you move into a field you don't know anything about, such as spiritualism, you can make a fool of yourself.",
        "And that's, in fact, what happened with the cold-fusion hoax, which - not hoax, but fiasco - of a few years ago, where two chemists at University of Utah - Pons and Fleischman - decided they had solved the problem of fusion by doing an experiment at room temperature.",
