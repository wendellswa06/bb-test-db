        "Is that accurate?",
        "Sec.",
        "Gen.",
        "GAHONGAYIRE: Well, that might be part of the reason.",
        "But the real important reason we attribute to this, is the kind of governance policy we are implementing in this country, which means that we have to include all sectors of society.",
        "And (unintelligible) women.",
        "And in every kind of decision-making level we have to scrutinize and check that the women are very involved and they participate.",
        "So that leads and governs almost everybody and every sector.",
        "You're actually recording the numbers in parliament.",
        "But if you look at the judiciary itself, if you look at the women in cabinet, recently we just had local government elections.",
        "And we have more than 40 percent women who are elected as local government leaders.",
        "So this is a broad policy.",
        "The reason, you know, we've both suffered very much from the poor governance of this country, which led to genocide.",
        "And we are making lots of efforts to check that, to correct that.",
        "So it's actually kind of a broader issue than usually is analyzed by some people who analyze the why is women involved so much in decision making in this country.",
        "They are very careful about participation.",
        "Madam Secretary, why did you want to be in public life?",
        "I don't know if I actually wanted, but I just had to get moved.",
        "We all had to get involved because this was the reality in this country.",

        "The situation dictated that lots of things had to change, lots of, the future had to be forged because we had almost lost everything, life and everything else.",
        "And this very strong feeling became a mission to make things change and you're going to realize that from most of the population.",
        "And the elite population is very much involved; actually maybe not only the elite, but everyone else.",
        "So we want to see different things happen to our country and very glad to note that it's happening.",
        "Madam Secretary, if I may, it was my understanding that you had been living abroad, in Belgium.",
        "Isn't that correct?",
        "No, I was born and grew up in Uganda just next to Rwanda as a refugee.",

        "We had to come back to Rwanda.",

        "Being born as refugees is not acceptable at all.",
        "So we had to come to this country.",
        "But also, this part of this government's policy (unintelligible) which some of us experienced.",
        "It's the general situation that was happening in our country where there was a lot of oppression, lots of exclusion.",
        "The women were highly marginalized.",
        "And when this genocide happened, which was all a result of that kind of government, there was, women were very much affected and are still bearing the burden of the effects of the genocide.",
        "So when I say that we've got to work very hard and we are all determined to make a difference in this country and see that our children don't go through what we've been through ourselves, that's kind of a determination from those who are refugees and from those who are in this country and also who, you know, experienced terrible horrors that happened."

        "Not only that, but a lot of women who were in America and in Europe went back to Somalia to train women in the grass roots.",

        "And when they're sending money back or they're sending support back in different ways, it's very well received.",

        "In Somalia many of those women were influenced by women in Kenya.",
        "So they weren't necessarily Somali by birth, but these Somali women were looking at what was happening in Kenya and they were saying, A-ha, they're advocating for change in their government.",
        "They're protesting constitutional laws that limit their ability to own land, to have sentences for rape, to raise the age of child marriages.",

        "I mean this was not going to happen again.",
        "There was chaos in the country, there was war, and women kind of united.",
        "You know, the problem in Somalia is a tribal one, and it really breaks the country into sects and into, you know, people supporting different warlords.",

        "Well, I tend to believe that women are human beings like everybody else.",

        "In most cases, actually, you realize that they don't participate so actively, they are very much on the side.",
        "But being on the side also gives opportunity for them being a little more objective than the people who are directly involved.",
        "For instance, if we take that case of Somalia, I think the women really may be able to play a very important role in bringing these people together.",
        "We - I can share maybe the experience of Rwanda because sometimes there are groupings and (unintelligible) initiatives because we speak the same language, we share lots of culture, what you've heard about Hutus and Tutsis.",
        "But the women here have played a very big role in merging these communities together.",
        "Then after, there was the genocide where one of the grouping was - had planned to exterminate the other.",
        "So it's - the women have played a very big role in reconciliation, in bringing back the different groups together.",
        "And I think that Somalia can very much speak on some of these experiences, the Somalia women can play a very good role.",
        "Madam Secretary, this is - I'm going to go to another caller.",
        "But before I do, Jasmine's point, which was I think - you can hear her enthusiasm and her sense of pride in the country and her excitement about the future, but I've often wondered, do you, as a female leader, sometimes feel the weight of outsized expectation?",
        "Which is to say that people assume that, not only that you'll be competent, but that you will be somehow superhuman, that you will have - you'll be a better human being than, say, a male leader would be, that you would be, you know, that - do you see what I'm saying?",
        "That people are so excited, that perhaps they have real expectations of you and your ability to do certain things and to be better, that create an additional burden for you.",
        "And I wonder if you ever feel that way.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah, completely.",
        "That's the exact reality of what women who are in leadership feel because the society's expectations of the women are just an ideal, you know, person who's supposed not to do the wrong, who's supposed to be objective, who's supposed to be fair, who's supposed - and in some cases, you know, there might be some influences on the women as well."
