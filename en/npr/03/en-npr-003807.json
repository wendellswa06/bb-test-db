        "So I keep on picking some examples where there might have been some women who participated in the genocide, that's just an example.",

        "These society's expectations are there, they keep on pushing us; they put us at a very good position.",
        "I think I don't mind them, I like them pushing us towards that so that there can be someone in our society who can really be fair and just and that kind of thing.",

        "In Uganda, women have been making strides as well with several female ministers and a vice president.",

        "Yes, they do.",
        "In fact, Uganda I believe was among the first countries to begin pushing so-called affirmative action, trying to put more women in positions of power and high ranking political offices and so forth.",
        "The administration of President Yoweri Museveni received a lot of credit early on for doing that.",
        "And one of the ways, one of the central ways was by appointing the first woman vice president in Africa, who is, I should point out, no longer the vice president.",

        "I think that African women are making great strides right now and I'm very pleased by that and it's just common sense that no country can make any kind of progress if it excludes almost half of your population from participating.",
        "(Soundbite of song New York State of Mind, by Nas)",
        "Well, that depends on who you ask.",
        "Ostensibly, she went for her studies in the U.S.",
        "But actually, interestingly, I think a lot of this had to do with her private life.",
        "She had a very messy divorce and she actually went public with the fact that she was being physically abused in her marriage which became a very interesting thing publicly for her as a woman in such a high position because she sort of became an advocate for measures that would frame the issue of domestic violence, which is a very big concern to a lot of women's activists in Africa heretofore.",
        "And I think in the end her private life just became too messy, even though interestingly she was advocating for a very important cause.",
        "Interesting, that's interesting.",
        "Hold on, let's go to a caller in Denver, Colorado, and Bruhani(ph).",
        "Bruhani, what's on your mind?",
        "Well, I'm trying to interject on this issue.",
        "I'm a man.",
        "I'm from Africa, a refugee.",
        "Been here in this country, in the United States, for about 20 years.",
        "I can see the frustration and I understand, in my experience when I was back in Africa, women never had this kind of opportunity.",
        "But seeing in Rwanda, Uganda, Somalia, all over, the influence, it's not only for a woman's freedom, but it's men's freedom also.",
        "We have to consider it that without woman's freedom you cannot consider it a democratic country or a free country.",
        "So everyone have this experience that woman has been degraded and humiliated and unfairly treated in African nations.",
        "Bruhani, forgive me for asking.",
        "Did you feel this way before you came here?",
        "Oh yeah, I know this.",
        "I know, but I didn't feel as much as I'm aware right now, because the human right, the equal treatment in the United States or all over the world, that, you know, I'm more educated now and more understandable how a nation can grow with equal treatment.",
        "Otherwise we just, we had, as everyone knows on the panel, that Africa has been without hope for so long, tribal war or nation against nation or civil war, and so much, so many people have been lost.",
        "And the economy, instead of forward, we've been going backward."

        "So I think this is a good beginning and I'm very hopeful; it makes me feel with emotion, feel crying to hear the (unintelligible) from recently Liberia and hopefully that would interject to other countries, and we can see ourself in different situation and different roles, maybe down ten, 15 years from now.",
        "Bruhani, thank you so much for calling.",
        "No problem.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "That must be very heartening to all of you participating in this conversation, to hear a man call to say that this, this development brings him hope.",
        "But I did want to use his call as a springboard to ask Madam Secretary, I'll start with you and I'd like to hear from the other guests as well, is this gentleman's point of view a typical one, to the degree that you feel comfortable sort of analyzing public opinion?",
        "I'm interested in whether, like the earlier caller, Jasmine, said, that sometimes these women face a lot of resistance from the traditional leadership in asserting their leadership; people just feel it's just inappropriate.",
        "And so Madam Secretary I'd like to ask you, have you felt that way as a woman leader, that there are some people who just object to your position in the government on traditional, cultural grounds, they just think it's just not appropriate, and is that a common attitude?",
        "Sec.",
        "Gen.",
        "GAHONGAYIRE: Yeah, that, that attitude is going to be with us for quite some time, but we need to look at it and the way it's changing also and understand where we are coming from and be realistic about it, because these are attitudes that have been with us for quite a long time.",
        "So there is a lot of change here among the leadership, and you know that influences the majority of the population But there's also still kind of a resistance, especially at local, at grassroots level; it's still completely new.",
        "It's very new and some women are really having problems, especially within their families, within their communities.",
        "It's still new because some of them have to actually play, maybe, a smaller role in the family.",
        "The family role kind of gets shaken because you're spending a lot of time outside of your family, more than was expected, more than was happening.",
        "That's causing some bit of change and really you feel it.",
        "You still feel it a lot.",
        "But we also notice a lot of support among the women, the men colleagues at national level and within the educational sectors.",
        "There's still that kind of reality.",
        "Though we have some support, like the gentlemen we just heard from, but we also have lots of resistance where, even when we changed the laws to implement them we still have problems, you know, getting them really into practice.",
        "And what about women, do some women, are women reluctant to see women in leadership roles or are they reluctant to pursue leadership for some of these same reasons?",
        "Has it been difficult to recruit women to participate in positions in government?"

        "But in a short while what they see the benefits will be, we continue creating this awareness and being close to them, I think is going to be a very positive and eventually most of them get involved and we will create that awareness.",

        "But basically they do behave just like men.",
        "Because the way I explain it is this: I think that being from the same generation, having the same mindset, they tend to just behave as badly as men in similar position."

        "Yeah, in all those terms.",
        "In terms of corruption, in terms of being ineffective leaders, in terms of not really caring about people, but caring more about staying in power and all of that.",
        "And I think it has more to do with the way, the kind of education they receive, the way they grew up, they are basically the same generation, so it's not very, it doesn't surprise me that they just behave the same as men.",
        "Okay, thank you...",

        "Sure, I think that's a really interesting point, and his perception that it's a generational one is accurate.",
        "I also think that it's a class issue; I mean if you've got people coming from an elite background, this is what they're used to.",
        "But, you know, the other side of that is that there are women out there making some big moves against issues like corruption; the Nigerian finance minister, which is a woman, has been really attacking this, and she's going after everyone.",
        "I mean it's not just men, it's women too.",
        "And really, if you look at Rwanda, they're trying in a very gentle, very systematic and thorough way to address the issue of how do we train women to be leaders?",
        "How do we train them to maybe bring some of their female qualities to being a leader, but also how do we get them to overcome this notion that they have to behave as men or that they can be corrupt if they want to be?",
        "And what they're doing is, they're establishing an understanding of gender development.",
        "And this is the thing I've found most fascinating in Rwanda, is that when talk about gender equity, they're not just talking about women and marginalizing men; they want men in the conversation too.",
        "So it's a very broad based approach, and I saw it trickling down.",
        "I mean I interviewed one young man who was a war orphan living on the outskirts of Kigali with sort of a tribe of war orphans; they had been forgotten there for a decade, and this local mayor came, she held a sort of town hall meeting in a house, you know, with no electricity, no floor, and she said I want to hear about your concerns.",
        "And she listened to everyone and the women and the men in that room listened to her and they treated her not as a woman, but as a leader."
