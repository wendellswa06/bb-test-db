        "Does it, or are these just sort of another group of elites that are in essence maintaining the same kind of structures and methods of decision-making as before?",
        "I think that the caller raises a good point, and you, the question was a good one.",
        "The question that a lot of people ask here, that I hear, is now that, it's wonderful that more women are being put into leadership positions and that people are recognizing that more women need to be NP's, need to be in high political offices, but its not enough to just have women at the top.",
        "The real question is how much of it translates into real social change?",
        "Not only for women's issues but for, you know, all sorts of things, and how much of it is just window dressing for donors or whoever else is giving out the points here?",
