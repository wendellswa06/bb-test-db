        "One issue they could not agree on.",
        "Many countries had made pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but the U.S.",
        "wanted these pledges in writing as part of the agreement.",
        "And President Obama said there had to be a way to know whether countries were living up to those commitments.",
        "Without such accountability, any agreement would be empty words on a page.",

        "But Brazil did not want to come if India was not coming and the Chinese staff were at the airport apparently ready to leave.",
        "It's unclear if this was a negotiating strategy, but the leaders of the five countries eventually sat down and talked, and they began to work out an agreement.",
        "With a larger group of countries, they produced a three-page document.",
        "How did they resolve that central issue of how to verify countries' pledges?",
        "This came down to one sentence in the document.",
        "In the hallways here, I ran into Ned Helm, president of the Center for Clean Air Policy, who has followed these negotiations for years.",
        "And this is what they got fixed in the final deal.",

        "All right.",

        "And I thought that Romney had opened a big door for the president to walk through by, in a sense, having even fewer specifics than President Obama had.",
        "And they, you know, you sometimes wondered if the Obama campaign thinks it's on a good track to win and just didn't want to mess things up by being more specific.",
        "I, too, was looking for somewhat more specificity.",
        "One specific thing, however, that was interesting is he mentioned climate change.",
        "That issue's been dead since 2010.",
        "I thought that was the one striking courageous moment or one of the striking and actually courageous moments in the speech.",
        "And obviously, the issue that people are talking about far more than climate change are the jobs numbers, at least today.",
        "96,000 jobs created in the most recent jobs report.",
        "And while the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent, that's largely because people gave up looking for work.",

        "You know, in partial defense of the speech, actually one of the biggest sections of the speech was actually on education and training.",
        "But I think one of the things that is striking is how Bill Clinton, the night before, was far more specific on many of these matters, both explaining why the economy isn't better but that Obama still kept us from falling into a disaster and suggesting that Obama's way forward is more promising.",
        "Nonetheless, I think it's almost as if when Obama gave this speech, he expected the job numbers today, right after his speech, to be disappointing.",
        "That may explain some of the humility in the speech.",
        "And it was almost a bit of Churchill - all I promise you is blood, sweat and tears - because he didn't say everything's going to be easy in this speech."
