        "What can I do with your fab lab?",
        "That's the real surprise.",
        "The fab labs are the analog of the minicomputers in the history of the PC, and so I thought they were quick hacks, but for about $20,000 now, you can create modern technology.",
        "So it's my favorite kind of prediction about the future.",

        "Sure, Clinton wasn't as new on the scene as Obama, but even Ronald Reagan running for re-election at age 73 managed to run as the candidate of change.",
        "And, says Mellman, Clinton was also out-organized by Obama.",
        "After a disappointing third place finish in Iowa, she bounced back in New Hampshire but couldn't do more than tie Obama on Super Tuesday, when he focused his efforts on smaller, mostly red states, states that she for some reason ignored.",
        "The Clinton campaign acted as if they didn't know the rules, acted as if only large states counted.",
        "And the truth is they came out fairly even in delegates out of the large states and allowed themselves to get creamed in smaller states, and that's really where Obama built up his delegate lead.",
        "The Clinton camp made another false assumption - they thought the race would be wrapped up by February 5th.",
        "Oh, we all did.",
        "You know, we all did.",
        "Pollster Stan Greenberg worked for Bill Clinton in 1992.",
        "He says the Hillary Clinton team was tough and experienced but not flexible.",
        "They were not willing to move to a second plan - plan B - until after they were out of money and after they were deep in a hole on, you know, elected delegates.",
        "Plan B, which worked for Clinton in the later primaries like Ohio and Pennsylvania, was full-throated populism.",
        "Clinton became a tenacious, gritty fighter for the crowds of working-class voters who became her base of support."

        "I don't think it was until really when it was almost too late to reverse the outcome that she found her own voice - which was as a tribune for hard-working people and blue-collar voters, which she's done quite effectively.",
        "But it was very late in the game.",
        "And, says Carrick, there was another quirk of fate that hurt Clinton: Michigan and Florida, two huge states, took themselves off the playing field by breaking the rules instead of remaining on the calendar as originally scheduled in mid-February.",
        "Once again, calendar is destiny in primary politics, and the Michigan decision to try to go early was a disaster for her.",
        "The Florida decision was a disaster for her.",
        "It would have been much better if they had stayed inside the calendar, where they would have really helped her.",
        "But to Hillary Clinton supporter Bob Kerrey, who actually ran for president in 1992 and lost the nomination to Bill Clinton, all that pales in comparison to a much bigger, much simpler reason for Hillary's troubles.",
        "She's running against a phenomenal candidate, a man who's, I would say, a better candidate than anything her husband faced in '92 or '96.",
        "I'm not sure Bill Clinton could have beaten Barack Obama.",
        "Every mistake that she made, if she had not been running against Barack Obama, wouldn't even be a footnote.",
        "They're exaggerated.",
        "They're magnified because he was out-raising her.",
        "Because he was drawing enormous crowds.",
        "Because he kept getting better.",
        "And now, Obama is less than 70 delegates away from the nomination and Clinton is left making hopeful declarations like this one...",
        "I'm going to keep making our case until we have a nominee, whoever she may be."

        "Indeed.",
        "It's not necessarily different in the sense that it rules the others out.",
        "But what struck us as really rather important is the way in which the monument changes its character when they bring in about 80 stones from the west of Wales.",
        "They're not the ones that you see when you first look at the site because those are quite local stones - they're very large stones.",
