        "- and then you're talking about the bluestones arriving, I don't know, 1,200 years after that?",
        "Yeah, more or less.",
        "The first monument at Stonehenge is just a earthwork, it's just a circular enclosure.",
        "And there's probably some timber structures and things in it.",
        "But at that time it was really just a bog-standard kind of monument.",
        "We've got lots of those sort of things scattered across the British Isles.",
        "And then at around about 2600 B.C.",
        "they bring in these bluestones from Wales and it's at that point that the monument really takes off into the sort of structure that we see today.",
        "What do the bluestones mean, do you think, in your theory?",
        "Yeah, well, the bluestones must be the power behind this place.",
        "The word bluestone just refers to a whole series of different kinds of rock, particularly some dolerites, some spotted dolerites, some tuffs, all sorts of things.",
        "But they all come from one mountain.",
        "And what's rather important - and this is where our theory begins to build - is that this mountain has running off it sacred springs.",
        "Springs which are believed to be holy wells or healing wells where people go in order to cure ailments.",
        "Now, as it turns out there is medieval traditions associated with Stonehenge that these bluestones were regarded as healing stones back in medieval times."

        "And then the second thing is we want to look at the history of those stones to see how they were treated, how they were used.",

        "How were they treated?",
