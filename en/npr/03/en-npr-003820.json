        "What is the ultimate kind of fab lab that you're aiming for?",

        "You have an amazing molecular machine, the ribosome, that's a computer that builds the proteins in your body.",
        "And it really computes--everybody knows we've had a digital revolution, but few people know what it means.",
        "The heart of it are threshold theorems--they're called the Shannon proof for communication and van Neumannn proof for computing--that show how you can do perfect things with imperfect parts.",
        "And this little molecular machine in your body does that exactly like the computers, but its output is a thing.",
        "And so what we're moving towards is molecular fabricators that are little molecular computers where the output isn't numbers but it's things, but just like the transition from telephones to the Internet, it makes perfect things from imperfect parts.",

        "We just don't need to keep fighting over it.",
