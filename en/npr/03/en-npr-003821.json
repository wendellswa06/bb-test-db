        "Hi.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Yeah, I was just--I thought it was interesting that with this nanotechnology and desktop fabrication that people will be able to essentially be their own nutty professor and make--you know, the sky's the limit, just according to their imagination, and in a James Bond sense, you know, people can be their own, you know, Q, so to speak, making their own little customized, personalized gadgets, both for fun but also for some real-world applications as well.",

        "When I get it to my satisfaction, I can send it by the Internet to the company.",
        "They manufacture the boards, either just a one-on-one type thing or they'll manufacture as many as they want.",
        "And within a week or so, I have it.",
        "And it's just absolutely remarkable technology.",

        "Sure.",
        "So the transition to fab labs then is process technology.",
        "So in the field you can make the board without chemical waste in an hour instead of a week.",
        "And what's really important about that, even more than the cost, is turn times so you can do this in a remote village without a supply chain to reduce the threshold for inventions.",
        "Well, you'll have to go out and get one now.",
        "1 (800)...",
        "And in fact I should mention...",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "...in the links on the Web site, all the specs of hardware and software are freely available.",
        "I invite people to do just that.",
        "But there's got to be a limit to the complexity of things.",
        "How many parts can you send in the kit, you know?",
        "There's got to be a limit to what--maybe you can build a simple radio, but not some sort of complex satellite you're going to launch, something like that.",
        "We've been surprised by the foundry.",
        "Again I should mention the fab labs were done with NSF support as a little side project.",
        "I didn't wake up and think of this.",
        "And they just got pulled around the world.",
        "But in developing countries, people are working on projects like steam turbines for solar energy conversion and rural antennas and radios for Internet connectivity and instrumentation for agriculture and health care, really solving substantial problems.",
        "So I'd say the catch isn't complexity as much as right now to do this in the field, there's small high-tech consumables.",
        "The tiny microcontrollers are precision subtractive tools.",
        "But even so, a few hundred dollars in a drawer of those is a year's supply in a remote village.",
        "Right.",
        "Years from now we'll print them, but you just need a small set of high-tech consumables, and then the rest are locally available materials."

        "Sure.",
        "So the fab labs emerged as a kind of a market research.",
        "Having all the big machines, this is what emerged as what's most useful.",
        "So again, a powerful but small laser cuts in 2-D that lets you snap together complex 3-D shapes.",
        "And that's faster and cheaper than building directly in 3-D.",
        "A thing that makes lettering on signs which you can make the antennas and the flexible parts, a very little three-dimensional milling machine that works down to microns, and then tools to use tiny high-performance what are called surface-mount electronic components with very fast little computer chips.",
        "Now I imagine one of the interesting parts about this might be the ability to swap designs with other fab lab people.",
        "Yes.",
        "That goes much further than I would've expected.",
        "When we set these up, there's a sequence we see that just starts with--and by the way, these are in community centers, non-traditional settings where just people hang out.",
        "It starts from just empowerment, a joy of `I can do it.",
        "It turns on to hands-on technical education, that sort of just-in-time project phase.",
        "From there, there's real problem solving, then businesses are getting created, small-scale high-tech businesses.",
        "Right.",
        "But most interestingly for me is invention itself, that the labs work on and share projects and really invent--more knowledge, I'd say on balance, is coming back to MIT than going into the field from MIT.",
        "Right.",
        "So you can start to look at the other five and a half billion or so brains on the planet not as potential consumers but as potential creators.",
        "At what point can you start to do genetic engineering, you know, on a fab lab?",

        "I think the more interesting connection is where the research is headed is recognizing that in many ways the secret of life is that it computes to build, that it's an information-processing machine at the molecular scale.",

        "And in fact, I had thought 20 years from now we'll swap out the fab labs and plug this in.",
        "Right.",
        "But just day by day, the labs themselves are changing and they're morphing into that place 20 years from now, as we get closer to fab labs that can make fab labs.",

        "It's al...",

        "If you look at the transition from a telephone to the Internet or a differential analyzer to a Pentium, what it brings is complexity, the ability to make enormous complex things.",
        "But state-of-the-art chip fab or building an airplane still uses very old-fashioned techniques that would be recognized by a village artisan.",

        "Your guest is right in that the cost and affordability of these devices, these 3-D printing devices, is dropping really rapidly.",
        "You can pick up a desktop 3-D printer for about 1,500 or $2,000 now.",
        "The problem doesn't come in the affordability of the devices; the problem comes in the complexity it takes to design objects for production on these devices.",
        "And it's a very technical and very challenging task to do that.",
        "You have to be very proficient in 3-D software.",
        "You have to know a lot about how the actual individual device works.",
        "And that's not the kind of thing that is easily transferable to a village setting.",
        "Even in a very high-tech setting like San Francisco or any part of the modern developed world, it's not the kind of thing that the majority of people can do.",
        "And, you know, that's the reason why there's specialists in that field of product design that deal with that.",
        "So I'm very dubious about the concept of easily transferring this technology to an untrained or village setting.",
        "It just doesn't seem appropriate.",
        "I don't understand.",
        "Neil?",
        "So I believed everything you said until the world taught me that that wasn't right.",
        "To get the labs in the field, we had to rewrite a lot of the engineering software to make it integrate with all these tools.",
        "Once we did that and we found this tremendous demand, what we saw was in between `you have to learn everything and do everything' and `you do nothing and someone else does it,' there's this rich space in between.",

        "So we have eight-year-old Ghanaian girls on their first day building circuits, programming microcontrollers, designing parts.",
        "And they don't know quite what they're doing or how they're doing, but they do it.",
        "And there's things they learn to do in days, weeks, months and years.",
        "And a good model for that is if you look at the evolution of digital audio or software, it used to be proprietary.",
        "There was this spike of open-source, freely available, and Napster meant everybody could do everything, and it settled down to this continuum of you did down-line designs remotely, you customize with scripts.",
        "People design locally simple things; larger groups collaborated on bigger things.",
        "In between everything and nothing, it opens up this very rich space in between.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Here we go.",
        "But I have to say, I've been shocked.",
        "We used to put kiddie stuff in the field, and we found the kiddies need the grown-up stuff.",
