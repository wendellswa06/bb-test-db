        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Spencer, are you there?",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "Yes, go ahead.",
        "Well, I have a question concerning his comments about these being similar to the \"\"Star Trek\"\" replicators.",
        "Yeah.",
        "If I understand correctly, the theory behind the \"\"Star Trek\"\" replicator, I guess, was that they convert energy to matter.",
        "And I was wondering if that was the case with these fab labs.",
        "Well, he hasn't said they've gotten to that point yet where they can do the \"\"Star Trek\"\" replicator, but that would be something down the road, right?",
        "But it's a fair question.",
        "To be clear, we're using digital fabrication in two senses in this conversation.",
        "There's a casual one, which is computers controlling tools and you can share files and work precisely.",
        "And that's where we are today.",
        "And then the research state coming pretty quickly is the computers are tools where fundamentally at a molecular scale you compute to build.",
        "And so the \"\"Star Trek\"\" replicator--it didn't quite convert energy.",
        "The idea of that is you start with subatomic particles to make atomic particles to make molecules.",
        "And that's a nice idea.",
        "What's wrong with that is the energy scales to do that, you need gigaelectron volt particle accelerators.",
        "So it's likely the \"\"Star Trek\"\" replicator in your home will have a feed stock of things that work sort of like that, but that are engineered materials, but that come together like the molecular materials.",
        "That's the kind of sweet spot emerging from the research."

        "So you'll basically feed your replicator, you know, the raw material--metal, plastic, blah, blah, blah--and...",
        "Not--no, crucially it--you have feed stocks in your house now: electricity, water, things like that.",
        "Oh.",
        "These feed stocks will be conductors, insulators, semiconductors, but the key insight--and it comes back to things like the role of amino acids in your body that are like little molecular LEGOs--is these aren't continuous materials; they're digitally structured.",
        "The materials can contain the code for their own construction and also, crucially, their deconstruction.",
        "Trash itself is an analog concept.",
        "Trash just means the material doesn't have the information internal to disassemble it.",
        "Once you build digitally, like biology, you can unbuild.",
        "So crucially, these are microscopically structured materials, not goo, in just the same way the body does it.",
        "Talking about the fab lab this hour on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News with Neil Gershenfeld, author of \"\"FAB: The Coming Revolution on Your Desktop--From Personal Computers to Personal Fabrication.\"\" That's out in Basic Books.",

        "You must have students lining up to get in to work on this kind of stuff.",
        "Oh, it breaks my heart.",
        "In this class, this How to Make Anything class...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...we can fit maybe 10 people and then, you know, hundreds show up saying, `All my life I've been waiting for this.",

        "So either there's something wrong with this class or everything else, and I'm beginning to wonder a little bit about everything else.",
        "It breaks my heart that there's such a mismatch between the demand.",
        "And again, I didn't think of all of this and push this off.",
        "I couldn't wake up in Cambridge, Mass., and decide rural India needs precision fab.",
        "But everywhere we set up this lab, there's just this very deep thing they could touch.",
        "They think--you know, we express ourselves and the means of expression have kind of gotten funneled down.",
        "In high school, I wanted to go to a trade school to learn to weld and fix cars, and I was told you had to go to sit in classrooms, and it seemed kind of punitive.",
        "Right.",
        "And all the way back in the Renaissance, the notion of literacy emerged as mastery of the means of expression, the trivium and the quadrivium.",
        "And there's this great notion of the illiberal arts.",
        "Making stuff was thrown out as commercial.",
        "And so technology is something done to us and it's reasonable to be anti-technical.",
        "But once you let people get control so that breaking down the barrier between scientific consumers and creators so you can create technology, instead of it being an oppressive thing, then to you it becomes a liberating kind of expression, that just touches something very deep.",
        "So again, we're racing to keep up with that.",
        "That's why the specs are freely available and caller--encourage your listeners to do this.",
        "You don't need me to do this.",
        "And...",
        "You can just assemble your own, assemble your own fab lab.",
        "...What - is there some message you think people would get from coming here?",
        "The specs are online.",
        "There's this growing community of these foundations sharing designs and files, trying to wean this off of us.",
        "So Caltech doesn't have to try to steal it; they can just make their own from the specs.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And you say it costs about 25, $20,000 to get the parts together?"

        "Today the fab labs are maybe 20 or 25 K in capital equipment, 5 K in consumables.",
        "And crucial is that gets you go the scale where you can do both form and function--structure, logic, sensing, actuation and display in this sort of integrated suite.",
        "That wasn't meant to be affordable.",
        "Again, it was a little outreach project with the National Science Foundation.",
        "Right.",
        "But what we found, if you look at the scale of school budgets and business budgets and aid budgets, all over the world we're finding, even though that's not meant to be affordable, it is indeed affordable to work groups.",
        "So long before it gets down to a thousand-dollar thing--and in fact I have students looking at how you put one in your pocket--it's about 20 or 25 K right now.",
        "Well, I think people are going to go to your site and take a look.",
        "I have about 30 seconds left.",
        "If you could expand it and go to your next step, what is your next step to develop this idea?",
        "Yeah, I'd say the next step is not a herculean leap to the \"\"Star Trek\"\" replicator, but we want fab labs to make fab labs, among other reasons, 'cause we have so much trouble with international customs.",
        "So we want to be able to send fab labs electronically and then bootstrap them locally.",
        "And it looks like you can do that, 'cause there's a subset of high-tech parts you make remotely, and the rest you really can do locally.",
        "So in the next year or so, I hope we'll have, in that sense, self-reproducing fab labs getting closer and closer to the replicator.",
        "So you say it's hard for people abroad to get the parts themselves?",
        "No, there's just--there's a small set of very high-tech parts, and then the rest indeed is locally available.",
        "One of the things this played into is in this whole notion of sort of top-down vs. bottom-up aid, there's still--technology in the rest of the world is delivered top-down, but out of sight of academia and industry, there's this amazing network of grassroots inventors primed and ready, just struggling with--they don't have the means to quite do what they're thinking of.",
        "So what's pulling this is this dense network of grassroots inventors...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...who get what this is good for and are running with it when they get access to it.",
