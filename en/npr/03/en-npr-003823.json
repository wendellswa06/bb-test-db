        "You mean to - you want people to see the city that you want them to see.",
        "Is that it?",
        "It was kind of a way to accept the fact that there would be a tremendous amount of attention through media and through political eyes looking at our city, and it could have been a very superficial experience.",
        "And so we used this idea of what a fixer is, and we asked, you know, who was operating culturally as a fixer in the city?",

        "I think the flavor is what kind of gets people over the hump of, you know, I'm eating grass and seeds.",
        "It might be tempting to dismiss all of this self-affirmation stuff as earnest California hokeyness, but it is also earnest California capitalism.",
        "The place is always packed and Englehart is now opening two more Café Gratitudes in the Bay Area.",

        "Just to the west, a huge slab of the earth's crust called the Cocos Plate is grinding relentlessly toward North America, but it's running into an even bigger slab, the North American Plate.",
        "So the Cocos Plate is shoving itself underneath its northern neighbor.",
        "Lots of faults lie along and near the junction of these two plates like stitches in the seam of a baseball.",

        "So you've got a lot of soft sediments.",
        "And when the energy from the earthquake comes into that, those basins really kind of amplify that shaking like a bowl of jelly shaking around.",
        "And it just keeps on reverberating.",
        "Hayes also points out that shallow quakes in this region often create earthmoving waves at a frequency that's especially damaging to 10- to 20-story buildings.",
        "These buildings vibrate in sync with those waves like a tuning fork.",
        "A lot of buildings in Mexico City are at that kind of 10- to 20-story level, and so they're just at the right height to be quite vulnerable.",
        "The two quakes this month were on the same tectonic plate but several hundred miles apart.",
        "Hayes says it's not likely the first quake triggered a second one so far away, but it's possible.",
        "Mexico City has strengthened many buildings since the 1985 quake which killed more than 5,000 people, and it has designed an early warning system that detects the first vibrations from a quake to give people an earlier warning.",
        "But like many cities around the Pacific Rim - San Francisco, Tokyo, Manila - it's sitting on ground that's not going to stop moving.",
