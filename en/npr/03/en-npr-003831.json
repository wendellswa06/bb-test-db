        "Henry Clay called this program, which included internal improvements - a lot nicer word than infrastructure and federal spending on these things - he called it the American system to distinguish it from the British system, which he said was pure laissez-faire.",
        "So, ironically the American system stood as an alternative to pure laissez-faire, even though all of these people honored the market as having an important role in our story.",
        "And you would say - linking government programs, government benefits to a communitarian view of the country - that something as dramatic as Social Security, which came with the New Deal in the 1930s, actually came in the wake of other programs.",
        "You have these figures about Civil War pensions; that we were accustomed to paying lots of people from the government.",
        "Right, and the Scotch poll did a lot of important work on this.",
        "In 1910, about 28 percent of all men aged 65 and older in the country were receiving Civil War pensions.",
        "Want an entitlement program?",
        "In 1894, the Civil War pension system accounted for 37 percent of all federal expenditures.",
        "One of the great things about doing this book is to discover that in 1798, the Congress created the Federal Marine Hospital System for sick and injured seamen.",
        "That was signed by President Adams.",
        "So, long before ObamaCare there was AdamsCare, but I don't remember a lot of demonstrations against AdamsCare.",
        "But I do remember reading, I think it was Arthur Schlesinger in \"\"The Coming of the New Deal,\"\" that until the 1930s the typical American - in terms of what he or she saw of the federal government - it was a postman.",
        "That was it.",
        "Right and the post office itself was an extraordinary American invention.",
        "Our post office was far more expensive than any post office in the world.",
        "It was also central to our political system, because cheap postage is what allowed ideas to circulate through the country.",
        "Now, it's true, we didn't build a big welfare state until the 1930s.",
        "But as the Civil War pensions example shows, as the Marine Hospital System showed, we always look to the federal government to do some important things for the country and, in particular, to build the country up.",
        "The exceptional period here - the Gilded Age, as you write about it - it culminates, if you will, in the U.S.",
        "becoming an imperial power.",
        "It had - the 19th century ends with the Spanish-American War and the U.S.",
        "suddenly bursting on the scene.",
        "It is more powerful than ever.",
        "Suddenly it is prepared to be the creditor nation, rather than the debtor nation.",
        "You know, one might argue, well, the Gilded Age, you know, teed it up for the United States.",
        "Right, but the Gilded Age, you needed private enterprise, you needed entrepreneurs.",
        "But this was not enough.",
        "It's not just that that made us a great nation.",
        "The American century only began when we began to balance this off with government that was necessary, first to check the power of the powerful in the private sphere.",
        "I think Americans have always been very shrewd, that you need to check government power but you need to check concentrations of private power.",
        "Yes, capitalism does produce wonders.",
        "But capitalism doesn't do it all by itself.",
        "And it sometimes needs corrections, as we learned rather recently in our downturn."

        "The Gilded Age was followed by a long consensus in which the purpose of government was generally not disputed by Republicans, Democrats, relatively centrist liberals and conservatives.",
        "The long consensus seems to be over at this point.",
        "Are we into a new Gilded Age?",
        "Are we into a period of a few decades perhaps that will be another exception?",
        "I think that's the question that's really on the ballot in 2012.",
        "Because I think those who are called liberal or progressive really now represent that tradition of balance.",
        "And that what we are for is refreshing, refurbishing the long consensus.",
        "But our arguments - certainly the argument in my book - is America governs itself best when it preserves these public/private, individual and the communal - preserves those kind of balances.",
        "I think temporarily, conservatism has been taken over by those who do want to wreck and overturn that long consensus.",
        "And we're going to be deciding that in this election and I think for several elections to come.",
        "I hope the result is that we realize that we need these balances if we're going to work as Americans and fight off all of this declinist fear.",

        "It is that it no longer works like America.",

        "It also means a Senate seat is vacant in Massachusetts, and that state is expecting a scramble to fill it.",
        "Massachusetts law calls for a special election next January, and as NPR's Tovia Smith reports, there will likely be no shortage of candidates.",
        "It was something no one dared mention aloud while the senator was sick.",
        "Kennedy himself broke the ice when he brought up his succession earlier this month and the whispers came out of the shadows just a bit.",
        "But still, anyone who might be hoping to succeed the senator has to be most concerned right now with being sensitive to the moment.",
        "I think that the only focus for the next week should be on Senator Kennedy, on his incredible contributions to our state."

        "Out of respect for the senator and everything he has done for this commonwealth, I think it's appropriate that anyone who might be thinking of themselves at the moment keep their mouth shut, and let's celebrate his life first.",
        "I think we're going to have to wait at least a few days, if not a week or so, before some of those candidates admit their own ambition.",

        "And after the decent interval has passed, I fully expect the mad scramble to occur.",
        "With a special election now just five months away, Watanabe says candidates cannot afford to be too sensitive.",
        "In this case, he or she who hesitates is lost, because so much of the support and, again, the money gets gobbled up very quickly.",
        "It was one of Senator Kennedy's last wishes, that his seat not sit empty leading up to a special election.",

        "It was just five years ago that Democratic lawmakers changed the law the other way.",
