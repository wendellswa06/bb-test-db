        "We went across the country and we actually did some background research with the native foot and we saw there were some differences in the width and the depth of the toe box.",

        "What was that like?",
        "It was very interesting, because I don't think native people really knew there was a difference in their foot.",
        "They kind of said they knew it, but they really didn't know it.",
        "The inclination by them was to size up.",
        "So what we found out in our research in our consumer information, was that they were wearing at least the size to half a size bigger.",
        "Just the shoe that was too big?",
        "Well, this is one of the arguments that some people use and the response to that is to empower the government and make sure that the rule of law applies and anybody that uses weapons outside the state and outside the framework of the rule of law will not be tolerated.",
        "And I'm not telling you that that will be easy, but the government and Prime Minister Maliki is adamant to do so.",

        "I would say the mainstream Shiite leadership in Iraq recognizes the need for a balanced and inclusive political process.",

        "Iraq is a diverse community.",
        "We need to recognize the rights of the majority, nobody can - that is democratic system of government and the majority's rights need to be recognized but at the same time, not to the detriment of the rights of minority and not to the detriment of the importance of power sharing and bringing about an inclusive political process that will unify Iraqis in the face of terrorism and in the face of extremism.",
        "But I want you to reconcile something for us.",
        "As you speak of inclusiveness and of the multi-communal nature of Iraq, in your neck of the woods in Kurdistan some Iraqi Arabs complain that the only flag flying over government buildings is now a Kurdish flag.",
        "Peter Galbraith, the American who has long been an adviser to the Iraqi Kurds, has suggested that there's no sign whatever of the central government in that part of the country and that the U.S.",

        "That what we're watching on the ground there or we hear about is the fragmentation of Iraq rather than this integrating process you're describing today.",
        "I cannot tell you that there are not people or groups who do want to see the fragmentation of Iraq but most Kurds recognize that their interests lies in a federal democratic Iraq.",
        "Definitely not many Kurds would want to be part of a tyrannical Iraq or fundamentalist Iraq.",
        "If Iraq were to go down that path, then the Kurds will have difficulty staying in Iraq and one must understand why that is so.",
        "As far as the flag is concerned, the Kurdish leadership and the Kurdish Parliament have said that they want to raise an Iraqi flag that would represent the unity of the country.",
        "The present flag that is flown in Baghdad is one that Saddam Hussein has changed and represents in many ways the era of Saddam Hussein.",
        "The very fact that we are having a debate about the flag, I want to say that means Kurds care about symbols of national unity of Iraq.",
        "And I'm hopeful that the Iraqi Parliament will soon begin debate on this issue of the national flag and the national anthem and we will come up with symbols that will represent all Iraqis.",
        "But if a tyrannical dictatorial Iraq is one which Kurds would obviously not want to be a part of, what about an Iraq which south of Kurdistan is embroiled in sectarian violence largely between Sunni Arabs and Shiite Arabs?",
        "Would your people feel - I'm speaking of the Kurds, I know the Iraqis are your people as well - would they feel I don't want to be a part of that Iraq either and rather be in a safe zone up north?",
        "Definitely there is that sentiment among many ordinary Kurds and some political Kurds as well.",
        "They're saying why should we be part of that mess?",
        "But I think that is a very shortsighted view.",
        "And when I go back to Kurdistan and I explain to them if the situation in Baghdad goes sour, if there is a civil war in Iraq, it will not be a long time before Kurdistan will be plunged into it, undermining everything that the Kurds care for.",
        "That is why you find the Kurdish leadership seriously involved in Baghdad and trying to help overcome these sectarian divides and thinking about national unity."
