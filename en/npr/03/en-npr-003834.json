        "To many readers, Charlotte's death at the end of the book is heartbreaking, but perhaps no one was more heartbroken than the author himself.",
        "When E.B.",
        "White was doing the narration, he, of course, as anyone does when doing an audio book, had to do several takes for various things, just to get it right.",
        "But every time he broke down when he got to Charlotte's death.",
        "And he would do it and it would mess up and they would say, OK, let's take a break and start over.",
        "And he did that again until - he took 17 takes to get through Charlotte's death without his voice cracking or beginning to cry."
