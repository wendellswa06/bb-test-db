        "Assad has survived four years of civil war thanks to supplies and support from Russia and Iran.",
        "But last week, anonymous U.S.",
        "intelligence sources told reporters that Russia was stepping up its military activity in Syria.",
        "They said that Russian teams had set up an air traffic control center and barracks to house hundreds of people at a Syrian government airfield.",
        "The sources said Russia had requested permission from third countries that would allow it to fly military aircraft into the area.",
        "Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, presented the story as an example of U.S.",
        "media hyping an anti-Russia line.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Western media have, over the past few days, been headlining that Russia is ramping up its military presence in Syria.",
        "Although Washington hasn't confirmed the accuracy of these reports, the story's prompted the U.S.",
        "secretary of state to contact his Russian counterpart on Sunday.",
        "Secretary Kerry did call Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov to express concerns about the reports of a Russian buildup.",
        "The State department said that if the reports were accurate, Russian actions could escalate the conflict, increase the flow of refugees and risk confrontation with the U.S.-supported coalition against the Islamic State.",
        "That's because the Syrian rebels, supported by the United States, are also fighting Assad.",
        "Russian reporters asked President Putin about the U.S.",
        "claims.",
        "Putin criticized the U.S.",
        "campaign against ISIS, saying it was ineffective.",
        "But he added that it was too early to say that Russia would be ready to take part in military operations.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "(Through interpreter) We have provided Syria with significant support anyway, both in equipment and armaments and in personnel training.",
        "Some Russian analysts are speculating that Putin is aiming for a bigger say in international policy on Syria but not necessarily a bigger military role.",
        "Putin said he wants to create a coalition to fight terrorism, adding that the effort should go side-by-side with political change in Syria.",
        "But that change would keep Assad in power.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",

        "The United States and its allies have insisted that Assad must go.",

        "The Ebola outbreak in West Africa has now officially claimed more than 1,900 lives.",
        "Health officials believe thousands more people will die before the virus is brought under control.",
        "There is growing pressure on the international community to do more.",
        "After all the countries hardest hit - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea - have weak healthcare systems that have been overwhelmed.",
        "But officials at the United Nations and the World Health Organization worry that taking over the effort to fight Ebola would undermine confidence in those country's governments.",
        "And while Ebola has made headlines, the international community is struggling with other deadly diseases - like malaria - all on limited resources.",
        "Two top officials were in Washington this week trying to raise money for the international response to Ebola and they came by our studios.",
        "David Nabarro is the United Nations senior coordinator for the fight against Ebola.",

        "Dr.",
        "Nabarro it sounds like these healthcare systems in these countries are under tremendous strain - doctors exhausted, doctors in some cases on strike.",
        "What gives you the confidence that you can find enough healthcare workers to battle a virus that seems to be spreading so much?",
        "During my recent visit I explored the challenges faced by healthcare workers - by that I mean doctors and nurses, but also people who maintain the hospitals and clean them and so on.",
        "And it turns out that there are difficulties with them getting their basic pay, but also they have been promised additional hazard pay to enable them to keep working despite the dangers associated with Ebola virus disease and the money hasn't been getting through.",
        "So we've been looking at ways of getting the money through more reliably using mobile banking, using alternative routes to get money out because a lot of aspects of government are not quite working well.",
        "And we've also got support from the World Bank to help lubricate the money that is going through the system.",
        "You think the money is a big part of the problem?",
        "Money is a huge part of the problem - exactly the same here.",
        "If we had hospitals and we were asking to do extra work with a more dangerous disease, but we couldn't guarantee that people would get their allowances and their overtime and all these other things, after a bit they would say I've had enough.",
        "And so there have been strikes, but I'm absolutely confident that with the work that we've been doing here in Washington to absolutely make certain that money is getting through that will overcome that problem.",
        "And we will see more doctors and nurses working in very, very near future."

        "We also sat down with Doctor Margaret Chan, she's director general of the World Health Organization, and I asked her if the time could come when peacekeeping troops might be needed in these countries to help bring order to the response.",
        "When we talk about troops we are fighting a disease, OK?",
        "If we are going to go to war with Ebola we do need resources.",
        "An anti-war trust is not going to do it so we need money.",
        "We also need troops - we need doctors, nurses, statisticians, you know, a laboratory of scientists.",
        "And of course we also need weapons - do we have the protective gears to protect our health care workers so that they can take care of patients?",
        "If I may, it sounds like you're talking about medical troops, as you put it - medical weapons?",
        "Could we reach a point where there might need to be actual UN peacekeepers on the ground or actual forces in a more traditional sense to bring some order and make sure the things are being carried out to control this?",
        "You ask an excellent question.",
        "In fact as we are talking we have UN Meals in Liberia.",
        "This is a peacekeeping force and they have been providing their logistic capacity which is, you know, excellent to reinforce the transport of materials, people to places where we need them to provide the care.",
        "And the problem the government faced is under existing federal law corporations are criminally liable whenever their employees commit a crime that profits the firm.",
        "And therefore corporations had very little incentive to help the government.",
        "Right?",
        "If they report the wrong they're suddenly criminally liable.",
        "So the government started a policy of trying to encourage firms to detect and report wrongdoing and to cooperate.",
        "And it said, I know we're entitled to prosecute you, but we won't if you cooperate.",
        "But it also said that cooperation must be real.",
        "See, you can't just report and then say we won't give you any evidence.",
        "You have to cooperate and turn over all the facts we need about the case.",
        "My sense is Judge Kaplan is right, that the government went too far when it decided that it not only wanted the cooperation to give it all the facts about the crime, but wanted the corporation to help tip the scales against the employees by refusing to give them the resources it otherwise would have given them that they need to defend themselves.",
        "I think Judge Kaplan said something like, what you're effectively trying to do is to take defense lawyers out of the picture here.",
        "This is not a search for the truth.",
        "It is instead an attempt to tip the scales of the adversarial process.",
        "And for better or for worse, we depend on the adversarial process, the give and take between defense lawyers and prosecutors to find the truth.",
        "We believe you find the truth by the prosecutors presenting their best case, and the defense lawyers presenting theirs.",
        "And so long as that's the system we rely on, we have to allow defendants to use the means they would otherwise have available to them to defend themselves.",
        "Jennifer Arlen, professor of law at NYU, thanks for talking with us."
