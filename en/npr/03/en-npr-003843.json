        "(Soundbite of Beethoven sonata)",
        "It's the Hammerklavier Sonata, the sonata that makes all of us pianists quake in our boots.",
        "That's the most epic.",
        "It's in a frenzy.",
        "It's incredibly fast.",
        "It's this wild fugue jumping all over the place.",
        "The music gets so furious and so wild and so extreme and is pushing the boundaries everywhere that it's just hard to keep your head cool enough to play it.",
        "What is offered to the pianist and the audience in the Hammerklavier Sonata is part of what fascinates us about Beethoven in general.",
        "There is a huge struggle in his music, and I struggle with him.",
        "But I think that is an intrinsic quality of his.",
        "One doesn't struggle with Mozart.",
        "One struggles, but that is not his business.",
        "It came to him as if there was no other possibility.",
        "You know, we've all heard about seeing Amadeus, either the play or the movie, and sort of have a visual image, perhaps, of Mozart just sort of taking dictation from the gods, as it were.",
        "Beethoven was exactly the opposite.",
        "He often started with a rather mundane theme, and through dint of extraordinary perseverance, work, and that spark of creative imagination or inspiration created something from that mundane theme which, you know, is absolutely right on the ball throughout the ages.",
        "Abut and touch.",
        "Good.",
        "Diva - D-I-V-A - and agree",

        "Now, I want to start with the timeline.",
        "What have you learned?",
        "Well, the court said that, in July, there were some suspicious blood tests that led to a biopsy that showed that the justice had a cancerous tumor on her pancreas.",
        "Five days later she began a very specialized kind of new, cutting-edge radiation treatment at Memorial Sloan Kettering in - Cancer Center in New York.",
        "It was a three-week course of treatment.",
        "Doctors said that she did well with the treatment, that there is no evidence of cancer elsewhere in the body, and that no further treatment is needed as of now, anyway.",
        "So she finished her treatment today and went back to work.",
        "Right, so a quick...",

        "Right, a quick return to work.",
        "It sounds like no one knew she was doing this.",
        "Well, her doctors knew, and she decided apparently that she would announce it when she had completed the treatment course, and that is done now.",
        "She - while she was in New York, she kept up a pretty hectic pace.",
        "She not only continued to work, she was out and around town, spotted at movies, at theater, even met Kate McKinnon of \"\"Saturday Night Live\"\" at the Yiddish production of \"\"Fiddler On The Roof,\"\" and they shook hands for the first time - spotted window shopping on Madison Avenue, trying on shoes.",
        "So she was not acting like a sick person when she was in New York.",
        "Can you talk about how serious this is?",
        "I mean, what do you make of it?",
        "Well, I think there's no way to say this isn't serious.",
        "I mean, nobody really knows, at least in the outside world.",
        "She's had cancer three times before, over the course of 20 years, and that complicates things."

        "Is it a slow-growing metastasis of her lung cancer from last December?",
        "Is it a recurrence of her pancreatic cancer from 10 years ago, which he said would be highly unusual?",
        "Or is it a new pancreatic cancer in someone who is predisposed to getting cancer?",

        "No, Madeleine.",
        "I mean, you know, one of the things that had economists choosing words like dismal, disturbing, horrible, stunning today was that the Labor Department revised the numbers going back two months prior to the month it was released today.",
        "So the entire summer up through August, we're seeing worst numbers than we saw before.",
        "That's led economists today to start using the R word - recession - and they're not saying we're definitely going to have a recession but it looks a lot more likely than it did before.",
        "And just to put this in some kind of perspective, most economists had expected the number of jobs to rise by about 112,000, and instead they fell, like you said, by 4,000.",
        "So that's a big difference.",
        "Right.",

        "When we visited the snake room behind Coots' house, there were about 30 snakes - mostly timber rattlers and copperheads - crowded into glass cages.",
        "He says he waters them regularly but that his supplier of live mice and rats moved away, and many of the snakes won't eat anyway.",
        "In a follow-up call, I asked him, how long do his snakes usually live?",
        "Average is probably three to four months.",
