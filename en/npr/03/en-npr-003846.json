        "You can see wax from candles burning as he crafted his musical offerings to the world.",
        "And many of these offerings were crafted at the piano.",
        "At a moment, by the way, when the piano itself was undergoing it's own revolutionary transformation.",

        "Did the piano manufacturers invent things and then Beethoven write for it?",
        "Actually I don't think so.",

        "They were forced to create instruments that could withstand his playing.",

        "By the time of the 1820s, on the last three Beethoven sonatas, which are often played together, the word innovation seems inadequate to describe what the composer had done.",
        "He had transformed the sonata, the instrument, and music in general.",

        "Thank you very much.",
        "What's remarkable to you in this Census Bureau report, which tells us that the Hispanic population is now about 41.3 million people, or 14.1 percent of the population?",
        "Well, it's really rather steady growth of this population over a long run.",
        "It's been growing rapidly for the last 20, 25 years.",
        "This report shows us, though, a change; that for the first time since the 1960s, there are more Hispanic births than Hispanic immigrants.",
        "Is that because the birth rates among Hispanic immigrants in the US are very high, or other Hispanics, or is it because immigration is slowing?",
        "Well, it's a combination of factors.",
        "The birth rates are high.",
        "They're not extraordinarily high.",
        "They're lower than they were overall in the baby boom of the 1950s, for example.",
        "But they are higher than other groups.",
        "But, also, it's the youth of the population; that there's a big concentration of Hispanic women in their 20s and 30s.",
        "So even moderately high levels of fertility translates into large numbers of births."

        "I want you to give us some idea of how much younger the Hispanic population of America is than the rest of the population in America.",
        "Well, there's a couple of different ways you can look at it.",
        "The median age is about 10 years less than the white population.",
        "Thirty-four percent of Hispanics are under age 18 vs. 23 percent of the white non-Hispanic population.",
        "So it's quite a large difference.",
        "And if we look at the other end of the scale, say over 65, again, a much smaller share of Hispanics?",
        "Much smaller share, and 5 percent of Hispanics are over 65 vs. about 14 percent of white non-Hispanics.",
        "The other way to look at it is, as you said, 14.1 percent of the population is Hispanic, but if you look at the kids under five, it's 22 percent.",
        "And we should assume then that if present trends continue, the share of the population that's Hispanic would increase.",
        "The share will increase.",
        "Each younger age groups is more heavily Hispanic than the one that's a bit older.",
        "And one of the things about demography is that we can say with a fair amount of certainty that five years from now, almost all these people will be five years older.",
        "So...",
        "(Laughs) Now when we look at a population growth due to births in the US, as opposed to migration, there's one obvious difference, which is migrants include those who come here legally and who don't have legal papers.",
        "If you're born here, you're a citizen of the United States.",
        "You're a citizen in the United States, regardless of whether your parents were here legally or not.",
        "So the population of people here who are properly documented, counting a birth certificate as a document, the share would be going up (unintelligible).",
        "The share is going to be increasing rather steadily if we look 20 or 40 years out into the future."
