        "And it's just easier.",

        "Right.",
        "And for a good part of my life, I did identify more as black.",
        "As I got into high school and then later college, I began identifying myself as biracial because I really didn't feel any more connection to one group or the other.",
        "And in fact, if anything, I felt stigmatized by both groups at any point in my life.",
        "I went to a majority white, Catholic school for a good part of my elementary school, and I felt stigmatized there.",
        "And when I went to a majority black middle and high school, I felt stigmatized there because I wasn't black enough, and in the white schools, I wasn't white enough.",
        "Were there any - were there also other biracial kids in your grammar school and your middle school and high school?",
        "Well, there weren't.",
        "The only other biracial kids I knew were this one family who lived down the street from me, and, you know, that was it.",
        "It was just me, my sister and this one particular family.",
        "And, you know, their - you know, but my biracial friend was - his experience was a little bit different because most people looked at him, and they thought he was Italian.",
        "So they never questioned that.",
        "But when they looked at me, they saw my skin color, and then they saw my hair, which, you know, the two didn't match up, I guess, in their minds.",
        "And so they sort of questioned who I was and, you know - I didn't like the fact that I was forced to take a side when I was in middle school, and so I just really began identifying myself as biracial as a way of, you know, claiming both of my families' heritage.",
        "I'm proud of both my mom and my dad.",
        "I love them both dearly.",

        "No, not at all, and in fact, listening to her talking, she's sort of reiterating what many of the people in the study talked about, you know, that they strongly did identify as biracial or multiracial, that they didn't want to deny any particular parent.",
        "And they did have these strong biracial identities, but then in certain situations, they would talk about how they might present themselves as mono-racial, whether white or black.",
        "But overall, they oftentimes had very strong biracial identities, just like this caller.",
        "So it's very interesting to see that parallel and certainly not surprising.",

        "You could be biracial, and you could be Indian an Aborigine.",
        "So biracial is a kind of broad term, and I believe that throughout history, black has kind of encompassed biracial.",

        "Are things different for people with black ancestry from people who are of other mixed races, do you think?",
        "I think so because of the stigmas of slavery and Jim Crow and sort of like, for being white has been like an exclusive club.",
        "Like, if you have one drop of anything else, you can't be white.",
        "If you're poor and white, you're not white, you're white trash.",

        "They won't say a number 1.5 male or, you know, a biracial man.",
        "And the categories that are kind of set up.",
        "But I think as - you know, society is progressing, and you're seeing a lot more biracial Americans becoming more prominent in the media and sports and in life.",
