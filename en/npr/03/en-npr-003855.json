        "And even though my sister and I are fully Asian, we were thought of and have been perceived as being biracial because - and constantly asked if we were mixed because we don't - we have, you know, double eyelids, and I have a big nose, and my sister particularly has never had black hair.",

        "And so also I think it also should be noted that, you know, the whole issue of being biracial, certainly with things like Asian, you know, it's really not until the 1967 Miscegenation Act, where you have the legalization of marriage.",
        "That was a big thing.",
        "My father, when he came to graduate school in 1963, he was in Tennessee, and he was told that many times, you're allowed to drink in the white water fountain, are allowed to sit where the whites sit in the bus, but you're a guest, constantly remember you're a guest, and you have to go home.",

        "How do we fit the Asians in?",
        "And I...",
        "Yeah, she did - she brought up this, you know, the case of Loving versus Virginia in '67 which legalized, supposedly, interracial marriage.",
        "You know, I was born in '65, so my parent's marriage was technically illegal.",
        "And we thing everything got away of '67.",

        "It was just 2000 that the U.S.",
        "even allowed people to check more than one box in the census.",
        "It was in 2000 that there was still a university that forbid interracial dating on campus and that was just found out.",
        "I mean, there was last year, it was 2009, where the Justice of the Peace in Louisiana refused to perform a marriage ceremony for a black man and white woman.",
