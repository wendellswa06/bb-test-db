        "government got that debt deal, but then people looked and saw the U.S.",
        "economy still not looking really good.",

        "There's also concern just about leadership, where those countries are going in getting out from under that debt, and the combined risk with a second, a potential second recession in the U.S., which people are talking about, is kind of causing fear, you know, in markets really all over the globe.",

        "growth could turn into a recession or not.",

        "Here's what he said earlier.",
        "In 1997, Japanese economy was recovering and Prime Minister Hashimoto became rather complacent and argued that maybe it's time to cut budget deficit.",
        "And when the government cut the budget deficit, the whole economy imploded.",
        "And so what Koo said is he's afraid that what he's seeing in the U.S.",

        "Well, Frank, you're just in one location there in a worldwide story.",
        "But what is your sense about whether investors have confidence in governments, whether in Asia, in Europe or the United States, to help get out of this?",
        "Well, I think they feel that governments have kind of exhausted a lot of what they can do.",
        "And they also just see a lot of, to some degree, dithering and not really getting things done.",
        "Certainly that's been a complaint about Washington and a complaint with some governments in Europe, and it's somewhat reminiscent of what people have seen in Japan for many years.",

        "There are anti-aircraft positions being manned here in Benghazi, and especially in the evening.",
        "You hear a lot of explosions, a lot of sound of ordnance going off.",
