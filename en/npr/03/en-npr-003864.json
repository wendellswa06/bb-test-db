        "I mean, it's obviously - people have lost everything.",
        "FEMA will scale back the amount of cash emergency aid it gives out to families uprooted by disaster to $500.",
        "That's compared with the $2,000 it gave to Katrina survivors.",
        "The $500 is what FEMA had given in recent disasters before Katrina.",
        "We can add more to that if we have to, but we think the first $500 - particularly with the system we have in place we'll be able to put people in hotels and into apartment buildings much more quickly - is going to cut that need down for the amount of dollars.",
        "Paulison said FEMA is also clamping down on what auditors found was a major source of fraud.",
        "FEMA did not have a system in place to verify that those who said they were from the area - from the effected area - really lived there.",
        "We didn't have a system in place to identify, are they who they say they are.",
        "That is in place now.",
        "In other changes, Paulison said FEMA will make it easier and faster to register evacuees who need help.",
        "It will register people before storms hit.",
        "And it will use thousands of internal revenue service employees to help field calls by victims who want to register for help.",
        "Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff outlined the changes in a letter to governors and state emergency managers.",

        "His fans were everywhere - from truck drivers, who heard his first morning newscast at 5 a.m., to the president of the United States."

        "During his time in office, Carter was open about his faith and never shied away from topics like religion or the role God played in his life.",
        "But the former president worries that faith has become distorted in the world of politics today.",
        "Carter thinks religious fundamentalists have taken a stronghold on politics and are forcing their beliefs on others and leaving little room for tolerance of differing views.",
        "The former president worries that this kind of intolerance can only lead to a further decaying of what he sees as a society that's moral center is eroding.",
        "Carter takes on this controversial subject in his latest book, \"\"Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis."

        "I'm curious why you decided now to write this book.",
        "Was there some righteous indignation that caused you to do this?",
        "Well, this is my 20th book.",
        "I've never written one before about political affairs, but I was becoming increasingly concerned about the basic changes that have taken place in our national policy on the matter of issues that are important to me and, I think, to the American people.",
        "I'm not talking about a difference between Democrats and Republicans or about liberals and conservatives.",
        "I'm talking about a radical group of changes taking place in this administration compared to what was done under George Bush Sr. or under Ronald Reagan or under Gerald Ford or even Dwight Eisenhower as well as Democratic presidents.",
        "And they involve the basic issues of peace, human rights, the environment, rich vs. poor, church and state and that sort of thing.",
        "For instance, in the area of peace we've always had a policy in our country of going to war only if our country's security was directly threatened.",
        "Now we have a new policy promulgated by the president of preemptive war, a policy of going to war against another country with bombs, missiles and even invasion if we want to change the administration there or if we think that sometime in the future our security might be threatened.",
        "We've now seen an incredible debate about whether our country should resort officially to torture of prisoners.",
        "We've seen an abandonment of our basic principles on environment, and we've seen an unprecedented series of ostentatious tax breaks for the richest Americans who live at the expense of poor people and working-class people.",
        "And we've seen a breakdown in the relationship between church and state, a barrier that was established as far back as Thomas Jefferson, who said, `Build a wall between church and state.",
        "So these kinds of basic changes are the ones that caused me finally to write this book.",
        "What do you think essentially caused the breakdown of what many suggest is happening in this country, the moral fiber that the country was built on?",
        "Well, one generic change that's taken place has been an increase in fundamentalism in religion and politics, and they are somewhat different, and I describe them in \"\"Our Endangered Values.\"\" In religious circles, fundamentalists are always powerful men who consider themselves superior to all others, superior to women with the subservience or subjugation of women.",
        "They consider themselves--a fundamentalist does--to be inherently directly related to God.",
        "Therefore, their beliefs are God's beliefs, and anyone who disagrees with them at all have to be wrong or even inferior.",
        "They don't consider it to be appropriate to negotiate or to mediate or to deal with people who have contrary beliefs because that's a violation of their own principles.",
        "And also obviously a fundamentalist can't admit `I have ever made a mistake.",
        "So those kind of rigidities--black and white, no nuances, no debates, no give and take--have permeated not only religious circles but also, I would say, the activities of Congress.",
        "And I try to describe these in some more detail, obviously in the book, that I don't have time to do right now.",
        "So that is one of the causes of these black-and-white, `I'm right and you're wrong,' `Either or with us or against us,' those kind of policies.",
        "What we've heard recently coming out of Washington and we heard former President Clinton just talk about, the political talk that we've seen over the course of the last few years and in particular in the last few months, the idea that we are really going down a road of no return, is his thought.",
        "Would you agree with that?",
        "I hope it is a road of return.",
        "I don't think it's no return.",
        "I think we are headed in that direction.",
        "But I believe that the recent public opinion polls, which you and I both have seen, show that there's a growing disillusionment and disapproval and distrust of what has been going on in Washington.",
        "Most of this has happened since my book actually had to go to press back the first of July, but I think that almost all of the principles that I described in \"\"Our Endangered Values,\"\" as matters of deep concern, are now becoming much more vivid, much more known among the American public.",
        "Well, you were my counselor.",
        "When I had women problems, I'd come talk to you."
