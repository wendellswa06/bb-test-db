        "There are a lot of people out there looking.",
        "So what are the main issues that you're finding as you from a professional standpoint look at the issues facing job seekers?",
        "Well, James Smith's situation is actually very common right now.",
        "I think one of the biggest challenges in the - one of the most common trends that we're seeing first and foremost when someone loses a job or is in transition is emotional despair.",
        "There's a lot of anxiety about being able to secure alternative employment and just dealing with the shock of being laid off.",
        "And so what's really important is that individuals have access to quality resources to reenter the job search arena and really accessing pockets of growth because there is hiring taking place.",
        "We really just have to connect people like James to the places where opportunity is happening."

        "We're finding that over 200 to 300 jobs a day are being landed on our site.",
        "And just this morning, we found that there were over 40,000 jobs available in the top 15 categories being searched.",
        "So there are opportunities out there.",
        "So why would you target a search site specifically for African-Americans?",
        "Why do you think that it's important to be specific about that?",
        "Well, there is - there's a certain affinity that's created when it comes to community-based networking.",
        "And when I say community-based networking, we're talking about giving something before you look to receive.",
        "And the common approach to networking is looking to receive something before you get it.",
        "And so when you look at a community of African-Americans who are there to support and help each other, you're creating an authentic network.",
        "And what people have today, I think, are primarily unauthentic networks or just mere associations.",
        "And so having a site like A Mighty River, where you've got a community of African-American professionals there for one common purpose, to share resources, to share information, is critical, and it's also more effective because if you find out about a job opportunity through word of mouth, you're more likely to be considered for that job, more likely to have a greater rate of return.",
        "And so that's a resource that African-Americans have not been using in terms of being online doing that, but it's critical if we're going to stay competitive in this economy.",

        "When you're not living in the same city that you want to find a job in, what are the special challenges, and how do you try to bridge those?",
        "Well, the first thing is, a lot of times people think it's a disadvantage not to be local.",
        "And I don't think that's a challenge as much so as people might think given the advent of the Internet and the advances that we have with Web 2.0 technology because what you can do now is essentially create a virtual network before you're ever even in your new city, and you can start to create very meaningful relationships before you get there.",
        "As an entrepreneur, I'm constantly looking to establish new opportunities in different cities, and I usually try to figure out my marketplace before I enter.",
        "And so what I would suggest for Toni is to connect with the hospitality associations in the Houston area.",
        "Meet with their - try to meet virtually online or via phone calls with the leadership of those associations.",
        "They're going to have access to some of the top jobs in that area within your industry, and you can start to create a very, very solid network that way.",
        "And the second thing that I would suggest is to interview some of the top professionals in your industry in that market.",
        "Say, you know what?",
        "I would like to schedule maybe 10 to 15 minutes of your time.",
        "I'll send you two to three questions via e-mail so you know what I'm interested in talking about.",
