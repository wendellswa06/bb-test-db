        "Toni, you're in an industry that has taken some hits.",
        "Hospitality and tourism are down, and in some cases very significantly, like Las Vegas.",
        "So why are you choosing to stay in this field, and would you consider other ones?",
        "First of all, I really enjoy tourism and hospitality.",
        "It's what I've done for the past 15 to 20 years, and I have a lot of experience.",
        "So my first choice would be to stay in the industry.",
        "Of course, I would consider another industry if I'm not able - if I'm not successful in the hospitality industry.",
        "But yes, a lot of cities, they've taken huge hits.",
        "New Orleans is no different.",
        "People are going to - they're moving more to online conferencing and more regional conferencing.",
        "So the industry has taken the huge hit.",
        "But there are a lot of opportunities in that industry as well.",
        "What I find in this industry, in particular, it's a very closed industry.",
        "Meaning that a lot of times, the opportunities are not posted online, or they're not - they're only circulated in-house.",
        "That's where networking comes in and why it's so important because there may be a position available that will not be put out to the general public, but it's just a word of mouth, and people can tell you about positions that are actually in that industry or in that particular hotel.",
        "So my first thing is to get out and to network.",
        "I'm finding that one of the particular websites, A Mighty River, is very helpful in allowing me to do that because you're going to have people on that that are necessarily - that could be in that industry and just pass on a lead to me that may not be available to the general public.",
        "Marshawn, you know, your site is heavily focused on not just job listings, but also social networking.",
        "But social networking on the biggest scale, something like Facebook, is not necessarily something that monetizes well.",
        "From your own standpoint as a business owner, are you afraid that the business you're in itself is unstable, creating a Web-based site like the one you have?",
        "I actually think Web-based businesses are going to be the areas that continue to grow and continue to thrive.",
        "And that's where jobs are secure, that's where employers go to hire, and that's where people need to be to find the best jobs.",
        "At A Mighty River, there are several - there are hundreds of thousands of six-figure jobs that are available as of even today.",
        "There are, as I mentioned earlier, two to 300 jobs that we're seeing landed per day.",
        "There were over - approximately 40,000 that were available.",
        "And people aren't necessarily aware of sites like A Mighty River.",
        "It's key to understand that this is a site targeted towards African-American professionals.",
        "So there are top companies that are looking to hire top African-American talent, which makes it very different from the other social networking websites that are out there.",
        "A Mighty River is a professional networking website.",
        "It is more than just a job board, and the job board is dynamic.",
        "It's powered by Monster, who has one of the most dynamic technologies in the world for matching employers with qualified talent."

        "Toni, when you think about the best things that you have on your side, it sounds like experience is one of them, that you have a long history of experience in this industry.",
        "Do you think that experience is what it used to be?",
        "And the reason I'm asking that is because a lot of people are facing moments now where they've put in, say - you know, in one case, someone I know, 24 years in a company, and now having to face a change.",
        "Are you worried that even with your experience that may not be enough?",
        "Yeah, at times I am.",
        "Experience, you're absolutely right, it doesn't carry as much weight as it used to.",
        "But in certain industries, experience is crucial.",
        "And luckily, I mean, tourism and hospitality is one of those industries, to kind of know your product and how to sell your product, how to cater to your client.",

        "Just briefly.",
        "Yes.",
        "There are resources available for that.",
        "If you have a resume that's not up to date, or you're not necessarily sure how to present yourself best with your resume, you can post that, and you will have - we do have resources to help you tailor and make your resume as strong as it can be.",
        "And just real quickly on this point of experience, being different or having experience is not enough today.",
        "You have to establish what value you're adding.",
        "And what I would suggest for Toni is to take a look at her experiences and how they add value in this economy, in this marketplace.",

        "Thank you."
