        "David, your view of this?",
        "Much has been written, spoken about how this president kind of immediately seemed to embody the office, felt very comfortable in the suit of the president from day one - in fact, maybe even from Election Day.",
        "It seemed like - almost like that's when his administration started.",
        "But there have been moments where we've seen them kind of struggle with the learning curve, specifically some Cabinet appointments.",
        "That's been the bumpy road, that's the stuff he's had to apologize for.",
        "How meaningful is that?",
        "Well, you know, it's meaningful only in that it will be seen by others in Washington - other power players - as signs of weakness perhaps.",
        "I think it certainly took away a little of the sheen of the new president coming in with the honeymoon to have to find three different people to be your Commerce secretary or to have so many top appointments turn out not to have fully paid their taxes at a time, by the way, you're proposing to raise them on everybody else.",
        "So, you know, those are damaging things.",
        "Are they long-lasting damage?",
        "You know, that's debatable, but I think that it took a little of the sheen off of an otherwise efficient and largely popular, according to the polls, transition period into office.",

        "We've had this huge stimulus package passed that would be an extraordinary achievement for any president at any point in his presidency, and it happened in the course of a month.",
        "Look at the executive orders and other executive actions that have come out of the Oval Office - ordering the closure of Guantanamo and the end to torture and managing to rectify the children's health issue.",

        "It's - there's just so much going on; it's hard, I think, for anyone to keep on top of it all.",

        "David Gergen, you've watched a lot first months of a lot of presidents, some of them from very close, some of them from inside.",
        "We all followed President Obama on the campaign trail for a couple of years, some of us right on the plane.",
        "And you get a sense from watching speech after speech that you know a person pretty well.",
        "Maybe a good chunk of that is illusion, just because how well do you really know someone?",

        "Is the guy you see now the guy you saw then or are we seeing a very different person now that he's in the office?",

        "Usually, you see people shift gears when they actually get elected.",
        "But if you listen to that speech a couple of nights ago, you know, much of the rhetoric in that speech was almost word for word what he was saying on the campaign trail.",
        "I think that's one of the reasons that the public has rallied to him, that they find a consistency there.",
        "At the same time, there appears to be personal growth.",
        "He became a much better candidate by the end of the campaign than he was when it started.",
        "And I think that's carried over to his presidency, but I'm not sure any of us were prepared to believe during the campaign that he would be as audacious as president as he seemed to be in the campaign.",
