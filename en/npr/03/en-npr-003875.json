        "But health care is - everyone knows it's huge, and that involves getting a gimungo(ph) piece of legislation through Congress that changes the way we think about and practice health care in this country.",
        "That is an enormous task.",
        "Yet, I think the politics of it are such that really, on both sides of the aisle, people who have worked on this issue for a long time see an opportunity right now.",
        "And I won't call it a unique opportunity, but one that doesn't come around very often, when the stars seem to be aligned, and it seems that maybe you could actually get it done.",
        "And I think part of it is a fear that if you wait, the stars might come unaligned, and you might not be able to move on it.",
        "Let's see what some of our listeners are saying.",
        "Richard is calling from Wichita, and he wants to talk about the new secretary of state, is that correct?",
        "Yeah, my biggest surprise was that Obama's least qualified cabinet appointment in the middle of two wars was his chief diplomat, the secretary of state, who's got no diplomatic or government management experience, nor any real foreign affairs expertise, which is especially troubling because of Obama's own absence of expertise in this area.",
        "She spent a lot of time traveling the world as both a senator and as first lady, but that doesn't get it for you?",
        "Well, she's the least qualified secretary of state in living memory, if I'm not mistaken.",
        "Let's get our guests to weigh in.",
        "David Gergen?",
        "Well, (Laughing) I don't agree with the characterization she's the least qualified, but I have to say this - I think that she's off to a very good start.",
        "Her trip to Asia, it seems to me, was both wise and well-done.",
        "The foreign policy team overall has been - it's gotten off to a very effective start.",
        "And you know, they're doing a little bit below the radar screen, but they haven't had any - in other presidencies by this time, we've normally had some big blooper or mistake or stumble.",
        "They haven't had that.",
        "I think General Jones, who is sitting there at the National Security Council desk, has probably had a lot to do with that.",
        "He's been very quiet and almost invisible.",
        "But I think he's been effective.",
        "And I must say on the experience point, if you look at the special envoys who've been added to the team, with Richard Holbrooke going into Afghanistan and Pakistan and George Mitchell going into the Middle East and Dennis Ross in the wings and possibly be an envoy to Iran, there's an awful lot of experience represented by those folks, as well as by the vice president.",
        "So, I don't - I think the question we've had here for foreign policy is not one of just how much experience we have there but how much judgment do we have?",
        "And, you know, is this a well-considered set of decisions that are coming out of the administration?",
        "And so far, I have to say, while it's been cautious, it does seem to have been effective and smooth.",
        "Let's go to Anne in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
        "Anne, thanks for joining us.",
        "Your comments?",
        "Well, it was along the same lines as the previous caller.",
        "At first, I thought that that was one of the poorest decisions I heard coming out of the Obama administration, and I was disappointed, too.",
        "But after reading the press accounts of her trip to Asia, I was actually highly impressed and it brought me back again to a trust of the president."

        "We're now passing 6,400 layoffs as people cancel their jet requests.",

        "Well, and what's interesting - there's a real interesting choice facing President Obama along the lines that the caller just mentioned.",
        "You know, he's - he has sort of taken issue with corporate executives and their jets.",
        "I think he's referring specifically, in his defense, to those who are, you know, in banks or firms that have taken taxpayer money at the moment, not just across the board.",
        "But that's certainly been a very populist kind of statement that he's made that kind of, you know - very popular.",
        "But he's got a choice coming up himself.",
        "Long before he became president, the government started a project to build a new Marine One helicopter - actually, 28 of them - that would serve the president, the vice president and others who are served by that unit.",
        "And this project has gone so far over budget that it's now at $11.2 billion.",
