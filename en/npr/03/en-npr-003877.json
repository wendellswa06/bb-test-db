        "I don't know if this means that those adoptions in process are to be frozen.",
        "Well, we're going to have to leave that in train because there's a limited amount of information that you and I have on this, but let's go on to that broader subject of Haiti's children.",

        "I mean, after my story ran in the New York Times last week, where I had focused in on the story in particular of one child, I got scores of emails from readers asking if they could have her, you know, saying, you know, could I bring her from Haiti to them.",

        "Ms.�PAUL: It refers to children who are sent away from home, usually from the rural areas of Haiti, to live with wealthier families in the city, and the idea is that the children will be educated in exchange for performing some domestic labors.",
        "So ideally it would just be chores, but what the system and I should say, this is a very common phenomenon in Caribbean cultures overall, just to this idea of child lending, and it's seen as a mutually beneficial arrangement between families or parents.",
        "But what ends up happening more often than not in especially in the last 20 years or so, is that the kids end up in slums, not in wealthy families, and they're not educated, and it turns into a system of abuse.",
