        "So it's almost equivalent of domestic it's a little hard to tell the difference between this and slavery.",
        "Ms.�PAUL: Right.",
        "Well, what people argue and make the distinction between this and slavery on is that these kids are not bought and sold in a market as chattel.",
        "It is essentially an arrangement between families, and for that reason they're not slaves.",

        "Some are forced to work as spies or soldiers for criminal gangs.",
        "More than half of Haiti's population is under the age of 18.",

        "How many children are we talking about?",
        "Ms.�PAUL: There was a study done that was published in December, and it was USAID-funded, and it said that they interviewed about 1,500 households, I believe, and extrapolated from that that there are about 225,000 kids in Haiti that were living as restavecs.",
        "Aid organizations think that is a conservative figure and estimate that it might be upwards of 300,000."

        "And your piece notes that this system is technically illegal.",
        "Ms.�PAUL: Well, yes, in a sense.",
        "The system of child lending is not illegal, and what happens in private households is, you know, very difficult to track.",
        "Human trafficking is certainly illegal.",
        "Child abuse is illegal.",
        "But when you consider the extent of the governmental dysfunction in Haiti even before the earthquake, it's not something especially when you consider the domestic circumstances of this system, it's not something that they really had the power to do much about.",
        "And when the system we obviously have little idea of what's happening to this system at the moment, there's so much chaos in Haiti, but nevertheless, you speculated that maybe it could get better, maybe it could get worse.",
        "Ms.�PAUL: Right, yeah.",
        "I spoke to some of the people who had studied the system, you know, really systematically studied it and got their thoughts on what could happen, and what they say is that every time there is some kind of catastrophe, and we should bear in mind that Haiti is no stranger to catastrophe, you see more restavec kids who are just more vulnerable because their parents aren't there to look out for them, and they're not very highly valued as people in the families that they're living with.",
        "So they're the first ones to be turned out onto the streets, say, if the family doesn't have the funds to feed them.",
        "So on the one hand, that's a danger.",
        "On the other, with this huge demographic shift, there's a possibility that the demand for restavec kids will go down because people are heading out of the city, back into the country.",
        "So maybe people in the country will be less likely to send their kids to the city because they know there isn't anything there for them.",
        "The people who are heading out to the country will be less likely to take in kids and put them through this abuse.",
        "But you know, the bottom line at the end of all of that is it just might be that there are families who can't afford to feed all of their children and no place for the kids to go, and so I would say that it's more likely that you're going to end up with a lot of street kids.",

        "Yes, Neal.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "My point regarding restavec kids is it's something which is very deep in that society, and it's mostly true because of poverty, and people don't have money to feed their kids, and they keep having a lot of kids, and they hope by sending them to somebody else, in the capital most of the time, or the big cities, that person will take care of their kids.",
        "But that doesn't happen because 90 percent of the time those kids are abused and they don't send those kids to school, and they use them almost as slaves."

        "That never existed before.",
        "The best all of that goes back to poverty.",

        "They die early.",
        "So those kids are by themselves, and then they end up to somebody else, in somebody else's house, and that person, instead of taking care of those kids properly, they use those kids as slaves.",

        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "He says 90 percent are abused.",

        "Ms.�PAUL: You know, I really wouldn't be able to say if it's as high as 90 percent.",
        "What the research has found is that in - 30 percent of all households in Haiti had restavec had children present there who were not children...",
        "Members of the immediate family.",
        "Ms.�PAUL: Exactly, and so 16 percent of all kids were labeled as restavecs, but they say that it's probably more like 22 percent that were treated like restavecs and just not families who responded to this survey, to this door-to-door survey, were not willing to characterize what they were doing as part of the restavec system.",

        "Ms.�PAUL: You know, I don't know what happens for the rest of their lives, and again, as I said earlier, this is a system that has worsened in the last 20 years or so as the poverty in Haiti has worsened.",
        "So the kids aren't ending up with wealthy families who can provide education.",
        "They're ending up in slums.",
        "So I don't even know if there's necessarily enough evidence out there to be able to say that, but what I do know is that the kids are usually turned out after the age of 15.",
        "So it's very much up to them what to do after that, which I think as the caller indicated, they often do end up on the street and joining gangs.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm just wondering - a couple of years ago, a New York Times reporter did a very long article about child trafficking.",
        "It was in the New York Times Magazine section of the Sunday paper, and Terry Gross also interviewed him, and it was probably one of the most disturbing things I've ever read.",
        "I mean, it topped the Holocaust.",
        "It was really, really awful, and I'm wondering if that's an issue of it was - one of the things he said was that a lot of it was very Eastern European-based and that they would go into countries where there's a lot of poverty and especially deal with these kids on the streets, and I'm wondering if that's a concern.",
        "Do you know anything about that, Katie Paul?",
        "Ms.�PAUL: Well, I do know that there is a very big concern about human trafficking in Haiti, and there is human trafficking, and that is illegal, and I think even with what Deborah was talking about with you before, with this particular group, that was a big concern there."

        "Ms.�PAUL: Right, right, right, especially after a catastrophe like this, where they're out on the street, they're all the more vulnerable.",
        "But this system itself is not considered part of that same human trafficking that our caller probably had read about.",
        "And Jeanine, according to what I've read I'm certainly no expert, I've never been to Haiti, but according to what I've read, we're talking about a trafficking situation that may involve obviously the numbers are hard to know but thousands of kids every year as opposed to what Katie Paul is talking about - this survey suggests hundreds of thousands in this restavec system.",
        "Right.",
        "So thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",
        "Thank you.",

        "We've done some work there with our member station in Fort Myers, and there is some evidence that some Haitians wind up there.",
