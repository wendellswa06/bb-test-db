        "I was wondering if what we can do to make sure that the parents in Haiti are properly equipped to provide for and care for their children, and so hopefully this restavec system will maybe lose prominence.",
        "So either in terms of international aid or foreign policy, what can we do to sort of alleviate that situation?",
        "Well, Katie Paul, that's a big question.",
        "Yeah, it is an enormous question.",
        "I would say first and foremost, you can consider donating to an organization.",
        "The organization I talked to that the story of the child that I actually used in my story is Restavec Freedom, and that's affiliated with the Clinton Global Initiative.",
        "So you can find information about that online.",
        "Obviously you can also donate to something like the Red Cross, which is doing work in Haiti to make sure that people are fed and equipped and that there are tent cities that are properly set up for them.",
        "...Through, I realize Mother Nature is very powerful.",
        "And I can't change anything about that.",
        "I can't do anything about that, so I go.",
        "What kind of...",
        "Yeah.",
        "And then the other point that I would like to make about that is just that there - that two-thirds of these kids are girls, and that's because they're seen as more subservient, easier to control, more likely to do domestic tasks.",
        "So that leaves them at risk for sexual abuse obviously as well, which is, from what I understand, not uncommon.",
        "So it's important, especially in these camps, that the girls are taken care of, because they're just much more at risk.",
        "So some of the camps are actually setting up areas within the camp that are exclusively for women, just girls, so that they have a safe space to go if they have special needs.",
        "And then there are other tricks of the trade, like sending people out to get wood or whatever else they need in groups so that one doesn't disappear...",
        "And Katie Paul, you also mentioned in your story a group called the Restavec Foundation?"

        "It's Restavec Freedom and the Restavec Foundation, and it's run by a guy named Jean Cadet, who used to be a restavec himself and he's now an adult.",
        "And now an adult, so at least he didnt end up in a gang.",
        "That's absolutely right.",

        "So if you go back to the NPR Web site and download that podcast to talk about reconstructing Haiti and what's involved in terms of what they might get from international donors, the United States among others, and what might be needed...",

        "Hi.",
        "I went to Africa in 2007 and did a research on child trafficking.",
        "It is a mirror image of the restavec situation, where children are placed in contracts and then for a set of years are expected to basically perform duties, various labor duties.",
        "Where this becomes an issue of child slavery is when those contracts are altered and when they're altered and backed up with violence, which I believe most of these restavec situations are; that's when you see the issues of human trafficking and child slavery.",
        "And I think that Katie maybe missing that point a little bit.",
        "I work for a human trafficking organization here in Phoenix and, you know, the issue of trafficking is basically one that's age-old, if not...",
        "Sure.",

        "And when you...",

        "When you say contracts, Steven, these are verbal contracts, written contracts?",
        "Most of them are verbal and that's what we found in Africa.",
        "And my research with the restavec situation is they are verbal.",
        "And for as little as $20 for three to six years, children can be placed.",
        "I would point people to Dr. Kevin Bales' work.",
        "He's done a substantial amount of work on the restavec, really a kind of phenomenon, and the issue of child slavery.",
        "Slavery and human trafficking doesn't require movement, and I think that's a misconception.",
        "People can actually be slaves in their hometowns or their home villages.",
        "Katie Paul, does that seem to accord with what you know about the situation in Haiti?",
        "Yeah.",

        "Well, these are contracts that are basically between families, between - it may not even be a parent or an uncle or an aunt who basically sees an opportunity to unload a child that they can't take care of while maybe making $20 to do so.",
        "Ms. PAUL: Mm-hmm.",
        "I don't think that many people may realize what the child is facing, but I think that many of them realize that they may never see them again.",
        "Hmm.",
        "The poverty is just so desperate that the slim chance that they have of possibly having a better life for both the family member and the child outweighs really any other recipe theyre thinking of.",

        "There are times when that works.",
