        "I was a former Marine and a joint-terminal air controller with three tours in Iraq, and something that's not obviously or openly discussed is some of the checks and balances that it takes to actually release ordinance, and I actually did a mission (unintelligible) and some of the things that happened on the radio and behind the scenes.",
        "And one thing that each troop has when they kind of go out is that priority of mission, from left and right, to protect each other.",
        "And having that air cover and that observation, and knowing that you have that card in your pocket to actually drop ordinance is something that's really important to everyone on the mission, even down to the lowest soldier, to Joe on the field.",
        "And while we all know that protecting the civilians and increasing the security is the ultimate goal, protecting left and right is a big one.",
        "And I was just wondering if your guest knew of any backlash on the ground, amongst the troops, what have you, with the tightening of the ROE and the actual release of ordinance there.",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air, please.",
        "All right, Colby(ph), thanks very much, and Tom Bowman has left.",

        "Nicholas Goldberg, in a way we're discussing this as a practical matter.",
        "It is, if you want to win the conflict, it's best not to kill civilians to put other civilians on the other side.",
        "It's also a moral issue.",
        "Sure it's a moral issue.",
        "I mean, there have been philosophers trying to figure out, you know, what should be the fair rules of a moral war, you know, for almost as long as there's been war.",
        "The difficulty is that the more moral you are, the more you try to limit your airstrikes, the less you can accomplish.",
        "So a really elaborate set of rules has been established.",
        "One rule is that you can't target civilians.",
        "That's - by this point, although I said, it was ignored to a great degree in the 20th century, it's pretty much accepted now that military operations may not target civilians the way they did in Hiroshima and the way they did in the fire-bombings of Dresden.",
        "But a more complicated issue is the question of collateral damage.",
        "You know, if we're engaged in a legitimate military operation, but there's a fear that civilians may get caught in the middle of it, how do we deal with that?",
        "How do we decide whether to go ahead, and there's a been a very sort of complicated, part philosophical, part practical discussion of what's called proportionality, to figure that out.",
        "And that means that before you engage in an operation, you have to figure out whether the benefit you're going to gain from hitting your legitimate military target, you know, outweighs the anticipated cost in innocent lives and destroyed property.",
        "And it's with that complicated calculus that the moral - that people try to create a certain morality to war.",
        "Which some people might say is an oxymoron to begin with.",

        "Very well, thanks.",
        "All right.",
        "I just wanted to bring up a few things I'm thinking about as I'm listening, one being that you have to think about the more civilian casualties you cause, as was brought up earlier, you're losing, obviously, you know, the hearts-and-minds mission.",
        "But along with that, if you allow the enemy, such as the Taliban to be the one killing the civilians, indirectly, you know, there's two sides to this.",
        "They're coming to your side.",
        "You're not the one blowing their buddies up, first.",

        "You start to kill off the people who are on the ground living in the villages.",
        "You really lose a lot of that intel that could be gathered otherwise.",
        "They want the Taliban out, for the most part.",
        "They want the same thing we want.",
        "So, you know, if we can, you know, keep casualties low, civilian wise, keep gathering the intel, and win these hearts and minds I think that, you know, we're going to be in good shape.",

        "And I think that it fails to do that, because, yes, we know with - maybe less people have died than in Vietnam, but we have to keep in mind that not one American was killed by Iraqis and over a million Iraqis, just as precious as the million Americans, have been killed by us either directly through our ordinance which was greater than the World War II that we dropped all of Europe and Japan, or indirectly by destroying the one ordering that nation and, well…",
