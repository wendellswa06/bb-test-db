        "Does paying less for hospital care mean that you get lower quality care?",
        "Well, according to a new study in the archives of internal medicine the answer is not necessarily.",
        "Dr. Lena Chen is a clinical lecturer at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann Arbor.",
        "She was the lead author of that study and she joins us now from member station WUOM.",
        "Dr. Chen, welcome to the program.",
        "Hi.",
        "Your study examines the records of care for congestive heart failure patients - all of them Medicare patients - in more than 3,000 hospitals.",
        "Tell us what you found.",
        "Well, we found that the cost of caring for a patient does not necessarily correlate with the quality of care delivered.",
        "So, for same conditions such as congestive heart failure, higher-cost hospitals provided higher quality care.",
        "But for other conditions such as pneumonia, the converse was true.",
        "You mean, that actually lower cost hospitals for some conditions in the end provided better care than higher cost hospitals.",
        "Yes.",
        "Although the differences were very small in terms of quality differences between the high and the low cost hospitals."

        "Some of the ranges in price for treating the same ailment are pretty stunning here.",
        "For example, for congestive heart failure, you have a range of what was the cheapest and what was the most expensive?",
        "For congestive heart failure, the cheapest was $1,522, and the highest was $18,927.",
        "Eighteen thousand?",
        "Yes, it's definitely a huge range and we'd like to understand why there is such a range between hospitals.",
        "But what's driving that difference?",
        "Is it how many days you spend in the hospital?",
        "Is it how many people are checking up on you, medication, what's doing it?",
        "In part, it is probably the length of stay so - we found that the higher cost hospitals did have longer length of stay meaning the patient was in the hospital for a longer period of time.",
        "But beyond that we were unable to identify the specific reasons why high-cost hospitals cost more.",
        "Some of the reasons could be what you mention, such as different testing patterns.",
        "Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, will most likely approve a law that makes it legal to possess small amounts of drugs.",

        "What is the goal of it?",
        "Ms.",
        "ANA MARIA SALAZAR (Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense)): In drafting this law, they were trying to figure out a way to provide more definition in order to avoid some inequalities and corruption problems, because the current Mexican law allows those who are drug addicts to not be prosecuted.",
        "They--basically, once they're detained, they claim that they're drug addicts and it is a judge or prosecutor who has to decide if the quantity they're carrying is pretty much for their own consumption or is a quantity that pretty much shows that their intent is to traffic or not."

        "So it's actually more restrictive than the previous law?",
        "Well, I don't know if it's more restrictive.",
        "It just clarifies what's already in the law.",
        "I think what is creating some anxiety in the United States, and it's an anxiety that I understand very well, it's that there's just different conceptions, basic conceptions, as to how do you deal with drug addicts.",
        "From the United States perspective, a policy perspective, the fact that you can threaten a drug addict with jail is an important aspect of either helping this person or at least pushing this person to find help.",
        "In Mexico, and many other countries, the threat of jail is not part of their public or their health policy.",
        "They generally consider drug addicts in the same as, you know, as alcoholics, that you don't put them in jail; you try to get them help.",
        "Well, can you see how, from the U.S.",
        "perspective, local--at least, border officials say that they're very alarmed by this, that they're afraid...",
        "I absolutely understand.",
        "I can understand why there's concern.",
        "Especially in part because somehow the reporting has come out that Mexico has legalized drugs, and it's kind of given the impression that you can come to Mexico and, you know, smoke a joint in front of a cop and nothing's going to happen.",
        "You will be detained.",
        "And once you've been detained, someone has to determine whether--one, where you were detained, if you were detained near a school or in a school, you will be prosecuted automatically, regardless of the amount of drugs you're carrying.",
        "And two, if the amount that you were carrying falls within the personal consumption quantity specified by the law; and three, if you're an addict.",
        "Because you have to be able to claim that you're an addict.",
        "So, if it's worthwhile running the risk to consume drugs and face this process in Mexico, well, you know, it'd be much easier to do this in Mexico than in the United States.",

        "Thank you very much.",

        "I mean, talks sort of fell apart.",
        "After meeting with their top Rabbi and what it calls its Council of Torah Sages, they decided against joining any coalition.",

        "An increase in funding for ultra-Orthodox families and children, and a guarantee that the division of Jerusalem wouldn't be negotiated in any peace talks with the Palestinians.",
        "Shas strongly opposes any potential division of Jerusalem in talks, and the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of any future state.",
        "So Shas felt that it just wasn't getting what it wanted, and it said no.",
        "So what effect will this have on the ongoing peace negotiations with the Palestinians?",
        "Well, it effectively puts them in limbo.",
        "I mean, the US-supported Annapolis peace talks are really in tatters.",
        "It's been almost a year since those talks were restarted.",
        "There's been almost no discernible and substantive progress in those talks.",
        "And in theory, Alison, the talks will continue with this caretaker prime minister, Ehud Olmert.",
        "But in fact, most here believe talks will be effectively put on hold for the next four or five months as Israel now heads for new general elections.",
        "And with a minute to go, I want to ask you one more question.",
        "Will you explain why this move for early general elections - snap elections, as you put them - could pave the way for the political return of a familiar name, Benjamin Netanyahu?",
        "Well, that's right.",
        "He's the leader of the opposition right-wing Likud Party.",
        "He's been calling for early elections.",
        "And he's led in some early opinion polls.",
        "So he's expected to do pretty well in any early vote, according to these polls.",
        "And apparently Shas thinks it can get a better deal from Benjamin Netanyahu if Likud does well in these elections.",
        "He opposes sweeping territorial compromises in talks with the Palestinians and opposes the division of Jerusalem.",
        "And he increased funding for the ultra-Orthodox when he was prime minister, but cut funding when he was finance minister.",
        "So we'll just have to see what kind of deal they get.",
        "But four months or so from now, it could really be back to where we are right now in Israeli politics with this fundamental Shas party again playing kingmaker in any coalition talks, either with Netanyahu or with Livni, and demanding again more funding and guarantees about Jerusalem."
