        "This is the evidence that they're presenting to a court on which to take people's private property from them and to commit a fraud on the court either in an individual case, which is serious enough but to do it in a raft of cases, we thought, was a very serious problem and it violates our consumer protection laws.",

        "That's true.",

        "Yeah, I mean the mortality rates for congestive heart failure in the lowest cost hospital was 10.8 percent and in the highest-cost hospital it was 9.8 percent.",
        "So you're saying the ranges, whether 10 people or 11 people did not make it through treatment - which does sound pretty small - and the range of cost can be what you described as eight or nine fold in terms of cost?",
        "Right, there's a much bigger difference in dollars.",
        "So, if people are prone to think that, you know, some hospital must be good because people pay a lot to go there and be treated, that would be misguided, and to think that because that hospital is cheap doesn't mean you're going to some low-rent medical facility.",
        "That is true.",
        "And I think that when you're going to a hospital, if you have the luxury of looking at the cost that it would be important to look at their quality measures as well, not just cost as a predictor of the type of care you're going to get.",
