        "We keep hearing that the reason why people felt this quake widespread because it was on a single plate, is that right?",
        "Well, it's - it's what's known as an intraplate earthquake, meaning that it's an earthquake that happened very far away from one of the Earth's major tectonic plate boundaries.",
        "So here on the East Coast, we're not on a plate boundary.",
        "We're, in fact, very far away from the nearest plate boundary.",
        "And so that makes this earthquake somewhat unique, and that's also why it was somewhat surprising.",
        "We tend to feel earthquakes, more commonly, closer to plate boundaries.",
        "So we're not on a fault line that's on a plate boundary.",
        "It's just the plate shaking of its own, nothing bumping into it, sliding under it, anything like that?",
        "Well, you basically need two things for an earthquake.",
        "You need a plane of weakness, and that could be something like a fault embedded in the rock, and then, you need force on that plane to drive that sudden release of energy.",
        "And here on the East Coast, we do have faults in the rock that are left over from previous cycles of tectonic activity a long time ago.",
        "So millions of years ago, the East Coast was very much like the current West Coast in that it was the site of an active plate boundary.",
        "And so we do have faults left over from that time, that if they're under sufficient stress can slip and produce earthquakes, like the one we felt last Tuesday.",
        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow talking with Dr. Diana C.",
        "Roman, a geophysicist.",
        "We're talking about the earthquake earlier that most of us felt.",
        "And would it be true to say that these are happening all the time, of this magnitude or little less, and this is just one that we happen to feel?",
        "They are happening, certainly not of this magnitude, but there have been reports of smaller earthquakes on the East Coast in recent years.",
        "And also, historically, there have been large-magnitude earthquakes on the East Coast.",
        "Most recently, actually, in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006, there was a magnitude seven that was felt along the west coast of Florida.",
        "Further back in history, some very famous events, the 1883 earthquake in Charleston, South Carolina, was a 7.1, and that did actually quite a lot of damage and resulted in a number of fatalities.",
        "So the large events are rare, as they are everywhere on Earth.",
        "The bigger the earthquake, the less frequently it occurs.",
        "And that's the same on the East Coast, but they're even more rare here.",
        "But we do also have small earthquakes occurring occasionally that we detect with seismic instrumentation on the East Coast, as well as on the West Coast.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "You know, something that to my own personal view is really astounding, is that I remember back in 1985 we had an earthquake that I felt in - well, living in Connecticut, and we had a hurricane that same year...",

        "Nobody can defend a practice of filing false and fraudulent affidavits with the courts in this country.",
