        "Companies are working on new versions of Exenatide that don't need to be injected and some day there may be a once-a-week form of the drug.",

        "Is there any connection, Dr. Roman?",
        "Well, fracking is a somewhat controversial process that is used to extract natural gases from the earth.",
        "Basically, it's done by pumping fluids into the ground to break up the rock and make it easier to get into all the little pockets of natural gas that are isolated, to help push them out.",
        "It does produce earthquakes.",
        "Most of the time, those are very small earthquakes, but occasionally, they are felt earthquakes.",
        "Recently, there was a swarm in Arkansas - felt earthquakes.",
        "Also several decades ago in Colorado, there was some deep pumping that produced several sizable earthquakes.",
        "And this why fracking is controversial, because we don't know about the possibility of the fracking process to trigger a large earthquake.",
        "We tend to associate it with small earthquakes, but it is possible that, under the right conditions, we might get a larger earthquake.",
        "Is anybody studying that possible relationship?",
        "Yes.",
        "Of course, this is something that's definitely being studied and certainly...",

        "Well, because we'd like to - I'm glad to hear you're doing it because you're an independent researcher.",
        "It is a process and a phenomenon that is certainly being discussed in light of some of the recent observations of seismicity related to fracking.",

        "Well, most of the seismicity that's associated with fluid pumping into the ground is really small, magnitude three or less, and that's below the threshold of what you would be likely to feel.",
        "But there have been fours, fives that are thought to have been related to pumping of fluids underground, although, again, that's rarer than the smaller events, but it is possible.",
        "And with the increase with fracking going around the country, we might see more of those events.",
        "It is possible.",
        "Yes.",

        "But I think in general, you know, the way we move forward in understanding natural processes is by getting more observations.",
        "And so really having more seismometers, having more computational power to process data is really what's going to help us understand some of these things and move our ability to explain and, ideally, forecast these events forward.",
        "And hardware is usually the first that gets cut, though, in budgets.",
        "It is, but, you know, it's - science is expensive, and that's the reality.",
        "You know, it's not only the instruments themselves but also the transportation, the labor, the maintenance and so on.",
