        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Now, from what we hear, this is something almost predictable, that the - that animals do react to these events.",
        "Well, I mean, animals are so incredibly sensitive to their environments.",
        "They have to be.",
        "So the fact that they can sense something of this magnitude coming, you know, seconds or minutes before we can, I don't think that's surprising to many of us.",
        "It isn't, because you work with them and you see this.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "One of my favorite stories is that Mandara, the mother gorilla, her baby who's a little over 2 years old, was away from her and she actually gave an alarm call a few seconds before.",
        "The first thing she did was grab her baby and then run for the top of the trees.",
        "And then the lemurs, actually, the lemurs gave a warning.",
        "They began sending out alarm calls about 15 minutes before the earthquake struck.",
        "15 minutes.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Wow.",
        "Well - and we actually noticed that - and this is earthquake happened during the day, so we weren't - we didn't see a lot of - we didn't necessarily see our animals beforehand.",
        "We weren't anticipating that something would happen, but we do know from the earthquake that happened last year that our elephants - actually, about 15 minutes before that, it was about 15 to 20 minutes before, our elephants started acting strangely.",
        "So they had their ears up, their tail up, they were in alert, listening posture.",
        "So we know that that happened with the elephants as well.",
        "Isn't there any way - I mean, this is - you know, in science, they would say this is anecdotal evidence, right?",
        "They might be considered a coincidence.",
        "They're not - you know, they're, you know, looking at it, there's no experiment going on.",
        "Is there any kind of study you could do to try to test for this scientifically?",
        "You know, the hard thing of doing the study has to be something that you can replicate, so it's really hard to create an earthquake in a laboratory condition.",
        "So that's - the difficulty with this is that a lot of times as we go, we look at the earthquake when it happened and we gather that information in hindsight.",
        "One of the great things about having animals in a zoo is that we can learn from them, so our - one of our primary goals is learning more about them so we can understand them better, so we can help save them and conserve them.",
        "So something like this is a really great opportunity for us to go back.",
        "So as soon as the earthquake went past, the first thing we did was say, what happened with your animals?",
        "What did you notice before, during and after the earthquake?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number, if you like to call and talk about the animals at the zoo.",

        "The elephants.",

        "Well, there was - in 2000, there were some anecdotal evidence of elephants.",
        "Some people said that they saw elephants moving toward higher ground before the tsunami.",
        "One thing that we do - we have an extensive research program in Asia, studying Asian elephants and some of our elephants are radio-collared.",
        "So we actually have collars on our - we have collars on our elephants in Asia, so what we're able to do is to go back and to look and say, where did they move before and during the tsunami?",
        "We have an incredibly small sample size, so, like, we just had two elephants that were collared that we were able to look at, and we did not find any evidence that those elephants, those two elephants moving toward higher ground during that time.",
        "We actually found that one of our elephants actually moved slightly closer to the shore just before the tsunami, although she did move away afterwards.",
        "You know, there are - we always look back on earthquakes and things.",
        "There are cameras that were either security cameras turned on in banks, whatever, capturing the shaking the ground.",
        "Where there any such things like that in zoo, that you could look at the tape and see the animals moving or making sounds that would actually document what they did?",
        "Well, we're going through now and we're looking to see - we have webcams on a lot of our animals, so we're looking to see if we have any video footage.",
        "But the thing is, not only do we need the video, but we also need a time stamp video.",
        "So we're not finding that we have that, you know.",
        "But a lot of - we watch our animals for a specific behaviors.",
        "We record these behaviors usually in response to a certain stimulus.",

        "And 45 minutes later, I could feel the shaking.",
        "And right away, I was pretty sure that we had a Bay Area quake, partially because of knowing that animals reacted that way.",
        "Well, you know, that's a great comment.",
        "One thing that we did - actually, some of our keepers were walking on one of our exhibits, Asia Trail, and a lot of the people outdoor in that - outdoors in that area did not actually feel the quake, but they were walking and they heard the elephants making some unusual vocalizations.",
        "And then they heard - then they saw some of the trees shaking, some of the bushes shaking.",
        "And so a lot of us were wondering when the earthquake hit, we were - you know, is it the jet?",
        "Is it the truck?",
        "What could it be?",
        "But we almost did the same thing.",
        "You know, the animals - we were kind of listening to our animals and saying, what are they doing right now?",
        "And then when the ground started to move and we saw the bushes started to shake, we were able to piece it together a little quicker simply because we were reacting to our animals."
