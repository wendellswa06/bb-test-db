        "It's hard to say exactly how many and how many of those people have come back and haven't.",

        "Thirty-eight-thousand - what percentage of the student body is that that vanished?",
        "That's about a 10 percent enrollment decline in just one year.",
        "Wow.",
        "What does that mean for a school system that was built for a certain number of students, and they don't have them anymore?",

        "The ants then set across a simulated desert in a lab, and sure enough with shorter legs they took shorter steps.",
        "And they stopped short of their nest.",
        "That suggested that the ants are actually counting there steps.",
        "But Wolf says it doesn't prove the point."

        "They extended the ants legs by building stilts out of fine pig hairs and then gluing them on the end of the ant's legs.",
