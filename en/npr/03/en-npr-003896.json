        "And research shows that low-income students are far more likely to undermatch - to apply and attend schools that aren't as challenging or competitive - in part because they don't think they have what it takes to get it and because many don't even know what schools are out there.",

        "And then this summer, a lot of those schools that teachers were repairing and did reopen for a little while, well, they shut down because the government closed about 260 of the island's 1,100 schools.",
        "Wow.",
        "And that's because of that plunging enrollment, both before and after the storm, as many families left for the mainland United States.",

        "The repairs that happened were all just to get the power back on and not to actually improve it.",
        "And so one change that's on the way is that the governor announced early this year that he was going to privatize the electric grid, which is publicly run.",
        "It's been poorly run and maintained for decades, and the public electric utility is in massive debt.",
        "And Ricardo Rossello, the governor, said that the island-wide blackout was proof of how big of a mess the grid really was.",
        "And so he announced that privatization early this year.",

        "(Speaking Spanish).",
        "That was the governor speaking in a televised address.",
        "And he said that the government would sell the utility's assets to companies that would make the grid more modern and more efficient.",
        "And this was a hugely controversial move.",
        "But it was in line with much of the governor's messaging since the storm - mainly that as tragic as Hurricane Maria was, it has also presented opportunities to transform the island and its infrastructure.",

        "Well, one of the big issues is that Puerto Rico, although it's known for its beaches, it's actually a very mountainous island.",
        "And so after the hurricane, you had these crews of linemen and line workers who had to cut through really thick jungle to get to power poles in many cases.",

        "It's five times harder than normal in the United States doing the same job.",
        "And then, of course, another reason, Steve, that it took so long to get the power back was that, you know, Puerto Rico's government was just not prepared for the magnitude of the damage.",

        "The government now acknowledges that about 3,000 people probably died.",
        "But for months, it deliberately withheld data that would've helped researchers and journalists arrive at that number much more quickly.",
        "And that was something that was really painful for the relatives and friends of people who died - people like Ani Sanchez - that really hurt.",
        "If you were here and you saw your neighbors die because they couldn't go down the stairs because they were too old - old people left behind.",
