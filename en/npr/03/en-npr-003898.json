        "Here you have another example of not only a piece of video that might have been produced either by a professional shop or by an amateur that then gets virally distributed by people who like its message, and that's the wild card in this coming race, which is that the citizens are no longer passive receivers of content but are now actually distributors, and now producers too.",

        "It is clearly a very provocative new tool, and the political establishment, since 2004 with Howard Dean, has learned that it's very successful at raising money, but this year you're going to see it being very successful at activating people to vote and to actually do things in their communities.",
        "Now, your colleague, Mike Asifrey(ph), makes a distinction between online videos versus TV ads, and he says that they accomplish different things."
