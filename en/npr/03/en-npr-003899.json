        "That's correct.",
        "Most of the campaigns so far, including Hillary's own let's-have-a-conversation video, and even Barack Obama's initial introduction, are very much TV-like.",
        "They actually - when they see a video camera, they think they're look at - you know, it's a television interview.",
        "They're being interviewed for \"\"Meet the Press\"\" remotely.",
        "They don't realize that the Internet video is a much more fluid and more authentic type of media, and they don't have to be so scripted.",
        "In fact, Hillary had to defend the fact that the furniture behind her was actually her real living room and not something that she had set up.",
        "So there are examples of other candidates who have learned that this is a different kind of medium.",
        "One of them is actually a British member of parliament by the name of David Cameron.",
        "You can see his site at webcameron.org.uk, and he is a conservative member of parliament who is very effectively basically inviting people to travel with him as he represents his constituents.",
        "Talking with Andrew Rasiej this hour on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News, talking about the Internet as politics.com.",
        "Do they have different strategies, or I mean, are all these ad people from the same cloth?",
        "Well, most of the campaigns are still, as I mentioned earlier, top-down operations, but some of them have started to incorporate some interesting functionalities on their sites.",
        "Barack Obama, for example, has a MySpace-like social network that he's trying to build, and John Edwards has an invitation for people to submit video blogs on his site.",
        "It's not really clear yet whether or not the social networks on a campaign's own site are going to be as powerful as the ones that already exist just out in the public - MySpace, for example, and Facebook, where Barack Obama has hundreds of thousands of supporters, and he's really taken off in the social-networking environment.",
        "So here's another example of where campaigns have to learn when they should try to build it themselves or when they should just use what's already out there.",
        "You know, we have a year and a half to go until this election, and that's a millennium on the Internet in terms of development.",
        "Exactly.",
        "You're going to see videos on mobile phones.",
        "You're going to see text-messaging advocacy, where you're going to get text messaging sent to a supporter.",
        "You're going to see Google mash-ups, where people are going to take voter files and they're going to be able to make Google maps so you can actually create a walking tour through your neighborhood and find Democrats registered or Republican registered, then you might go knock on their door and make sure that they get out to the polls for the primary."

        "You're going to see a lot of these tools, but there's really two very distinct schools in the way technology and politics collide.",
        "One school is the school that considers technology as a new tool in top-down politics.",
        "We have a message, we're going to deliver it now through this new medium, and that's pretty much what you're seeing through the political operatives, the campaigns, the political organizations, the parties themselves.",
        "But there's another school that believes this technology offers an opportunity for a more robust and participatory democracy, more transparency.",
        "For example, there's a fantastic organization in Washington, D.C.",
        "called the sunlightfoundation.com that's using technology to expose corruption in Congress by putting massive amounts of data online for citizens to sift through it and connect the dots, go through the earmarks, see who's giving money, see who's getting the benefit and who's not.",
        "These kinds of tools were not available before, so you're seeing a disintermediation of politics, very much the same way that the music industry saw a disintermediation when Napster came along, and even though they shut it down, the genie was out of the bottle, and digital distribution has fundamentally changed the music industry.",
        "You're going to see the same things happening in the world of politics.",
        "Does that mean that the Internet-savvy people are going to be the more involved people?",
        "Well, Internet-savvy people certainly are going to be more involved, but there's a mistake also in thinking that the Internet's only going to be used to reach people who are on the Internet.",
        "The Internet's going to be used to dictate the pulse and the pace of the campaign, and traditional media types are going to actually be spending their time following the Internet themselves and getting a lot of their information on the Internet, making judgments, which will then be reported in traditional media.",
        "So the Internet actually is kind of like the ringmaster.",
        "So it's like what happened with the anti-Hillary ad.",
        "The traditional medium reacted.",
        "That came first, and they had to react to that.",
        "They didn't start it.",
        "Well, you know, it's not so easy - you can create a great video, and it's not all of a sudden get a million people to watch it.",
        "What happened there was that the creator, Phil, before he was known, had sent it MyDD, which is a very well-known, progressive blog, and a lot of people responded to it, and it got of a lot of attention, and then it got virally distributed, and then when it got pointed to by Drudge, the mainstream media said, hey, look what's happening here.",
        "So it's not that every single one of these videos is going to take off like that, but even if you produce one small one, and a thousand people find it provocative and it moves them to the polls, that's an effect.",
        "So it's a very interesting time to be involved in politics."
