        "But it is a big number, especially given the potential for violence yesterday, which did occur, by the way.",
        "One woman - a nurse, age 61 - was shot dead when men on motorbikes opened fire into a crowd of Venezuelans at a polling booth.",

        "And they fear that it will then go on to destroy what remains of the democratic institutions in Venezuela - notably, the national legislature, which has been undermined by the Supreme Court for a very long time now.",
        "But they're worried that'll be eliminated, and there'll be no more elections and Venezuela will become an all-out dictatorship.",
        "Wow.",
        "So it sounds like this vote is not going to change Maduro's plans to rewrite the constitution or move forward with this at all.",
        "Well, I think they hope that this will lead to a lot of pressure on him to cancel the vote.",
        "We don't know whether he will.",
        "International pressure will likely intensify.",
        "And they're trying to undermine the credibility of the exercise and perhaps create rifts, which are believed to exist within the establishment, although large rifts have yet to emerge."
