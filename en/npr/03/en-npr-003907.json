        "That's right, and now there are reports from Nepal, where melting glaciers have caused flash flooding, frequent landslides, food problems and deaths on a scale that really has never been seen before.",
        "It seems that some of these glacial lakes in remote mountain villages are rapidly filling up with--you know, as the glacier melts, the water comes down, fills the lake up, swelling it in some cases to seven times their normal size, and bursting and causing what are called outburst floods and wiping out lives and property.",
        "And Dr. James Hansen, one of the world's leading climate scientists, said this week that the world has just one decade to get its act together and limit the release of greenhouse gases, because if the temperature rises just one more degree Celsius, the Earth would go into a climate pattern it hasn't seen in half a million years, and that is unchartered territory.",

        "And the great physiologist, Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon was famous for calling this the fight and flight reaction that I'm sure almost all of your listeners have heard about.",
        "So the animal was faced with this sudden threat, and the choice is run or fight.",
        "In both cases, what that animal needs is a fast heartbeat, a lot of blood pumped to the muscles and so on.",
