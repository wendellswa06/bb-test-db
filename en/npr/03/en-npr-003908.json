        "Now of course that's the obverse.",

        "I can't imagine a more stressful situation than that.",
        "And there was a nephew present in the room, and apparently he said your Uncle Cheng just died, I shall now die.",
        "And in fact - Eng was his name, in fact did die, dropped dead.",
        "And those bodies were actually taken to Philadelphia.",
        "An autopsy was performed there, and anybody who visits the Academy of Medicine in Philadelphia can actually see the plaster cast that was made there and the autopsy report that was done.",
        "So that's a really famous case of two important characters, one of whom died of this phenomenon that Walter Cannon called voodoo death."
