        "Well, I am.",

        "And he's with us on a studio from AEI.",
        "And first, Sharon, is this what's different with this new START treaty?",
        "What changes?",
        "This new START treaty was thought of as an interim agreement.",
        "The original START treaty expired at the end of December, 2009, and although the Bush administration had negotiated a strategic arms control treaty, there were no verification measures in that treaty, which we call the Moscow Treaty.",
        "So it was very important to get a new START treaty that had verification measures, that brought down the levels even a little more, and this treaty represents I guess a reduction in 30 percent of the warheads.",
        "But I've read that given the aging parts of the Soviet, the old Soviet system, this is nothing the Soviets, the Russians wouldnt have had to do anyway.",
        "Exactly, and this should've been probably a little easier than it actually was, although I think we're all glad, or most of us are glad, that this treaty was signed today.",
        "Tom Donnelly, what's different?",
        "Not enough, unfortunately.",
        "Neal, you used the phrase both sides (clears throat) - pardon me - in talking to Ted Koppel, and I think that sort of underlines the fact, at least to me, that this is a very backward-looking treaty in the sense that it reprises the old bilateral world, bipolar world, that we used to live in through the years of the Cold War, whereas the world we live in today and the world of the future is a more complex, probably less stable and with an increasing number of nuclear powers much different balance of terror, if indeed there still exists a balance of terror.",
        "Yet at President Obama said, and I think it's accurate, 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia - that's it."

        "Well, it doesn't take too many nuclear weapons to make a mess.",
        "So the numbers are important but not as important as who has what and what the geopolitical effects of those arsenals are.",
        "Compared to the giant stockpiles that both the United States and the Soviet Union had during the Cold War, these recent reductions may be pretty modest, but compared to the old arsenals, we've come down a long way.",
        "And the question is, as we reduce, are there others not just terrorists but other states who think their interests are served by having even pretty small nuclear arsenals, and certainly the evidence of proliferation over the last decade or so pretty strongly suggests that other people see utility in nuclear weapons, even if we don't.",
        "Neal, if I could just jump in for a moment to sort of underline something that Tom Donnelly is saying - if you look at India and Pakistan, for example, you're looking at two nations that probably each has about 70 nuclear warheads.",
        "The danger of a nuclear war in that part of the world is probably greater at this time than it is anywhere else in the world, and believe me, those 70 nuclear warheads on either side could create a human tragedy the likes of which we've never seen.",
        "And as we look ahead, Sharon Squassoni, to this treaty we're going to talk about the NPR, the Nuclear Posture Review, and the ways the United States may has decided it may use or not use these weapons in the future, and the changes and what matters there.",
        "But as you look at this treaty in itself, isn't it a good idea?",
        "The last START treaty expired in December.",
        "Isn't it a good thing just to have another treaty?",
        "It's necessary but not sufficient, and here I would agree with Tom.",
        "More needs to be done, and actually that Nuclear Posture Review, or the NPR, as we call it in the arms-control community, talks about reducing, about next steps with Russia, and a key area will be reduction of tactical nuclear weapons.",
        "We want this very much.",
        "The Russians have a lot of tactical nuclear weapons.",
        "So I would say this treaty is a good start.",
        "I would say in terms of reducing the nuclear weapons threat, it does less than it does for politics and non-proliferation, and by that I mean that it was a critical part of resetting the U.S.",
        "relationship with Russia, which was at an all-time low, and it was critical as a demonstration of the Obama administration's, and the Medvedev administration's, commitment to disarmament, which is key to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and getting what we want there.",

        "Well, I was a missile officer during the '60s and - in a silo, and they have silos in Wyoming, Montana, parts of Nebraska.",
        "I always felt that there were people with good enough sense that we would have never launched a missile at all.",
        "And my question is: What security measures are they going to take going forward where bad guys aren't going to get a hold of a nuclear dirty bomb and set it off in downtown Wyoming or whatever?",
        "What security measures are they going to take when somebody like North Korea says I'm going to do whatever I want and this treaty doesn't mean anything to me?",
        "Well, that gets to the NPR, the Nuclear Posture Review, and we're going to get to that in just a second.",
        "But Ted, in the few seconds we have left before the break, John is talking about the nightmare scenario that's much more likely, sadly, than the use of any of these strategic weapons.",
        "No, I think John's absolutely right, although I'd love to have a conversation with him over a beer sometime to figure out what he would've done if that order had come down to launch and he's sitting there with that key.",
        "Well, I always felt that there was enough good sense in the upper command - we wouldn't have done it.",
        "Okay, but I mean the point John makes, the larger point, is the one I was trying to make before when I said if - you know, the bomb we have to worry about now is the one that comes in somebody's backpack or a suitcase or is even sent by UPS or Federal Express.",
        "John, thanks very much for the call, and we appreciate the time you spent down at the bottom of that silo, hoping that nothing ever happened.",

        "And the nuclear review, Tom Donnelly, what's fundamentally changed here?",
        "Well, I think the big headline is that we're not going to modernize our arsenal.",
        "And I think, actually that's, at least to me, the most significant and most worrisome development of the advance of this week.",
        "And next, there's going to be a nuclear summit in Washington.",
        "I think Defense Secretary Gates is on record, and I think he sort of speaks for the majority of defense folks when he said that reducing the arsenal to these levels as specified in the treaty was acceptable if we could only update the remaining weapons that we have and ensure by testing that they were safe and reliable.",
        "So, we've gone down to the numbers in the treaty, and I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing, but the legacy Cold War arsenal that we have is less and less useful, flexible or valuable in this world that we see coming.",
        "And so, the posture review is really kind of the therefore clause of the overall policy.",
        "And so far, it looks like the administration is not going to do anything serious on that front, and I think that's really going to be a problem.",
        "Sharon Squassoni, the president's political base would've found it difficult to authorize a new generation of nuclear weapons.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think this posture review is quite careful to say we are going to maintain our nuclear arsenal.",
        "We're going to do all the things we need to do, life-extension programs, but we're not going to build new warheads that have new missions or new capabilities.",
        "And I think that shouldn't be a surprise at all.",
        "This was clearly President Obama's view going in."

        "On the other hand, it does contain quite a bit of money for the nuclear weapons complex, and that may make some of his more-liberal supporters not very happy because right now, we spend about $54 billion a year on our nuclear weapons and what we call nuclear security, all told.",
        "And Ted Koppel, there are going to be others within the president's base unhappy that the policy doesn't simply state that the only possible use for nuclear weapons is to deter other nuclear weapon state, and that the United States would never use them first.",
        "Well, our experts will correct me if for some reason I misstate anything.",
        "It's my recollection that we have largely had that as a policy.",
        "We would we would never be the first to use nuclear weapons.",
        "Where I think this new policy alters that a little bit is that it says we would not even use nuclear weapons in the event that we were attacked with weapons of mass destruction, like biological weapons or chemical weapons.",
        "I think the phrase we're missing here is strategic ambiguity, and Tom Donnelly, if I'm correct, the previous statements on this first use were ambiguous.",
        "Yes, but sort of with an edge to them, if you will.",
        "It was certainly the case at the height of the Cold War when the conventional balance in Europe was thought to be heavily in favor of the Soviets, that we did have a first use policy, essentially.",
        "It's also worth remembering, not just as a hypothetical but as and I'm sure Ted Koppel will remember this in 1991, just prior to the first Gulf War, there was a famous meeting between Secretary of State James Baker and Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, which...",
