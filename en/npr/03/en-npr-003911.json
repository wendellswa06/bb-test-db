        "Doesn't that encourage some terrorist-sponsoring states and terrorists to use nuclear weapons on us because they think that we will not know where they are coming from?",
        "And the second question is: What is the nuclear posture that you talk about in terms of deterring this type of an attack on us?",
        "Well, Sharon Squassoni, what does it say?",
        "Well, this is kind of a complicated topic, but the U.S.",
        "and others have been engaged in research on what we call nuclear forensics.",
        "I think we're pretty certain that after an explosion, we might be able to actually detect where the material came from.",
        "What purpose is served, or what objectives would a terrorist organization have in, you know, exploding a nuclear device on U.S.",
        "soil or against U.S.",
        "forces somewhere and not claiming attribution?",
        "I mean, the problem I think that you're getting at is, you know, how do you deter a terrorist?",
        "And the answer is, it's very difficult.",
        "So what you really need to do is make it very, very difficult for terrorists ever to get their hands on either nuclear weapons, nuclear material or radioactive material.",
        "And that is the subject of the Nuclear Security Summit that's going to be happening in Washington next week.",
        "Just down the street here in Washington.",
        "Thank you for the call, Morty.",
        "Tom Donnelly, there is an exception on the use the United States says it will never use nuclear weapons against a country that is in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but then also says, well, and there's a special exception for you, Iran and North Korea.",
        "Well, that kind of undercuts the, you know, the guarantees, the negative assurance as the administration is calling it.",
        "It's also worth recalling that in 1991, Iraq was also a signatory to the NPT, and it wasn't until after the war that they were formally found to be in violation of it.",
        "So, look, it is in some ways reassuring that there are these caveats and exceptions, but that also suggests that maybe this wasn't a great declaratory policy to have in the first place.",
        "You know, if you're not North Korea or Iran, but you're some other nuclear state, and you can't tell, you know, whether you're on the hit list or not, possibly that makes your decision-making process more opaque.",
        "But the point of the United States security guarantees and the point of our nuclear deterrent is to make it as clear and as unambiguous as possible.",
        "Let's get Paul(ph) on the line, Paul calling from Moab in Utah.",
        "Hi, I'd like to know if what and if this policy has any effect on the relationship we have with Israel concerning their nuclear weapons and our no-ask-no-tell policy as to how many they have and if that's even addressed at all in this policy or the upcoming one that's next week."

        "It seems to be addressed in the very careful formulation of states in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.",

        "Sharon, you're shaking your head.",

        "And there could be countries - and nor is Iran for that matter, although it signed the NPT, it's not in good standing.",
        "So I don't think that this NPR changes anything towards our policies toward Israel.",
        "But it does highlight the fact that we place great stock in not just membership with the NPT but compliance and that we're going to reward in a certain way those countries that play by the rules.",

        "All the cases that we've just mentioned are cases of people who think that their security lies in the possession of their own nuclear deterrent or nuclear weapons and the Non-Proliferation Treaty doesn't seem to suit their needs and the number of quest - countries on that list who take exemption is growing, and even those that are signatory countries are both expanding and modernizing their arsenals."

        "But it's more than just - it's 60 - it requires 67 votes, I believe, in the Senate.",
        "And I would flip the question right over to Tom Donnelly because I think if - there may be as much opposition on the left flank of the Democratic Party as there will be on the right flank of the Republican Party.",
        "Tom, what do you think?",
        "I can't actually speak for the Democratic left.",

        "I do think that there needs to - that in the minds of senators, and particularly informed Republican senators, there is a link between the START treaty, nuclear modernization and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.",
        "So I think the Senate is favorably disposed, and certainly people like Senator Kyl or - sort of think that the outcome could have been worse, just to put it in stark terms, but they also want to see a serious commitment to revamping and modernizing the nuclear weapons arsenal and they're nervous that this is a first step toward a testing treaty.",
        "And so I think, if you will, just looking at the crass politics of it, the price of ratification probably includes some concessions on both the modernization and in testing front.",
