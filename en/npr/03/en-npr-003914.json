        "They wanted to kill us, and the German police and politicians did nothing about it.",

        "One recent study concludes that some 193,000 Turks left Germany to come home between 2007 and 2011.",
        "The most commonly cited reasons were better job prospects in Turkey and discrimination in Germany.",
        "Yucel Yolcu was a member of the 36 Boys gang, named after the postal code of a tough Berlin neighborhood where many of them grew up.",
        "But one day, he decided that he was never going to get work in films if he stayed in a drug-and-violence-prone gang.",

        "Yolcu wound up in Istanbul, sleeping on a friend's couch and trying to break into the film business.",
        "It was around that time that he began a new, unexpected process of adjustment.",
        "For all his effort to cling to a Turkish identity while in Germany, he now found that in some ways these Turks were utter foreigners to him.",
        "He was surprised to find a Germanic desire for order welling up in him one day while walking down Istanbul's teeming downtown thoroughfare, with masses of people jostling this way and that.",

        "Over time, Yolcu grew to embrace the relative chaos of Turkey and now feels at home here.",

        "If you want something new to talk about, how about black holes?",
        "And there's some interesting news about black holes.",
        "You know, they don't just come in one size.",
        "It's just like the three bears, black holes can be really big or really small, and it's that middle-sized one that has eluded astronomers until now.",
        "Tucked into the reams of data from the European spacecraft XMM-Newton that has beamed back to Earth all that data is evidence of a new type of black hole, the size of which falls somewhere between the really big ones called, appropriately, super-massive black holes, and the much smaller stellar-mass black holes.",
        "And joining me now to talk about the evidence for this new kind of black hole is Sean Farrell.",
        "He is the XMM-Newton catalog scientist in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Leicester in the U.K.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Well, thank you very much, Ira.",

        "Well, for a long time, astronomers have theorized that there might be something in between the small ones, as you put it, and the super-massive ones.",
        "Now there have been lots and lots of claims put forward of discoveries of ones in this intermediate-mass range, these middle-sized ones, but until this discovery, we haven't really had any strong evidence.",
        "And it's not really been well-accepted by the other astronomers.",
        "Tell us about the spacecraft, the XMM-Newton.",
        "What does - what is its mission?",
        "Well, XMM-Newton is the European Space Agency's premier space telescope.",
        "It's an enormous space telescope that observes in X-rays, and it's actually in many ways similar and yet complementary to NASA's Chandra space telescope.",
        "And it carries two main instruments in X-rays, and one of them which is an imaging instrument, the EPIC camera, and also an optical monitor, an optical telescope.",
        "And we use the data from the EPIC X-ray camera in a catalog that we actually helped build called the 2XMM Serendipitous Source Catalogue.",
        "And we were looking for white dwarves and neutron stars, and that's when we found, accidentally, this black hole.",
        "Now is it important that you found this middle-sized black hole?",
        "Well, yes, I think it is.",
        "The issue for quite a while has been, why don't we have something between the stellar-mass and the super-massive black holes?",
        "You know, if we have a small one and we have a really big one, why don't we have one in the middle?",
        "And up until recently, there's been a lot of conjecture by the astronomers and the theorists as to how you would get one in between.",
        "And I think that providing strong evidence that they actually exist, whether or not we can explain how they form, you know, actually finding one is going to sort of tip the balance on that one.",
        "Over the last few days, Syria's government and its allies have begun an offensive in northern Syria that the United Nations is warning could become a bloodbath.",
        "This is in the last major rebel-held area, the province of Idlib.",
        "But the area's also home to millions of civilians, many of them refugees who fled fighting in other parts of the country.",

        "So there's these massive convoys of tanks and artillery and fighters amassing on its southern border.",
