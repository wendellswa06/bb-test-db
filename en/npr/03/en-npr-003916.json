        "Yeah, and do we think that black holes are at the center of many galaxies, including our Milky Way, now?",
        "Yes, I think that there's a lot of very strong evidence to indicate that the objects at the middle of these galaxies, and perhaps all galaxies, perhaps not all galaxies, but certainly in the case of many of them, we can actually measure the velocity of stars around these galaxy centers.",
        "And from that you can work out the mass of the central object.",
        "And in many cases, this comes out to be millions or billions of times the mass of the sun, which is far too massive to explain for any object other than a black hole.",
        "Is there a limiting factor on how massive a black hole can be?",
        "I suppose there probably is, but I'm not sure we've actually reached it yet.",
        "I think that the mass that a black hole can reach is going to be pretty much set by the amount of material that surrounds it.",
        "So for the case of a stellar-mass black hole, which is formed when a very massive star explodes, its initial mass is set by the mass range you can have for stars.",
        "You could have stars that maybe weigh up to, you know, 50 to 100 times the mass of the sun.",
        "And if you go back to the very early range of stars, the first stars to form after the universe was created, the Big Bang, then you can get even more massive stars.",
        "But the mass that the black hole can attain is really limited by how much material it can swallow, which will swell its mass.",
        "Now I understand that you're getting watching time on the Chandra tomorrow.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "That is correct, yes.",
        "We've been very lucky to be granted time on the Chandra space telescope by NASA to observe this, to really lock down its location so that we can then follow it up with a range of other ground-based and space-based telescopes.",
        "Well, we're hoping we can, actually.",
        "It's funny you should ask that.",
        "The thing about this object, it's so far away.",
        "It's 290-million light years away.",
        "So we can see the galaxy quite clearly in a relatively, with a relatively large telescope, but we don't really expect to detect any stars that are around this particular object.",
        "They're going to be too faint in optical wavelengths.",
        "So if it is actually in, say, a binary system with another star, then we won't see that other star.",
        "But it must be feeding somehow because we can see it very brightly in X-rays.",
        "So the question is, if it's feeding, from all the objects that we've seen, from galaxies to stellar-mass black holes, they always form disks around them, almost always, I should say.",
        "So you get this accretion disk forming around it, and that disk, as I said, gets very, very hot.",
        "And it also emits a lot of energy in other wavelengths, including ultraviolet.",
        "So Hubble would potentially be very, very good to look at this and see if we can see the signature of the accretion disk and see the near ultraviolet wavelengths."

        "We're talking about future telescopes like the Webb telescope that's going to follow the Hubble.",
        "Would that be able to see any better, see these kinds of objects?",
        "Well, to be honest, I don't know much about the James Webb telescope, but I do understand it's a significant advance from Hubble.",
        "So I'm certain that if we expect to be able to study it well with Hubble, we'll certainly be able to do better with the Webb telescope.",
        "And what more do you need to more about this one, no matter how you look at it?",
        "Well, I think detecting the accretion disk is probably the first step for us.",
        "That's where we're going now.",
        "That will allow us to characterize what's actually going on and actually put sort of more of a final nail in the coffin to prove that it is really is a black hole in the intermediate-mass range.",
        "But there are other studies we can do, but we're going to be limited somewhat by the current range of instrumentation that's available.",
        "One test that would be really good to do would be to study emission lines in the X-ray spectrum.",
        "These are typically seen in sort of stellar-mass and supper-massive black-hole spectra at an energy range that is well-suited to the instrumentation we have.",
        "But we don't have a telescope that's sensitive enough to actually detect this at this point.",
        "Now these emission lines, particularly due to heavily ionized iron gas that's very close to the black hole, they show up as a certain signature.",
        "Now if it's close to the black hole, it can be strongly affected by the gravity of the black hole, and it actually skews it a bit.",
        "It makes it distort the signal.",
        "So if we can study that and see that, that's again, you know, very strong evidence that we've got a very massive black hole, but currently we can't do that with XMM-Newton.",
