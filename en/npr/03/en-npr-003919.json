        "We actually count moos.",
        "If you're a McDonald's client, you're allowed to have three cattle out of 100 mooing in the stunning area, and if more than three cattle out of 100 moo, you fail the audit, period.",
        "And that resulted in huge change because it forced people to manage those facilities.",
        "And that's not the only change you had to make.",
        "You were obviously really good at some of these skills, seeing those things in pictures and three dimensions.",
        "The social skills, well, those were much more difficult for you to manage.",
        "Well, I have to learn social skills sort of like being in a play.",
