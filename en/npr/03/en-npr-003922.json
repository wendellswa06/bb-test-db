        "But we're what we call short-grass country, and that buffalo grass has never taken off.",
        "It's just laying there dormant, and we're out of grass, and so what really faces our ranchers in this country is last year with the drought that we have, they managed through that, probably culled the lower one-third of the cow crop off and early-weaned some calves.",
        "Now we're coming back with the same issue, year two, and instead of early weaning - we're early-weaning calves, but instead of trying to cull another third, we're going to have some herd liquidation issues.",
        "So people selling off their cattle, I guess getting out of the business.",
        "Totally, yeah, and, you know, the thing about it is, the local livestock barns have been - normally don't operate in July.",
        "And there's cattle coming to town on a weekly basis.",
        "And so summer months is when they have a sale once every two weeks, once every three weeks, and now they're having sales every week, and it's just because there's no grass.",
        "The producer doesn't - the farmer, the rancher, we have had no rainfall.",
        "You know, and we're in a climate of less than 25 inches of rainfall annually.",
        "So a big difference, you know, in terms of our climate to a lot of other places within the United States.",
        "And so, these cattle, you know, and the people that are buying them, we're weaning the calves - early-weaning the calves.",
        "They're going to a background yard.",
        "And the cows are going to slaughter.",
        "There's no grass to turn them back out on.",
        "And we - there is one outfit coming up out of Texas, which droughts out a year ago and buying a few cows, but they're still not out of that problem that they had a year ago, in 2011, either, so...",
        "And as people look at last summer and this summer, and, well, everybody knows the general outlook, for the next four years anyway.",
        "What are people...?",
        "Right now, what's winning is the time slot, strangely enough.",
        "We're so used to hearing about people watching television on DVR, recorded, or they're watching it on their smartphones, or they're watching it on their tablets.",
        "But what we discovered this fall is that when a show airs on primetime still matters.",

        "And \"\"The Voice\"\" is funneling this huge audience to \"\"The Blacklist,\"\" and it's become a success.",
        "And, in fact, it's really damaged a show on CBS that airs against it called \"\"Hostages\"\" that is also kind of similar.",
        "And people thought that show would do better and it isn't, because \"\"The Blacklist\"\" is getting this huge audience from \"\"The Voice.",
        "OK, Eric.",
        "So, time slot is still important, which will surprise a lot of people because, of course, we all think now everyone is recording shows on their DVRs and watching them when they want to watch them, in their own time.",
        "No, and what we discovered this fall is that people are still hanging out on a network.",
        "For example, if you look on Thursday nights, Thursday nights on CBS is started with \"\"The Big Bang Theory,\"\" which is a really popular show, and it is funneling a whole lot of viewers through that whole night.",
        "And it leads to a show called \"\"The Crazy Ones,\"\" with Robin Williams.",

        "So, Robin Williams plays this very charismatic, but slightly unhinged ad exec.",
        "And he runs an advertising firm with his daughter, who's played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, who's more buttoned-down.",
        "And the appeal of Robin Williams coming back to television was huge and drew a lot of people.",
        "But they had that audience available because \"\"The Big Bang Theory\"\" drew it in the first place.",
        "And so we might see the reverse of that, for example, on Monday nights, where CBS advanced a show called \"\"We Are Men,\"\" and it really derailed the ratings, because it got really bad ratings.",
        "And people kind of left CBS and went to other places to watch other shows.",
        "So we can see this dynamic work and not work in different parts of the schedule.",
        "Well, that sort of gets us to losers, shows that just didn't work and, in fact, got cancelled really fast.",
        "Talk to us about those shows.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Another thing we saw this fall is that the networks are not being patient with shows at all.",
        "If they get bad ratings for a week or two, they are gone.",
        "So, shows like \"\"Lucky 7\"\" on ABC, \"\"We Are Men,\"\" I talked about, on CBS, \"\"Welcome to the Family\"\" and a remake of \"\"Ironside.\"\" And those shows got cancelled within two weeks of bad ratings.",

        "I would probably rate it as one of the more challenging animal rescue calls that I've had.",
        "A driver called 9-1-1 after passing an ice-covered pond and seeing something about 30 feet out - peeking just above the ice, the heads of two brown cows.",

        "They were making an attempt to get out.",
        "But every time that they would get their front hooves up onto the ice shelf, the ice shelf would collapse.",

        "So what we did is we came up with a plan to take a saw that we use to cut the roof if a house is on fire.",
        "We decided that we would take that saw and an ax, break the ice so that we could get the cattle moved closer to shore.",
        "Captain Daniels and another fire fighter, wearing bright orange ice rescue suits, sawed their way through 30 feet of ice.",
        "And slowly but surely, with the help of a couple lassos, they eased the cows back along the trench to shore.",
        "A rancher came by to pick up the two wayward cows.",
        "According to the fire department, they've been doing just fine.",
        "As for Captain Rick Daniels, whom we asked what's been the strangest animal rescue he's ever had...",
