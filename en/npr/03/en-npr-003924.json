        "I am in front of NTV, which is one of those newsrooms that has been blacked out by the government, and - you heard from at the intro here, spent the night in the newsroom because they were tipped off that if they left the newsroom, they would be arrested.",
        "Now, you know, what the government is saying is they are arresting these journalists because they see them as complicit with this event that happened.",
        "And, you know, this was the opposition leader declaring himself president, and they view that as nothing short of a coup - they being the government.",
        "So they think that the media coverage of it is complicit with a coup in this country.",
        "OK.",
        "You - we lost you for a couple of seconds there, Eyder, which made me think maybe you'd been taken off the air, but fortunately, you came back.",
        "I believe we heard you say the journalists in that station where you are are staying in the newsroom, fearing arrest if they go out of the newsroom.",
        "Can I just ask, is there a right of free speech or free expression in Kenya?",
        "This is very, very rare in Kenya.",
        "I'll tell you a quick story.",
        "You know, on Monday - on Tuesday when this event was going on, this mock inauguration was going on, I then took a walk around downtown.",
        "And this group of young people came up to me, and they said, what happened?",
        "Because the government had blocked all the stations from coverage.",
        "And, you know, that doesn't happen in Kenya.",
        "It happens in countries neighboring Kenya.",
        "It happens in Ethiopia and Uganda, where the media is often the - you know, attacked by the government.",
        "But it doesn't happen in Kenya.",
        "Kenya has one of the most progressive constitutions in - on the continent, and also, it has, you know, media freedom.",
        "People here are free to speak their minds, and the media is very vibrant and free.",
        "And so this is very rare, and it worries a lot of observers that Kenya is moving back to the days where it had an authoritarian government under Daniel arap Moi.",
        "Couple of seconds here - this parallel inauguration, of course, came after a disputed election.",
        "Very briefly, how divided is society?",
        "It's very divided, and we'll see how this plays out.",
        "There is a court case right now moving its way through the court to see if whether this move by the government is constitutional or not.",
        "OK.",
        "Eyder, thanks very much."
