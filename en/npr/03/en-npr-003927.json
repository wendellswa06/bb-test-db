        "If California or Texas or any other part of the country is in a heat wave and it's going to be 90 or above, it's just not safe to ship.",
        "And you have people who want the turtle coming to their door.",
        "They can't.",
        "It can't go on a truck, especially a dark brown truck in the heat.",
        "It can't go on a truck safely and get there, so they've got to pick it up at the center or it's not safe to ship at all.",

        "And there are times when, you know, I pretty much let people go home early because there's no packing to be done on the day where it's not safe to ship.",
        "In our sun right here, you know, it might be 95, it might be 98, it's 120 something in the sun, and it's crazy.",
        "If we don't cover all our turtles, they die.",
        "If we don't pull their eggs real fast, they die.",
        "So for us at the Turtle Source, it's hard to keep our stuff going right with these temperatures because it's even hotter here in south Florida than it normally is.",
        "Like I said, we didn't even have a winter.",

        "Now, to be fair, Audie, there's lots of different kinds of intimate relationships, and having an extramarital affair doesn't automatically make you unethical.",

        "OK, so how do these researchers go about making this connection between the personal and the professional?",
        "John Griffin at the University of Texas at Austin, along with Samuel Kruger and Gonzalo Maturana (ph), they combed through the Ashley Madison list looking for people who were executives at various firms in the United States.",
        "The researchers honed in on the fact that if you actually plan to use Ashley Madison, you need to pay to connect with other people.",
        "So the first thing they did was to limit their analysis to people who paid for access to these kinds of transactions.",
        "The billing data from those transactions provided addresses, billing names, and, presumably, these were less likely to be fake than just email addresses.",
        "The researchers then matched the names with various databases, did multiple checks to ensure the people they identified on Ashley Madison were the same people who were the CEOs and CFOs of various firms.",
        "In order to test whether these companies were more likely to do dishonest things, the researchers looked at a couple of different measures.",
        "They looked to see whether the firm was the target of a class action lawsuit or the firm had made financial misstatements.",

        "Corporate infractions were more than twice as likely at firms that had a CEO or a CFO who signed up on Ashley Madison compared to similar firms where the top executives had not signed up on the site.",
        "What's the moral of the story then?",
        "Well, the moral of the story at one level is you can say personal ethics and professional ethics are connected.",
        "But actually, it gets a little more complicated than that, Audie.",
        "You can think of Ashley Madison in terms of ethical behavior, but you can also think of it in terms of risk-taking behavior.",
        "You're taking a risk with your marriage, for example, if you go looking for an extramarital affair.",
        "If the same risk-taking behavior also shows up in other domains of your life, it can have negative effects, but it can also have positive effects.",
        "Yeah, like, wouldn't you want a CEO to be a little bit of a risk-taker?",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So a second group of researchers, these include William Grieser, Nishad Kapadia, Qingqiu Li and Andrei Simonov, they looked at 47,000 Ashley Madison users.",

        "These are just workers who use their corporate email addresses to sign up for the website.",

        "But this time, the message was more positive.",
        "Companies with more Ashley Madison, you know, enthusiasts tended to take more risks as measured by the number of patents they registered, by the use and success of those patents and their willingness to invest in R and D.",
        "These companies also took bigger financial risks, some of which paid off big, some of which failed big, which is what you expect to see when people are taking risks.",
        "The bottom line, Audie, is that this and other studies suggests is it's not easy to have your cake and eat it too.",
        "If you want people at your company to be risk takers and innovators, you may also have to live with some of them taking some dangerous risks.",
