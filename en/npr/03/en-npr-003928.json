        "How are Germans reacting to these results this morning?",
        "I think a lot of people here are trying to wrap their heads around what happened last night because on the one hand, this is the ultimate vote of continuity and stability, electing Angela Merkel to yet another term - her fourth.",
        "But then you've got this rise of the far-right party, the AfD.",
        "They won so many votes.",
        "As Mary Louise said, this is going to be the first time a right-wing party of this kind of nationalist, hardliners on immigration - the first time that they will get a foothold into Parliament.",
        "So in that respect, this was really an anti-establishment vote.",
        "So in Germany - because of Germany's history, Rachel - does the rise of a right-wing party feel somehow different?",
        "Definitely.",
        "And people have said that.",
        "I mean, as an American, you have to resist the urge to see everything through this prism of Germany's history.",
        "But that history is really present right now.",
        "I mean, this party did say - did take such a hard line on immigration.",
        "The campaign posters evoked a lot of Islamophobia, in particular.",

        "And this was on both sides.",
        "I talked with a 60-year-old retiree in Berlin last night.",
        "When I asked her what she thought of the AfD, she said it's stressful because they're like Nazis.",
        "And I talked with a cab driver who voted for the AfD.",

        "So interesting.",
        "What is that?",
        "I mean, that reality that people were bringing up that past and that we have the rise of this party - what does that mean for Merkel as she plows forward with another term?",
        "Well, we should point out this means that the AfD is now the third-strongest party in Germany, which is remarkable.",
        "So they're going to have a legitimate political megaphone to push their policies, which are to the right of Merkel, especially on immigration, on social issues.",
        "When she gives an address, when she makes a point, they will go to the AfD for the counterpoint.",
        "So it's going to present a challenge for her internally.",
        "And then, externally, Merkel's biggest challenges are the same ones they have been - chief among them, navigating her most vexing geopolitical relationships, the German relationship with Russia and the German relationship with the United States and the Trump administration.",
        "Both important and complicated.",
