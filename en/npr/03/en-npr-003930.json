        "There was a recent Washington Post article asking if civil rights organizations like CORE and the NAACP are passe 40 years after MLK's death.",
        "Now, some of these groups, like the NAACP have been struggling with money troubles, there's leadership issues, there's aging membership, declining membership.",
        "On the other hand, there are these new online outlets like the Color of Change, which has over 400,000 members that try to bundle grassroots younger organizations.",
        "And last year when six black teens in Jena, Louisiana were arrested, the Color of Change helped gather protesters to march in Jena.",
        "So the article poses the question, what would happen if W.E.B.",
        "DuBois or Marcus Garvey had a laptop?",
        "Jay, what do you think would have happened?",
        "Boy, I mean, imagine the possibilities.",
        "I just think over all if you look at what bloggers are doing and how we're bringing a different voice to the table, a different voice to the conversation, it's amazing.",
        "I mean, if you imagine the possibilities of, let's say Dr. King, or W.E.B.",
        "DuBois or anyone of that era might have been able to do with the technology, with the access to information that we have nowadays.",
        "Arlene, is there something that we give up by doing so much online?",
        "I mean, I'm certainly invested in it.",
        "We have our blog here, we have a Facebook community.",
        "But there is still a difference between grassroots, door to door, knocking, meeting people, shaking hands and e-activism.",
        "What are the pros and cons of that approach?",
        "Well, I do think that online activism does create kind of a designer-type activist that excludes a lot of people.",
        "There are plenty of people of color who have not yet crossed the digital divide.",
        "And that's an issue that a lot of bloggers and online activists need to explore further.",
        "So I think that's, you know, one of the drawbacks.",
        "One of the good things is, I mean, just the fact that you can spread so much information in a short space of time.",
        "The quality of the information is beyond anything that can be done on paper.",
        "So I think that the reason that many of these established organizations are struggling is that they've failed to embrace the technology because they already have the brick and mortar.",
        "They already have the people that understand who they are, but they've not really embraced the internet like they could have.",
        "Wayne, what are the ways to blend, you know, hybridize this approach?",
        "Because, for example with the Jena Six, Color of Change situation we talked to a young man from Morehouse.",
        "And what he did was, he found a posting about these protests online but then he printed it out and went and took it to a bunch of people.",
        "So it was a mix of online and face-to-face networking.",
        "Do you think that's an approach that's going to really strengthen the entire question of who gets to mobilize people?",
        "Online activism can only take you so far, because it is, by definition online and most of the problems that exist in our world exist in the, quote unquote \"\"the real world.\"\" So you do need to get out into the real world.",
        "I would personally love it if organizations that have a tremendous legacy in our community, like the NAACP, the SCLC, Urban League.",
        "I would love it if they would embrace the technology.",
        "I would love it if national NAACP, instead of having to wait for their quarterly board meeting of 129 people, could indeed be having some online town hall meeting.",
        "Could be using blog technology to get the word out about bills and legislation that we need to call our congresspeople about, etcetera.",
        "They simply don't have the leadership to do it, which is why they've become, and the question can be asked, are they obsolete?",
        "Are they irrelevant?",
        "They don't need to be out there, they need to find ways to work with us.",
        "Instead we too often find ourselves almost at - battling one another for no good reason.",
        "You know, when it comes to this issue of what the traditional organization should do, there have been so many different blog posts.",
        "Once said, \"\"If we were to be a truly color-blind society, then these groups should disband.",
        "It's up to the federal government to be sure laws are in place to address every civil rights issue.\"\" There's always the question of, has the time passed for organizations like the NAACP?",
        "And people have a variety of answers.",

        "There's nothing wrong with color.",

        "And so I really don't see anything wrong with having organizations designed to help a certain group of people, especially if they are suffering some kind of injustice.",

        "I mean, it's really as simple as that.",
        "Otherwise, we are going to be having the same conversation 20 years from now.",

        "I want to go to a specific question of whether or not certain types of activism are harmful.",

        "There was a Haitian immigrant brutally raped by mass teens in these housing projects in West Palm Beach, Florida.",
        "Her son was also beaten.",
        "Since then, four teens between the ages of 14 and 18 in age were arrested and charged as adults.",
        "So last week, Reverend Sharpton showed up in West Palm Beach to denounce the denial of bail to those defendants.",
        "He compared them to five white teenage defendants from Boca Raton - ritzier area - who were accused of raping two middle-school girls after drinking on New Year's Eve.",
        "Those white teens, who also raped suspects, were granted bail.",
        "Now, NAACP activists also protested what they see as the disparate handling of the two cases.",

        "Arlene, because you have been out in front on this.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "And I was extremely outraged by those movements, and it's very common.",
        "And if fact, if these organizations are going obsolete, it's more because of stances like this than their inability to embrace technology.",
        "A lot of black folks out there really see a lot of inconsistencies with the types of cases they select.",
        "For example, the victim of this crime was a black woman and her black son.",
        "And this idea that we must choose the lowest common denominator of white racial justice as our standard to embrace is racist in and of itself.",
        "And I think most of us have enough sense to realize when a crime has been committed of this magnitude, that you do not go behind and try to release these same suspects into the community that they were locked up to protect.",
        "And so, you know, there was a huge groundswell of outrage and motions of activism against them, and I think it was well deserved.",

        "I think the first thing to do is, as Arlene suggested, you just look at the facts.",
        "In this case, the facts were that the NAACP West Palm Beach branch and Al Sharpton were wrong to have a press release and stand up with the parents of those defendants, those rapists, and say they should be released because the young white boys had been released in another part of the state.",
        "The fact is that they're wrong.",
        "Therefore, what the blogosphere did, what we did as bloggers, was we went to them behind the scenes, quietly, one-on-one and said, you're wrong.",
