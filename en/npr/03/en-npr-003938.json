        "The NASDAQ is down 8 percent from its peak this year.",
        "The S&P 500, it's off 4 percent.",
        "But as NPR's Chris Arnold reports, the sell-off hasn't triggered alarm and indicators for the broader economy are mostly positive.",
        "Technology stocks started falling late last week.",
        "Then they rose back, only to crash again.",
        "Yesterday, the NASDAQ plunged more than 3 percent.",
        "That's its biggest one-day loss in more than two years.",
        "The strange thing is, though, that most of the economic news has been good, so what's with the falling stock prices?",
        "Well, we're into another period of time here where everybody's going to leave the trading day scratching their heads, wondering what in the heck happened here.",
        "Juli Neimann is an analyst with Smith Moore and Company in St. Louis, Missouri.",
        "She says U.S.",
        "stock indexes rose 30 percent last year, and they can't keep rising like that, so...",
        "Swings in volatility in the stock market typically are not present when the market's rising, which it has been, of course, since the fall of 2009.",
        "But now since 2014, it's been very choppy.",
        "It's hard to know just what triggered this latest round of selling.",
        "It could be investors who are just taking some profits by selling stocks after a good run.",
        "David Kotak is chief economist at Cumberland Advisors.",
        "He says he's not seeing any signs of panic out there, and he's not worried.",
        "Markets can correct in an ongoing bull trend 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 percent at any time, for any reason, or no apparent reason.",
        "Markets do not move up in straight lines.",
        "Kotak agrees that we're not going to see anywhere near the stock gains we saw last year, but he thinks the overall trend will still be slowly up for some time to come.",
        "That's because he says the economy is continuing to slowly recover, even though he says people tend to hear about the couple of days where stocks see much more dramatic swings.",
        "This president gets 53 percent of the vote; he carried 28 states.",
        "And yet there are still some places where it doesn't help as much to send him."

        "That's Democratic strategist Paul Begala.",
        "I think that the better strategy is to use that national perch to define the choice.",
        "Yes, he can raise money, but it's less showing up and saying I love X, vote for X, than it is framing up the philosophical choice.",
        "Begala has been through this before.",
        "The Democratic president he advised, Bill Clinton, tried hard to help his party hang on to its majorities in Congress in 1994 but failed.",
        "At this point in that election cycle, Clinton had an approval rating of around 51 percent, a few points higher than President Obama is now.",
        "But by Election Day in '94, Clinton's approval was down to around 40 percent, weighing on his party.",
        "Still, Begala says, even unpopular presidents can help their party in a midterm.",
        "That's what Reagan did.",
        "In Reagan's midterm, his job approval was 44, measurably lower than Obama's, but he sustained minimal losses because he defined the choice.",
        "He spent every major speech trashing liberal economic policies and saying that that was what the Democrats wanted to go back to.",
        "And that's what I'd like to see Obama do.",
        "In reverse, that is.",
        "And bashing Republican policies of the past is just what the president plans to do on the campaign trail, says his top political adviser, David Axelrod.",
        "Axelrod sees November not as a referendum but as a choice.",
        "It's an easy race to frame; you have a choice between competing visions.",
        "We've got a Republican Party that hasn't really offered anything new.",
        "And their basic posture, is let's go back to doing the same things that got us into the crisis in the first place, the same irresponsible policies, the same lack of oversight on Wall Street, the same fiscal policies that brought about these problems.",
        "The president can also rally his party's base by traveling to the right places; in Mr. Obama's case, states where he's still popular.",
        "But a president who is very unpopular with certain segments of the electorate can also have the perverse effect of energizing his opponents.",
        "The Republican candidate for Senate in Kentucky, Rand Paul, recently told CNN that the GOP was quote: licking our chops at running against President Obama.Obama.",
        "What I tell to the national Democrats is bring it on and please, please, please bring President Obama to Kentucky.",
        "We want him to come and campaign for my opponent.",
        "In fact, we'll pay for his plane ticket if President Obama will come down to Kentucky.",
        "But chances are President Obama will not come to Kentucky to campaign.",
        "He'll do what he can to defeat Rand Paul and other Republicans from safer spots on the national stage, ones where he has more leverage and control of a bigger megaphone.",

        "Now, gentlemen, you said your job is to shed light and not heat on the Wall Street scandal.",

        "So we will be asking very tough, hard questions on behalf of the American people.",
        "But at the end of the day, the mission of our commission is to try to get to the truth, what really happened here, so that hopefully we do not soon repeat the mistakes that led to this cataclysm.",

        "Or are you going to also be looking at the behavior of the people who run these big Wall Street houses today, the bonuses, the decisions that they're making right now?",
        "Michele, I especially liked your introduction about commissions.",
        "I was in Congress for 28 years and saw a lot of commissions come and go.",
        "Most of the commissions that weren't successful tended to be creatures created by Congress as a substitute for the policymakers making policy.",
        "This commission is going to look a lot more like, for example, the 9/11 Commission, which was charged with trying to find out what happened.",
        "So the answer to that or any other question you might ask as to what we're going to do is going to be driven by how we get the facts, to what extent are people forthcoming.",
        "We do have the power of the subpoena.",
        "We can refer to the Department of Justice.",
        "That's not a threat.",
        "That's just an understanding on the part of Congress that some people may not be as willing as others to provide us with the questions that we've asked.",

        "We will then be hearing from people about the impacts of the crisis on ordinary Americans.",
        "Day two will be given over to federal, state and local officials who are attorney generals and local prosecutors, telling us about what their investigations have revealed about the financial crisis."
