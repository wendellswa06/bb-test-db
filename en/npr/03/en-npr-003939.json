        "It would rewrite the rules under existing laws for all kinds of consumer loans.",

        "Another thing is the agency would collect up and monitor consumer complaints.",
        "There's one other important point here, too, is that the White House wants to get states to have more power.",
        "In recent years, the financial services industry generally was winning the argument that they didn't want to have to deal with 50 different states and 50 different sets of rules.",
        "They wanted things to be fairly simple for themselves.",
        "But consumer advocates said that consumer problems generally start at the state level.",
        "So that's where the regulators can respond more quickly, that's where they see the problems and that's where a lot of regulation should happen.",
        "So, if this new agency is launched, what are the questionable practices that it would try to seek out and stamp out?",
        "Consumer advocates want to make sure that we never again see public enemy number one rise back up.",
        "Those were those subprime mortgages with the low teaser rates.",
        "When we had the housing boom, especially in 2004 and five, we got a lot of loans where for the first couple of years you could afford it, but then after a while the interest rates would start ratcheting up and pretty soon you found yourself with a completely non-affordable mortgage."

        "And another thing are the prepaid bank cards.",

        "If he had seen some sort of security threat or had some issue he wanted resolved, he could have read the text messages, but I feel he just took the whole issue too far.",
        "Or did he?",
        "Legal experts say a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 1985 established that schools have more latitude to search students than police.",
        "And it's a low burden of proof that schools must clear before they can search a student.",
        "But can they go so far as to search text messages?",
        "Boulder Valley School District spokesman Briggs Gamblin says yes.",
        "And while Gamblin won't talk about specifics because the searches were part of a broad disciplinary investigation, he will say this.",
        "We believe reasonable suspicion existed to seize the cell phone and to transcribe the information in the cell phone.",
        "But that Supreme Court ruling does not allow for unlimited or unjustified searches, says University of Colorado law professor Paul Ohm."

        "If it was a frivolous search, he says, the ACLU has a case.",
        "Ohm says some states, meanwhile, have laws that give students more privacy than was established in the 1985 court case.",
        "For instance, Colorado law prohibits the recording of electronic communication without the consent of the sender.",

        "Back at Boulder Valley, Briggs Gamblin says school districts like his are scrambling to craft policies to keep up with that new technology.",
        "You know, five, six years ago, with cell phones, we were simply worried about conversations going on when kids should be listening in class, phones ringing and disturbing the teacher while they're trying to teach, but we weren't worried about pictures, we weren't worried about text messages.",
        "Whether or not they are sued, Gamblin expects the district will adopt a definitive policy governing cell phones.",
        "Some schools have banned phones, but he doubts their new policy will go that far.",
