        "How effective can this commission be, since Congress is already at work on a number of financial reforms that actually might be complete before your work is finished at the end of 2010?",
        "Does this mean by default that the commission's work will become more anthropological than actionable?",
        "Well, let me say, to start with, this national debate about how we reform our financial system is just beginning, not ending.",
        "And let me just say this - and this is not to minimize legislation - but even if Congress were to act in the next couple of months - and who knows when they will - on financial reform legislation, if they create a new agency or new powers, let's be clear: We had regulatory authorities.",

        "It will be over six months instead of the usual 12 or 18 months that it might normally be expected to take.",
        "But the two things the president will talk about that they will need to see: first, by beating back the insurgency, he says that will provide time and space that will allow Afghan forces to be trained.",
        "So, look for him to talk about that tonight.",
        "And second, a diminished Taliban force will be weaker and thus it will be easier for those Afghan security forces to handle once they do take over.",

        "forces.",
        "What about help from NATO countries and additional troops from them?",
        "The president will talk about the expectation that NATO will be sending some more troops, perhaps 5,000, perhaps more than that.",
        "But he will also highlight that there are 40,000 or so troops currently there, they come from some 44 different countries.",
        "He will talk about how important it is to have the entire world, the world involved in this mission.",
        "But let's be clear: The U.S.",

        "We will hear a date: July of 2011.",
        "Now, let me tell you what the White House stresses that date is not.",
        "It is not the goal for the end of the mission, period.",
        "It is when that transfer of security to Afghan forces will begin.",
        "But how fast that transfer takes place, how long it lasts, which would be the ultimate end date, those things will be determined by conditions on the ground.",
        "So, no fixed endpoint, but at the same time, the message coming from the White House is that this will not be an open-ended mission.",
