        "Well, I think that he has tried to be very specific, to reassure people that he did have the - sort of the chops to be a solid candidate, to be somebody who could really run the government.",
        "And so we found that they were very, very specific and often had deadlines.",
        "There would be something that would say, within one year I will convert the White House fleet of cars to hybrids.",
        "And those sort of deadlines are an attempt to reassure voters and also help us at PolitiFact as we try to measure them.",

        "And that way, he's actually showing some willingness to be accountable.",
        "In looking through some of the things he said - and we put one of the quotes on our site - Obama has said repeatedly, hold me accountable.",
        "And so on our site, we say, OK, we will.",
        "And so we have it so that it will be a dynamic database where you'll be able to come to the site and see how many promises are in the works, how many are stalled, how many promises are kept or broken or whatever."
