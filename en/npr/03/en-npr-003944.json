        "This new START treaty was thought of as an interim agreement.",
        "The original START treaty expired at the end of December, 2009, and although the Bush administration had negotiated a strategic arms control treaty, there were no verification measures in that treaty, which we call the Moscow Treaty.",
        "So it was very important to get a new START treaty that had verification measures, that brought down the levels even a little more, and this treaty represents I guess a reduction in 30 percent of the warheads.",
        "But I've read that given the aging parts of the Soviet, the old Soviet system, this is nothing the Soviets, the Russians wouldnt have had to do anyway.",
        "Exactly, and this should've been probably a little easier than it actually was, although I think we're all glad, or most of us are glad, that this treaty was signed today.",
        "Tom Donnelly, what's different?",
        "Not enough, unfortunately.",
        "Neal, you used the phrase both sides (clears throat) - pardon me - in talking to Ted Koppel, and I think that sort of underlines the fact, at least to me, that this is a very backward-looking treaty in the sense that it reprises the old bilateral world, bipolar world, that we used to live in through the years of the Cold War, whereas the world we live in today and the world of the future is a more complex, probably less stable and with an increasing number of nuclear powers much different balance of terror, if indeed there still exists a balance of terror.",
        "Yet at President Obama said, and I think it's accurate, 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia - that's it.",
        "Well, it doesn't take too many nuclear weapons to make a mess.",
        "So the numbers are important but not as important as who has what and what the geopolitical effects of those arsenals are.",
        "Compared to the giant stockpiles that both the United States and the Soviet Union had during the Cold War, these recent reductions may be pretty modest, but compared to the old arsenals, we've come down a long way.",
        "And the question is, as we reduce, are there others not just terrorists but other states who think their interests are served by having even pretty small nuclear arsenals, and certainly the evidence of proliferation over the last decade or so pretty strongly suggests that other people see utility in nuclear weapons, even if we don't.",
        "Neal, if I could just jump in for a moment to sort of underline something that Tom Donnelly is saying - if you look at India and Pakistan, for example, you're looking at two nations that probably each has about 70 nuclear warheads.",
        "The danger of a nuclear war in that part of the world is probably greater at this time than it is anywhere else in the world, and believe me, those 70 nuclear warheads on either side could create a human tragedy the likes of which we've never seen."

        "And the nuclear review, Tom Donnelly, what's fundamentally changed here?",
        "Well, I think the big headline is that we're not going to modernize our arsenal.",
        "And I think, actually that's, at least to me, the most significant and most worrisome development of the advance of this week.",
        "And next, there's going to be a nuclear summit in Washington.",
        "I think Defense Secretary Gates is on record, and I think he sort of speaks for the majority of defense folks when he said that reducing the arsenal to these levels as specified in the treaty was acceptable if we could only update the remaining weapons that we have and ensure by testing that they were safe and reliable.",
        "So, we've gone down to the numbers in the treaty, and I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing, but the legacy Cold War arsenal that we have is less and less useful, flexible or valuable in this world that we see coming.",
        "And so, the posture review is really kind of the therefore clause of the overall policy.",
        "And so far, it looks like the administration is not going to do anything serious on that front, and I think that's really going to be a problem.",
        "Sharon Squassoni, the president's political base would've found it difficult to authorize a new generation of nuclear weapons.",
        "Exactly.",
        "I think this posture review is quite careful to say we are going to maintain our nuclear arsenal.",
        "We're going to do all the things we need to do, life-extension programs, but we're not going to build new warheads that have new missions or new capabilities.",
        "And I think that shouldn't be a surprise at all.",
        "This was clearly President Obama's view going in.",
        "On the other hand, it does contain quite a bit of money for the nuclear weapons complex, and that may make some of his more-liberal supporters not very happy because right now, we spend about $54 billion a year on our nuclear weapons and what we call nuclear security, all told.",
        "And Ted Koppel, there are going to be others within the president's base unhappy that the policy doesn't simply state that the only possible use for nuclear weapons is to deter other nuclear weapon state, and that the United States would never use them first.",
        "Well, our experts will correct me if for some reason I misstate anything.",
        "It's my recollection that we have largely had that as a policy.",
        "We would we would never be the first to use nuclear weapons.",
        "Where I think this new policy alters that a little bit is that it says we would not even use nuclear weapons in the event that we were attacked with weapons of mass destruction, like biological weapons or chemical weapons.",
        "I think the phrase we're missing here is strategic ambiguity, and Tom Donnelly, if I'm correct, the previous statements on this first use were ambiguous."
