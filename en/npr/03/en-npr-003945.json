        "It's also worth remembering, not just as a hypothetical but as and I'm sure Ted Koppel will remember this in 1991, just prior to the first Gulf War, there was a famous meeting between Secretary of State James Baker and Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi foreign minister, which...",

        "Now, whether the Bush administration would, in fact, have done that and what exactly effect that had on the Iraqis, people will be arguing over through their memoirs and political science journals for decades to come.",
        "But this has been a pretty traditional tool of American strategy that certainly and it's worth saying that there are many asterisks and caveats in everything the president has said and in the reviews.",
        "But it does seem to take that past option somewhat, if not entirely, off the table.",
        "Yeah, let's go to Morty(ph), and Morty's on the line with us from Portland, Oregon.",
        "Hi, thanks for taking this call.",
        "I've got a comment and a question.",
        "It appears to me that the proliferation of nuclear material and technology has led to a situation that if someone were to attack us with a nuclear weapon, they may not know the origin of the nuclear weapons (unintelligible)."

        "Doesn't that encourage some terrorist-sponsoring states and terrorists to use nuclear weapons on us because they think that we will not know where they are coming from?",
        "And the second question is: What is the nuclear posture that you talk about in terms of deterring this type of an attack on us?",
        "Well, Sharon Squassoni, what does it say?",

        "So what you really need to do is make it very, very difficult for terrorists ever to get their hands on either nuclear weapons, nuclear material or radioactive material.",

        "Thank you for the call, Morty.",
        "Tom Donnelly, there is an exception on the use the United States says it will never use nuclear weapons against a country that is in compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but then also says, well, and there's a special exception for you, Iran and North Korea.",
        "Well, that kind of undercuts the, you know, the guarantees, the negative assurance as the administration is calling it.",
        "It's also worth recalling that in 1991, Iraq was also a signatory to the NPT, and it wasn't until after the war that they were formally found to be in violation of it.",
        "So, look, it is in some ways reassuring that there are these caveats and exceptions, but that also suggests that maybe this wasn't a great declaratory policy to have in the first place.",
        "You know, if you're not North Korea or Iran, but you're some other nuclear state, and you can't tell, you know, whether you're on the hit list or not, possibly that makes your decision-making process more opaque.",
        "But the point of the United States security guarantees and the point of our nuclear deterrent is to make it as clear and as unambiguous as possible.",
        "Let's get Paul(ph) on the line, Paul calling from Moab in Utah.",
        "Hi, I'd like to know if what and if this policy has any effect on the relationship we have with Israel concerning their nuclear weapons and our no-ask-no-tell policy as to how many they have and if that's even addressed at all in this policy or the upcoming one that's next week."

        "I do think that there needs to - that in the minds of senators, and particularly informed Republican senators, there is a link between the START treaty, nuclear modernization and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.",
        "So I think the Senate is favorably disposed, and certainly people like Senator Kyl or - sort of think that the outcome could have been worse, just to put it in stark terms, but they also want to see a serious commitment to revamping and modernizing the nuclear weapons arsenal and they're nervous that this is a first step toward a testing treaty.",
        "And so I think, if you will, just looking at the crass politics of it, the price of ratification probably includes some concessions on both the modernization and in testing front.",
