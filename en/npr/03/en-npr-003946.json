        "Now, he has also responded - his campaign has responded directly to the charges that he's being hypocritical by having a lobbyist as his campaign co-chair in - here in New Hampshire, Mr. Demers.",
        "It is true that Demers is a lobbyist, and he does have clients that include pharmaceutical companies.",
        "But here is the distinction the Obama campaign is drawing.",
        "His communications director, Robert Gibbs, says Demers is a state lobbyist who does not do business involving any federal legislation or federal regulation, and that the campaign has drawn a distinction between lobbyists who are registered to work at the state level and those who lobby the federal government.",
        "And they say that, you know, a ban on lobbying money and PAC money is far from perfect, but there is a distinction that's worth being drawn here.",

        "And what they started saying was, you know, there's a lot more to learn about Barack Obama.",
        "We think you should be asking tougher questions.",
        "And now that the polls are suggesting that the Clinton is indeed in a tough fight here against Obama to win, and maybe even trailing, that strategy is starting to play out.",
        "The campaign did a conference call with reporters yesterday where they were saying, you know, there are a lot of questions you should be asking about Barack Obama.",
        "You should be, you know, digging in more.",
