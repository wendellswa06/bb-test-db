        "So now what do you think?",

        "It may--as heartfelt as it may have been to her, you know, to me, she makes an analogy that she always calls Rose a beautiful creature, but my thing is, she never says beautiful white creature.",

        "What that will do for all the states, they're going to fall off another cliff.",

        "So, as we looked across state lines, we found about 98 different permits, about 80 different grants and loan programs.",
        "And we said, you know, we can consolidate all that to what we call one front door.",
        "So we can better serve the customer, if you will, when they come to us by having them go through one door to get access to a permit, to have that done by multiple agencies together as one, to have them consolidate their grants and loans."
