        "Wrigley is a great place to party.",
        "The sun is warm, the beer is cold and it's a wonderful place to spend a few hours.",
        "So, you know, yes, I think there are a certain number of people who take the whole thing entirely too seriously.",
        "But I would think by and large, Chicago Cubs fans probably have a healthier attitude, albeit an attitude born of certain amount of deprivation over the years, than fans of lots of other baseball teams.",
        "You know, in your book, you have a lovely piece entitled, \"\"What If They Win?\"\" This was written in 2004 just before the Red Sox won their first championship since 1918.",
        "Right.",
        "And talk about the premise of that piece because it occurs to me that it could be applied to the Cubs at this point.",
        "I think it can.",
        "I think it can, Tony.",
        "The premise of the piece was simply that everybody who roots for the Red Sox would be much better off if the Red Sox didn't win even though they might not understand that because - and again, I was looking forward, not realizing that 2004 would be the year in which a month of Sundays appeared on the calendar et cetera, et cetera.",
        "If the Red Sox won the World Series, I said, they would simply be another team that had won the World Series.",
        "And goodness, the Phillies did won the World Series, the Mets had won the World Series, anybody could do it, right?",
        "Florida won the World Series, for goodness sake.",

        "You can even find your way home.",
        "It's all thanks to innovative new cell phone applications.",
        "In a moment we'll meet the designer of one of these new applications.",
        "But first, I've got a few different cell phones here in the studio, and I've got the one guy who knows how to work them, our tech guru Omar Gallaga.",
        "Hi, Omar.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "And Omar, first of all, what exactly is a cell phone application?",
        "Well, in much the same way that on a desktop computer you might go to the store and purchase a box of software that you would bring home and install, it's kind of the same principle.",
        "But on a cell phone, you can actually download it, and you've got it right there on your phone instantly."

        "Books, DVDs.",
        "Yesterday, we scanned a bottle of Snapple, and it recognized the flavor.",
        "So, yeah, you can scan as you're shopping, get comparison prices, read reviews from people that have purchased the product.",

        "You - your phone listens to the music, and it tells you where you could buy that music.",
