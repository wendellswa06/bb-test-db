        "That's a good question, Bob.",

        "Is this a healthy thing?",
        "I think that - no. I don't think it's a healthy thing.",

        "And it suddenly occurred to me that at the first game I'd ever gone to, in 1954, when the Giants were hosting the Pirates in the Polo Grounds, Bob Skinner was playing for the Pirates.",
        "And I'm sitting with Joel Skinner and I said, hey, I saw your dad play when I was 6-years-old.",
