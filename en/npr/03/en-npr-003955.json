        "And Appalachian State rose up from their own division and slew the giant, so it was an upset to say the least.",

        "Prior to 1940, yeah.",
        "The numbers are very difficult to compare era to era, partly because of the composition of the baseball, partly because of other equipment, bats, partly because of the raising and lowering of the mound, partly because of years when there's expansion and all of a sudden, there's much less good pitching for hitters to face than there was before they were more teens.",
