        "Many, many more high school girls playing sports; Many, many more opportunities for women in college to get scholarships, not only in the sports that we see on television especially basketball in the case of women, but in all the sports - women playing soccer and getting scholarships to do that.",
        "And not all teams were at track and field.",

        "Why?",
        "Well, the pictures were actually done in 1990, and they were done to illustrate some disparate nonsense rhymes that were accompanied by a musical suite composed by the Czech composer Janacek.",
        "And the concert was in - by the London Symphony Orchestra.",
        "And so these pictures were projected as the concert went on.",

        "You know, it was the kind of thing where he was so wrapped up in other projects that, you know, it was finished creatively in terms of our work.",

        "I think you've gotten to the numb of this.",
        "You were deterred from publication because of what editors would do to your project.",
        "(Laughter) No, not quite.",
        "But it's a long process even from sort of finished pictures and manuscript to having a book in the stores.",
        "And because there were other things on the plate both for Maurice and me individually, we always thought we would get back to it.",
        "But we unfortunately didn't.",
        "How did it come to be published now?",
        "It was found by Lynn Caponera, the head of the Maurice Sendak Foundation in a file folder and gloriously sent to our - Maurice and my mutual editor.",
        "And it was totally complete when it was found.",

        "And if someone is using the gun for self-defense, how quickly can they get to their firearm if the trigger lock is in place, if it's stored in a secure cabinet or safe of some kind?",
        "Well, it's a little tricky but at the same time the court was focused on the fact that in the immediate moment of self-defense - they were reading our law literally to say there was no exception.",
        "So I think that if we provide an exception in the immediate moment of self-defense that then we would be meeting the Constitution while at the same time being clear that the storage of a weapon in the home has to be either locked or disassembled and unloaded.",
