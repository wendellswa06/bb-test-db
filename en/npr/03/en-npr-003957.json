        "Alan Cheuse has a review.",
        "An apocalyptic rainstorm and flood trap over 1,000 people in a hospital.",
        "Its wards are filled with hundreds of very sick children.",
        "There's the medical staff, kitchen staff and some visiting family members.",
        "And on top of this, the hospital floats atop the waters that cover the surface of the earth.",
        "This is about as preposterous a situation as you'll find in recent American fiction.",
        "A quartet of angels appear to be presiding over the story.",
        "One of them seems to be the late brother of a young medical student named Gemma(ph).",
        "This dutiful healer makes her rounds and attends to the sickest of the children, even as she discovers that her affair with a young colleague has left her carrying a child of her own.",
        "Gemma's realistic pregnancy stands in counterpoint to the allegorical world in which the hospital floats, and the fiery healing powers Gemma discovers within herself sometimes rock the hospital to its core.",
        "The story itself bobs up and down, from realism to the fantastic and back again.",
        "And I have to warn you, it's enormously long.",
        "There is an end to it, though I shouldn't say what that end might be.",
        "And the sailing hospital sometimes seems like a \"Ship of Fools,\" or a bloated episode of \"Lost,\" so \"The Children's Hospital\" isn't a novel for the unadventurous.",
        "But if you go into it, knowing you're going to encounter inventions by one of the most deliriously imaginative young writers in America, perhaps that will help you keep afloat.",
        "The book is \"The Children's Hospital\" by Chris Adrian.",
        "Our reviewer, Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia.",
        "This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.",
        "I'm Debbie Elliot.",
        "Lloyd Richards, one of the most revered directors and educators in American theater, died Thursday in Manhattan on his 87th birthday.",
        "This soft-spoken man was the first African-American to direct a Broadway play, A Raisin in the Sun.",
        "NPR's Allison Keyes has the story of his legacy.",
        "Richards made history in 1959 with Lorraine Hansberry's landmark drama about a black family moving into a white neighborhood on Chicago's Southside.",
        "The production starred Claudia McNeil, Diana Sands, Ruby Dee and Sidney Poitier, and was later remade as a movie.",

        "It's good to be here.",
        "And that waiting that you wrote about - you write, of course, waiting is normally a passive activity, but maybe not this year.",
        "Well, it's striking, don't you think, that the exuberance, that, one could almost say, exultation of the election season, did so efficiently give way to this in-between stasis, this feeling that's just quite palpable abroad - in the air, almost - waiting for something new to start.",
        "It's obviously being felt in our political conversation every day.",
        "But there's also a way in which the economy has slipped into this in-between period.",
        "We had these really anxiety-provoking weeks of October and November, when we really wondered if the economy was falling off a cliff and it didn't seem to quite go over the edge.",
        "And yet now we're in this in-between time, when the economy has not begun to recover.",
        "The worst may be behind us, but we're waiting to find out, aren't we?",
        "So, waiting has emerged as a powerful political, economic, daily theme in our lives, and it's very striking that it should fall in this time of the year, when waiting defines so much of what we experience.",
        "Curious, you write, curious, isn't it, that depression is the word for both economic collapse and nervous breakdown?",
        "Well, that's true, too, isn't it?",
        "When referring to the economy, commentators have invoked the memory of the Depression, somewhat breathlessly, hoping to God that we don't return to it.",
        "And yet, this is also the time when that sadness that can almost seem appropriate to the season is an experience of depression.",
        "It does strike the ear that one word has reference to both experiences, economic and emotional.",
        "And you talked about, just a moment ago, how we invoke the Depression in hopes of staving it off in the same way that we light the lights in these dark days of the season in hoping of staving away the dark.",
        "Well, it's true.",
        "Don't you find where you are that the seasonal lights are just so quite glorious - the white - little white bulbs on the trees, now, the festive lights attached to the various holidays?",
        "It's impossible in a way not to see the long, dark night as a source of special seasonal beauty.",
        "Certainly that's true here in Boston, where we have boulevards gloriously lit, and there is a kind of dogged refusal of the human spirit to sink under the weight of darkness and to sink under the weight of what's missing.",
        "I mean, that is what, of course, is so palpable today - what is missing.",
        "Look at all that is missing."

        "I'm really glad that you chose this topic today, because I've been thinking about a lot about the fact that people just aren't allowed to shut down anymore in our society.",
        "In the old days, we would farm all summer or hunt or do whatever we had to do and save up stuff, and then we really didn't have to do anything during the winter except stay alive.",
        "And I think that our culture, of course, and the way we work today, is, that's ridiculous, you know, it doesn't make any sense.",
        "But there's a big part of us through our huge long history of, you know, in our development as a species, that requires this shutting down, this welcoming of the dark as a time to just regroup.",
        "To regroup, well, that's - it's another way of waiting, isn't it, James Carroll?",
        "Yes it's true, and it's a wonderful observation, Mary, that you make.",
        "And one of the pains of our lives today is that we have lost the capacity to do that shutting down, to take it easy, to stop and look.",
        "And that's one of the troubles we have with the season, isn't it, how frantic we all get, rushing from chore to chore and this to that.",
        "Right.",
        "I really feel that it's one of the main reasons that we are - have some of these sicknesses in our society, you know, lots of depression, lots of anxiety.",
        "People don't feel OK about the fact that they maybe can just do nothing.",
        "I mean, of course, they can't because they have to go to work and they have to pick up the kids and they have to do all the stuff that we plan so rigorously into our schedules.",
        "But given time to do nothing or do something, people invariably choose something.",
        "Well, let me make an observation tied to our politics, very much picking up on your thought, which is, you notice how impatient everybody is because the Bush administration hasn't left and the Obama administration hasn't begun?",
        "And people are even saying we should amend the Constitution to make for an immediate succession.",
        "We can't stand the interlude, the time between, the time when not much happens, and yet it's a profoundly healthy structure of time.",
        "It's a very good thing for us as a people to stop in this way and to really actually step back a moment and let's think about who we are, what we want to become, how we recover from the last eight years, what we want out of the next four years.",
        "It's actually a very precious time, I would say, and nature's kind of inviting us to take it.",
        "I think so, too.",
        "I mean, look at - it's just like the tide comes in; the tide goes out.",
        "Well, there's a slack tide in between where nothing really happens, and I think that that's something that's completely lost in Western culture.",
        "So what about these people who are trying drag molecules one at a time, you know, around and build things like that?",
        "You're not a fan of that?",
        "You could be one of those astronomers on the banks of the Nile 3,000 or 4,000 years ago, observing the connections between the movements of the tides and the movements of the heavenly bodies, Mary."

        "It's no accident that shopping is the main activity, the main non-professional activity, that certainly in America we indulge in, in this period.",
        "It's partly because the unconscious pressures of this darkness make us vulnerable to wanting, to what we don't have.",
