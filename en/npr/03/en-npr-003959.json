        "You talked about the support for Prime Minister Thaksin.",
        "He has been unpopular of late.",
        "He's been described as struggling to remain in power - in fact, said that he would resign after elections.",
        "Yes, in fact he's been - he has been the most powerful prime minister, in terms of the popular vote, that Thailand has ever had.",
        "But what happened was Thaksin monopolized economic and political power to such a great extent that he replaced old, traditional power networks - the military, bureaucratic, and intellectual elite - from Bangkok who has run this country for generations.",
        "And he replaced that structure with one of his own.",
        "So he clipped their space, and this is a deep power game to stop him.",
        "And it succeeded in shaking his hold, so he had to dissolve Parliament, hold elections - which were boycotted - and the election was later discredited and annulled by the courts.",
        "So yes, he's been struggling for his political survival.",
        "And there are questions that trouble people.",
        "As recently as I think 14 years ago, back in 1992, here was another coup against another government in Bangkok that turned out to be rather bloody.",
        "Yes.",
        "There's been a lot of concern that the current political crisis, which has dragged on for almost 10 months now, will turn violent.",
        "And this is one of the reasons cited, in fact, by General Sonthi tonight, when he took power.",
        "And it just shows analysts that Thailand, having been run by a military government for many years of its modern existence, the military is still very much a factor.",
        "This coup was staged in the middle of the night there in Thailand.",
        "I guess a lot of people are going to have questions about what happens when people wake up and see what's going on.",
        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "But not quite in the middle of the night.",
        "It was a little earlier than that.",
        "The action started around nine p.m., so most people are already aware of what's going on.",
        "In fact, the phone lines were jammed.",
        "The rumors were swelling around ahead of time, as well.",
        "So I think most of the city is awake and watching."

        "Which hints at ISIS's real goal, setting up an Islamic state that stretches across the Middle East.",
