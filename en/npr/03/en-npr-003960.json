        "Well, the idea of how one develops a new technology, nanotechnology, is pretty complicated.",
        "Ideas come from everywhere.",
        "Right.",
        "And in this particular case, one of the things one wants to do when one thinks about building a technology is to understand how to move things.",
        "Right.",
        "And whatever `things' can be is a flexible definition, so that we started with a thing that was simply a model, a little bead.",
        "There's no particular reason to move that, per se, but one hopes that more interesting things will come of it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So this is a proof-of-concept demonstration?",
        "It's a proof of concept.",
        "And so then the question is, do you try to build a motor, something that looks like a small submarine or, as you say, an outboard motor, or do you try to use something which is alive and biological?",
        "And we took the option in this case--and I think in many circumstances it will be the right option--of trying to work with biology, as biology has, of course, had lots and lots of practice in working with small things and moving them around.",
        "And how are you able to guide where you could get the algae to go where you want it to go?",
        "We're talking this hour about chemistry, nanotechnology and wherever else our language and dialogue takes us.",

        "You know, in Nicaragua, for example, very often we would find in the political dealings and wheelings of the revolution, they would bring up your love life, you know, to dismiss your arguments as women, and the things that they would never use with a guy, you know.",

        "Her love for Philippe, that was definitely a very passionate love on both sides, was used against her and was the reason why they called her mad.",

        "I made in my youth some decisions that, you know, when I see them retrospectively I think they were mad, but it was hard for me to choose between power and love.",
        "And Juana has the same conflict.",
        "Let me ask you, do you think that Juana La Loca was in fact mentally ill at all?",
        "Or did they make her unstable by isolating her for over 40 years and even by beating her and whipping her?",
        "I mean it's a horrible story in that sense.",
        "Do you think that she really had a genetic mental illness?",
        "No, I don't think so.",

        "One can end up believing in lies if the lies are repeated incessantly, especially if they are all one hears.",
        "Mad was no doubt my passion for Philippe.",
        "It was certainly madness to love him like I did, but love does not choose its object according to reason or convenience.",
        "Love besieges love.",
        "That is what love does."

        "The storm's heavy rains have triggered some coastal flooding in Haiti and dangerous mudslides are possible on the Caribbean island.",

        "Mr.",
        "Brennan, what's the likely threat from Ernesto?",
        "Well, the threat in the short-term is going to be from very heavy rains, especially over the mountainous terrain of Haiti and Jamaica and eastern Cuba, where some areas could get six to 12 inches, as much as 20 inches of rain.",
        "Later in the week, as Ernesto's going to move to the northwest across Cuba, where there's a hurricane warning in effect, and eventually Ernesto will turn to the north and threaten most likely the state of Florida, but where that threat occurs is going to be determined by exactly when and where Ernesto makes that turn.",
        "So anywhere from the Florida Panhandle all the way down to the Keys and anywhere in the peninsula could be threatened by Ernesto by the middle or late portions of the week."

        "It could weaken, depending on exactly how long it spends over Cuba and what part of the country it goes over.",
        "There are parts of it that are very mountainous and that would be worse for the storm's intensity, in terms of weakening it.",
        "But it is possible that Ernesto would re-strengthen once it entered the water on the other side of Cuba and moved into the Gulf of Mexico.",
