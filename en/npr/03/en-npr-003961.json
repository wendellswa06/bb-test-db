        "It's always been a part of the political DNA of California that we want to participate in democracy and we don't trust those special interests up there in Sacramento to respond to what citizens need.",
        "The clearest case of that was the so-called property tax revolt of 1978, Proposition 13.",
        "When the legislature failed to put the breaks on skyrocketing property taxes, the voters did it.",
        "Prop 13 started something new in people power.",
        "That's Joel Fox, who for many years ran the anti-tax organization that grew out of Prop 13.",

        "It's not just the conservatives or not just the liberals, it's everybody who wants to use this process to try to promote their agendas.",

        "California voters have recalled a governor, Gray Davis, and replaced him with Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
        "They've set strict term limits for state legislators.",

        "More than half the budget is tied up with respect to education.",
        "Propositions dealing with certain kinds of spending on public safety, others that deal with the local government and trying to protect their dollars.",
        "It's really just difficult.",
        "Hertzberg says it's part of the reason that the California legislature has approval ratings in the single digits, and it's the reason why he's now heading an organization called California Forward.",
        "They have proposals for reforming term limits, for example, and the budget process.",
        "If the legislature will put them on the ballot, fantastic.",
        "If they won't, we'll keep pushing it.",
        "And get it on the ballot as a citizens' initiative.",
        "Either way it's California voters who will once again have the final word."

        "It's also interesting to point out I suppose that in another press release that was put out today by the military, they said that they picked up two more female detainees up in the northern city of Mosul, which I guess if they're kept, would bring the number up to six.",
