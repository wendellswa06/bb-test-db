        "In the intensity, it goes in different places.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But it's--you know, think of it as going to where the smell is best.",
        "Right.",
        "And what use can you make of this now you know how to hook up the algae to, you know, a cargo?",
        "As I said, it's a model.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And so the question is, where would one want to have a small organism pulling a load around?",
        "And I think the answer to that remains to be seen.",
        "The first thing to do is just to show that it can be done.",
        "And that was what we did.",
        "And the notion in that is to make the case that you can get it to pick up the load, drop off the load, and go in some direction.",
        "But I could imagine, for example, that if I had a large body of water that I wanted to survey for something, I wanted to see if there were toxins in it or I wanted to see what might be there in the way of nutrients or whatever, I could take these organisms and drop them into the pond, into the large body of water and let them swim around, and then turn on a light, maybe at night, and they should come toward it.",
        "So it would be a hunt-and-fetch kind of strategy.",
        "Right.",

        "I think we had to--we being the postdoctoral fellow, Doug Weibel, who did the work; I don't do anything, I sit at my desk and other people do the work.",
        "So anyway, Doug did the work.",
        "And he took advantage of surface chemistry, what binds to what on the surface of the algae, in a very clever way.",
        "I think that the basic processes had been known before, but the surface of the algae is sticky in a particular kind of way, in a molecular way, and one can find ways of taking advantage of that.",
        "Getting the load, the sphere to stick was one thing.",
        "Getting the load to fall off afterwards was, I think, a little bit more clever.",
        "But even there it was known chemistry.",
        "What we ended up doing was to connect the load to the algae by a linker that itself broke when one shined light on it.",
        "But it has to be the right kind of light.",
        "And we were, I have to say, a little bit surprised that we could get the link to cleave without at the same time doing any apparent damage to the algae.",
        "You touched on it before a little bit, but this sort of seems to be a little different approach to nanotechnology engineering, where you're using biological objects or already existing biological living forms as opposed to someone who might try--and we've seen this over the past years--build little mechanical motors.",
        "Right.",
        "There's an interesting controversy in nanotechnology as to what the strategy is.",
        "And at the beginning of nanotechnology, there was an idea that the way to think about nanotech was to look around you and see things that were submarines or automobiles or motors, devices that work in a scale that we're familiar with, and then make them very, very small.",
        "And very, very small means change their size by about a factor of a million or something like that, maybe more.",
        "The trouble with that is that I think one can make pretty convincing arguments that most of those sorts of ideas simply won't work for one or another reason.",
        "And that's both, you know, a limitation, but also in some sense is a comfort because there was also, as you well know, a concern that one might be able to build small machines, nano-scale machines, that would, among other miraculous things, replicate themselves and then, in replicating themselves, begin to eat their environment.",
        "And the fact that you can't either make small motors or probably make small replicators makes the subject something which is of a different character than people were, I think, a little worried about.",
        "But if you look at biology, we are, after all, composed of cells that are a few microns across and the cell is filled with what I'll loosely call machinery, components which are some nanometers across.",
        "So nature's had a really remarkable...",
        "Head start.",
        "...set of accomplishments in building these things.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Dr.",
        "Whitesides, stay with us.",
        "We're going to take a short break...",
        "OK.",
        "...and come back and take some questions and talk more about your views on nanotechnology and the conflicts that go on there and the potential for the future.",
        "So stay with us.",
        "We'll be right back after this break."

        "It's the engineering approach, but I think it can be made to work.",
        "I think that there are different flavors of that.",
        "There has been some truly spectacular work done in using an atomic force microscope, basically a needle with a very sharp tip, to shove atoms around on surfaces.",
        "And I think it's spectacular work and in due course is likely to be good for something in terms of manipulating surfaces at the atomic level.",
        "But then the idea of actually building very small mechanical motors has a lot of problems with it.",
        "Friction gets to be much more important at small scales.",
        "It's not clear how you power them.",
        "I mean, it's just--things don't scale from large to small very well.",

        "Self-assembly is the process by which some complex system puts itself together.",
        "The pieces choose to come together just of their own volition.",
        "You don't have to reach in and cause them to do it.",
        "And there are lots of examples of self-assembly that we're all familiar with.",
        "Basically, every crystal, that little piece of sugar--the molecules of sugar have come together and formed a nice regular structure.",
        "So the question is, can you make irregular structures that have some function?",
        "And I point to you or to me as examples of something in which no robot put us together; we put ourselves together.",
        "So biology is the master of self-assembly."

        "And we're just then touching on in nanotechnology where that might lead to.",
        "Yes.",
        "And the issue with many of the things that are happening in nanotechnology now is that the field's really just at the beginning.",
        "It's, I think, better to call it nanoscience than nanotechnology.",
        "And if you look at a new field as it emerges, it's a nice idea that a single invention makes a field--if you have a transistor, then all of a sudden you have microelectronics.",
        "But in practical fact, it usually takes a few hundred inventions.",
        "You need silicon, you need the transistor, you need software, you need FORTRAN, you need displays, you need mice, you need all the rest of the things that go into a computer system in order to have a technology.",
        "And what's happening now in nanotechnology is very much that.",
        "People are coming along with bits of science which will become bits of technology and eventually it will add up to more than is there right now.",
        "We've seen people making transistors out of DNA now.",
        "Seen people making transistors out of DNA, and in fact people are making transistors at the nano scale.",
        "If you look at what the very skilled engineers in Intel and other companies are doing, you find that the dimensions of the objects that they work with have very quietly gone well below the 100-nanometer mark.",
        "So nanotechnology is with us.",
        "But a lot of that is what I'll loosely call evolutionary nanotechnology.",
        "That doesn't make it any less interesting than or less important than revolutionary technology, but it's maybe a little bit less flashy.",
        "So we really don't know where any of this is heading, and that's sort of exciting.",
        "Well, it's very exciting because, as with many technologies, it's a technology that touches on so many parts of the world that we don't quite know where the big impact will be.",
        "I mean, if you ask where will nanotechnology almost certainly be important, one place will be in computer memories because it'll be possible to store much greater amounts of information in much smaller space.",
        "Now that doesn't sound perhaps breathtakingly exciting.",
        "On the other hand, if you imagine a world in which information is fundamentally free and it's accessible to anyone, it has enormous consequences for education because perhaps we don't need to learn anything anymore; we mostly need to know how to find it.",
        "It has enormous implications for how countries value themselves competitively.",
        "If everything that everyone knows is in a common pool and it's just a question of who reaches in most efficiently and grabs the information, that's very different from the world that we've all grown up in.",
        "I mean, many interesting differences.",
        "So these technologies that are kind of at the core of society--it's not easy to understand how their consequences play out in the top-level things that we see and touch and feel.",
        "You seem to be saying that you believe that all knowledge should be open-source, then.",

        "People from chemistry, biology, all kinds of different fields, engineering, a wide variety of expertise.",
        "Is that because you just never know where things are coming from?",
        "Certainly I don't know.",
        "And the students who are in graduate school, the postdocs who are in the laboratory, are here to learn, but what they are learning is not, as in the past, a specific discipline for a specific well-defined future.",
        "What they are in principle learning is how to be as flexible as they can to take the opportunities as they come along, since they're coming along at more and more rapid rates.",
        "And so it's really immense fun to put together a group that has such a broad range of interests and just let people talk to one another.",
        "When they do, wonderful things happen, as, for example, this algae which requires knowing something about microbiology, something about organic chemistry, and then having an interest in being able to move small loads around, which is basically a problem in nanotechnology."
