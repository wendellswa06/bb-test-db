        "There's never any shortage of fresh ideas.",
        "You can either start from problems such as disease or you can start from phenomena, looking for things that are new, or you can start in early-stage technology in which you ask questions like, how do you move a load around on a micron scale?",
        "So the issue is not looking--it's not difficult to come up with new things to work on.",
        "I tell the students there are three stages in a research project.",
        "There is a stage in which you define the problem and decide what the strategy's going to be, and then there's a stage in which you solve the problem, and then there's a stage in which you sell the solution to the community.",
        "And the easiest one of these is usually solving the problem.",
        "And probably the next most difficult is figuring out what a good problem is.",
        "But there really are so many around that you just have to look at the world around you.",
        "Curiously, one of the ones that's hardest is to, once you've solved a problem, to get people to pay attention because, after all, it's a new idea if it's a good problem.",
        "Everybody's a little conservative about new ideas.",
        "Yes, but on the other hand, if you hook up with a corporation early on, they're going to be wanting to know how to sell it to the community first before anything else.",
        "Corporations are pretty conservative now.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, capitalism is a very efficient system, but it doesn't favor ideas that take a few years to work out.",
        "So one of the issues that the United States has to think about just a bit is the general strategy for how one invests in research, how much should be short-term and how much should be long-term.",
        "And by long-term I mean sort of three to five or somewhat longer than that years, because we tend to be pretty short-term as a society now.",
        "And who makes that decision?",
        "Well, it's a good question.",
        "And the part of corporations--with large corporations it's largely made by their owners, who are often financial institutions or individual stockholders who are interested in doing what they need to do as quickly as possible.",
        "And the whole atmosphere of globalization is one in which decisions have to be made rapidly.",
        "You have to move into or out of something efficiently, and you can't really understand financially how it's a good thing to do to start a program of investment that takes 10 or 15 years to get to an answer, other than in select areas such as pharmaceutical development.",
        "So all the pressures are in trying to make things rapidly.",
        "And then as far as public investment goes, that's done by some combination of people who set government policy and what's called the peer review community, which is in fact us in the universities--we in the universities.",
        "And it seems like some of our technologies have made wrong decisions or the wrong bets in recent years.",
        "In what sense?"

        "It's a very interesting issue.",
        "The great change in the automobile industry came in the early '80s when Toyota and the other Japanese discovered that consumers really did care about quality.",
        "Now the systems that they used to make their automobiles with high quality were in fact invented in significant part by Americans, particularly by a man named Gimming(ph)--Gimming.",
        "But the question of how one gets really first-rate cars off a automobile production line is of course a complicated question of first having the right kind of design, second having a manufacturing system that makes things work, third having a work force that is alert and pays attention and cares about the quality of the product.",
        "I mean, it's not simply a technology issue.",
        "And I think that's another thing that the US has to pay attention to.",
        "But you are correct in saying that the US has made some right and some wrong decisions.",
        "The US basically invented SUVs.",
        "Now SUVs were quite profitable.",
        "There are, I think, a number of us who have objections to SUVs on a variety of reasons, but they did sell fairly well for a while.",
        "We're talking with George Whitesides this hour on TALK OF THE NATION/SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "And of course now you have Toyota making hybrids and American companies having to license the technology from them.",
        "It's almost like a deja vu 1975 all over again.",
        "(As Malory Archer) Which, and I'm just spit-balling here, would mean you could outsource a good deal of business to a private firm - like ISIS.",
        "Yeah, it's something which I don't understand, either.",
        "General Motors made a serious effort to get started early in all-electric cars.",
        "And they had the first pure electric, which they developed into, I think, a successful prototype and actually had a number of them on the road in the hands of drivers.",
        "Pure electrics turn out to be, at least using existing technology, not as practical and not as useful as the hybrids.",
        "And the Japanese had a good focus on that and moved early and aggressively.",
        "And you're right, those are excellent cars.",
        "And they also have a government agency that helps to shape the direction technology takes.",
        "That's true, but now that becomes a much more arguable point.",
        "There are lots of folks, myself included, who would just as soon not have government setting policy on those kinds of matters.",
        "There are sorts of decisions, I mean, things that involve very large public investment and which have enormous consequences for the economy that are beyond the scope of individual corporations.",
        "And transportation may well be one and arguably things like energy policy are another, in which the government should be involved.",
        "But for the government to pick the technology that's likely to work has not generally worked very well.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Well, China has an enormous, enormous job just to bring its society up to that of the rest of the world.",

        "A big fraction of China's effort will go into providing the services that we take for granted.",
        "But China is very ambitious and Chinese are, I think, as a people right now very willing to be focused on science and technology as solutions to problems.",
        "So that I think that we should expect to see very serious competition and very effective competition from China in all the areas that we regard to be profitable and strategic.",
        "There are some people who've said, `Oh, China's just a new Japan and look what happened to them.'",
        "Well, I think that, for one thing, Japan's not doing as badly as people make it out to be.",
        "And for another thing, there are a lot of Chinese and enormous resources.",

        "It represents a major market; it represents a new source of technology globally, particularly if we're smart enough to pay attention to what they develop.",
        "And it provides a way of building a network between China and the rest of the world which ultimately I think helps to stabilize the world.",
        "So I'm absolutely for it.",
