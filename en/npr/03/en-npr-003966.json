        "Drug-related deaths are scarring families and communities across the country.",
        "The area around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has been hit especially hard.",
        "Twenty-two people have died there in less than two weeks, the latest in a wave of heroin overdoses.",
        "Police in Western Pennsylvania are blaming the deaths on an especially potent form of the street drug.",
        "After testing, they determined the heroin had been mixed with a prescription painkiller known as Fentanyl.",
        "DR. NEIL CAPRETTO: Fentanyl is very potent.",
        "It can be 70 to 100 times more powerful than morphine.",
        "That's Dr. Neil Capretto.",
        "He's the medical director at the Gateway Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh.",
        "He says dealers have stamped the drug with a street name Theraflu.",
        "Dr. Capretto says that is no accident.",
        "Well, what does the product Theraflu treat?",
        "Flu symptoms, cold symptoms.",
        "What does going through opium or heroin withdrawal feel like?",
        "It feels like a very bad case of the flu multiplied times 10.",
        "They call it dope sickness.",
        "So it's basically marketing.",
        "We will treat your withdrawal symptoms if you're, quote, \"\"dope sick\"\" with this Theraflu.",
        "You know, drug dealers compete with one another to get new customers.",
        "At first, it may not seem to make sense, why would they now have this product so potent that some of their customers are dying?",
        "Isn't it bad for business?",
        "But as some of my patients told me, a dealer may be willing to lose four or five customers through an overdose death to attract, you know, 30 or 40 new customers.",
        "And they call that the class of doing business.",
        "When people start hearing of people dying from overdoses, logic would say stay away from that stuff.",
        "It's dangerous.",
        "People with addiction hear it and - particularly heroin addiction - and they think, that's the strong stuff.",
        "That's the good stuff.",
        "And they chase it.",
        "And, of course, they don't want to die.",
        "They think, I'm going to use it.",
        "I want to push the high to the edge, and I'm going to be more careful than the last person who died.",
        "But they very well may be the next person who dies.",
        "Do you have a sense of why this drug is hitting the streets now in your area?",
        "But the question is, will that change?",
        "At least some of the language in the new regulations seems to leave a lot of the oversight and even the penalties up to the banks themselves.",

        "The U.S.",
        "Army Corps Of Engineers says the water flowing into the lake poses a twofold problem.",
        "First, they are worried that lots of brush, logs and groundcover from the Rough Fire burn area will flow into the lake.",
        "That debris can be harmful to people fishing or skiing.",
        "Caldwell says the Corp has a solution for debris.",
        "We have a floating boom.",

        "The boom spans the width of the lake.",

        "He says the consequences that come with the increased sediment from storms over a burn area are huge.",
        "We can get upwards of 2,000 acre-feet worth of sediment coming into Pine Flat.",
        "That settles on the bottom and displaces 2,000 acre-feet of water.",
        "And that's just from one storm.",
        "It may not seem like that much of a loss, but with such low reservoir levels, every drop matters.",
        "All that water is already allocated to farmers and towns downstream.",
        "And a lower holding capacity means less water for them.",
        "What happens in the burn scar area impacts everything downstream - sediment, water quality, ability to store water, how it's used.",
        "Haugen says the problem with increased sediment flows doesn't just go away after El Nino ends.",
        "We won't know the full extent of that problem until probably five to 10 years out, as that sediment makes its way down through the river system.",
        "The consequences of these fires are long duration.",
        "Haugen says the sediment dissolves in the lake water, eventually makes it out of the dam into growers' fields, and over time can clog farm machinery and water pumps.",
