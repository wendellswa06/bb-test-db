        "But certainly this region, as you were leading into the story, was an area that we would've expected tornadoes for May 20th based on climatology.",
        "Well, let's talk about the forecasting because one of the amazing parts of sort of science of this story was that hours before, the National Weather Service locally issued a warning that there might be a tornado.",
