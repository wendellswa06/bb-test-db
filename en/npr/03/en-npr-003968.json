        "And that's just a fancy term that allows us to see various aspects of the tornadic storm and the rainfall in ways that we couldn't see before because it can actually see the storm from double perspectives, from a horizontal and vertical perspective in terms of the - what we call polarization signature of the radar.",
        "I read that one of the things the radar is looking for is flying debris.",
        "Is that right?",

        "Yeah.",
        "And one of the things that the dual polarization radar can do with a couple of the signatures or products, is it actually can help to see that debris ball.",
        "You can somewhat detect that if it's a really well-defined debris ball in the reflectivity, the sort of old school way of looking at the radar data because as debris is being lofted in the tornado, debris actually has a radar cross-section.",
        "You can see it in the same way that the radar, quote, unquote, \"\"sees the raindrops.",
        "But using correlation coefficient and some of the other advanced products, we can actually get a bit more information on that debris ball so we can, you know, there are times it's not clear whether that circulation in the Doppler signature is actually on the ground as a tornado.",
        "Using the debris ball and the correlation coefficient and other products together, we really can improve our ability, perhaps, to detect the tornado on the ground.",
        "And that certainly leads to improved warning.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You know, whenever there's a big storm, it feels like climate change gets thrown into the mix.",
        "Is there any evidence of a link between tornado frequency or strength and global warming?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, you know, I've been all over places talking about this because clearly as a scientist who understands the peer review literature and the president of the AMS, who recently released a 2012 climate change statement, I know that climate change is an issue and there are things that we need to be concerned about with human-caused climate change and the natural climate change.",
        "But on tornados, the peer review literature is just not very mature on this right now.",
        "It's much more mature on the link between climate change and drought or heat waves or even the intensity of rainfall, and even more so as well on hurricanes in terms of the intensity of hurricanes, perhaps, increasing in the future.",
        "And if I were to cascade along that spectrum, scientific literature relating individual tornadic occurrence in climate change is very immature at this point",
        "I think we have to be careful on that jump, although I know there's a tendency to do it.",
        "There is great deal of research ongoing right now at places like Purdue University or even by one of our doctoral students, Victo Gensini, here at the University of Georgia, looking at climate change and the type of environment that might emerge that could support, you know, tornadic storms, wind shear profiles that Jeff Trapp and others at Purdue have been doing this work as well.",
        "So that's sort of where we are, and I think we just have to be very careful on sort of causality for individual tornadic storms.",
        "And that's where we have to leave it.",
