        "That's right.",
        "At about the same time, Republicans were definitely taking more blame.",
        "We've just been hearing about the looming debt ceiling and you asked people about that.",
        "And you found, to cite a headline from your poll, 4 in 10 say the government can go past debt limit.",
        "You mean to just blow through it?",
        "Well, they think we can go past the deadline without major problems.",
        "But 47 percent, a few more, say that it is essential to deal with this debt fix before the deadline to avoid a crisis in our economy.",
        "This was similar to something we saw in 2011 going into the debt ceiling.",
        "For a lot of Americans, this is a very opaque issue and it's hard to understand the implications of it.",

        "Forty-two percent say Obama should give ground.",

        "And there's very little room to compromise in the political bases.",
        "Most Democrats say it would be unacceptable for Obama to back down on this.",
        "But most Republicans say it would be unacceptable for their party leaders to back down on this.",
        "And that's where we are right now.",
        "You're saying, in effect, this logjam didn't descend upon us from heaven.",
        "This is a conflict in our society, as well.",

        "The source is unclear.",
        "I mean, they may be hearing what their political leaders are saying.",
        "But their political leaders are certainly also hearing what they're saying.",
        "You asked a question about the Tea Party.",
        "Are Republican leaders paying too much attention to them?",
        "Most Democrats say yes.",
        "But I was surprised at how few Republicans do.",
        "Only, I think, 18 percent said they're paying too much attention to the Tea Party.",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "We've been hearing a lot in coverage of Capitol Hill and from political leaders in Washington about concerns in the Republican Party that the Tea Party is holding too much sway.",
        "Well, in the general Republican electorate nationwide, that's not that widespread a concern.",
        "Only 18 percent of Republicans think the Tea Party is getting too much attention from leadership.",
        "Forty percent think it's right and 24 percent still say there's too little attention to the Tea Party.",
        "Even Republicans who themselves don't agree with the Tea Party don't really express a lot of concern about too much Tea Party influence."
