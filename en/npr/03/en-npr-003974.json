        "And then they came from over around Bed-Stuy - the British did - and they came back from Bay Ridge, and they sort of cornered Washington up into what is today Brooklyn Heights.",
        "And then he sat up in the hill for two days and suddenly was convinced by his generals that he ought to get down to the Brooklyn ferry really quickly.",

        "But in the course of trying to find the right spot to signal from, I realize that these signal posts had become anti-Soviet missile sites that the American military used.",

        "And Rick Santorum was, you know, at the end, if you looked at the debate, he was on the far left or the far right, not ideologically but just on - when you looked at the candidates, and he was out visiting all 99 counties, doing the grunt work that we always said wins, but we never thought it would matter because everything was on the debates, how Gingrich looked, how Rick Perry looked, how Mitt Romney looked.",
        "And so tremendous comeback win, although the polls show it at the end, tremendous comeback win for Rick Santorum.",
        "But at the same time, Mitt Romney, as you say, spent a lot of time away from Iowa, focusing a lot on New Hampshire, at the last second thought he had a shot of winning it, and I guess if he had eight more votes than Rick Santorum, he did win it.",
        "Well, he won it, but last time he was disappointed after investing heavily in New Hampshire - excuse me, in Iowa, and coming up second to Mike Huckabee.",
