        "And prior to camping out in Iowa for some time, Santorum has done a lot of events here and in the traditional manner, not like some of the candidates, who do two events a day.",
        "He does six events and works it.",
        "Presumably he'll get a boost.",

        "Ron Paul is the other winner, he would say in a three-way tie, he would say, in Iowa, but he comes in with much sunnier prospects here in New Hampshire.",
        "Well, his message resonates naturally with a good deal of the Republican electorate.",
        "Certainly there's a libertarian streak in New Hampshire, fiscal conservativism, small government is big.",
        "The wars weren't hugely popular here, and he's had a campaign that's been working it on the ground for months, phone-banking daily.",
        "Who's on the air?",

        "Ron Paul's been up.",
        "Romney's got some ads up, and sort of like in Iowa, although we would anticipate there will be some ads whacking Romney, you know, he's been able to skate through without the sort of sustained barrage that, you know, his Super PAC, run by folks that are officially not with him but, you know, unofficially strong supporters have been, you know, beating down people in Iowa with.",

        "Hard to say.",
        "I mean, Huntsman has certainly, you know, staked it all on New Hampshire.",
        "He had his 150th event last night in Peterborough, where Romney will be tonight.",
        "You could argue that the results out of Iowa, the muddle may auger to his benefit, but, you know, he's going to have to pull votes directly from Romney is at least the conventional thinking on that."

        "This is an open primary here in New Hampshire next week, which means independents can vote for a Republican if they'd like to.",

        "So it's not a completely open primary, but it's close.",
        "And of course the verdict in New Hampshire is critical to validate Romney's claim that he's the person who can get elected in the general election because he can appeal to independent voters.",
        "So if he doesn't do well in the state, that's problematic for sort of the basic premise of his campaign.",

        "I don't know what endorsements mean, but he got John McCain today, he has Charlie Bass, Kelly Ayotte, the senator, former governor and senator Judd Gregg.",
        "But Newt Gingrich has the Manchester - the New Hampshire Union Leader, and they've been attacking Romney, I was going to say left and right, right and right, constantly.",

        "What does that do to the primary electorate?",
        "Well, one thing that was interesting is that Speaker Gingrich - former Speaker Gingrich essentially didn't, you know, return for several weeks in the wake of that endorsement, which certainly boosted his campaign and, you know, certainly made the Romney folks a little nervous.",

        "They've done it a number of times.",
        "And there's also, if you remember, Pat Buchanan won here in '96, John McCain won twice, and so I think that the national news media may fuel some of that sentiment of we're going to send a message, we're not going to have a coronation here.",

        "You know, what fascinates me, too, is that while the Republican field still seems very muddled, maybe not in New Hampshire but nationally, yet it seems like the DNC, the White House, they were all convinced it's Mitt Romney.",
        "The Democrats have opened up a little shop in Iowa to talk - make their talking points.",
        "And they're all - the word today is that Mitt Romney is the 25-percent man, the fact that he only can get 25 percent in Iowa, 25 percent nationally in the polls, and it just seems like while the Republicans don't know who the nominee will be, the Democrats and the White House are convinced it's Mitt Romney.",
        "Josh Rogers, we think Mitt Romney will do better than 25 percent here in New Hampshire.",
        "But at this point, he's got to be trying to manage expectations.",
        "Well, I think that's right, and, you know, a win would be a win, but, you know, talking to a lot of Republican strategists, they think if he wins by anything less than 10 points then, you know, could easily be spun as lackluster, although, you know, he will walk away with the win.",
        "And Linda Fowler, one thing we also have to understand, we were talking about the importance of the evangelical vote, social causes in the state of Iowa, it's a little different here in New Hampshire.",
        "Well, it is.",
        "The evangelical vote is no more than 15 to 20 percent of the primary electorate.",
        "Assuming that Rick Santorum picks up most of that, now that Bachmann isn't in the race, and Perry's not campaigning here, some will go to Ron Paul.",
        "He picked up some in Iowa.",
        "So my - the person I'm watching is not Santorum but is Paul.",

        "As we just heard from Linda Fowler, professor of government at Dartmouth College, Michele Bachmann out of the race.",
        "It looks like Rick Perry is effectively skipping the race here in New Hampshire, going on to the primary in South Carolina.",
        "How does this dynamic shift, as you have Ron Paul a strong third, Rick Santorum the new man in the race against Mitt Romney?",
        "And, Ken Rudin, it's interesting that you have a meeting scheduled for this coming weekend in Texas of movement conservatives - those would be toward the right wing - people meeting to see: Can we settle on one person to run against Mitt Romney?",
        "Well, it's clear from the beginning that the conservative wing in the Republican Party - which is not a small wing.",
        "I mean, basically that is the Republican Party - not happy with the prospect of Mitt Romney as the nominee, who has had, shall we say, somewhat-liberal positions in the past when he was running for office in Massachusetts.",
        "They would love for the conservative vote not to be split.",
        "They would love to unite around one candidate.",
        "And while Iowa voters did help narrow the field a little bit with Michele Bachmann's leaving, you still have Ron Paul.",
        "You still have Newt Gingrich.",
        "You still have Rick Santorum, and you still have Newt Gingrich.",
        "So you will still have four conservatives still splitting the vote, and that's the thing they don't want to see, because that can only help Mitt Romney."
