        "In 2006, 2008, the Republican Party was virtually obliterated - not just in this state, but across New England, this entire corner of the country.",
        "How has that shifted in the last couple of years?",
        "Is that going to continue?",
        "Well, in 2010, the state legislature, both chambers, were elected with veto-proof majorities of Republicans.",
        "But their agenda of expanding where people can take guns, trying to introduce bills about evolution and so forth - I think people who just voiced their disgust at the Democrats may be taking a harder look at Republicans this time around.",
        "And I'm not sure that having this highly visible, very extreme legislature is helpful to the party in the general election.",
        "And there are a number of interesting congressional races in New Hampshire, as well, Josh Rogers."
