        "I think that Governor Romney had set his sights at second or possibly even third place.",
        "I think it was perceived around here, at least, that Iowa was not necessarily going to be his strongest state.",
        "Until recently, as we - as you heard - we've all heard, Governor Romney hadn't put much of an effort into Iowa, but did near the end.",
        "And I think his showing is really quite extraordinary, given the level of effort.",
        "Now, it shifts to New Hampshire.",
        "And I've been in the business of being involved in this process since 1979, when I endorsed Howard Baker for president.",
        "And things can change very quickly.",
        "run like you're three votes behind, and don't expect anything to be the same next Tuesday as it is today.",
        "I think Rick Santorum's good showing in Iowa and the fact that he has worked hard in this state now for almost two years now - as has Jon Huntsman - means that, you know, Mitt Romney, who's also worked hard here, will have to match him, you know, step for step during the next five days, because a lot of people will make up their minds between now and next Tuesday.",
        "And Senator Sanborn, the person - Ron Paul came in, well, maybe a slight disappointment there in Iowa, but expected to do very well here in New Hampshire, as well.",
        "Yeah, Neal.",
        "I mean, clearly, the fact that the Iowa results said, you know, one very obvious point, and that's, you know, there's three - we're essentially down to three different candidates in this race.",
        "As you note, Ron Paul has been truly the consistent, stable voice, something people can truly believe that, you know, he's - when he says what he says, he means what he says, he has a phenomenal group of people working here in the state of New Hampshire.",
        "He's been here for some time, as you know.",
        "He has, you know, very dedicated, loyal support.",
        "You know, one of the things I find that's so exciting about Dr. Paul is, obviously, when we talk - start talking about how some candidates have come up and come down, and there's been this real gyration within the Republican Party, that Dr. Paul's numbers have continued just to migrate north, that he hasn't had to back up at any level whatsoever.",
        "And, you know, people are really ready to pick a president or a presidential candidate that actually, you know, says they're going to cut the size of government, going to push back on the scope and the regulation.",
        "And this is the type of state for that.",
        "As Congressman Bass knows, we're a people that really believe in personal freedoms, who really embrace personal responsibility.",

        "We're working really hard, and we expect to see some great things coming out of it.",

        "And, obviously, he has the shoulders, as he puts it, to bear what is going to be a very, very nasty campaign for president.",

        "And I truly appreciate that.",
        "And for Congressman Paul, compared to Governor Romney, you know, all these endorsements that the governor picks up continue to be very similar to where he is.",
        "And I personally think it's a challenge for him to have McCain come in, just like with Christie.",
        "And I appreciate them both.",
        "But it perpetrates the conversation that he can only seem to find moderate Republicans who have been, you know, not quite as strict on cutting, not quite as strict on pushing back on regulation or taxation.",
        "So he hasn't had that ability to truly cross all the borders between conservative, moderate and maybe liberal Republicans.",
        "Although he did get Nikki Haley in South Carolina.",
        "He did - absolutely.",
        "I stand corrected on that.",

        "You know, that's a great question, whether or not they get aimed at Mitt Romney, whether or not they get aimed at Rick Santorum.",

        "There's nothing that I can see that Barack Obama can say about Mitt Romney that somebody else hasn't already said.",
