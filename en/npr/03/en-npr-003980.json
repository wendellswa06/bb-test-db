        "So it may not go much further than the vote today.",
        "All right.",
        "One other story I want to ask you about - The New York Times published a piece yesterday about the presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in 2016, saying that there were these claims of sexual harassment, pay disparity by staffers.",
        "What are you learning about this?",
        "Well, the complaints were, in particular, made by female staffers who talked about mistreatment, sexual harassment and being paid much less than their male counterparts.",
        "And the Sanders campaign is not denying any of this.",
        "They are talking about how the campaign grew too fast.",
        "And they released a statement saying that harassment and discrimination are not tolerated by Bernie Sanders himself and that they took some steps in 2016 to fix the problems."

        "You've got 700 miles of barriers down here.",
        "There are vehicle barriers in the remote areas of the west desert and pedestrian fencing.",
        "They range from chain-link fences that are easy to cut to these 12- to 18-foot-tall iron bollard fences.",

        "But even Democrats agree that border security needs to be improved.",
        "So clearly, even all that technology isn't passing muster.",
        "It's not securing the border to the level that Democrats and Republicans would like to see.",
