        "They are.",
        "There are some sort of preliminary discussions, but again, what the Sunnis say is they want to see a little more evidence of what this government is going to look like, who the Shiite prime minister will be and what sort of offers are gonna be made in terms of how many Sunnis will be allowed to be in the cabinet and will get some of these high-level ministries and so far, there's been no concrete offer that we're aware of.",
