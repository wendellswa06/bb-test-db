        "But because her mother, the nurse, you know, sat there at the kitchen table encouraging her daughters to study and study and study, this is what shaped Sonia Sotomayor.",

        "She's not a fancy flourish merchant.",
        "You know, she's not a person who is going to reinvent the philosophical approach to law.",
        "But she does believe that the law is to be understood by the common man in the street.",
        "And I think there's a lot to be said for that, actually.",
        "Well, let's talk about one more set of experiences here, and these are the experiences of Gerald Shargel, a well-known lawyer who writes for you in The Daily Beast about the aftermath of the attempted Christmas Day bombing of a jetliner heading into Detroit.",
        "And Mr. Shargel writes that he thinks he's changed his opinion about the criminal process when it comes to terrorists."

        "Yes, he does.",
        "But, you know, what is really interesting, I think, about this moment in our society is that this terrorist threat is making everybody sort of rethink their approach to law, you know, civil liberties.",
