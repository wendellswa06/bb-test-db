        "Now when you say some support, what are some specific stories you've heard from specific people about aid that Pakistani authorities are providing now to the Taliban or other groups?",
        "Well, the most significant types of support tend to be non-lethal support - information, intelligence, assistance with training, actually getting across the border, logistical help, food stuffs, petroleum.",
        "But there tend to be no good evidence of large-scale weapons being funneled to militant groups from Pakistani authorities.",
        "What did you hear from people when you were talking to them about this?",
        "Oh, when you get on the ground, it's quite clear.",
        "People talk about it openly.",
        "There really is no doubt in a sense talking to people on both sides of the border that there is a lot of support from elements, for example, of the Pakistani government.",
        "What's important to understand historically is that elements of the Pakistani government provided significant support during the 1990s to the Taliban, and it was fundamental to the Taliban's success in taking over virtually all of Afghanistan.",
        "So by the September 11th attacks, the Taliban, with strong Pakistani, backing was running Afghanistan.",
        "But, wait a minute, because you've mentioned that historic support for the Taliban.",
        "President Pervez Musharraf said as long ago as 2002, we've cut that off.",

        "Pakistan has denied aiding the Taliban ever since as far as I know.",
        "How can this be going on so openly still?",
        "Well, I think you'd have to direct that question to the Pakistan government.",
        "I mean, what is clear in a lot of the declassified documents during the 1990s as well is they consistently denied this - even in private - to senior U.S.",
        "government officials.",
        "So it's not entirely surprising that they would deny this, certainly publicly.",

        "publicly denied many times that it was providing support to the Mujahideen.",
        "In fact, it was, and we know this quite clearly historically.",
        "Did this tipping off in any specific incident get Americans killed?",
        "I am not aware that Americans were killed because of this information that was provided to insurgent groups.",
        "It has gotten Afghan officials, including border post officials, killed.",
        "I suspect firefights along the border have gotten individuals from both sides killed."

        "How could the U.S.",

        "Well, it's not certain that information that the U.S.",

        "When you spoke with U.S.",

        "And it would be nice to say this was beating a dead horse, but in point of fact, the idea of mercantilism - the idea that you should import more than you export, and that the way a country gets rich is by importing, excuse me, is by exporting everything and importing money - it's an idea that animates the entire government of China.",

        "It's a book about individual freedom, about individual liberty, and about individual responsibility.",
        "And the fundamental thesis of \"\"The Wealth of Nations\"\" is that to the extent that we are free and to the extent that we are equal before the law and to the extent that that law is a just and reasonable law, that is the extent to which we get rich.",
