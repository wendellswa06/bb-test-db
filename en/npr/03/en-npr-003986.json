        "You're welcome, David.",
        "Yes, Adam Smith knew Watt - not only knew him, but actually got him a place to work.",
        "The ironmongers in Glasgow wouldn't let Watt work on his steam engine because he didn't belong to their little union group, their little trade association.",
        "And so, Smith was instrumental in getting Watt a space to work at Glasgow University.",
        "And he actually invested in a couple of machines that Watt developed.",
        "And he wrote about Watt and what a genius he was and still, he missed the whole Industrial Revolution.",
        "And it's interesting how he missed it.",
        "Smith thought the Industrial Revolution had taken place already.",
        "This is the 1770's that he is writing - 1760's, 1770's, he thinks it's already happened.",
        "Because he says, look, in the long run, the only way we could really create increased productivity is through labor-saving devices.",

        "We can people to work more hours, but there are only so many hours in a day.",
        "It's labor-saving machinery, and he goes on to give some examples.",
        "He thought it had happened.",
        "What he didn't foresee wasn't the Industrial Revolution, it was the quantity.",
        "He foresaw the quality of the Industrial Revolution.",
