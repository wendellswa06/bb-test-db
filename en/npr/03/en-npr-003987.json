        "Perhaps you're a liberal and you have another point of view on this, but it's something that has to be argued and thrashed out within the political system.",
        "Whereas, when you talk about negative rights - the right to be free from certain kinds of oppression, including the right to be free from having yourself owned by some other person - those things are absolute, and we don't have to argue about those because we know one doesn't impinge on the other.",
        "One of the things you address in your book, P.J., is the argument or the contention that a lot of people have is that Adam Smith was - \"\"The Wealth of Nations\"\" was an amoral stance, basically summed up by the Gordon Gekko philosophy, greed is good.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'ROURKE: Yeah, greed is good.",
        "And it turns out that the only way that Adam Smith ever argues that greed is good is that he says that greed keeps - you know, shopkeepers and manufacturers and other businesspeople will get together and collude and try and keep prices high and wages low, he said, but they're too damn greedy to ever stick to the agreements they make."

        "He said, slavery doesn't really work because this is not the way to motivate people for them to get the most done and so on.",

        "And it wasn't really until America succeeded and arguably until America got through the Civil War and really proved that it would survive that people could look and say, oh, democracy is one way that we can provide some buffer between these sources of power - the very rich and the very poor.",
        "One thing that kept Smith from worrying as much as he might of about the divisions between the rich and poor was his understanding that A, this was a fluid situation, that the same person who was rich right now and poor right now is not necessarily going to be the same person 10 years hence.",
