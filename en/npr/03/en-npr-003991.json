        "Foreign diplomats and journals are not allowed into the trial.",
        "They were allowed on Wednesday briefly.",
        "And I think that was because the regime was feeling the pressure a little bit from the international community, and what they like to do in these instances is they like a little valve.",
        "They just open it up a little bit and let the pressure ease somewhat and then bang.",
        "So the trial was closed again yesterday, closed again today, although an American diplomat is allowed to go to attend because John William Yettaw is an American citizen.",
        "Okay, I suppose with all these closings to the media it's hard to know what's going on in there and in fact it's hard to understand this story.",
        "It seems so bizarre that someone would swim across a lake to her home, and yet there's serious implications here, aren't there, especially if Aung San Suu Kyi is convicted?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean there's very serious implications for her.",
        "But let me just tell you that it got a little bit more bizarre today.",

        "So it's a little far-fetched.",
        "But this is a very serious thing for Aung San Suu Kyi, of course, because if convicted again she gets potentially put either back under house arrest or she gets placed in prison again.",
        "And that means she can't participate in any way in next year's election here.",
        "Now, she's been barred from running as a candidate.",
        "But if she's in jail or if she's under house arrest here, then she's barred from participating at all, and that presents a serious problem for the opposition here."

        "It was at 9,000 at the beginning of the blowout, but that pressure was depleted by a very large hole in the top of the straw that's drawing it out of the reservoir.",
