        "Under the proposal I make today, if the FBI needs information right away, right away, the FBI could notify a judge that they were going to get it, and then go get it without waiting for a response.",
        "But that proposal was not adopted.",
        "The committee tried to balance these new police powers by demanding more information about how administrative subpoenas are used.",
        "The FBI will also have to report to Congress on how it uses another tool known as a mail cover, which allows agents to trace letters through the Postal Service.",
        "But at the same time, the FBI will get more authority over the Postal Service.",
        "Zoe Strickland, chief privacy officer for the Postal Service, is concerned about language that would take away the authority of the Postal Inspection Service to resist or limit such searches.",
        "The inspection service are the experts around mail, so it seems appropriate that they would work hand in glove with the requesting agency, and we're not quite sure how it would work with just a `thou shalt' sort of direction."
