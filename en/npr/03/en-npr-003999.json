        "In contrast, President Obama is now trying to enlist both China and Russia as allies to head off such 21st century threats as a nuclear-armed Iran.",

        "The commerce affects our peoples lives in so many ways.",
        "What Mr. Obama didnt say there is that of the more than $400 billion in trade between the two countries, more than $300 billion flows just one way, from China to the U.S.",

        "Mr.",

        "What they have to do, though, is to focus on certain policies and I think Dean was right when he said that the Democrats need to take a stronger position in defining what moral values include, because if you have black Americans, many of whom are Christian, thinking that you cannot be a good Christian and a good Democrat at the same time because the Democrats support certain policies--gay rights or certain other policies--that they cannot be Christian and Democrat, then the party is in trouble.",
