        "...procreation and so forth artificially, goes against the church teaching.",
        "Now the thing is, how you somehow manage to marry, to use a phrase, that particular moral message with the message, the other educational messages that secular organizations are pushing, they, in a sense, have to work together.",
        "Well, you know, sub-Saharan Africa counts for about 60 percent of the people infected with AIDS, I think around 40 million, and they're saying 80 people may die from AIDS by the year 2025.",
        "And so this is a serious problem.",
        "So the question becomes, just as Roman Catholics here in the United States ignore--largely ignore the pope's edicts on birth control, how much Africa will do the same thing.",
        "I mean, yeah, this should be no surprise coming from the pope.",
        "I mean, this is very, very consistent but the question is a matter of safety and danger, and how much people will decide on their own that we need to use condoms as a safeguard.",
        "As we look at Africa, we also see a great deal of applause and a couple of `it's about times,' if you will, coming from the G8 and the nations there forgiving much of the debt, quite frankly, to many of the countries there on that continent, 18 of--or 14 of the 18 coming from that continent.",
        "Some will see this as a real step in trying to get Africa and those poor countries on their feet, E.R.",
        "Shipp.",
        "Well, the two issues are not disconnected, in a way.",
        "Because of AIDS, among other things, you have countries' economies are just ravaged.",
        "So this forgiveness of some of the debt, not all of the debt, but some of the debt, will supposedly free up money for health care, education, infrastructure and the like.",
        "The test is to see whether the money can be redirected in that regard.",
        "But the United States and others should not pat themselves on the back too soon.",
        "There's still a long way to go, and there are many people saying that there still needs to be a doubling of aid to those African nations, and that there also needs to be a freeing up of trade policy.",
        "I certainly agree on the latter part in terms of the trade policy.",
        "Part of the problem that we've had in the past, though, Ed, it's not the problem of aid per se.",
        "It's the fact that once the aid gets there, the government structures don't get it to the places that actually need it.",
        "You know, many--not--by no means not all, but in many, many of these countries, you still have dysfunctional governments if not outright tyrannical governments that have, in a sense, you know, taken the aid and, you know, lined the pockets of it.",
        "And unless there's a continue oversight from the Western powers that are giving this aid, you're just going to, in a sense, be throwing good money after bad.",
        "I'm not saying that this debt package isn't--this debt relief package isn't a bad idea, but there really has to be some oversight so we just don't keep repeating the same mistakes of the past.",
        "Hey, George, take the big picture...",

        "Just one second, to pick up on your point, but I just want you to also take a big-picture look at what was just suggested there, and that is the idea that E.R.",
        "talks about, the impact.",
        "When we look at 80 million Africans who may die, it's predicted, by the year 2025, what Robert suggests, that this debt relief package does not stop, necessarily, all of the ills and the problems and the problems with corruption in government.",
        "So when you look at those two things, what else has to happen here, George, to really get this continent on its feet, running and competitive?",
        "Thanks, Steve.",
        "Well, I mean, we just really had to have some--a lot of private investment as well.",
        "I mean, the government thinks it's important and I disagree with Robert in terms of it wasn't just--I mean, I don't think he said that, but they really do need more aid because we give such a small percentage of it, and of course you have to improve efficiency.",
        "But the real key, and there are about 200 companies in the US that actually have formed an organization--in fact, I'm meeting with them in the next two weeks in Baltimore--saying this is a great place to invest.",
        "They're saying that, you know, the return in Africa's better than anywhere else in the world, so I think the key in addition to the government's support, that is badly needed, is going to be private, individual corporations that partner with people in Africa to really bring it back to the kind of economic strength that it needs.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "All right.",
        "Let me quickly get to, with only about a minute for each of you, the idea that Costco, the wholesaler, is announcing now that it's adding health insurance to what you can buy at its warehouse.",

        "Is this a good idea, E.R.?",
        "Well, it shows how desperate we are to find alternatives to health care.",
        "I pay my own health-care insurance every month.",
        "It's over $500 a month, so I can understand that people may be looking to go to a Costco or anywhere else.",
        "Costco is promising that, in its pilot program, anyway, those people who qualify can save anywhere from 5 percent to 20 percent off of what they would normally be paying for individual health-care packages.",
        "So it's worth an experiment, anyway.",
        "I think it's a great idea.",
        "I mean, I think one of the--I mean, one of the big problems, obviously, whether you're looking at government health insurance programs or even many of these big companies, is, A, you know, getting access to everybody and also, you know, controlling costs and so forth.",
        "I think it's good when you have a company like this, in the sense, becoming a third force.",
        "It's a pilot program right now, but hopefully it'll--we'll see more experimentation down this road.",
        "I think it's extremely creative.",
        "I think it's a wonderful idea, but I am worried about people with existing conditions that may not get the coverage, and that's why we really do need universal health care."

        "I mean, you know, there's a wink and a nod and a little laugh when you first hear about Costco, but one should not worry necessarily where it comes from as long as the coverage in an of itself is equal to what you would be able to buy elsewhere.",
