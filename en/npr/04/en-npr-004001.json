        "That's right.",
        "However, an important part of the encyclopedia will also be to engage citizen science.",
        "So there will be at one level an expert group that will be working on providing information.",
        "But we think there will be many citizen scientists out there who can provide information as they go on their nature walks.",
        "We can imagine a future where the birders will go with our handheld devices and take pictures and wirelessly send the information to the encyclopedia.",
        "So we see this as harnessing the power of many contributors at many levels.",
        "But we will start with the expert community and the established organizations that have been working on studying species.",
        "And how long do you think it will take to assemble this encyclopedia?",

        "I believe that you'll need to come up with a new name because species does not apply to bacteria and other forms of life that reproduce asexually.",
        "If you're talking about vertebrates, common large plants, et cetera, that - where you get two individuals contributing genetic material that can defines separate species as the things that can reproduce together.",
        "But with all types of life that reproduce by dividing like bacteria divide, it's non-sexual therefore how can you possibly distinguish which groups are the same species and which are two separate species?",
        "The caller is exactly right.",
        "For microbes, the species concept begins to break down, so the experts who study microbes now use the term file types, genetic variants.",
        "So that's a fine point.",
        "It's an encyclopedia of all life, all variants whether they fit the conventional definition of species or not.",
        "It will start with the animals and plants and the fungi.",
        "The microbes are recognized as more difficult and they will be tackled later.",

        "But later, we will have to deal with questions of copyright and intellectual property.",
        "And so you'll start out with the low hanging fruit, so to speak.",
        "Yes, that's right.",
