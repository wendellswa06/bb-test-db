        "Like, you know, you get those guys that have been infantry for like, 20 years and they're just broken, broken down.",
        "So yeah, war changes people, and it changes women in different ways than men.",
        "Well, let's talk about those different ways.",
        "What were the women telling you that set them apart from the men that they served with?",
        "For men going to war, it's been about becoming a man.",
        "And for women going to war, it's also about becoming a man.",
        "That's the difference.",

        "You're out there to make sure you, and the people you went with, come home.",
        "So changing your look may be considered somewhat superficial but clearly, you found deeper changes.",

        "This is what I need to get rid of in order to, like, be successful and to be accepted, and to be respected by my peers and subordinates, my soldiers.",
        "So for this Iraq vet to earn the respect of other soldiers, she thought she had to hide anything that made her seem feminine.",
        "Sure.",
        "These characteristics she felt were just what the military called weaknesses; things like discussing things, to come to a decision.",
        "Zavage went to Baqubah in Iraq in 2005, when the war was getting really bad.",
        "She ended up overseeing security at a forward operating base called Warhorse.",

        "But what I think's really interesting is the discussion that was going on inside her head this whole time.",

        "And now, she's kind of trying to get that part of herself back.",
        "I feel like I just did a major, major undoing when I got out of the military.",
        "And it took like, so much to even like, get a grip - sort of like, figure out myself again.",
        "Undoing - that's a very interesting word.",
        "Yes.",
        "This transition back to civilian life is different for everyone.",
        "One of the people we were talking about earlier, Alyssa Corcoran, who was over in Afghanistan - and there's a photo she provided, of her in full-body armor, her fingers reaching towards the trigger of an M-4 carbine.",
        "Now, she's out of the military; and we took another picture of her at home.",
