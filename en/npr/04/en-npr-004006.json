        "It was as if the Seahawks were just there to lend support.",
        "How big a factor was Bettis in this game?",
        "Not that big a factor.",
        "I mean, he ran the ball effectively when he was in, but the play that mattered the most from the running back position, of course, was Willie Parker's record-breaking run of 75-yards.",
        "But still, it's a wonderful way for a great player to cap a career, winning a Super Bowl in his hometown.",

        "The four men who were originally charged were four Guatemalan national policemen and members of the country's elite anti-organized crime unit, including the director of the anti-organized crime unit.",

        "When they reached Guatemala City, however, they broke off from the caravan and said that they had a meeting to go to, and they were never seen alive again.",
        "So it's not really known if they were meeting with drug dealers on purpose or if they were simply mistaken for Columbian drug dealers - that's a version of the story the Salvadoran government is circulating - or if they were killed on contract by a Guatemalan organized crime group acting on behalf of Salvadoran drug traffickers.",
        "Sources originally told us that this was a drug deal gone bad, that the men who were killed had reneged on some payment or failed to deliver something and were therefore killed.",

        "And that moves on forward in time, in terms of the vision, talking about treating horses as ecological analogs for the 13 species of horses that were present in the late Pleistocene, and on to elephants and cheetah and lions, all of which were present and played a very important role in North American ecosystems.",

        "One might ask if Asian or African elephants can serve as a proxy for the five species of elephants we had in North America, perhaps they can knock back these woody species that happen to be overtaking the grasslands of the Southwest, a threat to biodiversity, but also an economic threat to ranchers.",
        "If we, in fact, did reintroduce elephants or lions or camels to wild areas in the American Plains, would they have a dramatic effect on the environment with respect to other species that we enjoy having around?",
        "In other words, would they, in turn, prey upon other animals, not just the livestock, but other wild creatures, which would disappear because we've introduced these bigger--or, as you say, megafauna--into the American environment?"
