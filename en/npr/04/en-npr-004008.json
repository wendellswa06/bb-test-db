        "But it was only after the British invaded in 1903 that the Chinese decided they'd better integrate Tibet into China as if it were like a province.",
        "They didn't manage this until 1950.",
        "They sent an army in.",
        "The first nine years they negotiated a kind of concessional arrangement where they allowed the traditional system to continue.",
        "That collapsed with a big uprising by Tibetans against the Chinese presence.",
        "And then they began these huge social engineering projects trying to really eliminate Tibetan culture and religion.",
        "And in 1980, they reversed that as we all have seen throughout China to a more moderate phase.",
        "And now they're really trying to make Tibet into part of China, not through any socialist method but by using modernity.",
        "Development is the big mantra for the Chinese in Tibet and this is part of that effort."
