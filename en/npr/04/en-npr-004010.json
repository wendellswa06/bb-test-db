        "Hitting a mosquito with a raindrop is a difficult experiment.",
        "The first thing we did was, dropped small drops from the third-floor story of our building onto a container of mosquitoes.",
        "And you can imagine, that didn't go very well.",
        "It's kind of like playing the worst game of darts you can imagine.",
        "So the team took the experiment inside.",
        "They fired jets of water drops at the mosquitoes, and recorded the results with super-high-speed video cameras.",
        "And they found that mosquitoes don't actually dodge raindrops; they hitch a ride.",
        "So as the raindrop falls, rather than resisting the raindrop, they basically join together - kind of like a stowaway - on this comet.",
        "So as a result, they get very, very little force.",
        "To them, it's like getting hit with a feather.",
        "And they ride the drop for about a thousandth of a second, until their wings catch the wind like little kites and tear the mosquito away from the drop.",
        "And the mosquitoes don't seem to be any the worse for wear.",
        "Well, it's hard to see the expression on a mosquito's face, but they definitely survived.",
        "And most of them didn't even land.",
        "They continued flying, as if nothing had happened.",
        "The results are published in the \"\"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\"\" The real hazard for mosquitoes is, apparently, if they are flying very close to the ground.",
        "If they don't peel off from the raindrop in time, they live out that axiom about being caught between a rock and a hard place.",
        "For example, if you're standing on the ground and a piano falls on you, you basically get smashed.",
        "David Hu expects that's what would happen to the mosquito.",

        "Well, for those guys who are making flying robots the size of insects, as long as your robot is small enough, you don't have to worry about rain.",
        "For biologists, here's another exquisite example of how life has evolved to live on a planet that's inundated with fluids.",
        "And for anyone who might be tempted to kill a mosquito by swatting it in midair, it'll never work.",

        "Last month, Springer signed up for an all-day workshop on climate, but it was canceled due to lack of interest.",
        "He says it's ironic that one of the talks was about whether the public cares about the problems climate change might cause farmers.",
        "And we couldn't get more than 11 farmers to come to the meeting to care about it (laughter).",
