        "Robert Novak wasn't the first journalist who learned about Valerie Plame from White House officials, but in a column on July 14th, 2003, Novak cited two senior administration officials to say Valerie Plame had been involved in recommending her husband, Joseph Wilson, for a CIA fact-finding trip to Africa to see whether Iraq had sought nuclear weapons there.",
        "It wasn't an extensive reference but it turned out to be a critical one.",
        "Plame's work for the CIA was classified at the time.",

        "An unnamed Official A had spoken to Novak.",
        "Fitzgerald wrote, `Libby was advised by Official A that Novak would be writing a story about Wilson's wife.",
        "Novak repeatedly declined to comment for this story, but Official A turns out to be Karl Rove, the deputy White House chief of staff who's the president's top political strategist.",
        "That word comes from an adviser to Rove who spoke to NPR on condition he not be named.",
        "Here was the conservative columnist back in June on CNN, where he was a paid commentator.",

        "They are most of the time, and they're doing so with the help of sniffing dogs, with cranes and with helicopters.",
        "But one other thing that distinguishes this earthquake from what happened in L'Aquila in 2009 is that L'Aquila was mostly isolated in one city of 80,000 people that had many roads going to and from, whereas in this case, the earthquake really stretches from coast to coast, striking smaller-sized towns along the way, many of which are nestled in the mountains and are only accessible with small, little winding roads.",
        "So access is proving to be difficult, and I'm sure - and this is based on what first responders are telling me - it's going to take days to fully understand the enormity of this disaster.",
