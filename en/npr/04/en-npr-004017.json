        "And all of his movies, and there are not that many of them don't forget, it's just about, you know a half a dozen or so Wes Anderson movies, but he - he is one of those people who is actually able to walk that fine line between comedy and tragedy and dealing with the dysfunctional family.",

        "Lots to this movie, a great cast too, Shirley Maclaine, Marcello Mastroianni, Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, and more.",
        "Murray, do you see family dysfunction evolving over the decades as we go from something like \"\"The Pharmacist\"\" in the '30s, which we listened to earlier, to something like the \"\"Royal Tenenbaums\"\" which was much more recent?",
        "Yeah, absolutely because at a certain point, and I really think - I mean earlier, any dysfunctional family movies involved bad people.",
        "We think some of those gangster movies like \"\"Little Caesar\"\" and \"\"Public Enemy\"\" And \"\"White Heat,\"\" and functional families were the norm, you know.",
        "It's \"\"Love Finds Andy Hardy,\"\" you know, and it was Dad, Mom, junior, and sis and all was well, but then with an increased awareness of psychology and psychological realism, World War II had intervened, and then you get, you know in the best...",
        "A little more honesty, a little more gray area.",
        "So that even that wonderful American family, in one of my favorite movies of all time, \"\"The Best Years of our Lives,\"\" guess what, if your son comes home a double amputee, don't expect everything to be hunky dory all the time, he's going to explode from time to time.",
        "So, then it creeps - dysfunction creeps into nice people's lives, and then I think the real breakpoint was \"\"Ordinary People\"\" in 1980, where it was just was - it was grim and grim all the way through, and an extraordinary directorial debut for Robert Redford.",
        "Which we heard at the top of the show."

        "Murray, we know that \"\"Mommy Dearest\"\" was based on a memoir tied to real life.",
        "Right.",
        "Could one reason that we've seen so many family dysfunction movies be that people are told to write what they know, and a lot of these filmmakers are writing from their own experience?",
        "Well, and also as a couple of the listeners have pointed out, somehow we see ourselves in these films.",
        "Most - look, the \"\"Andy Hardy\"\" movie is not - I mean, the norm is not norm, is not normal.",
        "And that Hollywood ideal, just I think, especially after World War II, didn't have much resonance in people's lives.",
