        "Well a large part of the adult population of Latinos are foreign-born, and a significant number of those speak either Spanish primarily or watch Spanish news media.",
        "So if you wanted to reach out to a large segment of the Latino population, that is those who might be of an immigrant background but are U.S.",
        "citizens and therefore eligible to vote, certainly Spanish language media is going to be important for reaching out to those - to that particular constituency.",

        "You talk about the large number of people who are foreign-born, but then there's also many different cultures under this umbrella and the census which says, OK, this is not a race it's an ethnicity and mark this box - and there's all sorts of issues.",

        "And we think about Latinos at the Pew Hispanic Center, we're always thinking about important differences or what we might call important lines along which you are going to see differences in attitudes and differences in opinions.",
        "So for example in ethnicity, Mexican-Americans are the single largest group of Latinos, but there are significant populations of Puerto Rican and Cuban-Americans who are in the United States as well.",
        "But growing recently has been a really large Central American population, primarily Salvadoreno (ph) and also Juata Meteco (ph).",
        "So you see many different new groups coming in with the most recent wave of immigration.",
        "So it's a tremendously diverse population.",
        "One other big thing about Latinos is that Latinos are very young.",
        "Over a third of Latinos are under the age of 30.",
        "So you have a huge chunk of the Latino population, more so than white or black, being young.",
        "And that, of course, portends to greater, perhaps, Latino political voice in the future, though that remains to be seen.",
        "We will see what happens in the future.",
        "But at the moment.",
        "Latinos are much younger.",
        "So those two factors are really big in explaining who Latinos are, and of course the big third one is immigration.",
        "Among adult Latinos 18 and over, over half are actually foreign-born.",
        "So we're talking about a population that's primarily foreign-born, or largely foreign-born for those, for adults.",
        "Among young people though, those under the age of 18, it's the exact opposite.",
        "It's mostly native-born.",
        "So you've got a real diversity within the population on many different dimensions."
