        "Almost 30 years later, it seems impossible that the police department drop a bomb on its own city.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, I think, for me, making the film and thinking about what it means, that's sort of the most essential question that the story provokes, is sort of how does the unthinkable come to be reality?",
        "And I tried to really draw that out in terms of the moral in the film.",

        "These were improvisations.",
        "Yeah.",

        "So then, as things go bad, it becomes more and more haphazard and truly spirals out of control.",
        "There are miscalculations on the other side too.",
        "This is a group that had its intentions, but one of the things it was doing was deliberately provoking the people in that neighborhood so to force the police department to make a decision.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's accurate, and it's difficult to know at the end of the day how far they wanted to take things.",
        "I think that there's a certain point of view that says, in fact, they wanted to provoke the action of the police and show the true nature of the system as they came over the top.",
        "Did they expect them to come over the top just that violently?",
        "Did they intend to die in the house?",
        "I don't know the answer to that.",
        "It's not impossible that, in fact, they did.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "That was one of their tactics.",
        "After the initial incident in 1978, there were nine members of the group imprisoned.",
        "And when they regrouped, they were advocating on behalf of those people, and their technique to advocate was that if they riled the neighborhood up that - they wouldn't get attention on their own, but if they drew the neighborhood into the conflict, the neighbors would bring the attention of the authorities.",
        "And it still took a long time and a lot of aggravation on the part of those neighbors.",
        "But again, in fact, they did force the city's hand to act."

        "And what did you come to understand about the nature of this group?",
        "And just going back remembering, at the time, they were sometimes characterized as a radical black organization, sort of the spinoff of the Black Panthers.",
        "And we did see pictures of them holding weapons at various points.",

        "They would reject back to nature as well as black liberation.",
        "So ultimately - but - so I think some of these things apply.",
        "But then at the end of the day, especially since I made the film and I wanted to really bring in the point of view of Michael Ward, the only child who survived, and again, myself being a child at the time, there was also the sense that they were a family.",
        "And when you hear it from a child's point of view, you know, as different as they were, sometimes they were the same in the sense in which they had these religious or quasi-religious beliefs, raw food.",
        "But the children always had to eat raw food, whereas the adult, not always.",
        "And to me, that doesn't sound that different in the way a lot of Americans take their religion.",

        "And I just asked, well, did you cry when they yelled at you?",
        "And he said, yeah, we cried when they yelled at us.",
