        "What differences?",
        "Well, a language, a history, traditions that go back centuries and centuries.",

        "She then emigrated to the United States with her parents and her sister when she was 15 years old, and found herself navigating an entirely new life in Los Angeles, where her father made a living first as a musician - or at least trying to be one - and then performing exorcisms and conducting seances with the long-dead and the not-so-long-dead.",

        "It's spectacular.",
        "You talk about a moment I want to go right to.",
        "When you were 16 years old, living in Los Angeles already, trying to figure out who you were as an American kid, your dad - who had divorced your mother and had married his mistress - was living in Los Angeles.",
        "And he had - after trying to work a while as a musician - had reverted to, let's say, perhaps a stereotype and was working as an exorcist and performing seances, where the clients knew that he was a Gypsy, which probably added to the spice for them.",

        "She was haunted by memories of her husband.",
