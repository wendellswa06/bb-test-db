        "World War I was the dominant event of the 20th century.",
        "This is Richard Ned Lebow.",
        "His book \"\"Archduke Franz Ferdinand Lives!\"\" inspires us to tell this counterfactual, perhaps playful history of the last 100 years.",
        "Lebow is a professor of International Political Theory at King's College, London.",
        "It is his contention that if the archduke had lived, no war would have occurred.",
        "That's a view Christopher Clark shares.",
        "He's author of \"\"The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War.",
        "None of the European great powers was planning to launch a war of aggression on any of its neighbors.",
        "So to the extent that we can imagine a counterfactual history, it's not totally out of the ballpark to imagine a world in which the great powers of Europe didn't go to war in 1914.",
        "Absolutely and, strangely, when you look at what the men who made the decisions to 1914 - how they see the future - one thing that you can't help being struck by is how open the future seems to them.",
        "I mean it's only from our perspective, in retrospect when we look back, does that war appear to us inevitable because there is something about big events, which makes us believe in their unavoidability.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC, \"\"BLUE DANUBE\"\")",
        "The Austro-Hungarian Empire had two capitals: Budapest, and the more important one, Vienna.",
        "It was at the cutting edge of culture and science.",
        "Sigmund Freud was re-writing human psychology.",
        "Arnold Schoenberg was rearranging the musical scale.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "The Hapsburg family had ruled the empire for centuries with roots in the Holy Roman Empire.",
        "They were German-speaking Catholics ruling over a polyglot empire at the heart of Europe.",
        "Its leader in 1914 was Franz Josef, a man who had ruled the empire for 60 years.",
        "Margaret MacMillan, author of \"\"The War That Ended Peace,\"\" says that if there had been no war in 1914 the Austro-Hungarian Empire might have survived and evolved into a different sort of union."

        "They talked about a more voluntary association and they talked about a common market, or a free-trade area.",
        "Which would've made a lot of sense if that had continued because as soon as you got these different nations established in the wreckage of the First World War, you got tariff barriers going up.",
        "You've got trade wars.",
        "And they all suffered.",
        "So, our counterfactual world is starting to take shape.",

        "Maybe not the happiest country in Europe, but not a fratricidal one, either.",
        "We handed this hypothetical ball to historian Christopher Clark and he ran down the field with it.",
        "With no World War I, he figures Czarist Russia doesn't come completely undone.",
        "No World War I and Germany of the 1920s is not bled by the victorious and vindictive allies, the Nazis never come power.",
        "And Christopher Clark reasons the role of Germany and German would have been greater.",
        "Europe would have been a more German-speaking place that the cultural authority, the German universities which was quite extraordinary before 1914, might well have survived.",

        "Germany was the biggest land power in Europe.",
        "It had the biggest army.",

        "Tell me a little bit about the status of life for your family back in the old country.",

        "So when that was the case, you know, the heritage background kind of came in second, because the general public knew them as these talented performers first.",
        "So, in that sense, I think we were a bit unique in our situation, because there were others who were not able to get to that stage.",
        "And you had some money at the time, the family?",
        "We did, because - I mean, most of it was made through the performance and traveling.",

        "Well, this is kind of funny, because if you look at the Soviet Union historically, you will see that most famous Soviet writers from long ago, they had this really, really great relationship with the Roma culture.",
        "Many of them - you know, Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky - they mention Gypsies or Romanis in their writing, and it's most of the time very positive.",
        "But at the same time, it was almost kind of like an unspoken rule that Gypsies remain Gypsies.",

        "Because that, I think, shows a person as being irresponsible, first and foremost.",
