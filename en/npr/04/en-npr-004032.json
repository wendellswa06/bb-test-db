        "Sometimes, the conversation is over as soon as you say Gypsy.",

        "Do you think it's that they don't know what that means, or do you think they have a negative connotation?",
        "I think they're afraid.",
        "I think they do have a negative - many people do have a negative connotation, because those who know, they will continue and kind of ask questions, and, you know, they're not necessarily awed by the stereotype or anything.",
        "But they want to know more, because maybe they're heard a little bit.",
        "But the ones who have heard the negative, they just don't want to go any further because they're afraid of what you're going to do, as a Gypsy.",
        "So it's not just in the Soviet Union, former Soviet Union and in parts of Europe that the negative stereotype has a story to it.",
        "You're saying also here, in the United States, that people have their impressions of what a Gypsy's going to do.",

        "The incident we talked about earlier in the program, where your dad was performing this exorcism and you ran away - in part, you say, because what he was performing was not just an exorcism, but the role - the stereotypical role of the things Gypsies are said or imagined to do.",
        "And yet, at the same time, throughout the book, you refer repeatedly to a kind of a cult or spiritual or superstitious interaction between your family and a world beyond.",
        "So how - you know, is it pure stereotype?",
        "Or is there, in the Romani culture, some core of these kinds of beliefs and actions that really is part of being an American Gypsy?",

        "It may be in religious terms, or it may be in just the spiritual terms that are not attached to a specific deity.",
        "But I think it's a common feature in most cultures.",

        "You know because learning so much about the American history, I've come to this, to the conclusion - and it was kind of a discovery that just kind of wowed me - is that the Americans, you know, the early Americans, the originals, were really like the American Gypsies.",
        "We kind of all are.",
        "If you look at the word Gypsy in terms of not labeling a specific culture, but in terms of what it means socially, maybe, you know, what you know about the stereotype of a Gypsy as being that free-spirited individual who doesn't necessarily agree with what they're being taught, and are out there finding their own way.",
        "And, like I said, reading about American history, I found that this is what the country was built on, these people who left everything behind to find their own truth.",
