        "It tells us that she has a problem with African-American voters, because she only got about 20 percent of that vote.",
        "But at the same time, Barack Obama, while he was essentially the loser on the day, got as many and perhaps one more delegate out of the state than she did.",
        "It was a closer contest than it may have appeared initially.",
        "There is another Democratic debate in South Carolina tonight, Ron, and I expect Senator Obama may be speaking sharply as he has been over the last 24 hours about Senator Clinton, and especially about her husband.",
        "Yes, Bill Clinton has become the designated attacker for the Clinton camp.",
        "He's good at the role, and of course in this particular case if there's blowback, it comes to him more than to his wife, the candidate.",
        "So that works even better for him.",
        "You know, this debate that was on Martin Luther King Day, and I think an awful lot of the questions are going to reflect that, it's co-sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus, and that's going to put a certain amount of pressure on Barack Obama.",
        "Barack Obama is currently leading overwhelmingly among African-Americans in South Carolina, and they are half the voting base there.",
        "But at the same time Barack Obama does not want to become exclusively the black candidate.",
        "He doesn't want to be like Jesse Jackson in the 1980s, great to win in southern primaries, not so great in the rest of the country; not necessarily the way to win in the fall.",

        "He decided not to compete up north; just go for the former New Yorkers and all the other Floridians he might very well be able to nail down while the other candidates were absent.",
        "Now everybody else is coming down to join him, John McCain with his South Carolina momentum, Mitt Romney with his Nevada and Michigan momentum, and still Mike Huckabee, who's been running a strong candidacy even though he hasn't been winning since Iowa.",
        "He's got a big natural appeal to evangelicals in Florida; he's going to pull a lot of those votes, as he did in South Carolina.",
        "So he's right in the hunt.",
        "And you've still got the question marks over Fred Thompson.",
        "Does he compete at all or does he drop out this week?",
        "And Ron Paul, who is still a real candidate to five to 10 percent of the Republicans and in Florida, that could keep anybody from looking too terribly impressive.",
        "Ron, let me tell something.",
        "Earlier today I went and back through conversations that we've had with you in the past looking for a little clip of tape in which you said after Super Tuesday it's all over, but in fact you said back in November, maybe Super Tuesday is not going to solve things and maybe things will go on.",
        "I was surprised that you are right back then and you look more right now.",
        "I mean, this contest - boy, it's - I thought things were going to be over in two weeks.",
