        "So they're still aiming to try to have something next week.",
        "But there are a few things on the table.",
        "Which is a reminder that however uncomfortable lawmakers may be with the president's Twitter account, they're still with him on some major issues of substance and pleased if he will sign a piece of legislation like the health care bill, assuming that Republicans can ever agree on what they think that ought to be."
