        "There were the comments by her national co-chair Billy Shaheen about Obama's teenage drug use that she had to personally repudiate then there was the attack on Obama's kindergarten essay about wanting to be president that her campaign admits now was a dumb move, and the polls weren't looking great either.",
        "Her lead in Iowa evaporated and Obama is now ahead there by a few points in the average of polls.",

        "But one thing the Clintons know how to do is take every bit of good news and leverage it, so the Des Moines Register endorsement is already on the air - in radio and television campaign ads - whether it will make the difference for her in Iowa is unclear.",

        "And it is ironic because, as you point out, in Iowa, John McCain has practically disappeared.",
        "He's barely campaigning there.",
        "He skipped Iowa all together four years ago.",
        "But his campaign says what they're hoping for in Iowa is to at least place in the top four, and this endorsement might help him.",
        "I should point out that this wasn't the first endorsement McCain got.",
        "The Union Leader, which was the very conservative New Hampshire paper, several weeks ago endorsed him, and that's probably even more important because the Union Leader is an opinion maker among conservatives and Republicans of New Hampshire where the Des Moines Register doesn't really play that kind of role among Republicans in Iowa.",
        "McCain, as you said, also got the Boston Globe endorsement.",
        "The Globe has a very big New Hampshire market.",

        "And tellingly, that endorsement came in New Hampshire, a state John McCain won in 2000.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's obviously the place where - Lieberman might be able to do him some good.",
        "Lieberman was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2000, and now he's an independent.",
        "He's broken with his old party on many, many issues, most prominently the Iraq War where he has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with McCain.",
        "So his endorsement might help McCain win back some of those crucial independent voters in New Hampshire that made up such a big part of McCain's win there in the 2000 Republican primary.",
        "And interestingly enough, Lieberman said today he originally had planned to wait to endorse someone after the primaries, but his old friend John McCain asked him for his support, and even more telling, no Democratic candidate asked Lieberman for his endorsement."
