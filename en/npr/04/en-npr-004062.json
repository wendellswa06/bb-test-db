        "I've met up with Hibbeln at a local grocery store where he leads me directly to the fish counter.",
        "I see big variety of fish.",
        "I see salmon and halibut.",
        "It's beautiful and fresh, and I'm getting hungry looking at it.",
        "All of these fish, he explains, are chock-full of omega-3 fatty acids.",
        "Now, a lot of people know of the omega-3 connection to heart health, but Hibbeln has spent 20 years investigating links with emotional health.",
        "One of the most basic ways of omega-3's help to regulate mood is quieting down your response to inflammation.",
        "He says when you get walloped by something, whether it's a virus or an emotional stressor, you want to bounce back as quickly as possible.",
        "You can either be good at weathering a lot of stresses or you can be brittle, and omega-3 fatty acids make your stress system more flexible.",
        "Both by helping cells in the brain communicate better and, he believes, by protecting neurons against the damage that can be done by high levels of stress hormones over a long period of time.",
        "And this, he believes, leads to more emotional resiliency.",
        "When you do look at people who eat more fish, they have less depression.",
        "They have less aggression.",
        "Now, not all studies have shown this convincingly, but Hibbeln points to a growing body of evidence.",
        "For instance, a study of schoolchildren in England, linking omega-3's to improved behaviors - more pro-social behaviors - and several clinical trials that have found omega-3's may help control depressive symptoms and promote feelings of well-being.",
        "When I started eating fish more myself - when I really started eating it regularly, it was an aha moment."

        "That's right.",
        "...One recent people don't eat more fish is the cost.",
        "So what alternatives?",
        "Well, the most affordable options that come to mind would be canned tuna and sardines.",
        "These are a fraction of the cost of fresh fish, but still good sources of omega-3's.",
        "And there are also plant-based sources of omega-3, such as flaxseed and chia seeds.",
        "One of the easiest ways to get flaxseed into your diet would be to buy a bag of milled or ground flaxseed at the store, sprinkle it on yogurt, put it in your cereal, and, similarly with Chia - there are lots of Chia seed powders.",
        "So you can add them to shakes and smoothies.",
        "So those are some good options.",

        "Yeah, so, you know, we've talked about omega-3's, but there are a host of other foods and nutrients that are thought to play some role in helping to regulate our moods.",
        "So what I have here in front of me is a plate of scrambled eggs that I made at home before coming in.",

        "OK.",
        "Tell us a little more specifically, what is there on the plate that might be helpful.",
        "So the eggs are a good source of protein, which, as we've just heard, can be satiating and tend to stave off hunger longer than if we were to just eat, you know, say a bagel.",
        "And eggs, along with other protein-rich foods such as beans, meat and some grains, provide many of the essential amino acids that our brains and bodies need to - to function well.",
        "Buried under my eggs, here, are these - these greens.",
        "I've got Swiss chard - I think Drew prefers Kale - and these are just chock-full of lots of vitamins and nutrients - so everything from vitamin A to vitamin K to potassium - so incredibly nutrient-dense, and that supports good brain function.",
        "So I think the bottom line here is that, you know, no food that you're going to eat is going to take away your stress, but if you eat meals like this that are nutrient-dense, have good amounts of protein and healthy fats, this can affect how the stress gets to us.",
