        "Ohio voters also reelected Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown.",
        "His was one of many Democratic seats the Republicans once hoped to capture as they drove to win a Senate majority.",
        "They were favored at the start, but fell short, as NPR's David Welna reports.",
        "The headline may be that Democrats remain in charge of the Senate, but the story of this year's Senate races is largely about women.",
        "A record 18 of them contested Senate seats, and in three states - Hawaii, California and New York - the Democrats and Republicans on the ballots were all women.",
        "Democrats won all three.",
        "It was also a night of firsts for women, nowhere more so than in Wisconsin, where Democratic Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin defeated former Republican Governor Tommy Thompson.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF SPEECH)",
        "Americans spend millions on beauty products, trendy clothes and plastic surgery.",
        "Is America obsessed with beauty?",
        "That's a question filmmaker Darryl Roberts explored in his new documentary, \"\"America, the Beautiful.\"\" Model and actress Gerren Taylor was at the heart of the film.",
        "Now 18, she was only 12 when she started walking the runway.",
        "Gerren and Darryl joined me to talk about the documentary.",
        "I asked - I started by asking Darryl about America's obsession with beauty and the power of advertising.",
        "Whether it's an Apple computer, whether it's Sketchers with shoes, a lot of industries use sex and beauty to sell their products.",
        "So, when we talk about beauty and advertising we're not just talking about the beauty industry, we're talking about a plethora of industries that, you know, use sex and beauty to sell.",
        "What was it that made you want to pursue this film?",
        "Basically, I was on a computer one day and read a story about a guy who had murdered a model, and he said that she was really beautiful, he wanted to date her, and she wouldn't date him.",
        "And he said if he couldn't have her nobody could.",
        "So I was sitting there thinking how stupid because he went to jail to throw your life away over some beautiful woman.",
        "And when I set that, the first thing that popped into my mind was have I ever done anything really stupid over a beautiful woman?",
        "Those are a series of questions like that that made me say, well, this would make a great documentary, to see why we're so obsessed with beauty in the first place.",
        "There is the term glamour - actually has associations with magic.",
        "It's one of those words that comes, Gerren, from the idea that beauty can be a kind of magic.",
        "Do you feel that way?",
        "People act crazy when they see something in their eyes that's beautiful.",
        "They'll go out their way or do anything for that person."

        "(Soundbite of movie \"\"America, the Beautiful\"\")",
        "Oh, I just think I'm ugly.",

        "I don't have a certain reason.",
        "I just think it.",
        "No one's ever told me, but I'm sure a lot of people think I'm ugly...",
        "She was 12 at that time, do you think she still feels that way today?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Actually, I interviewed her when she was 15, three years after the clip that you saw.",
        "And then she still insist that she was ugly with no concrete proof which is evidence of how this - I call it toxic beauty culture in our society - are pushing these images on the young girls and telling them if you don't look like this you're ugly.",
        "Gerren, let's talk about your personal story which in some ways is the flip side of Ashley's dilemma.",
        "At 12, you were discovered on a street in Los Angeles.",
        "The next thing you know you were on the runway and then a guest on \"\"The Oprah Show.\"\" How would you characterize - what kind of person were you before you were discovered?",
        "I believe I've been the same person.",
        "I've had my roller coaster throughout my career but very bubbly, outgoing, just happy.",
        "When I was discovered I didn't really change my persona.",
        "I was kind of on top of the world.",
        "I never knew the world was so big and then when - and my career went in just kind of stopped, that's when I developed the eating disorder and just my life kind of crumbled.",

        "How did it feel to one day be Giraffe and the next day be completely valued and validated for the same looks that you'd had the day before?",

        "So when it did finally happen, I was just happy like granny was right.",
        "Darryl, what do you think of the way that Gerren appeared on the runway.",
        "The way that she ended up being made up and what you have to do to essentially a pre-teen in order to make them look like a vixen?",
        "I was under the impression because when I saw her I knew that she was twelve.",
        "So the first thing I thought was wow, the fashion industry is sexualizing a child.",
        "That was my opinion and then our culture is becoming very youth-oriented.",
