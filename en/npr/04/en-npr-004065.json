        "They're scared to draw down their excess saving.",
        "And the reason they're scared is because there's been a lot of turnover in the Chinese labor market due to the reform of once state-owned enterprises.",
        "And they've done these reforms without really giving workers the safety net that they used to have under the old state-owned regime.",
        "So they need to build a safety net."
