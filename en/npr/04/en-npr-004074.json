        "What are they actually grooming off?",

        "So they did a couple of things that are - it's so funny.",
        "So first of all, to test why a cockroach grooms, you have to prevent the cockroach from grooming, which presents an interesting challenge: How do you get the cockroach to cooperate with you?",
        "And they came up with something sort of like one of those dog cones that prevents dogs from scratching.",
        "But it's a teeny, tiny antenna cone made from the tip of a pipette that they put on the base of the antenna.",
        "So the cockroach can't actually pull it down.",
        "So on a cockroach now, they have one antenna that's being groomed and they have this other antenna that the cockroach can't groom anymore.",
        "So they can see what happens to the dirty antenna, and they find that all of this gunk starts to accumulate on the antenna.",

        "And they're sort of like a wax that the cockroach secretes to prevent itself from drying out.",
        "So that's good.",
        "But too much of it and it clogs the pores that are on the hairs that are on the antenna.",
        "And this actually is bad because they use these pores to smell.",
        "They have to smell.",
        "So complicated but amazing."
