        "Ninety percent of the structures have been damaged and whole communities are obliterated by storm surges with giant waves as high as seven meters.",
        "How would you describe the immediate plans of World Vision?",
        "That is, what is it that you're trying to accomplish right now and what are the challenges you face?",
        "Yes.",
        "World Vision has launched a massive relief effort.",
        "Right now we already have 5,000 blankets and 3,000 plastic sheets ready to be delivered in the hardest-hit areas for the needs of the families.",
        "We will also be providing much needed food, water, hygiene kits.",
        "So right now, the most pressing challenge for us is really established clear and safe access to roads that would bring truckloads of supplies to those who are most in need.",
        "And are the roads, in fact, intact?",
        "Were bridges away?",
        "Are you able to actually move these relief supplies to people?",
        "Yes.",
        "Right now, it's really very difficult to find a safe route because most of the roads are still damaged and some of the roads are still impassable because they still have floodwaters.",
        "So government is really working hard with road-clearing operations and at the same time, they're also still looking for those who are still missing.",
        "Mr.",
        "Aspi, I wonder if you can tell us, when we hear of winds of about 150 miles per hours and that over 90 percent of structures have been damaged by them, typically, what is a house - what does a family typically live in?",
        "What sort of structure in this part of the Philippines, and how much of a chance do structures of that kind have of surviving such heavy winds?",
        "Yes.",
        "Most of the houses in the rural areas are made from local materials, but can easily be blown away by strong winds and fierce rains.",
        "But even the most sturdy structures in the cities and urban communities really didn't have a chance."

        "But the structure of failure in the United States intelligence community before 9/11 was not fundamentally the responsibility of the director of CIA; it was a government-wide problem.",
        "And so in that sense I think the inspector general's perspective is narrow, but it has to be put into context.",
        "It's coming form inside the CIA.",
        "It's sort of an internal conversation rather than a government-wide critique, in my judgment.",
        "Well, practically, a lot of people have called for some kind of discipline and some kind of accountability, and yet both General Michael Hayden, the current CIA director, and the previous director, Porter Goss, both refused to do that, to discipline anyone, including George Tenet.",
        "This report does call for some disciplinary action.",
        "Yes, limited though in its findings.",
        "I mean, in this case the inspector general, though severe in his criticisms of Tenet and his leadership group, does not suggest that their failures crossed the more egregious lines of criminal or negligent performance that would absolutely demand disciplinary action.",
        "Instead, their findings fall into the category of the discretion of the leadership of the CIA to issue reprimands or to sort of clarify the record and make a note on the record that this failure of leadership was important enough to generate notice.",
        "And so then that falls to Tenet's successors, and neither of them have chosen to do this.",
        "I think in part they're speaking to the whole community that they now lead in saying we're not going to second guess you, we're going to always give you the benefit of the doubt as long as you perform honestly, don't commit crimes or fail in grossly negligent way."

        "Well, the people inside the community that you come across and ask that question give a very mixed report.",
        "Certainly inter-agency communication is better than it was, but it's certainly not perfect.",
        "And a lot of the culture of bureaucracy that leads people even against common sense, to hoard information or to jealously guard their prerogatives in the system, that clearly persists, even though the structure is better and a lot of the systems are better.",
        "And as to the broader ability to effectively allocate resources quickly to address emerging threats, we still operate a very large and unwieldy bureaucracy.",
