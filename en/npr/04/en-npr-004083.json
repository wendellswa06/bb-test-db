        "Well, in the days before this incident, most of the world was focusing on North Korea's uranium facilities and the North Koreans were complaining about South Korea's so-called Hokog(ph) military exercises, and North Korea was threatening to retaliate if those exercises went ahead as planned.",
        "But that is pretty much par for the course here.",
        "The North Koreans always complain about South Korean military exercises.",

        "Well, you know, the North Korean regime has been making threatening noises towards this administration, this conservative administration of President Lee Myung-bak ever since he took office in 2008, and you know, we saw a rise in tension last year.",

        "Well, now, how is South Korea responding then to this North Korean attack?",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "If I can compare it to the American response to 9/11, when everybody was clustered around their TV sets, when all of life came to a halt, it's actually quite different from that.",

        "So far it was two sailors.",
        "Now, 46 sailors were killed last March, so in military terms it doesn't look quite as bad.",
        "But if we find out that, as is feared, civilians lost their lives on that island, then I think the public opinion could change here very quickly.",
        "Is there any concern about firing or possible, possible military action across the demilitarized zone on basically the mainland of the peninsula, which would perhaps be even more serious step?",
        "Yeah.",

        "That is, of course, always the concern here.",
        "In the United States we tend to be more concerned about North Korea's nuclear capability, but North Korea has more than enough in terms of conventional missiles with which to completely flatten Seoul.",
        "So that is, of course, a concern.",
        "People want to make sure that this does not escalate beyond that island - beyond that part of the world.",

        "Did this turn into a political stop for Mitt Romney as he was there?",
        "Well, it was not overtly political in the sense that he didn't talk about President Obama's economy and he didn't talk about his five-point plan for creating jobs.",
        "But it was political in the sense that the Romney campaign wants to show that Mitt Romney can look presidential and it is a long tradition of presidents to go the scene of a natural disaster, console people who have suffered, meet with first responders and reassure them that things will get better.",
        "And that's exactly what he's doing.",
        "You know, the Romney campaign believes firmly that voters have made up their mind about President Obama and are not satisfied with him, but they're just not sure yet whether they can see Mitt Romney as a president.",

        "The opening reel, with its swooping camera and faded photographs leaping to life as the notes on Percival's music stand jump off the page to dance, is a real tour de force.",
        "Later, the plot kicks in, and you sense that making some spectacular videos for OutKast may not have fully prepared the director for his big screen debut.",
        "Still, he's perfectly capable of goosing the plot to life with a musical interlude - say, a car chase that turns into a gunfight as Rooster and his digitally animated hip flask rap to each other about repenting.",

        "You won't mistake either of them for actors, exactly, but they're fine surrounded by Hollywood veterans like Terrence Howard and Ben Vereen.",
        "Likewise, you won't mistake the director's work in Idlewild for that of the Busby Berkeleys of Hollywood's golden age.",

        "This showbiz musical stuff has been baffling smart directors for a couple of decades now.",
        "With its scrambling of styles and its sometimes underwhelming songs, Idlewild's a bit of a mess, but Barber's music video notions feel like the kind of kick that the form has been needing."
