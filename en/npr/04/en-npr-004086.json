        "King has moved a lot of books pimping on the alleged down-low phenomenon, of straight-acting men sleeping with other men in secret, as if it's the Black Plague or sickle-cell, some unstoppable pandemic decimating African-American nightclubs, poetry readings and barbecues from coast to coast.",
        "But I'm not convinced that the increase of AIDS cases among black women reflects an increase in homosexual activity among black men as much as it suggests an increase in irresponsible sexual behavior among black women--like black women going on vacation and picking up Jamaican cabana boys, for instance.",

        "But this has been the traditional one, and it's the one that many ways is an example to the rest of the world of how even if we have real disagreements, we still come together; we listen to the president's message, and then lawmakers have the opportunity to express their approval or disapproval but not by throwing things at one another but by simply expressing in that chamber their thoughts about what the president is saying.",

        "What we really thought we were trying to do on this was to provide at least an avenue in which those individuals knew that there was a continuation of being able to seek asylum.",

        "Fourth quarter growth will be zero or even slightly negative, and if we had much longer, that kind of weakness, it would qualify as a recession.",
        "And Nancy, what about other countries?",
        "Are they doing the same thing - injecting money into the economy?",
        "Yeah.",
        "As a matter of fact, the European Central Bank announced on Friday that it's ready to provide funding to banks over the year's-end, and the Bank of Canada injected $3 billion in short-term funds into the Canadian banking system just last week."
