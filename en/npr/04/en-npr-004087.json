        "There's a bunch of ways we found this catalyst works and one way is exactly what you just said, just take the solar panel, put it up on your roof�",
        "Right.",
        "�and then, solar panels put out electricity, which you could use when the sun is shining.",
        "And if you wanted to, you could take some of that electricity, feed it to this catalyst, which then when it gets electrified from the photovoltaic, it splits water to hydrogen and oxygen.",
        "Another way you could do it is this catalyst forms directly on the PV material, which is a semiconductor.",
        "And so, then you can just shine light right on the semi conductor, never really get the light to electricity directly, just use the energy of that supercharged photovoltaic to split water to hydrogen and oxygen, because the catalyst is coated on the semiconductor so it can basically take the energy from the photovoltaic directly.",
        "Wow.",
        "And so, how close are you to making these kinds of devices?",
        "We're really close.",
        "As a matter of fact, for the first one, where you would feed it electricity from a photovoltaic, we've been able to build - we've actually have built this out of polyvinyl chloride, PVC piping.",

        "Because we're in water, we've been able to invent another catalyst that makes the hydrogen.",
        "So, this is important.",
        "Usually when you split water, the first thing you make is oxygen, and then you leave protons behind, which later are combined to make the hydrogen.",
        "And the catalyst we invented splits the water, does the hard heavy lifting to make the oxygen.",
        "The hydrogen then is made now, not - it also - usually people use platinum.",
