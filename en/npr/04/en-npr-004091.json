        "You should know that people have been - you can buy commercial electrolyzers.",
        "And they work really well, but they're super-expensive.",
        "And an electrolyzer splits water.",
        "And they're expensive because you start making the acid, so you have to run the electrolyzer in very concentrated base, like lye.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that keeps the acidity down.",
        "But then it brings a whole bunch of extra cost to the system, and it makes it expensive.",
        "And our catalyst - the one special thing we did is that when you do build up the acid, it actually can start eating the catalyst a little bit.",
        "But as it does, we put in - and this is the first time a scientist has ever been able to do this - is my students were able to figure out how to make it self-heal itself.",
        "Huh.",
        "So after the protons and the acid starts getting to the catalyst, the catalyst actually rejuvenates and fixes itself.",

        "You could do that.",
        "There - so you could use the electricity from the fuel cell and charge the battery.",
        "The other interesting thing, this is a little further up, but you know, I'm in academics, so we can always - we aren't so tied by a product next year, even though now I am, as I try to develop the technology - but one of the things that keeps fuel cell - fuel cell cars are really wonderful machines.",
        "If you see the Mercedes F series, Toyota, Honda, they use hydrogen and then there's a fuel cell car - a fuel cell in the car.",

        "No, this - that's what's hurt the fuel cell industry, is you have to distribute hydrogen.",
        "And it's hard to think about how will you have hydrogen gas stations - all of a sudden your house just became a gas station too.",
        "Wow.",
        "Quite fascinating.",
