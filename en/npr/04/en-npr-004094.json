        "Exactly, yeah.",

        "We're not looking at that.",
        "This is sort of a background mortality rate.",
        "This is not a sort of a big outbreak situation.",
        "What we think is that this trend towards increasing mortality rate might be a symptom of forests that are vulnerable to sudden extents of die back, like we've seen in those areas.",
        "Does that mean these forests are turning into deserts eventually?",
        "I wouldn't go that far.",
        "I think that would be a little extreme.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But again, I think this might be sort of a harbinger of things to come.",
        "It would be bad economic policy to try to cut the deficit tremendously in the short run.",
        "This is an economy where the unemployment rate is still 9.6 percent.",
        "An immediate deficit reduction would be very, very hard for the economy to grow through.",
        "Now, I absolutely, like almost any mainstream economist, think the long-run deficit is a terrible problem.",
        "I'd be wildly in favor of passing a plan right now for dealing with that long-run deficit.",
        "But a good plan would almost surely have some fiscal expansion in the short run and then do the fiscal contraction when the economy is healthier.",
        "So let's put this in simple terms.",
        "I mean, you were vocal about your support for additional stimulus.",
        "You're saying there has to be some further stimulus.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think you can't look at where the economy is today and say that we're where we want to be.",
        "It is - we are still in an economic crisis.",
        "And, you know, even if all you care about is the budget deficit, taking actions now to get the unemployment rate down is good policy, because the thing I worry about is the longer this unemployment rate stays high, the bigger chance there is that some of it becomes permanent, and that's obviously a disaster for people, but it's a disaster for the long-run budget deficit."

        "You have studied the year 1937.",

        "And you've warned against a repeat of what happened then when President Roosevelt's recovery program basically went back into recession.",
        "That was a year when he raised taxes, when the Fed tightened monetary policy.",
        "Wouldn't President Obama risk making some of the same mistakes by insisting on any tax increases at all at this point?",
        "It's incredible important to draw a distinction between not raising anybody's taxes and not raising net taxes.",
        "Not every tax cut is equally effective, and the economic research is incredibly clear that tax cuts for very high-income earners have about the least fiscal stimulus of tax cut possible.",
        "So if you say I want to cut taxes by $50 billion, I'd say don't do it for the very high-income earners, but do it in the form of a payroll tax holiday, or continue the Making Work Pay tax cut that we had in the Recovery Act for another year and give that money to middle-class families.",
        "They're the ones that are likely to spend it.",
        "This idea that somehow you can't raise any tax anywhere because we're in a recession, that's just bad policy.",
        "Christina Romer, you support more stimulus and a tax increase on the wealthiest Americans.",
        "Other economists would say, you know, let's focus on deficits and not raise taxes and not spend more.",
        "What makes your case more compelling?",
        "I mean, why do you think what you believe in and what other economists who agree with you believe in will necessary work?",
        "I mean, you don't let's face it, I mean, you don't necessarily have facts on your side.",
        "The other side doesn't have facts on its side.",
        "We don't know the results of it, right?",
        "We just think we know what might happen.",
        "Well, I'm going to disagree that we don't have facts on our side because I think exactly what makes me very confident in the policy that I'm suggesting is the empirical evidence.",
        "So, for example, I'll cite, I think, a very important new study that came out of the International Monetary Fund that looked at fiscal consolidations, times when countries tried to get their budget deficit down in 15 countries over the last 25 years.",
        "And the conclusion of that is it hurts growth.",
        "So this idea that getting your deficit down will somehow magically be good for growth, it will be painless, I think the empirical evidence is very strong that in the short run, that is something that will be painful.",
        "And I think that fact is what lies behind saying, of course, you legislate the deficit reduction, it's good policy even from a credibility, a confidence kind of perspective to get that plan in place, but don't be under the illusion that if you were able to cut the deficit a lot in 2011, that would somehow be good for the unemployment rate because it absolutely would not, and I think the evidence is very strong for that position.",
        "That's Christina Romer.",
        "She's the former chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.",
        "She's now back at U.C.",
        "Berkeley, where she teaches economics.",

        "And there was so much concern that when Monday morning arrived, that they might not be able to borrow, that the government felt it had to do something in order to shore up confidence in them and let people keep buying.",
        "Well, now, is this really just about confidence or is there a fundamental problem with these companies that would take lots and lots of money to fix?",
        "So the fundamental problem is that they have these big losses and people don't know exactly how big they are but there's a concern that they are so big that with any honest accounting they would wipe out their capital.",
        "Five trillion dollars?",
        "Could we have something that if it's as bad as some people fear, even the federal government would have trouble coming up with the money to fix it?",
        "No. It's not - they're not - the only issue here is the amount of money they lose on those mortgages."
