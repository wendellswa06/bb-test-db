        "Right.",
        "If the climate changes in one place, might we see the trees migrate, so to speak, to a better climate for them?",
        "That's what people are predicting with some of these big vegetation models.",
        "And maybe this is sort of the start of that.",
        "It could be.",
        "That's pure speculation, though.",
        "Yeah.",
        "What about the animals that live in the forests where these trees are?",
        "Are they affected also?",
        "Well, again, if current trends continue, it does have the potential of changing what we call forest structure, the sort of - the size and the arrangement of stems in a forest.",
        "And certain species are dependent on the sort of old growth forest characteristics, and if we start essentially having younger trees, which is what we'd expect with an increasing mortality rate, they might not have the sort of habitat that they need.",
        "What about the effects of air pollution?",
        "Have you ruled out that air pollution might be killing the trees?",
        "We've looked at that, and air pollution is a big problem in some parts of the West, especially ozone is the big major pollutant that could affect forest health.",
        "That said, especially in the southern Sierra Nevada, where we had a pretty good coverage of data, the ozone didn't get any worse over the study period.",
        "It's not good, but it's not getting worse.",
        "So, that really couldn't explain that upward tick in mortality.",
        "If you look at the Pacific Northwest, where they have much cleaner air, we're also seeing that increasing trend in mortality.",
        "So, air pollution doesn't really seem like it fits the story.",
        "You know, when - I think of the trees as I do the oceans sometimes - the forests - is that when something gets going, it gets going, you know?",
        "It gets set in a direction.",
        "I don't imagine, besides just turning back global warming, that there's anything to do save these forests.",
        "Well, there are things we could do.",
        "You know, climate change has been getting a lot of press lately.",
        "But that's not the only story out there.",
        "There's a lot of other stressors that are affecting these forests - things like exotic pathogens, altered disturbance regimes - fire suppression, essentially.",
        "And those are something we have control over as land managers or as a - and so, if we can reduce those threats that are out there, it could allow our forests to adapt any sort of climate change that we are seeing.",
        "So, how could we do that?",
        "Sort of - it's sort of controlling exactly how we think of these forests.",
        "I think that's sort of the big thing.",
        "In the past, we've always had this model of 1850, this time period prior to Euro-American settlement, and if we could restore forests to that, then everything would be great.",
        "I think we're sort of starting to get away from that now.",
        "If we see sort of these landscapes as much more dynamic and if we can come up with ways to allow them to change, then I think we might be much be better off.",
        "Exactly how we do that, that's an open question right now.",
        "People are discussing that, and I don't think anybody has any good answers right now."

        "The Treasury and the Federal Reserve will lend them money short term if they have problems in the short term; and in an extraordinary move, the Bush administration has gone to Congress and said we want the right to buy stock in these companies, to take taxpayer money and buy a piece of these companies to shore up their capital cushion just in case."

        "Is the taxpayer taking on a lot more risk by making these commitments you just described if in fact they happen; if they're approved by Congress?",
        "Yes, although a lot of people would say that it was always clear that in a pinch the government would have to step in on the taxpayers' behalf to save these companies.",
        "They have never been fully independent.",
        "They're this strange hybrid: they're owned by shareholders but they borrow money, and the people who lend them the money, including the Chinese government for one, always have assumed that if they got into trouble the taxpayers would stand behind that credit.",
        "Well, now that it appears that taxpayers are stepping forward or being asked to step forward and stand behind that credit even more, is it possible that the government won't have to pay anything, that people will feel confident and things will return to normal?",
