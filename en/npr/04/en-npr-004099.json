        "Hey, Joe.",
        "So we only have a minute or so before we have to go to a break, Sean, but let's start with you, and tell us just a little bit about what Proposal 2 is supposed to do?",
        "Proposal 2 would loosen Michigan's restriction on embryonic-stem-cell research by bringing Michigan law in line with federal law.",
        "Currently in Michigan, it's illegal to destroy a human embryo for research, which may sound like a good idea to people, but the reason why almost nobody outside of Michigan has laws like that, is that doesn't make sense.",
        "Because the embryos that would be used for this research are already being thrown away by fertility clinics.",
        "There are thousands of embryos that are routinely discarded by fertility clinics across the country, and for a variety of reasons those embryos could never be used for fertility treatment, but they could be used for stem-cell research that patients across the country consider their best hope.",
        "Right.",
        "And the ideas you use these discarded or embryos that are no longer needed for fertility treatments, to extract the embryonic stem cells that scientists like you want to study?",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "So Proposal 2 would actually entrench in the Michigan constitution a number of restrictions on stem-cell research, like you couldn't buy or sell embryos, the embryos would have to have been created for fertility treatment.",
        "But either surplus to the clinical need or unsuitable for clinical use, such that the embryos would otherwise be discarded, if not donated with informed consent for research.",
        "I got it.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, as I said, we have to take a short break, but when we come back, we'll talk about the situation in Michigan and the situation with the rest of the country with regard to stem-cell research.",
        "Please stay with us.",
        "This is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "From NPR News this is Talk of the Nation: Science Friday.",
        "I'm Joe Palca.",
        "We're talking this hour about embryonic-stem-cell research and the elections.",
        "My guests are Julie Rovner, she's a health correspondent for National Public Radio, and Sean Morrison, he's a stem-cell researcher at the University of Michigan."

        "And Sean Morrison was just explaining that Proposition 2 would relax some of the restrictions currently on the books in Michigan about destroying an embryo, because that's what you have to do to obtain embryonic stem cells, and of course many embryos - human embryos are destroyed anyway in fertility clinics when the couples who've created them for fertility purposes don't want them anymore.",
        "So, that's the nut of the decision, but - before I start with - before we get on the national scene, I want to stay with you, Sean Morrison, for one second and say, you can still do embryonic-stem-cell research in Michigan, right?",
        "That's right.",
        "We can import lines that are created in other parts of the country or other parts of the world, and we do research on those lines.",
        "But the difficulty is that for many of the lines that scientists would like to be able to use to study various diseases right now, many of the lines don't exist.",
        "And often times even when lines do exist in another part of the world, and the people that made the lines are willing to share them, it's still often impossible to get the lines, because this research is obviously and appropriately very highly regulated.",
        "There's probably no form of medical research that is as highly regulated, and to do any kind of embryonic-stem-cell research, the providence of the lines has to be proven that the lines were ethically conducted.",
        "And unless you can affirmatively prove that lines created in another part of the world were obtained with appropriate informed consent and ethically derived, then nobody in Michigan or in other U.S.",
        "universities wouldn't be able to study them.",
        "And that process is often very onerous to provide the paperwork, you know, the documentation from the laboratories that derive the lines in, many labs just aren't in a position to be able to share that level of paperwork with labs in other places.",
        "All right.",
        "I think, I may have misspoken at the top of the hour.",
        "This is a proposal to change the law, not a change in the law yet.",
        "Any sense of where the polls are saying whether this will pass or not?",
        "Well, all the polls have the yes side ahead, but different - some polls put it extraordinarily close, some polls had the yes side leading by a little bit more.",
        "I think, all we know at this stage is that it will be close on Tuesday, and it could go either way.",
        "OK.",
        "Now let's turn to the national story and where - and Julie Rovner, where this comes in to a national issue is even if Michigan changes its law, you still wouldn't be able to get federal funds to make the embryonic-stem-cell lines.",
        "But an interesting thing is I don't believe either presidential candidate is suggesting that federal funds be used to derive embryonic stem cells which - and this is a fine point - they're both suggesting it might be OK to use federal funds to do research on cells that somebody else derived.",
        "That's right, and you know, it's interesting given the fact that both candidates have ostensibly the same position on embryonic-stem-cell research.",
        "We've certainly seen a lot of debate on this issue since - really since the campaign - the general election campaign started in earnest around Labor Day.",
        "We've seen dueling ads if you will, we have - here's one ad that Senator McCain was running during the fall.",

        "He's been anti-abortion down the line, but embryonic-stem-cell research is the one place where he has broken with the anti-abortion community.",
        "He has voted in favor of a bill to relax President Bush's restrictions on funding of federal-embryonic-stem-cell research.",
        "However, the Republican platform is against embryonic-stem-cell research, so this ad which goes on about stem cell research, stem cell research, stem cell research didn't say what kind of stem cell research.",
        "So it could be adult-stem-cell research, which is not controversial, or stem-cell research using umbilical cord blood, also not controversial, it was very carefully tailored to not say embryonic-stem-cell research for which it was rather roundly criticized.",
        "Again, on Senator McCain's website there was a statement that talked about stem-cell research needs to go forward in an ethical manner.",
        "It was written in such a way that it really could describe what President Bush's position has been.",
        "So...",

        "In that they have protected not only the derivation of new-stem-cell lines, but also therapeutic cloning which is illegal in Michigan, and would remain illegal in Michigan if people vote for Proposal 2.",
        "Because the other important point here is that the reason why it's necessary in the State of Michigan to look for a constitutional amendment, rather than just to change in the law is that the same groups that are behind the no campaign on Proposal 2, opposed repeated attempts to change the law in the state legislature to bring Michigan law in line with the laws of other states.",
