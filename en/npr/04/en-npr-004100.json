        "Yes.",
        "I think in my looking over what the implications of that would be, which certainly seem to make embryonic-stem-cell research illegal, because it would seem to make in vitro fertilization illegal.",

        "Right.",
        "I - someone was spinning out.",
        "There seem to be some interesting legal issues that you could spin out from that, like can you sue an embryo in that case, or can an embryo bring a lawsuit?",
        "And what about the 400,000 embryos that are currently frozen down in fertility clinics across the country?",
        "You know, if we were to consider them all people, who's going to have to implant all those embryos?",

        "Eric, that's a great question.",

        "It's always hard to say where we would've been, because it's always risky to try to predict into the future and know exactly on how things could be different.",
        "But anytime you impose restrictions on a form of research that is internationally agreed upon to be one of the most promising areas of medical research, and you say to certain groups of scientist that they can't pursue certain promising avenues of discovery, then you slow down the process of medical research, and you slow the process towards new cures.",
        "And so it's really important at this stage that we have policies that reflect the reality in this science, and that allow scientists to go forward in the war against disease, using all the weapons at their disposal.",
        "We're talking with Sean Morrison, he's a researcher at the University of Michigan and Julie Rovner, who's my colleague on the science desk about the role of embryonic-stem-cell research, both in the national election and in the election that is going to take place in Michigan over - on a ballot proposal.",
        "I'm Joe Palca, and this is Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And let's take a - well, let me ask you Julie, have - or maybe Sean, both of you.",
        "This issue - this embryonic-stem-cell-research issue was pretty hot, I would say, about a year ago, and it seems to me that some of the air was taken - or wind was taken out of it sails when first the Japanese scientists and then scientists in this country showed that you could make embryonic stem cells without destroying an embryo.",
        "And a lot of scientists are very excited - not exactly embryonic stem cells, but stem cells that do all the things that embryonic stem cells do, without destroying an embryo.",
        "Julie, do you sense that that's changed the political landscape at all?",
        "I think it did for a while, the idea that you can have pluripotent stem cells that you don't necessarily have to destroy an embryo to take.",
        "And certainly John McCain has been talking about that.",
        "And you know, there's hopes that we won't need to worry about this, you know, morally questionable avenue of research perhaps after a few years.",
        "But I think, you know, there are concerns even though these candidates, as we say, ostensibly have the same position on embryonic-stem-cell research.",
        "There are concerns on among - certainly among Democrats about Senator McCain for instance.",
        "They say that Senator Obama has said that as soon - if he becomes President, as soon as he takes office, he will lift President Bush's executive order.",
        "That he would simply change the Federal Government's policy on restricting research, the day he becomes President, where Senator McCain might wait until Congress were to pass a bill.",
        "That would be a different - that Senator Obama would devote perhaps more money to research on not just embryonic-stem-cell research, but the type of - other types of research you're talking about where Senator McCain has talked about cutting the budget.",
        "So that there may be other differences beyond simply, you know, the position on this specific type of research.",
        "So Sean Morrison, let me ask you.",
        "Is it worth the political capital that you have to spend to convince people to support embryonic-stem-cell research when it's clearly somewhat controversial, and simply go ahead and study these new cells that seemed to be able to do all the same things?"

        "And so as of now, none of the reprogrammed lines that have been made could ever be used in patients.",
        "So what - the one thing that I think all stem-cell biologists agree on is the need for the research to go forward with all types of stem cells.",
        "So that no matter where the cures come from, we can get to them sooner, rather than later.",
        "So, just in closing here, Sean Morrison.",
        "I mean, you've been doing this for, well, for almost a decade now.",
        "How confident are you at this point that there really will be therapies to come out of this field?",
        "I'm confident that there will be therapies that will come.",

        "There are many different ways in which embryonic-stem-cell research and pluripotent-stem-cell research could lead to new treatments.",
        "Either new cell therapies for diseases like Parkinson's Disease or Juvenile Diabetes.",
        "Or a better understanding of inherited human diseases from studying embryonic-stem-cell lines that carry the exact genetic defects that cause disease in patients, or from improving the drug-discovery process by screening for safer and more effective new drugs on cells that derive from embryonic stem cells in laboratory dishes, and there's just..."
