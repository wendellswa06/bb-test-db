        "And what did you discover after you - you had volunteers take a nap in a rocking or a still bed, and you compared their brainwaves?",
        "Exactly.",
        "So what was expected, and what we wanted basically to quantify and give a real measurement of was that people go to fast - to sleep faster.",
        "That's more or less obvious.",
        "We have quantified that and were able to show it finally.",
        "But the absolute surprise for us is that the dream period of the nap, all the time of the nap, the brainwaves actually - so beyond the fact that you went to sleep faster, the brainwaves during that period of rocking were completely - not completely, were changed in a matter that was consistent with the notion that the sleep is actually deeper.",
        "So the brainwaves, the way they show you that it is deeper relates to particular waves that you can measure with EEG, electroencephalogram, and the result was consistent all throughout the period.",
        "It's not just at the beginning of the rocking, it's all through the period of the nap.",
        "Are you able to tell why the rocking creates these brainwaves?",
        "These brainwaves that you find are actually the natural brainwaves that occur during that period of sleep, whether it is in a nap or at a certain period during a night's sleep.",
        "So it's not just that it brings new waves.",
        "It just fortifies waves which are already there intrinsically, naturally.",
        "It just makes them - to make it simple, it makes them stronger, which explains why the rocking works because it makes you faster asleep, and then while you are rocked, actually the rocking maintains you in a deeper sleep.",
        "That was a surprise for us.",
        "That it maintains you in a deeper sleep.",
        "In a deeper sleep.",
        "It's not just you go faster to sleep, but also while you sleep, your sleep is deeper.",

        "There was nothing in the literature to tell us that this would be the case.",
        "So that would imply it's a more healthful - a healthier sleep, a deeper sleep?",
        "Not necessarily healthier, but deeper sleep usually means a better recovery, if you want.",
        "So it's just maybe that in a shorter period of time, you might get more restoring sleep, if you want.",

        "The one thing which is true is that the type of waves that you see, which are reinforced here, have also been associated with an increase in memory for recent events.",

        "So you remember more.",
        "You remember more, yes, exactly.",
        "So we did not do that, but I mean, people have shown that while you are sleeping, the particular waves that we have seen are related to the quality of your memory recovery, if you want.",
        "And so it means that if you have more of these particular brainwaves, you will remember better.",
        "So what we do is that, by the rocking, we might have something that gives you a more profound sleep, and in addition maybe some additional cognitive, better results.",
        "Now, you only rocked your test subjects for about an hour, right?",

        "The only thing I can tell is that the very few experiments on an entire night were done in the last few days, and those people that have been rocked in an entire night, at least qualitatively, say that it was very pleasant, so - and they slept well.",
        "But we don't have yet the EEG analysis and so on, and it would need a lot of people in order to be able to give real strong data.",
