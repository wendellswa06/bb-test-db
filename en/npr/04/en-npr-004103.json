        "Now GM's been losing market share for three decades, and it didn't reduce these divisions and models, kind of, at the pace at which it was losing market share.",
        "So it's been really bloated, this kind of confused consumers.",
        "It muddied the brand image.",
        "And there haven't really been enough marketing dollars to support all this product.",
        "So essentially, if you look at it, the government is kind of forcing GM to do through this bankruptcy what the executives over the years just weren't able to do on their own.",
        "Frank, I understand that the American taxpayers will spend a total of more than $50 billion to rescue this company.",
        "That's a lot.",
        "Let's say GM comes out leaner, fewer debts, fewer divisions like Saturn or Pontiac.",
        "Is this going to ensure that it survives?",
        "No, it's not.",
        "You know, there's this old expression with business: you can't cut your way to profitability.",
        "GM has to sell more cars, and that's not going to be easy.",
        "It has some good products.",
        "The Chevy Malibu sedan is - it's quite popular and quite good, I think people think, but it has to stabilize this market share.",
        "And what the company predicts is that it's going to get market share down to about 18.5 percent in several years, and that would be actual progress, would kind of stop the bleeding.",
        "So, Frank, as we know, the recession's really demolished car sales, and they're down 50 percent.",
        "Can GM market its way out of this?",
        "Are people going to start buying cars as they once did?",
        "No.",
        "A lot of this is going to come from consumer confidence, and it is getting a little bit better.",
        "What we've seen in the last month or two is car sales beginning to pick up in some places, but it's going to take a long time for it to build back up to anywhere near where it was, which was around, a few years ago, 16 million.",
        "So one of the things the company is going to have to do is also figure out what are the news cars people are going to want to buy.",
        "There's an expectation that oil prices, not that bad now, they're going to go up again.",
        "GM is going to have to get better at building smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.",
        "Like the Volt.",
        "The Volt.",
        "And this is going to be a really interesting thing to see next year.",
        "If all goes well at the end of 2010, they are going to introduce this electric car they've been touting for years, the Volt.",
        "It's going to cost a lot of money, GM's going to lose a lot of money on it, the batteries cost so much to build.",
        "But what's going to be really interesting is if it's a good car, it could really help GM's image.",
        "And frankly one of the things going forward for GM, beyond all the financials we've just discussed, is if this company can turn around its image, it has a much better chance of succeeding."

        "And he very quickly has to figure out how to raise $28-30 billion for the International Development Association, which is an arm of the bank that contributes a lot of funds, in particular to sub-Saharan Africa, and that's going to run dry next year if they don't raise some money.",
