        "The idea here is that comets have inside them material that hasn't literally seen the sun for four and a half billion years.",
        "The comets were put together the same time the planets were, but the comets have been really unchanged over all these years.",
        "And so by looking at the shape of the crater and by studying the debris that comes out, they hope to understand what that early material was like.",

        "The probe weighed something like 800 pounds and the comet is much bigger.",
        "It's 10 miles across.",
        "So in the scheme of things, we're pretty small.",
        "And if a comet were heading toward the Earth, you'd have to do something pretty dramatic to deflect it.",
        "Although one scientist was saying that the Impactor created what they call a jet, so a small bursting of material out to one side.",
        "And that over the long, long period, that would actually deflect the comet slightly, so in a sense, this is a sort of thing that you could do if you had a comet and you caught it early enough and realized that it was eventually was, in many orbits, hit the Earth.",
