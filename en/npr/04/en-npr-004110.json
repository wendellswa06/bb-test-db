        "And that situation as we heard described in New York - obviously, details will vary, but the overall thrust of it, it's got to sound awfully familiar.",
        "Unfortunately, yes.",
        "We have situations periodically where police officers fire a large number of rounds, and what we have to do, like we always have to do, is do a thorough investigation so we can ascertain what was in the officer's mind at the time that they were firing to see whether what they did was appropriate or not.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And what are police and forensic investigators going to be looking for?",
        "Hi Matt, you're on the air.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "On TV shows, we see, you know, these painstaking re-enactments with pieces of red tape or laser beams used to track the trail of every single bullet fired.",
        "Is something like that likely to happen in this case, do you think?",
        "It's possible.",
        "I really don't know what the investigative protocol for NYPD is in terms of what they're going to do out at the scene.",
        "What they might do is they might well take the vehicle - because my understanding is there was a vehicle in which the three people were when they were shot - take that to some remote location where they can do either laser analysis or, more likely, we have dowels or rods that we can put through from one point of the vehicle to the other to determine the trajectory of the various bullets, try to find from the shell-casing patterns where the officers were standing and reconstruct it that way.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now use-of-force policies differ, I would assume, across the country.",
        "But in general, can an officer - is an officer allowed to shoot at a person without first seeing a weapon?",
        "Certainly.",
        "If there's a situation where a police officer can articulate a reason why he believes that an individual presents an imminent threat to himself or to some third party - a partner or an innocent citizen -then they don't have to wait to see a gun to pull the trigger.",
        "The question is, what was the officer's perception?",
        "Was it a reasonable perception?",
        "Let us say that I have a situation where I'm running down an alley, chasing an individual who I saw rob a supermarket, and I saw him put a gun in his waistband as he runs away.",
        "Then he stops and he reaches into his waistband.",
        "I don't have to wait to see the gun because I can make a reasonable assertion that he was reaching for the gun that I previously saw him place there.",
        "In a situation like this, I don't know whether the argument the officers have is that they believe that the individuals were armed with handguns or some other type of weapon or whether it was the vehicle itself that was being used to assault them.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And we're going to have to wait and see until that comes out."

        "Absolutely.",
        "We want to get to the phones, but quickly, is it typical that officers involved in a shooting like this would be suspended with pay as long as the investigation continues?",
        "Well, I think what's typical is officers are not necessarily suspended, but they're taken out of the field for some period of time.",
        "The range around the country, anywhere from two days up until to a couple of weeks so the investigation can move forward and so that the officer can decompress from what he or she experienced during the event.",
        "The thing that I find interesting here is the - Corky's report that they were suspended with pay, which is something different from being on administrative relief, and also that their firearms were apparently taken away.",
        "That is not typical.",
        "Now what is typical...",
        "Suspended may have been my word and not his, but go ahead.",
        "Okay.",
        "But what is typical is the weapons that the officers used are taken from them so that they can be analyzed, but the officers still are provided another weapon or allowed to carry another weapon that they have in their possession so that they aren't unarmed.",
        "So if, in fact, their weapons were taken away, not as part of the investigation but rather as part of the administrative process, that is kind of unusual.",

        "Because it seems like here, there is a number of incidents that we can go back - and I was wondering how is it that actually might detract, saying that previous incidents such as this that are, you know - it just seems like we're always at a agitation with regards to what was done, but is there any way that we can actually gauge or measure that these things that they're doing, you know...",

        "And a further belief by many victims' families this is going to be investigated by the police and the district attorney, maybe the feds will get into it, but these are all men in blue.",

        "And one of the points that was brought up earlier - I believe in Corky's report - was this notion of contagious firing.",
        "And that is where one officer fires or two officers fire and then a lot of other officers fire without being able to articulate precisely why they were firing.",
        "That is, what was the threat that they were perceiving?",
        "And this is something that happens around the country in law enforcement.",
        "Trainers are working diligently to try to overcome this, to try to remind officers that just because one officer is shooting doesn't mean that you can shoot, too.",
        "Unless you can independently articulate the reason why you're going to pull the trigger, you shouldn't be pulling the trigger.",
        "But unfortunately, that message is not 100 percent across the board in American law enforcement yet."

        "Why should there be any incidents like this?",
        "Well, I think that one of the things is that how things are characterized in the press and what people know about it through the grapevine is not necessarily what really happened, and so I don't know about the situation in Portland where someone was tased.",
        "If the person is unarmed and they present a threat that would justify a tazing, then the tase was appropriate.",
