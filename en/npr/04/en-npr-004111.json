        "And as I reviewed the investigations by both the agency and the district attorney, I was appalled by how unthorough they were, the lack of detail and what appeared to me to be a favoring police and not paying attention to some of the issues that needed to be paid attention to.",
        "Flip side of the coin, there are places around the country where officers are drug through the mud by investigators who aren't interested in doing the right thing and coming up with an impartial investigation, but rather will give into the politics of the day.",
        "And that's not fair, either.",
        "What we need are solid, sound investigative protocols being established and then followed in each and every case.",
        "And then I don't believe we'd have such a disparity.",
        "I do think there's always going to be some sense of - on the part of the cops that gee, we're being persecuted in some sense on the part of the family members and members of the community, that it's a whitewash.",
        "Having been involved in a shooting as a young police officer, having felt the emotion of being worried that I was going to be prosecuted and I was going to be persecuted for having done something that was absolutely necessary, I very much identify with the police.",
        "On the flip side of the coin, as a police process expert around the country, I see some of the real shoddy police work that goes on.",
        "I understand why sometimes members of the community, and particularly families, could be a little bit concerned about the adequacy of what the investigation is all about.",

        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I was just wondering.",
        "My comment is - it's unfortunate these incidents happen.",
        "But at the same time, after the investigation is completed and there shows no threat in any way for the officers - to the officers - what happens to the police officers?",
        "What happens to the community at that point?",
        "Well, it depends on whether there is an objectively reasonable belief on the part of the officer that there was a threat.",
        "Let us say what we have is a situation where a police officer responds to a call of a robbery in progress and he deploys and someone runs at him with what clearly appears to be a gun in his hand, and this is on video - let's say from his car video."

        "He shoots the person, the person falls out of view.",
        "The officer goes up and handcuffs the suspect, and the next thing you know is you see on the video he picks it up and he says, gosh darn, it's a toy gun.",
        "There was no actual threat, but the officer had a reasonable belief that his life was in danger when he fired because the toy gun appeared to be a real gun.",
        "Similarly, if the situation is where an officer believed the person was armed and he didn't have anything - and as I said earlier, if it was a reasonable belief - then we've got to give the officer the benefit of the doubt.",
        "And, in fact, that's what the federal courts have ruled - that officers don't have to wait to see the gun.",
        "And I certainly can understand that, but you still didn't answer the question...",
        "I'm sorry, sir.",
        "Go ahead...",
        "You said no threat at all, to the officers - through the investigation process.",

        "Okay, Macintyre, thanks for the call.",
        "I apologize for misapprehending what you were getting at.",
        "If in fact, there was no reasonable threat - and it can be demonstrated, conclusively, that there was no reasonable threat - then the officer is liable for administrative sanctions; could be fired, could be suspended, is liable for criminal sanctions in terms of being indicted, put on trial, convicted, so on and so forth.",
        "And then, of course, there's the opportunity down the road for civil litigation - to hold the officer liable.",
        "So officers who shoot when there is no objectively reasonable threat can find themselves in real hot water.",

        "Hi.",

        "My question has to do with doctrine, I guess.",
        "And it seems to me, as I've watched things over, you know, the last 40 years or so, that the definition of what constitutes aggression on the part of someone that the police are concerned about or afraid of has become incredibly broad.",
        "And to a point where it almost seems like there's kind of something close to impunity for police if they're afraid.",
        "And if that somebody even like keeps moving - they're shot, they're on the ground and they keep moving - that's considered aggression.",
        "So it's okay to keep shooting until, you know - so that it's only when movement stops -someone's dead."

        "And so I guess my question is, is there a problem about how broadly we're defining what constitutes aggression - how broadly we're allowing police to take deadly force on the perception of relatively marginal fears?",
        "I would say no, and I would point to the statistical evidence that shows that around the country, compared to a few decades ago, police officers are shooting far fewer people.",
        "The training is better, officers are structuring encounters in ways that reduce the likelihood that they'll have to shoot.",
        "And also, the laws have changed.",
        "In 1985, the Supreme Court said you're no longer allowed to shoot fleeing, non-violent felons, for example.",
        "But the point that you - or the example you used to get to your point, was someone who is on the ground and the officers continue to shoot.",
        "If I'm in a posture where I'm in a gun battle, and I'm shot and I go down as a police officer - just because I'm on the ground, I'm not going to give up.",
        "I'm going to continue to shoot, to try to hurt and take the bad guy who's shooting at me out of commission.",
        "I'd like to begin with the decision you made not to evacuate Harris County and therefore the city of Houston.",
        "At a news conference on Friday, you said evacuations for water are usually related to storm surge rather than rain.",
        "Let's hear just a bit of that press conference.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "Similarly, I've got to believe that that is the modality that the individual that I just shot is under.",
        "So the mere fact that someone is down doesn't mean they're out of the fight.",
        "And then we would have to look at the particulars -what type of movement, what was the person doing - and if the movement was continuing to threaten the officer or an innocent third party, then deadly force would still be justified.",

        "There is, for example, in this kind of shooting that we saw in New York over the past weekend, there's going to be a lot of reinforced suspicions amongst the community about the dangers represented by the police.",
        "At the same time, the police themselves are going to be especially skittish as well."

        "We're going to wait for the investigation to run its course.",

        "And what level of threat do officers have to perceive in order to use a Taser?",

        "Right.",

        "And to make a long story short, that's the one where they can fire a couple of prongs out.",
        "And those weapons generally deliver a 50,000-volt shock.",
        "The goal, with low amperage, the goal is to stop the aggressive action.",
        "And in some cases, the Taser is absolutely appropriate and it's going to work to preclude a situation from escalating to a point of deadly force.",
        "Sometimes people fight through Tasers, sometimes the officers miss with the Tasers - that the barbs miss when they're firing them.",
        "So it's not a panacea.",
        "But what we do know, is that one of the reasons why the use of deadly force is lower now than it was a generation ago in American law enforcement, is because officers do have at their disposal a variety of less lethal weapons.",
        "Besides the Tasers, we also have impact munitions, which are soft projectiles that we can fire at people to stun them and put some pain on them and get them to comply without having to kill them.",
        "But all of these devices are devices that should be used at a lower level of threat, not at a situation where an officer's life is in immanent jeopardy.",
