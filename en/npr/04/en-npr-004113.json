        "We just finished a meeting this afternoon with our utilities and representatives from different states that they are moving ahead with 31 new nuclear units in the United States to go through licensing in the next three years.",
        "That is plans for 31 new nuclear power plants.",
        "So this is a new wave of both licensing and construction that will occur.",
        "Well, actually, it may not occur.",
        "Companies are jockeying for position right now to qualify for some federal subsidies if they do build a plant.",
        "So they've started the ball rolling on permits.",
        "But power companies may decide the new plants don't make sense.",
        "And it's not just because of controversy over where to put nuclear waste or safety concerns.",
        "Those are still issues.",
        "The biggest obstacle to nuclear right now is just basic economics: building a coal-burning plant is cheaper.",
        "In fact, because of that, despite the energy secretary's enthusiasm, the Department of Energy's own experts are skeptical that nuclear power will play a bigger role in years to come.",
        "Absence in some change in policy, the economics favor coal in most regions of the country over nuclear.",
        "Alan Beamon is the director with the federal Energy Information Administration.",
        "The EIA predicts that nuclear power's share of electricity generation in the United States will fall in coming years.",
        "But there is something that could change that: tougher greenhouse gas regulations.",
        "The EIA recently did an analysis of some current proposals for a so-called cap-and-trade system to limit emissions.",
        "In the most stringent case, the additions of nuclear capacity are so large that they essentially double current nuclear capacity that exists in the country.",
        "That's because greenhouse gas caps make burning coal more expensive so nuclear becomes more attractive.",
        "And there is enough global warming concern in Washington right now that such caps are considered likely.",
        "I see environmental regulations on air qualities becoming stricter and stricter.",
        "That's Ken Hughey, a business development executive with Entergy, which runs 11 nuclear power plants and is currently seeking permits to build two new ones.",
        "Both would be located next to existing nuclear reactors.",
        "Hughey says like other companies, Entergy is trying to figure out how much a new plant would cost."
