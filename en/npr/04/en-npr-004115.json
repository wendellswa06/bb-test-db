        "But then - began his descent into murder takes all the lightness away and raises a serious question: how could a boy of 11 become involved in murder?",
        "The answer that's given to you - with a bus ride - only deepens the mystery, and then, I think - at least I, and I believe most readers will be off in search of the answer.",
