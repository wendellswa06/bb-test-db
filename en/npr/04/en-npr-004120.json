        "Hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "Say, I just wanted to share an experience that we had when I had when I was the mayor of Rapids City a few years ago, and we went to a an event in Boston that was the National League of Cities gathering.",
        "And this is really super because I didn't know Robert Reich was also going to be on the program because it involved these two guys you have on the show today.",
        "And the very first thing that happened, when these guys came out on stage in front of these thousands of small town and large city mayors and council people from all across the United States, Robert Reich goes over behind the podium that has no wooden box behind it.",
        "And Simpson goes over and stands up on this wooden box behind the podium.",
        "And so Simpson's head's up 10,000 feet in the air, and you can't even see Reich.",

        "And, you know, that first thing they did just sewed it up.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "It's a conservative record.",
        "And so my hat's off to you two guys.",
        "And I'll never forget Simpson saying that what they say in Wyoming when things start to get better - it's like an old cattle saying - which is, it heals up and hairs over.",

        "Except for Simpson's bald head.",
        "That never worked out.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Let me tell you, I remember that day so well because the program coordinator was very officious and trying her or his - I can't remember, desperately to get us - she said, now, remember there was a box by that podium.",
        "We walked out silently.",
        "I stepped up to his box.",
        "I was 20 feet in the air, and you couldn't see Bob.",
        "And we never said anything.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "He just then pointed over and just moved his finger like okay, and gave me the thumb.",
        "And I went over to the other one and we still never said anything.",
        "It was spirited."

        "And what you ought to have is just the opposite.",

        "That's an interesting point about self-confidence.",
        "But you know, the odd thing there again is that Washington, at least superficially, is filled with people who seem to evince a great deal of self-confidence, but they have the thinnest skins I've ever encountered in my life.",
        "I mean, you say something that may just be in satire or in jest and, oh, and somebody's hurt and they brood and then they attack you.",
        "And then they get mad.",

        "I remember saying to my husband if I'd seen this Bob Dole before the election I might have voted for him.",
        "These days when I see any politician poking fun at themselves on The Daly Show or The Colbert Report they really earn another look from me.",
        "I will often go search their websites and platforms to see if there was anything else I didn't know about them.",
        "And that leads me to ask you both about this.",

        "No.",
        "Then you might find a joke on yourself in the headlines.",
        "I think part of it really comes from political correctness.",
        "I think political correctness is like wearing duct tape over your mouth.",
        "Because if you really are a person that has bias and hate and bile and a lot of filth running around your head and pretend that you don't and give a big broad smile and say I would've never thought that, that's going to find its way to the surface like a fissure through a volcano core.",
        "And that's why I think there's a lot of stuff going on in the world about lack of civility.",
        "But I remember Bob Reich would get up and he would say before I went to work for the Clinton Administration I was as tall as Simpson.",
        "Well, they'd just go crazy.",
        "You know, and he had a thousand of those and I have a thousand of them and the self-deprecating - but this other stuff is not humor.",
        "This is slice- 'em-up, and slice-'em-up humor may get you a laugh, may get you ratings, may get you a lot of stuff, but I tell you, when you go home to bed at night I wouldn't think you'd sleep pretty well when you're making fun of persons and their physical attributes and their weight, whatever, whatever, whatever.",
        "And they do that.",
        "That's supposed to be ho-ho funny.",
        "Our guest is Alan Simpson, former Senator from Wyoming.",
        "Also with us Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor under the Clinton Administration.",
