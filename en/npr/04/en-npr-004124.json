        "We're now in a very uncertain transition that NASA and the country hasn't faced in decades, trying to design a new space vehicle while recovering from an accident with the old one, at the same time trying to draw plans that will credibly get us out to places we've never touched before.",
        "So this is really a time of flux, and it's a big challenge for the space agency, and that's what we're seeing right now is a lot of struggling with trying to get on track.",
