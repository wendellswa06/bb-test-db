        "First thing we need to do is get the shuttle out of the way as soon as possible.",
        "Mm hmmm.",
        "A vehicle that has a job to do in the next few years to get the most important components that are sure on the ground, already checked out, up to the space station.",
        "Those include the Japanese and European laboratory, for example, that our partners have been waiting on for years.",
        "But the standing army that Rick referred to that keeps the shuttle flying is a very expensive operation to support...",
        "Mm hmmm.",
        "...and that burden on NASA's back, they need to retire that vehicle, move to a lower cost vehicle that can get people up to the space station and then beyond, cheaply and safely.",
        "In fact, there are 10 more safe than the shuttle can ever be because of its limited, built-in design vulnerabilities.",
        "So that's the first thing, is to get the space shuttle's expenses put to bed.",
        "And then that'll free up, I hope, some money from some commercialization activity that will support the space station.",
        "All the supplies and cargo shouldn't be flown up on NASA rockets they should be flown up on commercial enterprises that can bid for that business and, you know, get NASA out of the freight business and get it back in the exploring business.",
        "And that may be the surface of the Moon where we go or the asteroids, which I would like to see visited pretty quickly and then, eventually, to Mars.",
        "The key to that is just going to be to get a new way to take people out of Earth orbit.",
        "And so on the Lewis and Clark end of the spectrum, I think we do need a new space vehicle.",
        "That's what NASA's trying to design right now.",
        "My friends that I've talked to this week in Houston are working very busily on the cockpit design for this new vehicle.",
        "And that's going to be a vehicle that's a lot safer for my colleagues and, I think, it's going to be something that can carry us decades into the future.",
        "Mm hmmm."

        "...all the while, filling in that commercial exploring, will be the commercial spacecraft that Elon talked about that can take some of the burden off the taxpayers and put it where the biggest bang for the buck is.",

        "I'm sticking to it, basically.",
        "What we really need is a partnership, as we move out, between the government; playing the Lewis and Clark role on the leading edge and constantly, and this is where we screw up and have screwed up in the past, built into that Lewis and Clark function, should be a constant handoff of operational activities to the private sectors, such as Elon's company, and the things Bert(ph) might build, and others out there.",
        "Just constantly shedding that so we have what I call, lean mean exploration machine, in the form of NASA moving outward.",

        "My concern with some of the things that are happening right now is that, for example, NASA is going to be subsidizing this new rocket, which is probably going to be built by one of the two major contractors, two or three major contractors out there, who are already incorporating in their plans, sort of a backup plan.",
        "That they're going to use the money that they get subsidized development of this vehicle to actually do those things Tom was talking about, which the current administrator is saying is for the private sector, which is carrying goods and cargo to and from space stations.",
        "So we already have the aerospace companies, the traditional aerospace companies as I call them, saying that they're building a variation of their vehicle which will actually compete with these non-subsidized, private companies that are going to be allegedly carrying stuff to and from stations.",
        "So I see a few years down the road, we could have real trouble there, as the smaller guys get kind of booted out of the way by these heavily subsidized aerospace companies.",
        "So it's a little bit complex, but it is something that, you know, I keep coming back the fact, if we're going to settle and stay and create the communities that Elon was speaking of, we have to make all of our decisions with that in mind.",
        "And that gets to the Lewis and Clark function for government and the enabling and protecting and nurturing the new private sector companies that are going to be the ones who actually create the economy that allows us to stay.",
        "Because as we say in our group, nobody stays until somebody pays.",
        "And I really don't want it to be the taxpayers.",

        "Sure, I mean, I think, you know, I represent an organization that has about 20,000 members, mostly in the U.S.",
        "And there's a large constituency of people who don't particularly care one way or the other about the intricacies of cargo versus crew or whatever, these other things, which are really important in a sort of inside baseball space way.",
        "But, you know, they care about that our nation and the world is dedicating significant resources to going out into the solar system and starting to explore and starting to settle.",
        "And I think the most important two things that NASA can do, as it goes forward, is: one, to do a better job of explaining why we're going, which I think it has not done a great job of recently.",
        "And I think that it's a great story to tell.",
        "It's one of the greatest stories of our time: the idea that we're going out and we're going to actually have a lunar settlement by 2022, by the time, you know, some of the kids in elementary school are just about the right age to be astronauts themselves.",
        "So I think telling the story is absolutely critical and something that NASA's got to do a better job of.",
        "On the other hand, if the government keeps running into a large deficit, the deficit runs higher every year, and we just heard this week about another $100 billion or more for Iraq and Afghanistan and for the war there.",
        "Isn't it possible that the government's whole mission to the moon and Mars can sort of evaporate in red, not red tape, but red ink and there will be a natural boost for the private people to come along?",
        "I think, you know, I mean, sorry to jump in, but, I mean, I think the funny thing is, you have four people on this show with you who basically agree that the private sector is absolutely critical, is indeed indispensable to NASA's exploration plans.",
        "Ira, it is literally impossible for NASA to do what it wants without bringing in strong involvement of the private sector."
