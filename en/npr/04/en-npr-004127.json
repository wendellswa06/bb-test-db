        "It is statistically true; at least it has been...",
        "Companies have to meet regulations and currently the regulations that are used for guidance for people who are developing private space travel don't include levels of safety that equal the FAA levels of safety.",
        "They only talk about levels of safety that have to do with hitting something on the ground should something go wrong and I'm afraid that the public may be misled if they opt to spend a few thousand or a few hundred thousand dollars for a four to ten minute space ride and not realize that the levels of safety don't anywhere approach the levels of safety required for an FAA certified aircraft.",

        "The legislation requires that anyone who, any private individual who does space travel, be informed explicitly, and I mean explicitly about the risks by whatever company is providing that trip and, I mean, the language will be, you know, it has to be formulated in the most extreme manner.",
        "I mean, you're basically gonna be signing something that says I almost expect to die.",
        "That's my point.",
        "You don't do that on a commercial aircraft and the reason you don't do it, we know what those levels of safety are.",
        "For a catastrophic event, it's (unintelligible) by law.",
        "For space travel there is no equivalent level of safety required.",
        "Right, well, but it is expected to be dangerous and that's, informed consent is the only way that somebody could actually fly on either suborbital or orbital craft and initially the danger will be high and, certainly, nobody's going to be duped at all.",
        "In fact, I mean, that would be completely against the law.",
        "But the main impetus in trying to get some sort of privatization has been based on the fact that we have this notion that what we have right now with the government space program isn't safe.",
        "And that is true, there are some safety risks involved, but I do not believe that the safety record will initially improve by an effort to privatize it so that folks can make money sending people to space for four to five minutes.",
        "Okay, let me just jump in because we have to take care of business, pay the bills.",
        "We're talking about space this hour on Talk of the Nation Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "Yes, go ahead, Elon.",
        "Well, yeah, I think, you know, there will be initially a higher level of danger which people will be informed about (unintelligible) that's if they, that they can fly, but I think in the long term, it will be considerably safer by virtue of commercial companies entering the space transportation business.",
        "Like, I expect that one day we will indeed have reliability levels, which are comparable to that of airliners."

        "I've got a ticket on one of these suborbital providers, Virgin Galactic, which is the same company that, you know, group of companies that Richard Branson runs, and I think there is a very explicit recognition among the group of people who've bought these first tickets to be private, you know, space travelers, that it is dangerous, but we know that it has to get started somewhere and I think that there is a link in a sort of a higher level way between the suborbital stuff that Virgin's trying to do, and other providers, and the orbital stuff that Elon is trying to do.",
        "They're fundamentally different in certain respects but I think the point is that we need to get that dynamic, that dynamo of commercial demand linking in with private providers and just as Elon says, that's what has brought about the extreme safety level in today's air transport industry and I think that that's what'll (unintelligible).",
        "From an astronaut's point of view, if the private company wants to take a human being to orbit or on a suborbital flight, if they don't provide some level of safety commensurate with the expense, they're gonna go out of business.",
        "So, after that sorting out process occurs, I think that, you know, that might be a way to farm out or bid for transportation of crew to the International Space Station on a very safe commercial system that eventually evolves.",
        "If I could toss a quick one in.",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "It's not really a fair comparison to take the mass transportation--mature mass transportation industry that we have today and compare it to an industry that is possibly at the level of, you know, barnstorming in the early days.",

        "In fact, if you built the moonship that NASA is planning to build to get there by 2017, that same ship could take you out to the nearest, near earth objects that come close to our orbit in space for less energy, in terms of rocket power again, and on a round trip that might last just a couple of three months.",

        "You know, we're still gonna have to build these rockets in the interim period, but your caller's absolutely right that in terms of fundamental improvements of what can enable us to send ships, you know, throughout the solar system and send those settlers out to different parts of moons and planets, it's really gonna be the space elevator.",

        "How do you make a space elevator?",
        "It's basically, you build a big ribbon and you put it out in geostationary orbit and you let it fall back down to earth so that you literally have a ribbon connecting the surface of the earth out into space and then you have an elevator literally, sort of a climber that hooks on the side of it and it uses, well, different kinds of power, solar power or laser power, and it climbs this elevator up into space and the wonderful thing about that is that you don't have to go through, you know, use rockets, you know, which require very high thrust to get out of the so-called gravity well of earth.",

        "We've never, you know, really built anything that long ever before and, you know, not even made something as big as a pencil with carbon nanotubes which are the only thing that would be able to survive the enormous stress that would be on this cable and I think there would be some hesitation for people to have this gigantic cable wrapped, you know, sort of spinning out from earth and potentially coming a hazard if it ever does break or come loose, or something like that.",
        "And quite frankly I think it's going to, you know, long before it makes sense to build a space elevator, it'll make sense to build, you know, a trans-Pacific bridge from Los Angeles to Tokyo.",
