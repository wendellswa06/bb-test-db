        "But I think what's really interesting is, when we're talking about NASA current day, and we're talking about the Lewis and Clark and leading-edge side of things, is unfortunately a lot of NASA's budget that would look at advanced technologies, be it nuclear rockets to take you to and from Mars, whatever, are being sort of jettisoned in the current budgets.",
        "And that's something that's of great concern.",
        "Whether its nanotubes or whatever, we need to make sure that NASA, where our taxpayer dollars are being put, is putting its money into looking way beyond the horizon rather than trying to build the trucks that Elon can do better.",
        "Jettisoned in favor of what?",
        "The money going into building this sort of monolithic government rocketing, rocket system, the CEV.",
        "It's an all-hands thing.",
        "They're throwing out technologies that would be very useful.",
        "For example, recently they haven't quite done it yet, I gather, but they're going to toss the idea of using methane for propellant.",
        "Now the beauty of that is that you can create propellant on the surface of Mars and other bodies in space, which is the equivalent of living off the land, and propel your rocket ships using those kinds of things in the early phases; and avoid using these sort of dangerous propellants that we use nowadays that require a lot of infrastructure.",
        "But NASA's tossing that.",
        "Which means...",
        "Because?",
        "...means we may get there, but we can't today.",
        "Yeah, because I, well I had heard, you know, that there were proposals if you go to Mars you send the rocket, you send a payload there first that sits on the surface and makes the return fuel.",
        "And then you would come and get...",
        "Right.",
        "And we're jettisoning the research on how to do that.",
        "Right.",
        "Although I should point out that you could have liquid oxygen and hydrogen engine just from any water you could find, and, so, and in fact a lot of the comets and asteroids are believed to hold a lot of ice.",
        "And certainly there's a lot of ice on Mars.",
        "So if you took a liquid oxygen and hydrogen engine, which is by the way the most efficient engine, that you could realistically build, based on the chemicals, you know, you actually are able to refuel anywhere that there is any kind of water ice.",
        "Yeah, but it's important to make sure that we have somebody who's, especially those who are, where we're pooling our tax dollars, we're looking into those sorts of pioneering technologies.",
        "I'm not specifically saying it's this or that or methane or space elevators, but that, the best use I believe of our tax dollars as opposed to private funds is to look into these advanced research projects that, in the long term, might provide us to live off the land once we get there."

        "After the accident three years ago the Congress said, and the President agreed proposing this new plan, that its time to renew our goals, challenge ourselves in the future, and put the resources behind this effort to make it happen.",
        "And now we're three years later and NASA's in such a tight budget box that it's throwing overboard perhaps technologies that will make it easier to operate just ten to fifteen years down the line.",
        "And that might truncate or make it easier to walk away from our ability to get out beyond earth orbit, stay on the moon if that's our goal, if the resources are there, or prevent us from going to the asteroid.",
        "So I think it's time for the country's policy makers to say, \"\"It's important to stay in space, it's important to try to tackle these new goals.\"\" And then put the necessary resources to work.",
        "That's what got us into the Columbia box, fifteen years of neglect of NASA and a goal for NASA.",
        "And I think that's what we need to do now; make up for that lack of support in the last decade and a half and go forward in the future on a firm footing."

        "Does Congress and earmarking money for how it might be spent?",
        "Well, if the President has said we are going to do A, B, and C, you know, restore the shuttle for flight, finish the space station, replace the shuttle with a new vehicle and go back to the moon, and that's what he's told NASA to do, then Congress has endorsed those goals in its regular, in its legislative language.",
        "But the budget numbers to support the execution of those goals has not arrived yet.",
        "Those funds have not been given to NASA.",
        "So Mike Griffin, the NASA Administrator, has the tough job of trying to keep moving on all these fronts but he's not been given the resources.",
        "You know, and that's almost, to me, from living through the space race of the 1960's, what was the miracle of the 1960's is that you had this ten-year period where, you know, there was not a change of an Administration killing the project, bringing it back, doing, and that sort of thing.",
        "So you had ten years of consistency.",
        "And it started to wane at the end of the Apollo project.",
        "Yes.",
        "Congress started to pull support.",
        "And that's the danger here, is that we might starve the future just to make it through these next few years of shuttle operations and finishing the space station.",
        "So, you know, we as a country have to decide whether we're really serious about sending people into space or we're going to be right back into the same situation, where we've compromised the design of some very complex and hazardous machinery by making short-term budget choices.",

        "One of the things that I think we should give him credit for is that unlike any other administrator in NASA history, he's carved out about a half a billion dollars to give to these commercial operators.",
        "That's never happened before.",
        "And he's protecting that, and I think that that's really his way of saying, you know, we want to place a bet on these commercial operators, we want to give them a real chance to start to succeed.",
        "And I think, you know, frankly, I really hope that Elon goes out and, you know, and takes that and proves that the private industry can really do it for the future of NASA.",

        "And, what I'm very afraid of is this 500 million that was put aside to help fund companies carry payloads to and from stations, we'll eventually be goggled up or killed off by the very powerful lobbies for the large aerospace companies which exist largely, right now.",
        "And I'm not saying everybody in those companies, because there are some very enlightened people working in all of these industries and in NASA and elsewhere, but they exist to kind of keep the money flowing.",
        "And what I'm interested in seeing is people like Elon and others get a chance to break out.",

        "And it's a hotel and a lab.",
        "At some point in the future, hopefully not that far away, maybe before 2020, we're going to see vehicles like Elon's carrying people and payloads to that private facility.",
        "At which point, if the NASA human exploration goes away, yes that would be sad, we would lose the Lewis and Clark function, but the breakout, the human breakout of the planet, would have moved to a sustainable level and we would be on our way.",
