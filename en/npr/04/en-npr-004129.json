        "Yeah, that was the plan, but county executives here said that plan just went out the window, and I was actually here last night when it went out the window, which was when a school bus arrived with people who had been picked up along the side of the road.",
        "And the Red Cross eventually just said, `You've got to let them in.",
        "And so I've talked to people who have come--have hitchhiked here, who have come on--borrowed rides, people who have come on buses run from a military base, they said.",

        "Yeah.",

        "And so these House members are going to be voting for a bill that rips away coverage for a lot of people for nothing because it's probably not going to get through the Senate.",
        "And the reason for the latter is there are two groups of people Trump needs to win over - those who are in the what we call the coverage caucus who want the more expensive bill that'll cost more coverage, and those who are in the freedom caucus who want a less expensive bill with less coverage.",
        "And he's got to win them both.",
