        "If it took a couple months or three months or something as such.",
        "And I suspect there's a lot of people all over the place that might have the same idea or same feeling, and I was wondering if it's at all possible to have something organized where there could be a clearing house, so to speak, to accommodate these people.",

        "And then as you ascended into the more darker and scarier reaches of the Superdome, you could feel that all begin to break down on the second level where all the toilets were.",
        "The floor was just slick with human excrement mixed with urine because no one could go in the bathrooms any longer.",
        "They were just that fetid.",
        "And so people would just try to find a space for themselves that they thought was a little away where they could relieve themselves.",

        "One man told me he had lost everything, and, you know, he was happy to be able to find a little beer.",
        "And then up on the fourth level, in the most nether reaches, there were--that was where all the women said, `You don't go up there.",
        "You know, they wouldn't let their children go up there.",
        "That was where the bogeyman lived, essentially, and all the rumors that were existent about there's somebody stealing babies, there's someone raping girls--that's--they seemed to flow from this sense that up there in the darkest regions was where the real problem was.",
        "And the National Guard spokesman for the area assured me that none of that had happened and that none of that was true.",
        "But we do know how to do it.",
        "But in that kind of environment, I think, where people are completely absent any information and perceive that day after day goes by and they don't get any help, I think it breeds that kind of fear and anxiety and eventually misery."

        "I won't press you too hard on that.",
        "They had said the water was no longer rising.",
        "We found a dry spot and kind of hiked through the flooded streets toward the Superdome.",

        "And when I came out three hours later, the water had risen another two feet.",
        "I mean, it was basically to my waist level, and I had to wade back through.",
        "So it was clear to me on the ground that the idea that that place could be evacuated in 24 hours, you know, with a massive infusion of troops, was completely unrealistic, because the buses could not get anywhere near that place.",
        "The only vehicles who could ford those flooded streets were what the military calls, you know, a deuce-and-a-half, the huge trucks with the big tires.",
        "And you would have to either take people out on huge helicopters, which even so can only hold--What?--maybe 30 people at a time, or you would have to ferry them on these trucks, which can maybe hold 15 people at a time out to the buses on the Interstate ramp, maybe a mile away.",
        "So it was going to always be a very lengthy process.",
        "And furthermore, the plan always was that they had to evacuate the 300 people who were patients of the infirmary set up alongside who needed to be sent away to hospitals around the state of Louisiana before they could think about also evacuating, you know, these thousands and thousands of more able-bodied but very desperate and failing people from the Superdome itself.",
        "And as we've heard today, once they did start the evacuation, more and more thousands arrived from hotels and various other places in New Orleans trying to get on those buses themselves.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I mean, there was just this sort of confused quality to a lot of people, wondering why help hadn't come more quickly.",
        "And so it's become increasingly clear, you think you can wait in a hotel, but nobody's going to come get you.",
        "So information spreads along one mouth to the other, and people finally were beginning to make their way over to the Superdome in the hopes that that was the only way out.",
        "But when I left New Orleans last night, knowing that the situation was getting increasingly dangerous on the streets and that the water was rising and you simply cannot be without your car, that will be your end as well.",
        "So you've got to get out of there while you still can.",
        "There were people just walking out of town, carrying their children on their backs on these hot, dusty interstates.",
        "It was, you know, like a scene in Oklahoma in the '30s."
