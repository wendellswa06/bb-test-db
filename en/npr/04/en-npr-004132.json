        "OK.",
        "I just wanted to let everyone in Shreveport know how proud we are of the citizens in Shreveport and how nice everyone has been to the folks that are up from New Orleans.",
        "I'm from Shreveport.",
        "This is--I mean, luckily, you know, we were spared by all the disaster down there, but we have welcomed these folks with open arms.",
        "We have two huge shelters set up.",
        "I have friends I know that have big houses that have taken in families.",
        "One of my friends said he had room for eight, and so he was taking in a family of eight.",
        "There's drop-off points for donations all over town, and the biggest thing that they need in the two biggest shelters that we have, which is--First Coliseum has opened a shelter, and I'm not sure how many they can hold, but I think there's about 10,000 seats, so I don't know how many cots that'll hold.",
        "But they need baby items.",
        "They need baby items.",
        "They need baby items.",
        "They need diapers, they need Pull-Ups.",
        "And yeah, you think about these mothers; they've been holding these babies with nowhere to sit them down for a week now.",
        "So you can imagine being a new mom.",
        "And, you know, even if you've never been in this situation, imagine being a new mom and just wanting to go take a shower, having no place to put your baby.",
        "You can't lay them on the floor.",
        "You can't--you know, they don't have a car seat, they don't have a high chair, no walker, no nothing.",
        "I'm a mother of twins, so I had lots of stuff to spare.",
        "My three-year-old had clothes that I had piled up.",
        "I took that all down there, and they were so happy to see diapers that my kids had outgrown and clothes and baby blankets and a car seat.",
        "Even if it's a worn-out car seat that doesn't have the straps or whatever, somewhere for a mother to lay her child so she can, you know, get a minute of--you know, let her arms rest.",
        "Jennifer, it sounds like there's a lot going on.",
        "We appreciate the update.",
        "There is a lot going on, but, I mean, we're handling--the roads themselves are just full of people.",
        "Shreveport has--I think the population of Shreveport has tripled in the last week.",
        "But, you know, we're going the best we can to help these folks, and we are--the citizens of Shreveport are helping more than I ever knew we were capable of.",
        "It's important to remember that there's a lot of human kindness erupting, as well as some less attractive aspects of human nature.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Here's an e-mail we got from Monica Miller.",

        "My husband makes the countertops.",
        "They're hiring more people to get these out to you.",

        "That from Monica Miller in Nappanee, Indiana.",
        "We're taking your calls, if you'd like to join us.",
        "We're continuing to talk about the crisis that has emerged after the passage of Katrina through New Orleans and the Gulf Coast; (800) 989-8255, (800) 989-TALK.",

        "Several hundred residents have no power.",
        "There are still downed power lines and trees to be cleared.",
        "Many people from the coast fled to Jackson, some coming from as far away as New Orleans.",

        "Good afternoon, Neal.",
        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Any idea how many evacuees have arrived there?",
        "Well, I am in the Jackson Coliseum.",
        "This is on the Mississippi State Fairgrounds in downtown Jackson, which is a mini version, if you will, of the Superdome in New Orleans or the Houston Astrodome.",
        "And there are about 1,200, 1,300 refugees I'm told here.",
        "Most of them had come prior to Katrina hitting, and most of them are from New Orleans or the Mississippi Gulf Coast near New Orleans.",
        "And it's an amazing scene.",
        "I mean, you know, compared to what we just heard to what things were like in the Superdome, this is luxurious.",
        "I mean, air conditioning is working.",
        "You know, there's running water, working bathrooms, and people are doing what they can to make it seem as homey as possible, but they are sleeping on some blankets set up on concrete floors with their own little corner of space and trying to have some semblance of normalcy.",
        "It must be getting--beginning to dawn on people that this is--you know, people running on adrenaline obviously dealing with an emergency, but this is going to run for weeks and weeks and months and months.",
        "You know, most people you talk to initially say they're thankful that they made it out and they're thankful that they made it here.",
        "The primary concern is those who left people behind, particularly those who left people behind in New Orleans, and they haven't been able to get through to them, and they haven't been able to hear from them.",
        "I talked to one person yesterday whose grandmother was in the Superdome.",
        "She knew that, as of yesterday, but had no idea if she was ever going to get out of there.",
        "And this is an 82-year-old woman with considerable health problems.",
        "And, you know, beyond that, they are starting to think about how long they're going to have to be here and how long they'll be away from home or if they'll ever be going back.",
        "Some are trying to make plans to go to relatives, either in Texas or other parts of the country.",
        "It's a Herculean task, though, for some people because they barely got out with the clothes on their backs.",
        "Some have a little bit of stuff with them.",
        "A lot of them didn't bring a lot of money, and a lot of them don't have a lot of money to begin with, and they have cars, but, you know, one person I was talking to, their car's been needing repairs and they can't make a cross-country trip right now to stay with some relatives, unless they get their car repaired, and they have no idea how long that might be.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And obviously, if they don't have money, gasoline is both precious and rare, I would think.",
        "It's precious, it's certainly rare around here, you know.",
        "With the widespread power outages, it's certainly--it's coming on gradually in Jackson itself.",
        "But in the outlying areas, there's still large power outages, and that means gasoline pumps won't work so people can't get gasoline.",
        "When a gasoline station gets power and turns on, there are hour and two-hour and three-hour-long lines waiting.",
        "They run out of gas within a few hours and then have to wait a couple of days until they get resupplied.",
        "The amazing thing is that prices, at least what they've been showing on their signs, haven't increased much at all in the last couple of days, still at 49--or 2.59 a gallon.",
        "Well, that's--compared to much of the rest of the country, that's not so bad."

        "There's been an amazing outpouring of support from the people of Jackson itself, and these are people who are without power themselves, who are without, you know, refrigerators and freezers, and they're bringing--the last couple of days, brought their perishables that they knew that they were going to lose anyway here so that they could be used to make meals for the refugees.",
        "They've been going to, you know, the Targets and the Winn-Dixies and that sort of thing to buy bottled water and diapers for the people here, and they are very well-stocked right now, and actually, the lunch line has been going for the last hour and a half or so, and it's still fairly long and those coming away from it seem to be coming away fairly well-fed.",
