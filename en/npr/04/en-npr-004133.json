        "It's very varied, and it varies on the basis of what hazard you're talking about, as well as what state or community you're talking about.",
        "So, for example, we have in this country and we have had for 25 years extraordinarily detailed, comprehensive evacuation plans for evacuations around nuclear power plants.",
        "However, in parts of the country where they don't perceive that they're at risk to, let's say, an earthquake, let's say in Missouri, which, by the way, is the state that's had the largest earthquake in the history of our country; I'll just tell you it started in December of 1811 and ended in February of 1812.",

        "And it broke windows in the White House and changed the course of the Mississippi River.",
