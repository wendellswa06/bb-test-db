        "In 1983, Betsy Thompson was a senior in college, deciding what to do with her life.",
        "Going into the military was not part of her plan.",
        "She wanted to go into health care, but the job market at the time was grim, so she applied for an internship at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C.",
        "And it had to be the happiest day of my life when I got that acceptance letter in April of 1983.",
        "It meant that I would be commissioned as an officer into the Army Medical Specialist Corps.",
        "For her, it was a stable job at an uncertain time, and they were even going to pay her to stay in shape.",
        "But going to war wasn't something she thought a lot about.",
        "You always knew that in the back of your mind you're making this commitment for so many years, they can send you anywhere.",
        "And they will if they need to.",
        "In that respect, though, it was very different than it is today, because young people going into the service, they know what they're getting into.",
        "She ended up staying in the military for 11 years.",
        "In that time, she got married, had a baby and got divorced.",
        "When I got out of the Army, she was just starting kindergarten, so I don't think she remembers too much of me being on active duty.",
        "Do you, Kelly?",
        "What do you remember about that?",
        "I do remember a little bit of her wearing the boots and the uniform, living on post and kind of living in that community."

        "No, not at all.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "It's not a subject that really came up often as she was growing up.",
        "But somehow, Kelly says, Army life became part of her.",
        "Like, she was the parent I grew up with.",
        "And I didn't realize until a little bit later, maybe in high school, how kind of unique that was to have this working single parent kind of raising me while she was in the Army.",
        "I kind of didn't appreciate until later how independent and strong she'd been, and I really kind of admired that and wanted to kind of follow a similar path.",
        "But Kelly understands that her path will be much different than her mom's.",
        "First off: education.",
        "Betsy Thompson went to the University of Maryland, and then enlisted in the Army and trained at a military hospital in the U.S.",
        "Her daughter Kelly is getting trained to be part of the Army's elite.",
        "(Soundbite of crowd chatter)",
        "And the other thing is that there are very different positions even within industries.",
        "You have interesting splits, say, between the auto industry on the one hand and the oil industry on the other hand.",
        "There's a very broad group called the US Climate Action Partnership, which is based in Washington.",
        "And interestingly, represents companies sort of across the industrial spectrum.",
        "I mean, among its members are General Electric and General Motors, both of whom make equipment that is used in activities that produce quite a lot of emissions.",
        "And you might not expect them to support this bill, but they do, and basically the reason is that they figure that like it or not, they're going to get hit with a climate bill, and they better be involved early on in shaping it so that they can shape it to their advantage.",
        "The other thing is that if you look at this bill itself, you see this fascinating sort of matrix of slicing the pie.",
        "So this bill actually names a broad group of constituencies and parses out how much of these pollution permits that the bill would create would be divvied up among these various constituencies.",
        "And this is a big, big economic issue, because these permits are expected to be worth something like perhaps 25 dollars apiece.",
        "These are permits, each of which allows its bearer to emit one ton of carbon dioxide, if this bill is passed, when it takes effect.",
        "And each of these things, if it's worth 25 dollars apiece, will collectively be worth more than 100 billion dollars in the first year of this bill.",
        "And so to the degree that any constituency gets these things, it can either use them to lessen its cost of compliance, or it can actually sell them on the market and make money.",
        "And so this is largely seen as an environmental bill, but fundamentally this is sort of like a tax bill.",
        "It's an economic bill with huge stakes and essentially everyone who uses energy in this economy is at the federal bar trying to maximize his take."

        "One big debate is whether the quote unquote \"\"big polluters\"\" ought to be given a chunk of their pollution permits or whether they ought to have to pay for all of them.",
        "There was a big fight in Europe, which created a system like this a couple of years ago, where there was a sense that large emitting companies got windfall profits.",
        "That is they were given permits for free and still electricity prices rose and their profits rose as well.",
        "There were investigations into that, and that hangs as a specter over this whole discussion in the US.",

        "We are facing four dollar a gallon gasoline at the pump, and we're five months away from a presidential election.",
        "Both of those things ultimately argue against passing a climate bill, and here's why.",
        "First of all, again everyone agrees that on some level passing a climate cap bill is going to increase energy prices, including ultimately increasing gasoline prices at some level.",
        "Now there are many studies that say it won't be too much.",
        "Studies disagree on this, but nevertheless it's not a message that a politician wants to deliver to a consumer today.",
        "Secondly, they particularly don't want to deliver that message as the presidential election heats up.",
        "And it's interesting that all three leading presidential candidates apparently will not be in the Senate today for this debate.",
        "Now they all say that they have reasons not to be there, but it is sort of interesting to note because at some level this climate bill has been a subject of discussion on the campaign trail.",
        "Yeah, I mean, interestingly, John McCain has recently said that he says global warming is real and something needs to be done about it.",
        "Right.",
        "And they all essentially say that, but then when you parse the details, they're all very careful and they've become increasingly careful in recent weeks not to say that anything should be done at all costs.",
        "I mean, I think most of them say that things should be done such that it doesn't kill the economy.",
        "And that's a big caveat, which leaves a lot open to interpretation.",
        "Because look, at the end of the day, in order to win the presidency, any of these candidates is going to need support from states that depend heavily on fossil fuels.",
        "I mean, notably coal states.",
        "And it's pretty clear that depending on how this thing shakes out, coal states are going to get hit harder than other states.",
        "There are provisions in this bill that would seek to address that, to sort of parse out some more largesse as compensation to coal states.",
        "But, you know, this debate largely has been had in this country so far in a very esoteric, general 30,000-foot level.",
        "And I think what we're about to see is this debate get had on a more detailed level.",
        "And when that happens people are going to start to realize that there's not a free lunch here.",
        "And that's not going to be a politically popular realization, probably.",
        "So you expect it not to pass this week, but perhaps after November it might be revived.",
        "Yeah, I think the consensus is that - well, consensus broadly is that it won't pass this year, and it'll be taken up again probably next year and maybe it'll pass next year, maybe the year after that."
