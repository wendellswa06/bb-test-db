        "So there is very much a push for diplomacy, but at the same time, as I have heard, it seems that most of the folks speaking out say Israel has the right to defend itself and in fact should continue to defend itself and this is not too much force at this moment.",
        "So we stand by their ability to do so.",
        "I think it's interesting that from the G-8 Summit there was no call for a ceasefire, which seemed to suggest that even though there are some who have articulated a difference in position with the U.S., nobody is willing to tell Israel to stop or - you know, you can't demand that Hezbollah does because they operate outside of the sovereignty.",
        "But the point is that nobody's wanting to come out and say just flatly, okay, ceasefire.",
