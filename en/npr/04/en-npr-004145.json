        "Well, there's a lot of - the game of whack-a-mole comes to mind when you're looking at North Korea, shell companies and front companies.",
        "But what we saw with Iran is that you just have to keep designating them.",
        "You have to keep identifying them.",
        "And at some point, the costs for North Korea are so high that it becomes just an untenable situation for them.",
        "When you look at this latest set of sanctions, do you see anything in there that says to you, ah, this is going to tackle the shell companies in a way that sanctions up until now have not?",
        "Well, no. I think that it's the - it's unfortunately the reverse because the individuals that are named are North Korean representatives overseas in Russia and China, but their Russian and Chinese counterparts are not named.",
        "That's where U.S.",
        "sanctions are probably going to have to come in.",
        "The United States could name those persons and those companies, and then banks will abide by that.",

        "So, even if you come up with that next hot shoot-‘em-up game, for example, you're still going to competing for that same stagnant market.",

        "Well, I think there is something to that.",
        "I mean, all you have to see is the fact that while we, in a sense, we lumped North Korea, Iran, and Iraq as an axis of evil, but the United States' options when it comes to North Korea, for example, seem to be somewhat limited.",
        "Even though there is a lot of - there seems to be a lot of somewhat evidence that Iran is behind Hezbollah, the United States is not really rattling the sabers towards Iran.",
        "So it suggests that from a rhetorical nature, and also just the fact that we have so many of our forces committed in Iraq right now, that we can't really -and if Afghanistan is becoming a problem once again - we can't pivot around and then try and take on Iran as well.",
        "It suggests that there seems to be they're almost forced to go back towards a rhetorical and a diplomatic approach as opposed to a military one.",

        "But first, just following up with you, Robert, so now you're saying it looks as if Iran is off the table for military action.",
        "But even a couple of months ago, there was a lot of talk and speculation in the newspapers that the U.S.",
        "was looking into some kind of military action against Iran.",
        "You believe that that's a done deal, there's no way now with the current situation that that's going to happen?",

        "I mean, I think we would like a strong position towards Iran, but, I mean, I think you have to sort of in a sense see what the facts are on the ground.",
        "You've got a situation where the Taliban seems to be making some kind of a comeback within Afghanistan.",
        "Even though there is something of a government in Iraq, there's been - there was another huge suicide bombing yesterday as well.",
        "So that is not yet under control.",
        "So unless there seems to be a suggestion that the United States has Iraq under control, trying to then turn around towards the - to deal with Iran in anything more than a multi-country diplomatic approach is - I think it's several months off, several months in the future, if at all.",
        "And, Callie, are we starting to experience as a nation combat fatigue on the voter side?",
        "There - the U.S., even though we almost always talk about Iraq, is actually fighting on two fronts, Afghanistan and Iraq.",
        "And now, potentially we'll get involved diplomatically on a third front.",
        "What - are American people going to burn out?",
        "Oh, they've already burnt out.",
        "And I think, still, the escalation of what's going on in the Middle East has probably - has captured the attention of the nation, I think, in ways that people may in the past have glazed over about.",
        "But, you know, when you start talking about 25,000 Americans trapped, for one thing, that gets some attention.",
        "And then when you start realizing the complexity of the situation, and it's not as simple as just saying, okay, now ya'll stop that, that there really are, as the professor said, you know, four nations involved here.",
        "And by the way, one of them is Iran, so we are really engaged in some way, in a long distance way, with Iran as it is.",
        "And so it comes down to understanding that this is really, though characterized as a regional war, I mean, this is a global problem.",
        "And for the United States, let's just bring two words: gas and North Korea.",
        "I mean, we've got to deal with those escalating gas prices as a result of this battle going on in the Middle East and then we've got to have some allies standing with us with North Korea in that diplomatic kind of conversation.",
        "And we saw - and the vote that was taken, the Americans voted to veto a proposal that would have condemned Israeli's military aggressiveness.",
        "And Japan said, well, no, you know, we're not going along with that.",
        "And we need to Japan in that conversation.",
        "So definitely, it's not just about combat fatigue in some set of psychological way; it's about a practical way, as Robert has said, and its about understanding that diplomacy is really the only way that we can go when we understand that we are a part of the world."
