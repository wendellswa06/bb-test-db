        "You know, technologically nowadays you can do almost anything.",
        "For us it really came out of what Lev described, and that is that the genre of games became too narrow.",
        "And we noticed that people who used to play games had moved onto other things - having kids; you know, being busy with work.",
        "And we needed to figure out something that would make it simply fun for them.",
        "They don't have to invest in, you know, something that is five novels deep.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Something they can just pick up, play really easily and enjoy and put back down and go on with the rest of their lives.",
        "I have to say you've made a strong point.",
        "I didn't grow up with videogames, and then to try to pick up a Madden football game at this point, I don't have time enough to do all that studying.",
        "I don't know - and much less make my fingers work that well.",
        "Well, I think two things have occurred, one, is we continue to be very committed to the gamer, the hardcore gamer, by providing new experiences.",
        "So, there has to be something for them as well so, that they'll stick with it.",
        "As Lev said, it's a really large industry.",
        "too many buttons, can't figure out what to memorize, what to do; the games are really deep and complex; and you say, you know what, I can't do that right now.",
        "I'm not interested in investing 18 hours and that's not really my thing.",
        "So, we developed a controller that really looks like a TV remote.",
        "It's got only a few buttons.",
        "It's based on full-motion in terms of, let's say, you're playing tennis.",
        "You swing your arm back like you would with a racket, and you swing it forward.",
        "And it's very precise, and you can heard the sound and you can feel it.",
        "And, you know, really for once, right now as I'm interviewing, you're talking to someone who has become a player again.",
        "You?",
        "Yourself?",

        "Lev Grossman, I know you've played with The Wii as well, and you liked it, especially for tennis.",
        "I did.",
        "You know, Nintendo with The Wii, they're doing kind of what I'm talking about.",
        "They're certainly taking a huge risk by innovating in a way that they have.",
        "But The Wii controller does two things, one, it puts you physically in the game.",
        "It's very immersive in a way that other controllers haven't been.",
        "You're waving your arms, you're jumping around, and you're kind of acting out the game as you play it.",
        "It's almost impossible not to have a good time while you're doing that.",
        "And I want to add a second point, which is that if you look like you're having a good time - when people play with conventional controllers, their eyes glaze, their thumb is twiddled, their mouth kind of goes a little bit slack.",
        "But when someone's playing with a Wii, they look like they're having a good time, and somebody walking by - a family member, a coworker wants to get in on that and say, hey, let's have a good time together, which is really quite new.",
        "Perrin Kaplan, I wonder, as you're looking at a new way to play games as well as - doesn't that imply you need new kinds of games as well?",
        "For me also, in terms of time management, I'm a Broadway musician, and I just started a political consulting business, so if I think if I have three or four hours to kill, at the end of the day I'd like to say I memorized a piece of music.",
        "I wrote a position paper for my business.",
        "Maybe, I built a piece of cabinetry.",
        "I can't imagine at the end of the day saying, you know what?",
        "I blasted away God knows how many creatures or aliens or enemies or something like that.",
        "You really do.",
        "We do have a lot of really deep games like Zelda, which launched with this system.",
        "That's the first time we've done that.",
        "And that's for people who want that really deep, immersive, emotional experience.",
        "But we have simplified some of the games.",
        "They're deep once you get into them, but for example, let's take the tennis game again.",
        "You can do what's called the Mii character.",
        "You can build a character - let's say I'm going to build Lev, and I happen to know what he looks like, and I can build him, and then I can put him into the game.",
        "With a very weak backhand, I hope.",
        "Well, it would be if I plan on winning.",
        "And then I'd put myself in the game, and we can play against each other.",
        "Then, if I choose to go over to his house, I can take my Mii and M-I-I, which is of me, to his house and put myself into his system and begin to populate it and show up in games there.",
        "And it really - the bottom-line is it's just a hoot.",
        "It's just plain fun, and that's what we're about, and we now have really proven results with our DS Portable System and Brain Age and some other software, and now with The Wii launch as of last weekend, sales are incredibly brisk, and we're finding that we're getting, you know, all the old customers and then a bunch of new ones.",
        "We've got evidence in the last couple of days of 60-year-old grandparents teaching their teenage grandkids how to play.",

        "This is Chris, Chris joining us from Portland, Oregon.",
        "Hello.",
        "Hi.",
        "Hi, I'm first-time caller here, kind of nervous.",
        "But the Nintendo Wii, yeah, it's awesome.",
        "I just got one on Sunday.",
        "And, I guess, the point that I wanted to bring up is you guys were talking about the mass videogame budgets and how's it's disproportionately growing, according to the number of videogamers out there.",
        "And the Nintendo Wii - which I don't know if you've - I don't think you've made this point yet - uses the same API as the software code to communicate with the hardware as the GameCube and a lot of the old hardware of the GameCube.",
        "So, current developers that are coming in to developing can use the code that they've - or old developers - can use the code that they've already developed for the GameCube for use on The Wii, instead of throwing everything away like people have to do with the PS3 and creating on a completely new development budget, which increases the price even more.",
        "Well...",
        "So, by doing that, the developers are able to take risks on extremely innovative games that are not necessarily guaranteed sellers, like Elebits or other quirky games that The Wii already has.",
        "Perrin Kaplan, do you agree with that?",
        "I 100 percent agree.",
        "I always tell people The Wii is a very, very powerful system.",
        "You know, we're not launching rocket ships.",
        "We're just playing videogames, and that's all you really need, and it allows developers to have an entry point that is not so expensive.",
        "You know, we get really creative people out of garages who could even enter to do this if they wanted to - and the top developers."
