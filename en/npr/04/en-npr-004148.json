        "Actually, what I think we're seeing is the industry splitting into different segments.",
        "There is a crisis in what I'd call the hardcore, core-gamer, retail-publisher side of the industry, where as Lev noted costs have risen dramatically, the size of the games has gotten extraordinary.",
        "The games are incredibly complex, and they're not reaching new audiences.",
        "But, at the same time, we are seeing a real boom in entirely new arenas, such as games launched directly onto the Web - what's called digital distribution -new kinds of publishers that bypass the box stores.",
        "You know, grandmothers are not going to walk into the traditional retail game store to look for something.",

        "I mean, one of the phenomena I've seen in the last couple of months is a game called Line Rider which, it's an online game, exists in a Web page and all it is, is a little dude on a sled going down a hill, and you can design the hill by making it sort of curly or straight or making faces out of it.",
        "I assume it exists in Java, it costs nothing to play, and it's massively popular.",
        "And it's true, that is huge new market.",
        "I'm curious as to whether, one, that's something that can be monetized by the industry whether there's money in it or it's just a, you know, sort of hobby thing for the creators.",
        "And, two, you know, whether it's going to push the medium forward artistically in the way that I think a lot of gamers would love to see it go forward.",
        "Raph, do you think so?",
        "I think we're already seeing it.",
        "Certainly, there is big money in casual games.",
        "The portals, as they call them - such as MSN Games, MiniClip, Club Penguin, and so on - are attracting a really broad demographic.",
        "The typical casual game player is actually a housewife in her 30s rather than being kind of the 18-year-old male that we come to expect.",
        "Depends on how you're defining game, though, doesn't it?",
        "Well, here's the thing.",

        "So, it's really a question of whether the games that are appropriate for a given person are available.",
        "And I think what we're seeing in the industry today is an explosion of games that actually target different kinds of people and therefore different kinds of play."
