        "Which game do you play, Stanley?",
        "Right now I'm currently playing World of Warcraft.",
        "World of Warcraft, and there are as I understand millions who play along with you.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "And do you get into it mostly for the - I gather as Lev Grossman has said earlier - the opportunity every once in a while to stick your battleaxe in the back of someone's neck or to hang out with your friends?",
        "Exactly that.",
        "I've got people I've known for the last eight years that I've met online and I've never met them in real person.",
        "But we've grown - we've seen their kids grown up, broken arms, go to the hospital, get better, birthdays, everything.",
        "My granddaughter was born and I held her online and everybody was cheering in this one city when I told them what I was holding at on time.",
        "To me it's a great hobby.",
        "Raph Koster, one of the things we tend to forget - these games are played very much one-on-one.",
        "There's one person sitting there, but certainly the World of Warcraft games - and increasingly console games too - you're playing an environment with other people.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I actually think it's a mistake to think as gamers as solitary people kind of bathing in the glow of the tube.",
        "In practice, the default mode for playing even single player console games is with a bunch of people taking turns on a couch.",
        "Gaming has always been a social activity in the thrall history, right.",
        "And what we're seeing now is the network is really enabling these kind of multiplayer experiences and almost beyond multiplayer."

        "Common activities today in massively multiplayer games include obviously combat and dragon slaying, but also saving villages, building villages, running shops, crafting goods, entire economies, dance troops, bands, weddings.",
        "You name it, somebody's doing it.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I'm sure you've all heard the criticism of gee, it'd be wonderful to have all those bands in that village building right here in the world.",
        "Well, you know, a lot of what a lot of the people who manage to do bands, for example, in the virtual world are people who maybe don't know how to play an instrument in the real world, which actually has a much higher barrier of entry, so to speak.",
        "We've also seen a lot of times skills from the virtual worlds translate out.",
        "So, for example, somebody who becomes the mayor of a virtual town, it's not unusual for them to learn organizational skills which they then turn around and apply to, for example, real-world businesses.",
        "And I've known many people who were, for example, shy or disabled in some way who got over it essentially and were able to go into the real world and really make a difference.",

        "They had a great time.",
        "In fact, our daughters have been trying out all of the sports games since and we're having lots of fun.",
        "So, Lev Grossman, this suggests that there might be a little crossover appeal, though you hear this sort of anecdotal thing I think about every new device that comes out.",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "But, you know, a few years ago a sociologist Robert Putnam wrote a book called Bowling Alone about the demise of community in America, and the big sort of anecdotal lead for that was the decline of the bowling league."
