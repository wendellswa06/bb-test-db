        "And Miers didn't help herself by a poor performance in her visits with senators on Capitol Hill and even failing to properly fill out a questionnaire from the Senate about her positions.",
        "So when it comes to these other issues, I think what the conservatives are hoping is that you get someone who's strongly in their corner, and what Democrats now have to face is the possibility that they go back to having to form a strong line of opposition to this highly conservative candidate who might swing the Supreme Court to the right.",
