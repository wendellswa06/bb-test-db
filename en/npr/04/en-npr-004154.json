        "And, third, and, in many ways, most important, the special reserve fund of $5.6 billion over a 10-year period, to allow for the acquisition of large quantities of countermeasures for addition to the Strategic National Stockpile, and then for distribution and use, under various emergency circumstances."

        "So what have you got in the stockpile at this point?",
        "Well, the major developments from the Project Bioshield acquisitions has been the contracting for a new anthrax vaccine, one made with modern production techniques, and our goal here is to have 75 million doses of this vaccine.",
        "This would--is--the first 25 million doses would be scheduled for some time in the year '06.",
        "That would allow for coverage of the first 25 million doses.",
        "We have in the interim also acquired the five million doses of the existing anthrax vaccine made with an older production technology but one that is approved for use and is used by the military in particular.",
        "And that is already being added to the stockpile incrementally with our purchases, and then we've also made the purchase of a pediatric form of potassium iodine, a special formulation for children to protect against the radiation from radioactive iodine in the event of either a nuclear power plant event or some terrorism event that involved radioactive iodine.",
        "So how--OK, so you got iodine and you've got--or you've got I guess bids out to get anthrax vaccine and you've got iodine.",
        "How do you decide where to put the money and--are those--I mean, is that what we think is the most dangerous threat or is that what you have available to buy?",

        "Right.",
        "But we decide based on the threats and the likely consequences.",
        "At the top of our list are anthrax and smallpox as the two agents that in the hands of terrorists could produce catastrophical loss of life.",
        "And, therefore, we've made a major effort in this development arena to try to ensure that we have the kinds of countermeasures to address them.",
        "In the case of anthrax, we already have in the stockpile well over a billion antibiotics, pills that can be available to help prevent the development of the anthrax symptoms should people be exposed.",
        "But the vaccine that we're acquiring is intended to be a complementary measure to the antibiotics that we already have.",
        "We already also have enough smallpox vaccine for every man, woman and child in the country, but we're moving ahead to acquire a safer version of the smallpox vaccine for those individuals who would be at some risk of taking the current vaccine.",
        "So you've got this materiel--at least in this case you've got the materiel.",
        "Have you got the infrastructure to get it to people who need it?",
        "We have invested substantially through our state and local awards for state and municipal capabilities for the distribution of countermeasures, in particular, for antibiotics.",
        "We have a major project with 21 metropolitan areas called the Cities Readiness Initiative.",
        "That it's designed to strengthen the local infrastructure for rapid delivery, in this case of antibiotics, to large numbers of people, should there be an anthrax event.",
        "In a similar fashion, last year, in promoting broader smallpox vaccination, the states made considerable progress in developing their infrastructure for rapid vaccinations so should they have to deliver smallpox vaccine or sometime in the future anthrax vaccine.",
