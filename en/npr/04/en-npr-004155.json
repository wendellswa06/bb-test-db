        "Yes, part of the materiel that's in the Strategic National Stockpile includes ventilators.",
        "And for the very reason that the caller indicates.",
        "Botulinum toxin is a significant threat.",
        "Even relatively small numbers of people with advanced botulinum poisoning would require intensive respiratory therapy, and very few hospitals would have readily on hand the numbers of such respirators they might need if they had a surge in cases of botulinum poisoning.",
        "So we have been building up in the National Stockpile, and have the capability for rapid delivery, of those kinds of respirators for that very reason.",
        "Well, I was going to say, is the National Stockpile, you know, one warehouse in Ohio, right in the middle, or Kansas, or do you have them scattered around the country?",
        "No, it isn't.",
        "Actually, it exists in several forms.",
        "The basic form is what we call a push package, and those exist in 12 strategically selected locations around the country.",
        "Each push package has enough materiel--drugs and other items, including respirators--to fill the belly of a 747 transport, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which manages this, has developed the capability to get the push package virtually anywhere in the country within 12 hours, and, for many major cities, within four hours.",
        "We think of the push package as a Whitman's Sampler.",
        "It's got a bit of everything that we have in it because we may not know exactly the nature or full scope of the threat at the early stage of an incident.",
        "But in addition, we also have contracts with a number of vendors producing antibiotics, respirators, other medical equipment, where the vendors produce and maintain within their own inventory systems materiel that we own and we can call upon when we know we have a specific need for that materiel.",
        "We call it vendor-managed inventory.",
        "So between these two modalities of these distributed warehouses, plus the stocks held by the vendors themselves, we think we have a robust and a very flexible and very rapidly deployable set of capability.",
        "All right, let's take another call now.",
        "This time let's try Patrick in--Is it Rifle, Colorado?",
        "Did I get that right?",
        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "What's your question?",
        "Well, thanks.",
        "I was wondering--you mentioned that you had a billion anthrax antibiotics in stock.",
        "Are those also maintained in the inventory?",
        "Because I was wondering--basically, my question is: Do they have like any kind of a shelf life that they'd need to be replaced eventually?",
        "Tricky question.",
        "Thanks, Patrick.",
        "No, in fact, that's an excellent question.",
        "Yes, the push packages and the vendor-managed inventory both have antibiotics suitable for the treatment of anthrax in them.",
        "Much of that supply of antibiotics is in what we call unitive use--typically, 20 pills in a bottle--to facilitate the immediate distribution of it as part of the emergency dispensing.",
        "But we have the problem that pharmaceuticals have a shelf life.",
        "And one of the management challenges for the stockpile is to turn over the materiel in a way that ensues that we always have materiel in the stockpile that is within its rated shelf life."

        "That has involved arrangements with the Veterans Administration, and that for some of our pharmaceuticals we're able to procure them in a way that as product begins to approach its expiration date, but still has plenty of time left, we can get it into the medical system, and replace it with new materiel, freshly manufactured, but we then have several years of shelf life.",
        "In addition, we have a special arrangement with the Food and Drug Administration that's called shelf-life extension, which so long as our stockpile warehouses and the manufacturers can demonstrate they have the adequate environmental controls for the product, and have a sampling system that tests the potency of the materiel, we can get authorization to hold that materiel longer than what would be its normally rated shelf life and have it re-labeled and appropriate for use over that longer period of time.",
        "But as you might guess, that has an overhead expense associated with it for the testing and the record-keeping and assuring that materiel available at any time is, in fact, good, safe and appropriate for use.",
        "OK.",
        "We're talking with William Raub.",
        "He's deputy assistant secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness at the Department of Health and Human Services.",
        "I'm Joe Palca and this is TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Let's take another call now and go to Keenan(ph) in Lansing, Michigan.",
        "Keenan, welcome to the program.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes, I was wondering if it would be possible for the government to immunize a large portion of the population by altitude--aerosol, if that's possible at all?",
        "You mean like having a--like a crop duster go over a city and spray some sort of an aerosol that would immunize people?",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, that's creative thinking.",
        "Let me ask Dr. Raub what he thinks about that.",
        "Well, the major technical problem is that in any type of administration of a medicinal, especially a vaccine, the control of the dose is very important, knowing precisely the dose that someone received.",
        "Some vaccines and other medical products can now be administered through aerosol by the individual's control or by a physician's control.",
        "But that only works because in that setting there's precise control of the dosage.",
        "And the current technology, there'd be no way to know for certainty whether enough, not enough or too much exposure in--had occurred in any type of larger area really such as a crop duster.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But it has a--it has an interesting appeal to it.",
        "Certainly, would be painless.",
        "You know?",
        "Indeed, it does."

        "Yeah.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, you know, we'll be on the air for a few more years.",
        "Maybe we'll having you back to talk about that.",
        "I just want--I'm curious, though, you know, you have this five-point--What is it?--5.7--no, you've got a--several billion dollars allocated for--5.6 billion appropriation over 10 years.",
        "Big pharmaceutical companies haven't exactly been beating down your door to supply drugs for this.",
        "Why not?",
        "I think the primary reasons are two.",
        "One is that often we're dealing with either a one-time acquisition or a, by industry standards, very small quantity.",
        "We're--in many cases, the government--and for these agents--is the--essentially the only acquirer and once our stated need is filled, there may be little or no additional need.",
        "Second, the industry--especially, the large industry--has many other opportunities.",
        "They have strong research and development programs.",
        "They have strong marketing programs.",
        "And in areas such as a new pharmaceutical product to treat the symptoms of arthritis, or a new pharmaceutical product to lower blood cholesterol or to control blood pressure or other aspect of the treatment and management of chronic disease, the pharmaceutical industry faces an extraordinary set of opportunities for long-term substantial acquisition of its products, if, indeed, it can produce things that meet FDA's safety and efficacy test and are better than the competition.",
        "So for the industry the opportunities for return on investment, for satisfaction of shareholder interest, is much, much greater in the traditional pharmaceutical sphere than it is in meeting to what are the very narrow and sometimes one-time needs associated with the--with homeland security and with having an adequate supply of countermeasures for bioterrorism agents.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to let that be the final word on this topic.",
        "Dr. Raub, thanks very much for joining us.",
        "Thank you.",

        "And I think the actions of the last couple of days, really from his acceptance speech, is starting to quell the fears of erratic behavior that many people had.",
        "Can I just ask - will part of that difference be taking responsibility for or trying to discourage some of the rhetoric that has made so many people feel so disturbed?",

        "Is there compromise possible here?",
        "Totally and absolutely.",
