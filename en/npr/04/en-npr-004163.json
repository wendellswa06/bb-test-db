        "Thanks very much for the call.",
        "Here's an email that we have from David in Berkeley, California.",
        "Given the information in Mr. Woodward's books and the general acceptance of their accuracy, how does he account for the lack of war outrage from the public to Democratic Party, moderates and the Republican Party and the rest of the media historically this seems to be totally without the president.",
        "Well, to a certain extents the public has grown numb from the war.",
        "It's going on for so long.",
        "It is better and people kind of say, oh well, OK.",
        "It's better, let's take that gain and pocket it.",
        "It is, as a I survey things, we were talking about this earlier...",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "This is the most important thing going on in the world.",
        "This is the destiny of nation being determined by their wars.",
        "And we will be in this one and it is not sure where it's going.",
        "There are other surprises, Iraq has always dealt surprises and it's likely to deal or surprise you with another one, but we don't anticipate in any way.",
        "And it goes back to the Barbara's question.",
        "Some people utterly outraged and feel that this were impeachable offenses or indeed after the administration leaves office or criminal offenses.",
        "It's extremely unlikely, I think, politically this will happen.",
        "Yes.",
        "And remember this was a war of Bush was that one who decided to employ the forces to do this back in 2002 before the war both of House of Representatives in the Senate passed resolutions given the president full authority to use the U.S.",
        "military in Iraq as he deemed both necessary and appropriate.",
        "That was a blank check.",
        "Let's go to Ian.",
        "Ian is with us from Honolulu.",
        "Hi there.",
        "Go ahead please.",
        "I guess, I was just wondering if Mr. Woodward given all the access you've had not just with this book, but with others - if he has the impression that, you know, that the president knows or cares about the rest of the role of being a president, if it's just all - you know his true aspiration and true focus is only been on the commander in chief goal.",
        "And especially looking around to the rest of the - promised that have occurred and the failures that have occurred domestically, is just isn't really even considered that important?"

        "And then, at other times he would tell me, say look I've got other things to do, this isn't the only thing I do.",
        "So, I think he separated himself.",
        "But as they were all saying this war is a war of choice.",
        "He decided on the war.",
        "His legacy is going to be largely determined by this one of the - I've done books and president's going back to Nixon and all presidents learned one...",

        "They will do what you tell him to do or if they don't then, the generals go and you get new generals.",
        "But, a president is not commander in chief of the economy or of other domestic issues can have a tremendous influence on it.",
        "But, it's not as if Wall Street will dance to the tune of the president where the military will.",
        "Thanks very much, Ian.",
        "Thanks.",

        "Nevertheless, you talked about the goals he set for himself upon coming into office.",
        "To unite country, then with the aspect after 9/11 he wanted to transform the Middle East.",
        "He wanted to bring peace to the world.",
        "He wanted to rally America's allies around.",
        "Yet, in many of these respects, it's possible to be less pessimistic about the war in Iraq than a year ago or in certainly two years ago.",
        "Nevertheless, a lot of these other goals are simply not going to be reached.",
        "It'd be better if we were pulling together rather than tearing apart.",
        "It'd be better if we were seeking solutions rather than scapegoats.",

        "I mean, if you're - you know, if you want to blame it on the socialist, Muslim, non-American citizen in the White House, you know, you can get by - I don't know who's proposing death panels - you can get by with that for a while.",
        "But ultimately, people are going to say, what was your solution again?",

        "He took over from Nixon.",
        "He was not elected, had been appointed after Vice President Agnew was on and Ford did a lot to heal the wounds of Watergate and he had, President Ford once told me, said, the lowest day of his life as president was the day when the helicopters left the embassy in Vietnam and the Vietnam war was lost.",
