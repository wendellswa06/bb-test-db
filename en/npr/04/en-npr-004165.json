        "Last night President Obama said the U.S.",
        "will recognize a newly formed Syrian opposition group as Syria's legitimate representative.",
        "Now, this will allow the group to channel international aid money into Syria and also draw plans for a transitional government if the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad does fall.",
        "We reached NPR's Kelly McEvers in Marrakesh, Morocco, where this new opposition group is meeting with international donors.",
        "Kelly, good morning.",
        "Good morning.",
        "So how big a turning point is this, that the United States is now recognizing this new opposition group?",
        "This is a move that was expected, but what it does is it sends a message to the Syrians, I think, that the U.S.",
        "is really serious about bringing down Assad and planning for the future of the country.",
        "What it also does - I mean I think the U.S.",
        "is trying to kind of have a policy now of recognizing the good guys and shunning the bad guys in this fight.",
        "This recognition also came with the designation of one group that's fighting inside Syria as a terrorist organization.",
        "So that's what's on the surface here in Morocco, these sort of public recognitions of the good guys.",
        "As you know, there's always kind of other things going on behind the scenes.",
        "Here the talk is about how Russia might have slightly changed its position in recent days on what to do in Syria and is now probably more willing to push for some kind of transition in Syria.",
        "What people are talking about here is what that transition would look like, how it would happen.",
        "For example, would this new opposition be willing to, you know, negotiate with some members of Assad's regime?",
        "And you know, who would be in the so-called shadow government that would take the regime's place?",
        "OK.",
        "So we're talking about diplomacy.",
        "We're talking about sending messages.",
        "We're talking about political transitions.",
        "But does any of this change the military situation on the ground?",
        "So far, no. There has been no formal shift in the stance of the U.S.",
        "or its allies on providing any more military support for the Syrians fighting on the ground.",
        "And I think what you hear from rebel commanders and fighters is, you know, that military position has to change in order for there to be a transition.",
        "It's not just - it's not as if, if the world powers agree on how Assad should leave power he would just sort of agree to that plan, unless he's pressured militarily.",
        "One thing we have learned.",
        "We just actually returned from Jordan, which is actually America's strongest ally in Syria's neighborhood, and we were able to confirm that Syrian rebels are being trained in the use of sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles."

        "We're told that the rebels are handpicked, secretly brought out of Syria, and we're told the emphasis is on, you know, secular, sort of more professional military defectors as opposed to Islamist militants.",
