        "And there were dozens of al-Qaida operatives whom we caught in Pakistan, but the operation always conducted by Pakistan law enforcement agencies.",
        "Now this has been violated here.",
        "It goes against Pakistan's sovereignty, and also it shows total lack of trust and confidence in our intelligence agencies by the CIA, which is, again, bad.",
