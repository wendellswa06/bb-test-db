        "It is not only the number of seats; it is the political weight that we enjoy because of what we have here in Iraqi Kurdistan.",
        "There's Kurdish self-government, the political environment of Kurdistan, the expertise that we have.",
        "With its powerful security force, Kurdistan has largely escaped the daily terrorism of central and southern Iraq.",

        "And Democrats, as now, favored tax increases more than benefit cuts and Republicans the opposite.",

        "And one thing that is at work here is that neither party wants to be blamed for a failure to reach agreement.",
        "So the Republicans, so far, have not made any public offers that would include significant tax increases.",
        "But it may not be out of the question that privately that's being discussed.",

        "Exactly.",
        "And that's really why privacy is so important, because the real issue here is that elected officials face intense political pressures.",
        "And when they speak publicly, whether it's at a public hearing or in any other public setting, it's very hard for them to move away from their party orthodoxy.",
        "And so it's impossible for Republicans in public to say that they're for tax increases and for Democrats to talk about cutting entitlement programs, generally.",
        "And so that's really why it's essential that this committee actually spend most of its time meeting privately because privately members at least can move a bit away from their party orthodoxy.",
        "Whereas if they were always meeting in public, they would just constantly be posturing politically to satisfy their base.",
        "And you say, in fact, those calling for transparency for public meetings on these issues are, in fact, afraid of success?",
        "I think that's right.",
        "The people who are criticizing this congressional supercommittee are generally people who are on the liberal or conservative end of the spectrum who don't want to see a kind of centrist grand bargain.",
        "And if this committee is to succeed, it would only succeed by coming out with something that's somewhere in the middle.",
        "And would need to get support from both parties.",
        "It's a group of - evenly balanced between Democrats and Republicans.",
        "Again, you need at least one Democrat or one Republican to go along.",
        "That's right.",
        "You need seven out of 12 members to agree in order for the committee's proposals to be placed on a fast track in Congress.",
        "They - if seven of 12 agree, they would - the proposals would go for an up-or-down vote on the floor of Congress, which means that there could be no amendments, no filibustering, none of the tactics which typically delay legislation.",
        "But it means you would need one Republican and one Democrat.",
        "And I think, ultimately, what this will come down to possibly is is there a single Republican who will be willing to support any kind of substantial tax increase.",
        "If not, if the Republicans completely hold the line against tax increases, it's very hard to see how the committee could succeed.",
        "I believe every Republican member of the supercommittee is a signatory to the no tax pledge."
