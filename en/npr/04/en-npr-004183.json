        "And through that process, they often actually manage to reach agreement as the 9/11 Commission did, issuing a unanimous report that called for a big overhaul in the intelligence community, which was quite influential.",

        "That's right.",

        "The members were a mix of Republicans and Democrats.",

        "Over the next 10 years, right, which is actually more than the supercommittee is being asked to do.",
        "And so it wasn't unanimous, but the fact that 11 of 18 agreed was itself fairly remarkable because it - among those 11 were quite a few Republicans and quite a few Democrats and...",

        "Exactly.",

        "And independent commissions often of people who are outside of government, and those people aren't as subject to intense political pressures.",
        "And the Republicans in Congress right now are - many of them, ideologically, are just firmly opposed to raising taxes, and even if they themselves would be willing to consider raising taxes, it's very hard politically for them to do that.",
        "And so that's the biggest problem facing this committee.",

        "I'm a history teacher, and I think there's a historical example that serves us when we talk about this.",
        "If you look at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, it would've been impossible for the bundle of compromises that came out of that to be done in public.",
        "The reason that the members kept the Constitutional Convention secret was because it was the only way they could get away from political pressure and political posturing.",
        "And so what we ended up with was this document that satisfied everybody in some sense, satisfied no one in some senses as well too.",
        "Such as how to manage common functional disabilities like driving and financial problems, later-stage issues like bathing and grooming.",
        "And these are interventions that have been shown to do things like delay the time before someone goes to a nursing home.",

        "The secrecy was absolutely paramount because there was no posturing necessary.",
        "Everybody can say what they wanted in private, in secret.",
        "They could work out all the compromises ahead of time, and there was no pressure on them from the outside.",
        "And I think, you know, I agree with you about transparency is usually the best policy, but in this case, I absolutely agree that it's imperative that it remains secret because it's the only way that these members - these are members of Congress that have to face re-election.",
        "It's the only way that they can possibly negotiate anything is if they're not subjected to those outside influences, those outside pressures.",
        "And somebody might point out that one of those compromises punted 80 years down the road resulted in the Civil War but...",
        "Right.",
        "Well, the agreement may not have been - well, certainly was not perfect.",
        "But that caller is absolutely right, and that's a great historical example where privacy was essential to reach an agreement on very, very difficult issues.",

        "You said you're not terribly optimistic, though, even given privacy.",
        "Right.",
        "I'm not terribly optimistic because of a couple of factors.",
        "One, the fact that, as I mentioned, all the people on this committee are current members of Congress.",
        "And what I found in my research, which I've written up in a book called \"\"Terrorism and National Security Reform,\"\" is that independent commissions tend to be more capable of actually forging bipartisan consensus because of the fact that once people are out of government, people are much more likely to be able to compromise.",
        "I interviewed one person, James Baker, who had been the chair of a number of commissions, former secretary of state, and he said it helps to have has-beens on commissions because they have no political axe to grind, which I think captures that well.",
        "And no political future.",
        "And no political future, but for commissions, that can be good.",
        "But the other factor is just the intense polarization of our political environment today.",
        "It makes it very hard for the committee to succeed."
