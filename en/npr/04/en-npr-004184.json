        "There's good data that shows that chronic stress can lead to cognitive decline, and so greater attention paid to mental health and well being in the life course.",
        "Finally, we have good evidence that people who engage in cognitively engaging lifestyles even after retirement, you know, but continue on with activities they enjoy and engage them, they're less likely over time to develop cognitive decline.",

        "Abraham Lincoln's black stovepipe hat is an icon.",
        "It seemed to enhance his height, emphasize his dignity and, I suppose, keep his head warm.",
        "There's a stovepipe hat at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois soiled and slightly brown with age that Lincoln said to have given it to William Waller, a farmer and political supporter in Jackson County, Illinois, and kept by his family for decades.",
        "But that veracity of that hat's been questioned.",
        "This week, several members of the state panel that oversees the Lincoln Library called for the Illinois State Police to conduct DNA testing of the hat to see if Abraham Lincoln ever really wore it.",
        "William Waller's family had kept the hat, along with the story that Lincoln had given it to the farmer as thanks for his support at one of his famous 1858 debates with Stephen Douglas.",
        "But the Chicago Sun-Times has discovered a 1958 affidavit in which a Waller descendant says Mr. Lincoln gave her father-in-law the hat, quote, \"\"during the Civil War in Washington.\"\" Of course, there was no cellphone camera to record the moment the hat was handed over; no tweet to bleat, look what some Illinois pol gave me instead of a windshield scraper.",
        "Louise Taper, the California collector who donated the hat to the library, says she's untroubled by the discrepancy.",
        "Family stories get muddled and mashed together all the time, she told us.",
        "The hat fits.",
        "It's 7 1/8 - Lincoln's size - and in those days, top hats were custom-made and bears the mark of his Springfield hat maker.",
        "Over the years, every scrap of paper on which Abe Lincoln scribbled is preserved and analyzed.",
        "But when farmer Waller got that hat, be it in Illinois or Washington, D.C., Abe Lincoln was on the edge of failure - losing a senatorial campaign or a civil war - not the kind of fame that got his face carved into mountainsides.",
        "But farmer Waller kept that hat his whole life and passed it on to his son, who was a five-term state legislator who died in 1956.",
        "His second wife sold it to a collector and attached that affidavit.",
        "James Cornelius, the Lincoln Library's curator, told us that calls to test the hat for DNA are not even a bad idea.",
        "DNA tests on a 160-year-old hat would not be conclusive and could harm what is, after all, not a bloody shirt in a murder trial, but an historical artifact.",
        "And the suggestion that the hat be vacuumed for Abe Lincoln's dandruff just made him laugh.",
        "In the end, Lincoln's legend is larger than a size 7 1/8 hat.",

        "How much do you make of this meeting, because two things are different, it seems to me.",

        "So unskilled attendants or unattended births, that is a major problem, and it is causing a lot of complications.",

        "During those three years, two FDA commissioners have come and gone, and now a third nominee is before the Senate.",

        "FDA Spokeswoman Susan Bro says the FDA's latest action on the Plan B over-the-counter request was intentionally timed to coincide with today's hearing.",
        "She says von Eschenbach wants to assure the Senate Health Committee that the matter can be resolved, possibly in the next few weeks.",
        "He felt this was very important - given the divisive issue that this has been - that in order to move his very ambitious and critical agenda for FDA forward, that he provide a framework under which there may be a path forward for this treatment.",
