        "The Democrats aren't fast enough.",

        "But it was a ceremonial meeting.",
        "It was symbolic.",
        "They got it out of the way.",
        "He asked them because it met his needs, and they went because that's what you do when you're invited over there.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well.",
        "But here's my question, though, to follow up on Mary's point, Joe.",
        "From the CBC's perspective, what must they do, what are they able to do to try to push their legislative agenda through the president?",
        "Well, what they can do is first get it through Congress, because whatever they do has to go through the entire Congress before it gets to the White House for his signature.",
        "And clearly - excuse me - clearly, as Congressman Davis pointed out, they have a significant amount of power in the House of Representatives and therefore the entire Congress, much more than they had before with these five committee chairmanships that he mentioned.",
        "There are some - almost 15, I think - subcommittee chairmanships that the caucus members chair.",
        "So this represents a significant degree of political power that other members of the House, the Congress as a whole, and then ultimately the White House will have to deal with if the caucus, that is, becomes a solid cohesive group at least on those issues where all members agree - and not all members of caucus agree on every issue - and therefore can influence legislation.",
        "The legislation that ultimately will have to be signed or vetoed or pocket vetoed by the president.",
        "Nat, let me get you in here and ask you in a follow up also to Mary's point that going is sort of pro forma, would it have been strategically better perhaps to not go?",
        "Oh, absolutely not, Tony.",
        "You've got to go visit with the president.",
        "He is perhaps the lamest of the lame ducks in recent times.",
        "But, you know, you have to, as Congressman Davis suggested.",
        "You know, this is part of the formalities, the business of governance.",
        "You have to do that.",
        "But I think that the - at least two things that struck me about this opportunity, Joe and Mary covered them and I'll cover just one other.",
        "And that is this, that the domestic agenda right now for the president, even his allies are saying that he doesn't really have any energy behind it."

        "So whether or not the Congressional Black Caucus has an agenda might not be as important as the fact that the president himself is lacking the energy to be able to get something done on immigration for example, on energy policy, or on say education, health care.",
        "These issues are important to America.",
        "And to the extent that the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus can lead the country, can help lead this Congress to solve in these issues, the president may very well follow them.",
        "And I guess the other thing is to say this that it's also an illustration.",
        "When you see president come and have the kind of conversation he had yesterday, apparently, and to kind of look, as Mary's talked about - he's out trying to be with other people, talking, you know, doing much more this public relations kind of thing, is an indication of just how badly we are distracted with Iraq.",
        "Well, you know, I guess if the Congressman is correct in his assessment, we won't be talking about Bush and the CBC meeting ever again.",
        "Well, Tony, usually when they have these meetings with people at the White House, whoever it is, if the White House is serious and they've got some serious policy discussion, the White House comes out afterwards with a statement about what was accomplished at the meeting and what they did and so on.",
        "But this was obviously just, you know, it was like, it's Black History Month, and they met with the black caucus.",
        "That's basically…",
        "You're right.",

        "Now, the reaction has been swift and it's been generally positive, but not always and some of it has been very mixed.",

        "This has been all over sports talk radio like crazy.",
        "And this is the second high-profile black man who has voiced anti-gay opinions publicly in the last few months.",
        "And there is a feeling that has been expressed publicly again on talk radio and elsewhere that homophobia is very high, and in fact is higher in the black community than others.",
        "So here's my question to you.",
        "I'll come to you first, Joe.",
        "Is this - homophobia - is this the prejudice that black folks have that no one wants to recognize?",
        "Well, I think a lot of people do recognize it and a lot of people do talk about it, and I certainly hear a lot of comments about - within the black community, about how homophobic the black community is.",
        "And I think there is certainly a high level, what I would consider, you know, too high a level of homophobia, bigotry, within the black community.",
        "If it is in fact higher than in the white community, though, you know, I'm really not sure.",
        "Because when you look at all of the laws and various things and societal pressures that have been put, that have been forced against members of the gay community, things that clearly have a bias against members of the gay community, most of those don't come in a structured and institutional way from black people.",
        "Having said that, I do think that black people - and if that's the topic of our conversation - certainly from my point of view have a level of homophobia, bias, that is really unconscionable, particularly when you consider our history."

        "You know, Mary Frances, some people suggest that this is rooted, this homophobia, if you in fact agree with that characterization of it from our community's standpoint, that the root of some of this is the church.",
        "Absolutely, and the EOC has just done a study that shows that male-on-male harassment of people because they think they're gay is on the rise, all the incidents of people doing stuff, locker-room type stuff and on-the-job kind of stuff, perceiving people are gay.",
        "And this homophobia is reinforced in the church.",
        "And one of the problems is, it interferes with the us not only in the sense that your moral sense it's outraged, but dealing with AIDS, for example, and the HIV crisis, all the homophobia, that's the whole down low thing related to that and black women, you know, getting infected and the like.",
        "So we are killing ourselves.",
        "And if you go to church, as I do, or if you listen to gospel music stations, as I do, you cannot miss sermons that reinforce all of the homophobia about sinners and this and this.",
        "And it happens at the same time we're so dogged on illogical that we all know that if two kinds of people didn't go to church on Sunday, the black church would close - women, black women, and gay men.",
        "If they didn't go, the church would close.",
        "And sometimes it's a choir director and it's the preacher.",
        "And yet this homophobia is persistently and consistently enforced.",

        "I mean, are we going to be able, as a community, work our way through this and come to the other side, so to speak, or we just going to be stuck with this sense of homophobia because it is so connected to Christian beliefs in the black church?",
        "Well, you know, the first thing that comes to mind, from a political standpoint, it is, and it is also moral as well - it is the issue of marriage.",
        "That's where - when we deal with homophobia in one context from just a political and practical standpoint, that's where the church runs into its greatest hurdle, because we have such a strong bias against same sex marriage.",
        "So that's the first thing.",
        "But it terms of coming in contact - I mean the context of homophobia as it has been experience within the black experience, the black American experience, the African experience, there's no question we have made peace with it when it comes to singing in the choir, as Mary pointed out, the musicians.",
        "We know this is a reality within our church experience.",
        "Everybody has recognized gay people for the longest time.",
        "The investigations into the fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes have revealed troubling details about safety.",
        "For example, Boeing was charging extra for a safety feature - one that might've helped the pilots in those flights.",
        "Boeing says it will now make that feature standard.",
        "We wondered whether the same could be true of safety features in cars.",
        "What has been difficult for us to do when you translate that into the political experiences, then to say that the experience that quote \"\"white homosexuals\"\" will have\"\" would be - somehow that they would have the same sort of legal standing as the challenges that black folks were facing.",
        "And so we had to go through that stage of where we didn't agree that it was the same thing, same sex, homosexuals had the same legal challenges as black folks did."
