        "Do you see the kind of regulatory pressure that could make automakers standardize these other safety features that you're talking about?",
        "Certainly not right now, not under this administration.",
        "If I'm an automaker and I've invested a huge amount of money in research and development of a safety technology, why shouldn't I try to recoup some of that money by asking buyers to pay a little extra for their car?",

        "I mean, you look at Toyota, who has all that same technology.",

        "Is there a risk that if you put all of these technologies in place - from automatic breaking to lane change, pedestrian sensor - that drivers start getting lazy?",
        "Well, the key to a lot of the technologies that we are talking about is they're proven to have on-road safety benefits.",
        "So they're out there in the market, and we can see them saving lives.",
        "It's some of the more advanced technologies, where you can truly take your hands off the wheel and your foot off the accelerator and brake - those are the ones that concern us because of the way they're implemented today.",
        "Another technology we'd like to start seeing coming standard in cars is a simple driver monitoring system that can tell whether or not you're actually still driving.",

        "Jane Addams won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1931 - the first American woman to win the prize.",
        "She was a founder of the settlement house movement, which helped care for poor immigrant families when the doors to America were thrown open to the world.",
        "Her Hull House settlement on Chicago's Near West Side served hot meals, brought in doctors and offered music, theater, English classes, inoculations and hot baths."

        "When Jane Addams was called St. Jane in her lifetime, the remark was often steeped in sarcasm.",
