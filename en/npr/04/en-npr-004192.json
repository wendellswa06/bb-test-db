        "Last week, General David Petraeus recommended a withdrawal of at least 21,000 surge troops.",
        "President Bush quickly okayed the move.",
        "The White House had said repeatedly that the surge is working.",
        "And to drive the point home, the president highlighted a new pact between U.S.",

        "Al-Anbar is a region in western Iraq and a former al-Qaida stronghold.",

        "Gaskin.",
        "He heads the 35,000-member Multinational Force-West, which patrols al-Anbar.",
        "Gaskin is also one of the highest-ranking African-Americans in the U.S.",
        "military.",
        "He says that while several thousands of his troops will ship home as part of the drawdown, the peace they've created in al-Anbar will continue.",
        "Major General WALTER E.",
        "GASKIN (Commanding General, Multinational Force-West): What will I see are probably where they came in as a positive surge force with a particular mission, and we were able to accomplish that mission.",
        "It's a part of an ongoing mission to eventually turn that area to the Iraqis so they were placed and plotted the area that they covered by the Iraqi army.",
        "So it would be very good having them aboard and having them being able to do the work up there.",
        "Let's turn to more of the local issues.",
        "There was the assassination of a key ally, Sunni Sheik Sattar Abu Risha.",
        "So how important was the sheik to your efforts and what is his death mean to trying to hold on to the peace or create peace in the region?",
        "Maj.",
        "Gen.",
        "GASKIN: I think as tragic as the death of Sheik Sattar that we have seen nothing that indicates that his movement and the awakening for the Salla Allah Iraq will it fragment or be broken.",
        "What he - what he did for us was he was a galvanizing force.",
        "He motivated the people of Anbar in particular and Iraqis in general to stand up against al-Qaida, reclaim their country that he characterized in an awakening.",
        "His brother, Sheik Ahmed, who is a leader in his own right, will be able to step forward.",
        "I knew Sheik Sattar.",
        "I was motivated and I liked him and - even though like others, I express sincere condolence for his death.",
        "He is a truly a martyr.",
        "And I think his death will cause a number of those who probably on the sense to wake up and see that al-Qaida means them no good and that to the point that they will remove such a national hero from among them.",
        "Al-Qaida in Iraq has carried out some brutal attacks against the local Sunnis.",
        "But are you ever concerned that in your training of the local Sunnis, once you leave, they'll turn against their Shia neighbors and the country will descend into civil war, that you're training people, who might then go and, as part of the intercountry violence, be trained to kill each other?",
        "Maj.",
        "Gen.",
        "GASKIN: Well, you know, the sectarian violence that they talk about is not religious.",
        "It is political.",
        "Sattar's mother was Shia.",
        "There is a growing desire for them to get past the political divide and get on with the economic development.",
        "They are not fighting for me or the coalition forces.",
        "What they are fighting for is their own country.",
        "The idea that they're going to somehow return to that fighting among themselves is ludicrous.",
        "They have a purpose and that purpose is to reclaim their country.",
        "They will make the same mistakes that any developing nation will.",
        "But rest assured that there is no fighting for their country.",
        "They are fighting for the ability to have a country, and without outside influence, as in Iran, or interference as in foreign fighters.",
        "But when the president came to al-Anbar to Iraq, there was some tussling over money.",
        "The local Sunnis were saying, oh, the Shias in Baghdad don't actually want to fund the projects that we're supposed to get rebuilt.",
        "And so how do you deal if you're talking about this as a political and economic wrangle as opposed to a tribal or religious wrangle even then it seems as if there's not always a spirit of cooperation?"

        "That's why - one of the main reasons it was moved from Philadelphia to here.",
        "But what happens, as it always happens with cities, it grows.",
