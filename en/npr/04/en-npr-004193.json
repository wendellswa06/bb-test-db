        "Why wasn't that - why wasn't D.C.",
        "originally part of D.C.",
        "or Maryland?",
        "What was the impetus behind making it its own district?",
        "Well, there was a belief that if it was a part of a state, that state would get so much preferential treatment in terms of federal money, et cetera, that there would be - you know, it would be an imbalance, and it would be unfair, and then there's the question of the Mason-Dixon line, whether the North would have more power, whether the South would have more power.",
        "And the gentleman is talking about retrocession, and Maryland does not want it, D.C.",
        "does not want it, and only people in the far right want it.",
        "That's a very small group itself.",
        "Although it should be said in the history of D.C., part of it used to be carved from Virginia, and that was given back to Virginia 150 years ago now.",

        "We can.",
        "Yes, well - yeah, I grew up in Washington, D.C., and I'm a native, and I've since moved out to Walla Walla, Washington.",
        "And I just like to share a personal experience that I think it's a shame, and it's pretty ridiculous in my mind that I had to move all the way out to Washington State to get the rights that every other American outside of Washington, D.C.",
        "has.",
        "And for all of those who are concerned about what the exact tactic is for how we get representation in the district - both in the Senate and the House - I would just urge you to try and imagine paying your taxes, sending your kids to war like me, signing up for the draft and knowing that when you're growing up no one that you vote for has a vote in all those decisions.",
        "And that regardless of how we do it, it needs to be done.",
        "And so the question needs to be what's the best way and can we move forward?",

        "I - in high school, I became more aware of the inequality and started lobbying.",
        "I remember meeting with Senator Paul Wellstone - a number of students and I from Wilson High School - went and met with Senator Paul Wellstone.",

        "And he said, I think you should be a state.",

        "Not necessarily clear sailing in the Senate.",
        "Yes, the problem in the Senate is the fact that - and this is what I believe, Rebecca.",
        "If you really had a straight-down vote, it would probably pass, maybe 53 to 47 or 54-55.",
        "The problem is is that, and you know this, in order to do anything in the Senate, you have to have 60 votes.",
        "And I don't think advocates of this bill have 60 votes at this time.",
        "I really think they need to talk to moderate Republicans and particularly Orrin Hatch, and if Orrin Hatch gets behind this bill fully…",

        "Do you think that the fact that we are, at the moment, in a war and people are paying attention to military service has helped get this bill a little further along?",

        "So doing it a little bit sooner and then opening up the door for them to do an end-run around the way the founding fathers set it up is not what Orrin Hatch is all about.",
