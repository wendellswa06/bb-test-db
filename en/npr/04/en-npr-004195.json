        "I always say that the post-racial is an ideal, and it's what - we should always be striving toward the ideal.",
        "But in looking at what that ideal is, as I'm looking at this issue myself in my own work, I am deconstructing both of those ideas of a post-racial society and trying to look at the lines of where all of these things are coming together into what is the reality of it.",
        "Can we be post-racial, a completely post-racial society?",

        "Issues of justice are a paramount for them rather than race, which is a great thing for us to be talking about on Martin Luther King's birthday, because I always think about a line from \"\"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\"\": Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.",

        "When I think about the usage of the term, the employment of the term post-racial, you know, I think it really means something else.",
        "I think we saw in the support for Barack Obama and, you know, not discounting his policies and what he represented to some folks versus Senator McCain, but I think there were a large segment of this country that was hopeful that with the election of Barack Obama, that conversations with race would disappear.",
        "I think we're a country that, even as we really have not had the kind of conversations around race that we need to have, we are fatigued by the issue of race, and Barack Obama seemed the best way for us to get past having to deal with race on a daily basis - this idea that once we elected, you know, an African-American president, a president of African descent, you know, then we no longer would have to talk about the kind of impediments that exist in this society because of race."

        "You know, in some ways, even this recent conversation with the Senate leader and his use of the term Negro dialect and the responses to that question, you know, struck me odd, on the one hand, because it's the same thing that the current vice president essentially said two years ago when he described, you know, then-Senator Barack Obama as being well-spoken.",
        "And it's also a critique that has occurred within the context of black communities for a long time in terms of the realities of colorism, the idea that there's a color caste system that has existed within black communities.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "I mean, literally he had to be perfect in his performance of his blackness and in the one way that he performed blackness that was appealing to a large majority of African-Americans but also was not deemed dangerous, you know, to a large number of whites and other folks who weren't African-American.",
        "And within the context of that performance, I mean, he really had to pivot, you know, in a way that made - that his performance had to be perfect.",
        "And if the criteria for the first black president, you know, is this level of perfection, you know, I don't think we'll achieve a post-racial society.",

        "So he has grown up in both of these worlds.",
        "He straddles both of these worlds, and that also - I mean, I was - when I was working on \"\"The House at the End of the Road,\"\" and I was in Alabama, I remember someone saying to me: I'm going to vote for Barack Obama, but I'm going to be voting for the white half, not the black half.",

        "Yeah, that was an opinion from Keli Goff, who joined us last Monday.",
