        "Immediately when he said that, that's what struck me, that, you know, he wasn't necessarily calling Barack Obama a Negro, but his understanding of whatever the technical term is that - the way African-Americans speak, black vernacular English, et cetera, et cetera, you know, was described to him when he was younger as Negro dialect.",
        "But in the context of this discussion, I mean, I'm fortunate in the context of being in the classroom, you know, in a multiracial environment, teaching African-American studies.",
        "You know, so I get to partake in this discussion fairly regularly, you know, amongst African-American students, Latino students, obviously white American students.",
        "So I'm privileged in that regard to have the conversation.",
        "I'm not a jealous.",
        "I'm not Tim Russert.",
        "I'm not a politician.",
        "I don't have any - we don't have an agenda.",
        "Our agenda is to try to be funny.",
        "So why this comment?",
        "And why now?",
        "That's what I'm asking.",
        "But I think we do have this conversation on a fairly regular basis in different places and spaces around the country.",
        "When you talk to the generation of white 30-somethings that really signed on board to Barack Obama's campaign fairly early and tell them, you know - and ask them, you know, what was their kind of introduction to, for instance, race in America, and many of them will tell you that, you know, for them, listening, for instance, black hip-hop artists coming from Compton and the Bronx and other places afforded them an opportunity to eavesdrop on a certain conversation about race in America.",
        "And for them it was just that - it was a conversation.",
        "You know, they felt they had a space to speak back to that if it was amongst themselves but also amongst their white peers, you know, amongst their black and brown peers.",
        "So I think we've had that conversation.",
        "I think very often that conversation gets stunted because what we get in terms of corporate media, around this conversation, is something very different that never really gets to depth in terms of what kind of concerns that folks have across the racial spectrum, you know, things that concern them, things that don't concern them, you know, common ground.",
        "We very rarely have that kind of rich conversation that we see take place in mainstream corporate media.",
        "There were moments during Barack Obama's campaign, you know, for instance after his great race speech, where we had those kind of moments, but for the most part, you know, it's a very superficial language.",
        "We are trying to have that conversation with you all and with our callers here on TALK OF THE NATION this hour.",
        "800-989-8255 is the number to call.",

        "Sure.",
        "I just want to make two quick comments.",
        "I think we will know that we are moving in the right direction towards a post-racial society when you have just as many individuals trying to seek a post-secondary education at a historically black college or university as you do as a majority institution.",
        "And second, I think that since Barack's election, I think that from what we can call conservative, or mainstream, or whatever type of right-wing media that you like to describe it as, I think we've seen more of the almost overt, sometimes, but very direct racist or subliminally racist comments and attitude towards people of color in this country in general - whether it's immigration, or Haiti or whatever the case may be.",
        "It just seems that there's a very sometimes direct, sometimes not-so-direct, subliminal message about how people feel about people of color in this country.",
        "And I'll take my comments off the air, thanks.",
        "Hasan, thanks for your call.",
        "I'm glad he brought up Haiti because, you know, having that conversation because it is, of course, a breaking news story, and we're continuing to get lots of information from Haiti, but it is in the context of Martin Luther King Day, and certainly some of the conversation about what happens with Haitian refugees and how much aid should be sent there has a racial undertone.",
        "You know, Haitians are brown people.",
        "It does have a racial overtone, and I think there are also immigration issues that will be with Haitian refugees.",
        "That also adds fuel to the immigration debate that is going on that has been, I think, part of what you've seen with some of the tea party protestors, as well.",
        "So I think that by - we can't really ignore that racial component, and I think that there is very often in this - you know, most of us who write, you know, kind of in the media establishment, we are both confounded by race, we are quick to cast things in racial terms.",
        "But at the same time, we are also doing things in such a way that it makes it difficult to have a candid conversation about something that may have a racial undertone, very much like what's the debate that could happen with Haitian refugees.",
        "Let's take a call from Melody(ph) in Syracuse.",
        "Melody, welcome to TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Thank you.",
        "I see a post-racial America as beginning, but as one of the gentleman speakers said, I feel it's the younger generation where race doesn't make a difference.",
        "I'm a teacher.",
        "I have an African-American daughter, and to me, the next generation is going to carry it forward.",
        "I also think there's an economic component because even when you get beyond race, you then have the idea of economic justice, and that will be the next big step."

        "It just doesn't matter the way it does to my generation or my parents' generation.",
        "I think they just simply read race differently.",

        "And of course, you know, race doesn't exist in isolation, right?",
        "Race lives alongside, you know, social and class divisions and a range of other things.",
        "So on the one hand, you know, they may respond to traditional imagery that we think of as racist.",

        "King Kong.",
        "Fay Wray, you know, the King Kong imagery, and for them, they don't read that imagery the same way.",
        "I mean, there's lots of reasons, including the fact that, you know, they're bombarded with images in ways that fundamentally we can't even process, you know, so much information.",
        "You know, so information doesn't stick with them the same way.",
        "So they may not be as sensitive to certain kinds of symbols of racism or stereotypes, et cetera, et cetera, but that doesn't mean that they don't read difference.",

        "When I talk to some of my black students at Duke University, they are clearly cognizant of what it means to be a black student at Duke University, right?",
        "That doesn't disappear.",

        "You know, I don't want to live in a society where we don't recognize race and ethnicity, right?",
        "Our value to the world has to deal with our relationship to communities and our individuality, and some of that speaks to heritage.",
        "And that heritage is most prominent when we talk about ethnicity and our race.",
        "Do we get to the point where we recognize that difference and value that difference and value that diversity?",

        "Well, yeah.",
        "It's the difference between being equal and being the same.",
        "I think that is, very much.",
        "And I think the caller also makes a very good point about economics, too, because so often when we're talking about this idea of a post-racial society, we're - and we're thinking very often in terms of African-American progress, but we're thinking of the progress of middle-class African-Americans, and that's often a stand-in for the progress of African-Americans in general.",
        "Right.",
        "And I think that's something that rarely comes into the conversation about what we're saying our post-racial moment is.",
        "And I think that Professor Neal was also talking about something that I believe is where we're going, as I said at the beginning of the program, is a multiracial society, where these differences are - they're valued a lot more than perhaps they are now.",
        "I think there's a sense - as I said, there was two definitions of a post-racial society, one being completely color blind, where there are no differences.",
        "We are all Americans.",
        "That's - we really can't get there, but at least recognizing those differences.",
        "And what, you know, as I said before, will save us, maybe demographics, because that the big shift that's coming about right now.",
        "Well, also, I mean, in addition to the generational questions of being, you know, one or two generations removed from the civil rights movement, there's the increasing mixing and multiracial kids, in addition to a multiracial society.",

        "I mean, they're - I think in the 2000 census, 2.4 percent of people who filled out the census form checked more than one box.",
        "And I think the demographers think that that is going to climb over the years to about 20 percent.",
        "So that's one change.",
        "And, you know, we have both - I think it's New Mexico, Texas and California, where minority groups are now the majority.",
        "So, I think this non-Hispanic white population in several states is, you know, getting close to 60 percent.",
        "So these demographic changes are also going to have a big impact on how our society handles race and - because we're going -we're not going to be able to walk away from it, because it's going to be right there.",
