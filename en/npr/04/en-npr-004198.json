        "Wow.",
        "But also keep in mind that in early history, it was considered unseemly for presidents or presidential candidates to campaign, though they did it through surrogates, of course, which is pretty much what Trump is doing for Republican candidates this year.",
        "Wait.",
        "There was a time when candidates didn't want to campaign?",
        "I like that.",
        "The Reverend Al Sharpton was among the first to call for MSNBC and CBS to fire Imus.",

        "Father Sabrino is a Spanish theologian who was born in the Basque country in Spain.",
        "He moved to El Salvador in 1958, became very synthesized to the plight of the poor and then became a pioneer in this movement to try to put the Catholic Church on the side of movements for justice for the poor that came to be known as liberation theology.",
        "But, actually, this week's document from the Vatican is not a kind of nostalgic return to those old battles over liberation theology.",
        "What actually got Father Sabrino into trouble this time is an entirely new set of issues, having to do with teachings about Jesus Christ, the technical term for which is Christology.",
        "And the Vatican fear that two of Father Sabrino's book on Christology flirt with religious relativism.",
        "That is thing that are teachings about Christ aren't really absolutely true.",
        "They are metaphors and symbols.",
        "Would say - moral relativism.",
        "When it comes to Jesus Christ, would two relativistic an interpretation make him less god-like?",

        "Jesus The Liberator\"\" came out in 1991, \"\"Christ the Liberator\"\" in 1999, so why not?",
        "Well, I mean, first of all, the Vatican is almost by definition always a bit behind the times.",
        "In this case, the investigation of Father Sabrino began in 2001.",
        "That's an important year because in 2001, the very famous Jesuit theologian from Belgium by the name of Jacques Dupuis was disciplined by the Vatican for many of the same issues.",
        "So my point is that there was a climate of thought at that time in which this works by Father Sabrino became targeted and are really has taken six years for the process to crank forward to a conclusion.",
