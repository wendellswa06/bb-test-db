        "Wow, so you're not ready to put these two down yet as just pure coincidence?",
        "Well, there's an interesting twist here, and that twist is actually reflected in some of the observations that are going on right now of 2012 DA14.",
        "And that is a group at MIT is looking for some sign that DA14 will shed fragments.",
        "It turns out that an asteroid like that, an asteroid that's already broken up, if it makes a close enough pass to the Earth, tidal forces will become so strong that they can rip pieces off the asteroid, even rip it in half.",
        "Now, DA14 is not coming quite that close, but it is spinning, and it wouldn't be too surprising if some fragments were shed.",
        "And one can wonder: Could this have happened, say, a century ago, during some former close pass that might have caught up with us?",
        "All right, we're going to go investigate and see and go around the world to see what others might be viewing at this moment.",
