        "So you feel like it's a net positive, actually, that inadvertently - in fact, it's interesting, some of the op-eds suggested - like Kathleen Parker at The Washington Post suggested that actually - that Donald Trump's actually helped Hillary by - he's actually handed her kind of a winning argument.",

        "So it's speeding up as it approaches closest to the Earth.",
        "It'll be moving fastest at the moment of closest approach, and then it'll be climbing out of Earth's gravity well again and slowing down a little bit.",
