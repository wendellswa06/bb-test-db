        "Its orbital diameter is almost exactly the same as the diameter of the Earth.",
        "It's tilted about 10 degrees with respect to the Earth's orbit.",
        "So we only cross paths twice during the orbit, once when it's going from south to north and second when it's going from north to south.",
        "And this - it's usually not the case that the Earth is there at one of the crossing points, but we're there today.",
        "And if we had been, like, 15 minutes off, it would have hit us.",
        "You could say that, yes, but it's not going to hit.",
        "There will certainly be a possibility that in the future it may come around and hit us, it's one of that group of asteroids that is fated either to make a close encounter by the Earth, fly off and hit something else or end its life on our surface.",

        "And it depends on a number of things, including the shape of the asteroid and its rotation, and a number of things that are going to be - for example the Earth could be breaking it up into pieces because of the tidal forces.",
