        "Well, that is absolutely our plan.",
        "Of course it is possible.",
        "There is no law of physics that prevents that.",
        "In fact, it's already been done.",
        "We've been mining asteroids for hundreds of years, in a sense, because the deposits that are left by asteroid impacts are actually the source of our platinum mines on Earth.",
        "And even to go to an asteroid and bring material back, that was actually done by the Japanese HAYABUSA Mission a few years ago.",
        "The real question is economics.",
        "And that's what we're attempting to overcome.",
        "What kind of stuff is on the asteroid that you'd like?",
        "Well, the first thing we would do, and you can read all about this at planetaryresources.com, but would be to go to the asteroids that have volatiles on them, for example water, elements that include carbon and nitrogen, things like methane for example, and to basically turn those materials into fuel and set up, for lack of a better word, gas stations in orbit, in space.",
        "And that will enable not only much reduced cost of deep space exploration for humans, refueling of satellites, things like that, but it will also enable us to bring the materials - the other materials on the asteroid - to a location wherever we want, whether it's the Earth, the moon, Mars, whatever.",
        "And so at that point we would then look to the much heavier metals, in some cases very rare metals, such as the platinum group metals: iridium, osmium, rhodium, et cetera; or more industrial metals such as nickel, cobalt, iron and the like.",
        "How far away - let's talk about the asteroid that came by today.",
        "Could you have jumped on that and what would you do with it?",
        "Would you mine it as it went by?",
        "How far away would you go?",
        "Well, the asteroid that came by today is too - it actually is going quite fast relative to the Earth.",
        "So it would be too hard and too much energy required to go to it and then bring materials back from it.",
        "So we actually are seeking, as resource targets, asteroids that have a much lower velocity difference from the Earth's velocity around the sun.",
        "You'd think of the asteroids that would be great for planetary resources would the ones that are orbiting the sun, co-orbital with the Earth.",
        "So just sort of around us as they orbit the sun, as well, because then the relative difference in velocity would be quite small."

        "Are there any precious metals like gold on these asteroids?",
        "There is, and of course the most precious metals that occur on the asteroids are the platinum group metals, as I mentioned, and really all of the platinum group metals are there.",
        "Platinum group metals, incidentally, do not occur naturally in the Earth's surface, and it's really not a joke what I said before, that the only way we can get platinum on Earth is through these impact sites of, you know, could it be millions or tens of millions of years ago.",
        "But platinum group metals, on average, are basically, you know, $1,600 an ounce or more.",
        "I mean, some of them are 10 times that.",
        "And they're just extremely rare.",
        "The good news is that they are also extremely valuable for industrial processes.",
        "So if we're - you know, one of the negatives some people bring up about asteroid mining is they say, well, that's great, if you bring all this material back, you'll crash the price.",
        "You know, my answer is, well, I can only hope that we bring the price down by a factor of 10 because their usage will go up by a factor of 100.",
        "And we're totally fine with creating a world of abundance like that.",
        "But yeah, that's our plan.",
