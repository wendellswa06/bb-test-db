        "Oh, yeah.",
        "I mean at the University of Strathclyde and the advanced concept team, we're developing technologies and approaches to (unintelligible) asteroids.",
        "This ranges from ablation where you use an intense laser beam to sublimate the surface of the asteroid, (unintelligible) that pushes against the asteroid for deflection; (unintelligible) approaches where you (unintelligible) surface spacecraft or even a nuclear warhead towards the asteroid (unintelligible) distraction.",
        "We've also recently supposed a concept called smart cloud that provides deflection through the release of a high-velocity dense cloud of low-mass small-sized particles, and...",
        "So you send a rocket out to it, and you release a cloud of small particles around it?",
        "Yes.",
        "We would use another spacecraft that would approach the asteroid on a collision course, and this would release a dense cloud of small-sized particles, of millions and millions of (unintelligible) spacecraft on (unintelligible) chip substructures.",
        "And each chip set is passively operated and able to provide local (unintelligible) maneuvering.",
        "And together, that would impact the asteroid (unintelligible) big cloud, and that would impart momentum to deflect the asteroid.",
        "How far away, and how many years away or far away would you have to discover this asteroid before you could do this?",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean at the moment we're using a model based on an asteroid that is eight and a half, nine years in advance.",
        "And it is a long-duration mission because, obviously, you have to fly to the asteroid, rendezvous there, and then release this cloud.",
        "And the cloud itself will be very, very dense with lots and lots of small particles.",
        "At the moment, we're working on simulations where the cloud (unintelligible) 626.5(pn) million particles.",
        "Right.",
        "Each particle is 7.5 milligrams each, and that's developed from work being created in Cornell University.",
        "And the reason it's beneficial is because it provides lots of little impacts of momentum, which is below the deflection limit of asteroids.",
        "You don't get any risk of...",
        "No risk, yeah.",
        "...fragmentation, unwanted fragmentation.",
        "You know, you don't want your asteroids break up into multiple sections.",
        "Not like they do it in the movies.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Another idea you've been looking at is shooting lasers at the asteroid.",
        "How does that work?",
        "Yes.",
        "And so what we would do, we would gain and reduces a small (unintelligible).",
        "And one day, we'll give the approaching asteroids.",
        "And then, we would either use a multiple laser beams or one laser beam, given the size and the composition of the asteroid, to sublimate the surface.",
        "And we're using the laser beam and then lasing(ph) on the surface and super heating the (unintelligible) in it's top form, the surface of the asteroid, directly from a solid to a gas and create a large fume of ejector, only a gaseous, much like a rocket exhaust in the standard methods of rocket propulsion.",
        "And this clear, big fueled-room(ph) reactor, which push against the asteroid.",
        "And slowly nudge it away.",
        "Again, similar to the smart cloud, it is a long duration of laser-glass(ph) method.",
        "So we'd need to know the asteroid's it's going to deflect kind of years in advance.",
        "Years in advance.",
        "So five, 10, 20 years in advance.",
        "Wow.",
        "Well...",
        "It's a very kind of gradual approach deflection.",
