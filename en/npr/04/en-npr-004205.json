        "Thank you.",
        "What is B612 all about?",
        "Well, B612 is a nonprofit foundation that is going to build and operate a space telescope to find these asteroids before - essentially, before they find us.",
        "What we're doing is re-launching a space telescope, an infrared space telescope in 2018.",
        "It's going to track the million or so asteroids in our solar system that threaten Earth and will give Earth decades of warning so that we don't end up in a situation like this, where, you know, you just have a year's warning, and there's nothing you can do.",
        "Because it turns out, with a decade's warning, deflecting asteroids is actually relatively straightforward.",
        "We can do that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And how are we going to pay for that?",
        "We are raising it philanthropically.",
        "We announced our plans just about seven months ago, and it's been going very well.",
        "It turns out that there are people who feel a moral urgency to protect our civilization.",
        "You know, every civilization is the last - they're the caretaker of all civilization up until that point, right?",
        "And there are people who feel like, hey, maybe it's worth it to spend, you know, an amount of money that's roughly equivalent to building a wing of an art museum, instead to give the Earth early warning of the next asteroid impact.",
        "And so you put a satellite into orbit that will look out...",
        "Around the sun.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Around the sun.",
        "Orbiting around the sun.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We're launching mid-2018, July of 2018, on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.",
        "Our space telescope is about 24 feet tall.",
        "It's about 2,260 pounds.",
        "It is a 50-centimeter optics, focal length - excuse me, 50-centimeter diameter main mirror with a infrared, heat-sensing imager.",
        "And from its position - well, it's going to end up orbiting the sun near Venus and looking outwards.",
        "So how many asteroids can you see once - or when - is it going to sweep around?",
        "How many asteroids in each sweep will it make?",
        "War and peace is it.",
        "And here is your last one: chum and chart."

        "I did.",
        "What is that - it is actually going to sweep around.",
        "But it will - the better way to think about this is that we'll discover, on average, about 10,000 new asteroids each month.",
        "So let's put that in perspective.",
        "All other telescopes that we've ever built, combined over the last 30 years, have discovered about 10,000.",
        "So we'll do that every, you know, every few weeks.",
        "So it will be, you know, roughly 100 times more effective than all other telescopes combined.",
        "It's going to basically do the job we need to do in order to give our society the warning we need, such that we can easily deflect an asteroid.",
        "And how much warning would that be?",
        "And how would we - if we had the warning, what would we use to deflect it?",
        "Well, you need - you basically need decades of warning.",
        "And that's because you need decades in order to get something out - you need, generally, years in order to get something out to where you're - to where an asteroid happens to be, right?",
        "You don't get to choose the spot where it is.",
        "So you need a good launch opportunity.",
        "And then you need time for whatever you do to take effect.",
        "So consider - these things are going around the sun, just like the Earth is going around the sun.",
        "And what we're talking about is finding them, you know, 30, 40, 50 orbits around the sun before they hit the Earth.",
        "And that means you only need to change their velocity by a tiny, tiny, tiny amount, something like a millimeter per second.",
        "So if you look down on the ground and see an ant walking, that's about the speed change you need to give to an asteroid to make it miss, if you do it that far in advance.",
        "Well, I would think that since everybody - we saw the meteorites - the meteor that struck Russia today and a close passage of this asteroid today, I would think every nation would be interested in chipping in on a project like this.",
        "Well, you know, nations sometimes don't do things so quickly or, you know, when there isn't sort of money in somebody's district, or something like that.",
        "Sometimes those things don't happen so quickly.",
        "So we at B612 Foundation realize that, hey, we could, you know, try and get the governments to do the right thing.",
        "We can try and get them to think about things off in the future.",
        "We can try and get them to understand probabilities, and so on.",
        "Or we could just do it.",
        "And we took the second tax.",
        "We are a nonprofit based in Silicon Valley, and we realized that there were enough people who could sit down and think about this for a little while and who would appreciate that, you know, that the simple sound bite is - you know, they have the patience to listen through more than just the sound bite, and that they realized, hey, this really is important.",
        "And, you know, so that's how we decide to do it.",
        "We built - we put together what's essentially the world's finest spacecraft team.",
        "And we are actually - and NASA is actually a junior partner.",
        "They're actually helping us, but we're doing it ourselves, essentially.",
        "Where does the name B612 come from?",
        "It comes from the home of the Little Prince, from the famous book by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.",
        "The Little Prince lived on an asteroid called B612."

        "Very simple, something everybody's read, something everybody can relate to.",
