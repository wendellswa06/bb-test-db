        "And I've even observed one, you know, catching them.",
        "So in an urban area, these large birds seem to be adapting their feeding habits, much like the little cattle egrets, which are a pasture bird, have done the same thing.",
        "Huh, what do you think of that?",
        "Well, that is a first for me because I was thinking, as he was telling the story, that it probably was a cattle egret, because we've seen them do that.",
        "They're called cattle egrets, of course, because they follow behind cows and kick up whatever insects or lizards or whatever follow the cows.",
        "And so as the listener said, they came into the urban areas first and started taking advantage of whatever food we had in that area.",

        "They're big birds.",
        "They have gorgeous colors on them.",
        "And then they have real strange long tails or wild feathers.",
        "And they can create some of the strangest postures you've ever seen.",
        "So I've been able to see them on David Attenborough's nature shows, but I want to see them out in the wild.",
        "And they display to the females in a group.",
        "And so they make wild calls and these wild displays.",
        "And when I was down in Mindo, I saw these little miniature birds of paradise.",
        "They're called - oh, and they're (unintelligible) as well.",

        "Wow.",
        "So we can still use our backyard birdseed feeders to watch for birds too, could we not?",
        "Oh, it's a great time for feeding birds because the cold and the snow really brings them into the birdfeeders, and just unbelievable surprises can come into feeders.",
        "A lot of people are feeding hummingbirds in the wintertime, and now along the Gulf of Mexico a number of these hummingbirds are wintering where they used to just stop off on migration.",
