        "Well, yeah.",
        "I think it is.",
        "I think it's his very first one and it's very important for a number of reasons.",
        "He has to first and foremost look presidential.",
        "We've been seeing him try to do this a little bit more and more on the campaign trail in recent weeks and months.",
        "But you know, there's only so much you can do when you're out on the campaign trail, and he has to show that he has a firm grasp of some of these issues.",
        "You know, the economy, obviously, first and foremost among them, because his campaign themes have all been about hope and change, and the number-one overriding issue to voters was the economy.",
        "So, he has to go beyond those slogans and show that he's in the process of taking some action, even though he and his economic advisers really don't have the power to do much yet.",
        "I suspect there will be a lot of questions about possible cabinet choices, the tenor and tone he is trying to set with those choices.",
        "He'll be grilled on foreign affairs, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, I'm sure.",
        "So, he needs to show the American people that he's well-versed in all of these issues and instill confidence that they made the right choice on Tuesday.",
        "But this is his first public moment since that really stirring speech in Grant Park on Tuesday night.",
        "Do you have any idea from his people about what it is he wants to say?",
        "Does he have a message he wants to get out here?",
        "I think, number one, the message is that he wants to show that he is on top of the economy.",
        "And there's economic news today that is not good news.",
        "The unemployment rate jumping from 6.1 percent in September to 6.5 percent in October.",
        "I think you're going to hear a theme about the need to put the middle class at the center of the economic policy that comes out of an Obama administration.",
        "Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under President Clinton, is one the 17 economic advisers who's meeting with President-elect Obama today.",
        "And he said so this morning that he wants to put the middle class at the center of the economic-policy approach that comes out of this administration.",
        "So, I would expect Mr. Obama to elaborate on that and echo those points.",
        "I don't think we're going to get any big news on any major cabinet appointments.",
        "No personal news is expected today, but his cabinet is starting to take a little bit of shape.",
        "It looks much like what we saw in the Clinton White House, too.",
        "Let me ask you about this meeting with the economic advisers.",
        "Warren Buffet there, I think, by maybe video phone or something and 16 other members of this Transition Economic Advisory Board.",
        "What went on there?",
        "This was a closed-door meeting.",
        "Do we have any idea exactly what people are talking about?",
        "I think that they're all kind of weighing in on some of the issues that are most pressing on them.",
        "These are all people who I know that the Obama campaign relied on for advice at times.",
        "Now, they have to shape a policy, and I think that they're lending their views of where the direct administration should go and, first and foremost, how to pick up the $700 billion financial-rescue package from the Bush administration and carry it on in the Treasury Department moving forward.",
        "I'm sure there will be names bandied about (ph) about who should direct this effort as Treasury secretary, but I don't know that we'll have any firm answers on the full shape of that direction, where they go with the policy and ultimately who will lead the Treasury Department under President Obama.",
        "NPR's David Schaper with us from Chicago, where later today President-elect Barack Obama will hold his first press conference as president-elect.",
        "David, thank you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "This is News & Notes.",
        "I'm Farai Chideya.",
        "It ranged from fiery outrage to middle-of-the-road ambivalence.",
        "We are talking about your overwhelming reaction to The New Yorker magazine cover depicting Barack and Michelle Obama.",
        "We received 10 times the usual response to our post about that controversy.",
        "And here to tell us about it is Geoffrey Bennett, he's the web producer for News & Notes.",

        "I'm doing well, Farai, how are you?",
        "So for those who haven't seen it, the July 21st issue of The New Yorker shows a cartoon depiction of Barack Obama wearing a turban, robe and sandals.",
        "Michelle has got an afro, combat boots, a gun.",
        "An American flag burns in the fireplace, and that's just for starters.",
        "Both of the Obama and McCain campaigns have called it offensive.",
        "So summarize the reaction on the blog.",
        "Well most of the 130-plus people who've commented on our blog already say the magazine missed the mark.",
        "People like Jasmine Santi(ph) wrote, \"\"I understand the satirical intent, but the execution is extremely poor.",
        "And when you get a bad cartoon that skates on the edge of offensive, you give up on satire.",
        "And there's this from Terry (ph) who wrote, \"\"someone finally had the courage to paint a true picture of what we can expect from Obama.\"\" Apparently he's not an Obama supporter.",
        "And this from Paul Brooke (ph).",
        "People should get over it, laughing in the face of fear is our best weapon against ignorance, and laughing at our own fear is really a lot more effective than laughing at the opposition's.",
        "So here's what Obama had to say about the New York cover - The New Yorker cover last night on CNN's \"\"Larry King Live.",
        "Well, I know it was The New Yorker's attempt at satire.",
        "I don't think they were entirely successful with it, but you know what, it's a cartoon, Larry.",
        "I do think that, you know, in attempting to satirize something they probably fuelled some misconceptions about me instead.",
        "But, you know, that was their editorial judgment, and as I said, ultimately it's a cartoon.",
        "It's not where the American people are spending a lot of their time thinking about it.",
        "Also last week's big story on our blog was the faux pas by Jesse Jackson who was caught dissing Barack Obama on a microphone that Jackson thought was turned off.",
        "What's the latest news online there?",
        "Well if you remember when Fox News aired the clip, Bill O'Reilly said there was more that wasn't aired that was, quote, \"\"more damaging than what was heard\"\".",
        "So yesterday, several left-leaning blogs picked up that East Coast radio host James Entoumay (ph) reported that Jackson had called Obama the \"\"N\"\" word and called him a half-breed among other things.",
        "But late yesterday, the blog TV Newser reported that Fox News shot down that rumor and said that Jackson said no such thing and that they weren't going to air any more of the tape anytime soon.",
        "Anytime soon I guess being the operative phrase.",
        "So who knows when and where this rest of the tape could turn up.",

        "And some of the sort of social media dialogue that I've seen around that sort of suggests that yes, she's a woman but her life is kind of atypical.",
        "She doesn't necessarily represent the template that a lot of young - a life that a lot of younger people see for themselves.",
        "And in fact, remember one of her surrogates, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, got into some hot water when she said that there's a special place in hell for women who don't support other women.",

        "So I don't know, how do...",
        "Yeah,",
        "...You respond to it?",
        "Yes, but a lot of millennials I think don't see themselves in Donald Trump's experience either.",
        "It's even harder to connect to.",

        "And he can't win on that, right?",
        "Well, you know, it's interesting because Dana Milbank, your colleague, wrote a very interesting piece about this, where he suggested that this was not actually just a mistake, that this was actually intended to spark kind of a gender backlash to appeal to people - to remind people that a lot of men feel that - well, to quote his piece, it says \"\"white men used to run everything.",
        "And now we don't and it's terrible.\"\" And \"\"we were focusing on the white part before, and now we're focusing on the men part.",
        "And he's quoting another analyst who has done some to research on this.",
        "So Karlyn, I have to ask you net positive, net negative do you think that Trump sort of tapped into something that for a lot of people's is obviously very visceral?",
        "I'm not sure because I think you have in most polls about 5 to 7 percent saying they wouldn't vote for a woman for president.",
        "And of course, we don't know the other side of that coin - the number of people who are willing to vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a woman.",
        "So it's hard to know whether those two things cancel out.",
        "But there's a larger point, and I'm wondering as I look ahead to the November election whether or not party will trump these gender concerns because people are very loyal to their parties in the final analysis when they go into the voting booth.",
        "And well, these issues will get an enormous amount of attention.",
        "Whether you're a Democrat or Republican I think is really going to be most important.",
        "Minority millennials last time voted overwhelmingly for Obama, whereas white millennials voted for Romney.",
        "So there's some really interesting cleavages here, including white millennial women, but only by a single percentage point.",
