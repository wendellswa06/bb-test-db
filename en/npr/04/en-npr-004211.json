        "Keeping men and women in different occupations and industries is a big part of why the gender gap exists.",

        "So - well, I'm not a fan of the draft.",
        "So, you know, like many Americans, no one wants to see that reinstated.",
        "But the fact is many women actually join the military because it helps their sort of economic stability.",
        "So I think this is going to be an interesting dialogue that happens in the country around, you know, whether it's - should we reinstate the draft, you know, how that impacts people's economic bottom lines and then to her point, you know, how does this impact the sort of pay gap overall.",

        "It has to do with this whole thing about being called out for diva attitude or bossiness.",
        "You all have heard this when the daytime TV duo Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan - Michael Strahan's been offered another job at \"\"Good Morning America.\"\" Kelly Ripa says she found out just before airtime and took a couple of days off.",
        "And now people say oh, she's having a meltdown.",
        "And a lot of people are saying that that's sexist.",
        "And I just want to ask - does anybody want to weigh in on that?",
        "Tracy?",
        "Yeah, I think it's fascinating when women advocate for themselves in the workforce that they are deemed a diva.",
        "You know, the same thing happened with Melissa Harris-Perry at MSNBC.",
        "But if you think about Conan O'Brien or David Letterman when they were having their back and forth with NBC, the media did not paint them as divas.",
        "And in fact, they ended up with better deals on the back end.",
        "So it's just another place where workplace policies or the culture in these workplaces are challenging for women."

        "Hello.",

        "What's it been like?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, there were protesters both inside and outside the venue in downtown Kansas City, Mo., where Trump held a rally, and mostly peaceful - there were a couple of arrests - but once the rally got going inside, there were almost constant disruptions for the first 20 minutes or so, and more after that.",
        "You know, people standing up, holding signs opposing Trump, chanting, some booing, and then of course the crowd would respond.",
        "Trump seemed angry and kept taunting the protesters, yelling get them out or go home to mommy, things he often says to protesters at these rallies.",
        "He did tell his supporters not to hurt anyone, said he doesn't condone violence.",
        "But then, Michel, as you point out, this morning on NBC's \"\"Meet The Press\"\" Trump said he is considering paying the legal fees of a man who is charged with punching a protester at another rally in North Carolina a few days ago.",
        "Now a reminder, that man was quoted as saying that next time, we might have to kill the protester.",
        "There have been some more protests today, nothing as dramatic as that though.",
        "And Trump's opponents are criticizing him hard for this, saying he is responsible for the atmosphere he creates at his rallies.",
        "So what does Donald Trump say to that, that he has created this environment?",
        "Well, he says it's not his fault, it's the protesters.",
        "Last night, he expressed a kind of bewilderment at why people think that his supporters are violent.",
        "He says we're peaceful.",
        "We just want to make America great again.",
        "It's the protesters that are the problem.",

        "It's hard to say how he'll be affected by the events of this weekend.",
        "We're certainly seeing strong support at his rallies, but of course a lot of protests, too.",
        "He's up against John Kasich in Ohio, which is a winner-take-all state that votes on Tuesday, and Gov.",
        "Kasich seems to be gaining some steam, maybe pulling ahead in some polls.",
        "The biggest prize, though, on Tuesday is Florida.",
        "That is the home state of Marco Rubio, who's been campaigning here all weekend.",
        "Polls do continue to suggest that Trump is ahead by about 20 points.",
        "But besides those big winner-take-all primaries in Ohio and Florida, do Trump's opponents think that they can make headway anywhere else?",
        "Well, Texas Sen.",
        "Ted Cruz has been campaigning in Florida and Ohio, but he is focusing a lot of time on other states that vote Tuesday - Missouri, Illinois, North Carolina.",
        "And he has been pointing out that he has the second-highest number of delegates and making it the case to voters who might be uncomfortable with Trump that he's the only one who can beat Trump.",
        "That's NPR's Sarah McCammon on the campaign trail in Boca Raton, Fla.",
        "Sarah, thank you."

        "We've lost this basic understanding that we are the ultimate victims of the 20th century.",
        "We are the ultimate victims of Europe.",

        "My great grandfather was a self-made, very successful British-Jewish lawyer, and the question I asked myself at the beginning of the book is why would such a person who had it going so well for himself in London, which was the capital of the world at the time, why would he go to desolate, remote Palestine?",

        "It's in a form called yellowcake.",
        "It's kind of a yellow powder.",
        "And they introduced it into the plant, so it's the very first start of the process.",
        "And that process goes through a series of chemical steps to making what's called uranium tetrafluoride and then finally making uranium hexafluoride, which is the material that you put into the gas centrifuges if you're going to enrich uranium.",
        "Now other parts of this plant, though, are under IAEA seal.",
        "Isn't that right?",
        "That's correct.",
        "And so they took off the seals in the first part today, and they intend to take off the seals in the next part, as the need arises."

        "Well, one thing that this meeting will probably do is consider sending the issue of Iran and its past violation of the non-proliferation treaty to the Security Council.",
        "But if Iran is unwilling to continue its suspension at Isfahan, if it just thumbs its nose at the European deal, then the Europeans have no choice but to join with the United States and try to move this issue to the Security Council to impress upon Iran that it's a serious issue and that fuel cycle activities in the Middle East, particularly in Iran, which has cheated in the past, are just too dangerous.",
        "And if it does go to the Security Council, that could mean sanctions against Iran, I suppose.",
        "It's possible.",
        "I mean, the first steps would be more political in nature, but at a level where it's viewed as a more serious issue where the consequences of not doing it could be more sever for Iran.",
        "And in the longer term, those could be sanctions.",
