        "So, these dire circumstances are happening in different parts of the world - Central America, China, Europe.",
        "And this had been known, as you say, from these records and scientists set up to look for these physical clues.",
        "How did they do that?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that's an interesting point, because with any historical account there's always the worry that perhaps people were maybe exaggerating things.",
        "So, what the scientists really needed was kind of an impartial witness just to double-check that things were as bad as they seemed.",
        "And they found that using a technique that involves looking at the rings in dead trees.",
        "And when you look at these tree rings from the mid-sixth century, you find that around this time the tree rings are really very narrowly spaced, which really does suggest that conditions were as bad as these early scholars were suggesting.",
        "And that's not just in one isolated area.",
        "Everywhere, they found this same pattern.",
        "So, this is worldwide prolonged winter period really when conditions were very cold and nothing was growing.",
        "So, as they're carbon dating tree rings from around the world, they think, well, there has to be an explanation for this.",
        "And the likely candidate is what?",
        "Well, there are two potential candidates really here.",
        "One obvious cause of environmental catastrophes of this kind of nature is major volcanic eruptions.",
        "We know that these eruptions can have that kind of effect.",
        "A very famous eruption in the early 19th century led to a year without a summer.",
        "So, another possibility is Haley's Comet.",
        "Could you lay out the case for that explanation?",
        "Right.",
        "Now, that's a really interesting one, 'cause obviously when you think of comet, the only comet that really everyone's heard of is Haley's, or Haley's ,Comet.",
        "And we know that the comet passed by Earth around the year 536 - just a few years previously.",
        "And luckily for us, the Chinese were making the very precise historical record.",
        "And they reported that Haley's Comet was quite a lot brighter than normal.",
        "And perhaps that reflects the fact that Haley's Comet may have been passing a bit closer to the sun during this passing through the inner solar system than normal.",
        "And it have done, it may have released more material.",
        "And if that material then rained down on Earth, then it's possible that that could be responsible for this cooling period.",
        "And as things stand right now, it looks suspiciously like both theories may actually be correct.",
        "Both of these camps have been pursuing their lines of inquiry now for a few years.",
        "And they seem to be coming up trumps in both spheres.",
        "Colin Barras.",

        "Stable, but understandably tense.",
        "The night of the 15th and the morning of the 16th there was heavy fighting going on downtown.",

        "It continued throughout the night and then it died down the next morning.",

        "He's a Muslim cleric living in exile here in the United States.",
        "He has categorically denied that he was behind this.",
        "These two men were allies at one point, but now obviously enemies, bad blood between them.",
        "What's the story there?",
        "It's a very long story.",
        "And the bad blood stretches back to the end of 2014, when prosecutors believed to be followers of Gulen began a series of investigations against a number of ministers in the Erdogan government and then subsequently, a week later, against members of Erdogan's family and others associated with them.",
        "Everyone immediately branded that a coup and from then on has been making a point of naming the Gulen movement for still engaging in plotting against his government, and culminating with the blame that he has laid at the door of Gulen and his followers for the coup attempt.",
        "Turkey has asked the U.S.",
        "to extradite Gulen.",
        "Any chance you think that that would happen?",
        "Well, it depends on the way that the U.S.",
        "government judge the seriousness of the allegations.",
        "And Gulen happens to be a permanent resident, so it has to be judged sufficient.",
        "But it has to be stressed that President Erdogan says the coup - has made a point of underlining his desire for the extradition of Gulen and appealed personally to President Obama, and said that he'd raised this personally with President Obama in the past."
