        "OK.",
        "Bob Woodson, you are against eminent domain, is my understanding, but we should note that this is an issue that has been on the books for quite a long time.",
        "Why are you against the Supreme Court ruling?",
        "Well, because I think it's proper to use it to remove blight or to serve some public interest such as a highway, but in Washington, DC, and other cities throughout the history of this country, it is used--have a devastating effect on, particularly, low-income and black communities.",

        "The concern is, as Bob Woodson suggests, that there are and will be a disproportionate amount of poor affected with this ruling.",
        "Well, I think the irony is that though the abuses that Bob Woodson talked about are very much a reality and part of our history and a shameful part of our history, at the same time, through the efforts of Bob Woodson and others, there's been a real effort in the last 20 years to rethink how we do community economic development.",
        "And the major reform has involved including low-income persons in the planning of their own revitalization.",
        "And it'd be a terrible irony if, at a time when for the first time low-income communities are real partners in the planning process, we deprive cities of a major tool for implementing the plans they come up with.",
        "In the city that I live next to, Boston, the Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative, which is a group of low-income persons in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Boston, actually begged the city in the late 1980s to give them the power of eminent domain so they could use it to implement their plans for revitalization.",
        "The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative got that power and, through that, have been able to--with the partnering of low-income people themselves--come up with one of the most innovative plans for revitalization anywhere in the country.",
        "A ruling by the Supreme Court that went the other way would have precluded low-income persons from exercising that kind of control over their own neighborhoods.",
        "So I think as a constitutional matter, it was clearly the right decision.",
        "The question then is, politically, how do we make sure that planning exercises are more like what happened in Dudley Street in Boston and less like the kind of abuses that Bob Woodson's talking about that occurred early in our nation's history.",
        "Well, right now in Washington we have--the poor people have never been welcome to the table to participate in any of the planning, such as the baseball field that's going to be built.",
        "When they're going to condemn hundreds of homes in Anacostia, low-income blacks in that area are saying right now, `We don't want it,' but their views are ignored because politicians and public officials who they fund have all of the power, as they've always had, and so what makes you think that suddenly they're going to be concerned about the interests of poor people and involve them in the planning process?",
        "So, Bob, your concern is that this ruling will allow the rich to get richer and will have absolutely no cake for the poor.",
        "Yeah, I mean, when they can say a--that a family who's making $25,000 a year and owns a home--right now the cities can then take that home and give it to someone who makes $100,000 because they'll pay more taxes.",
