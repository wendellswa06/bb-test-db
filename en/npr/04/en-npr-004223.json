        "This unit was put together to, in fact, find and hunt for Osama bin Laden.",
        "There's growing concern within the CIA that this unit had become a rebel unit, and the zeal for capturing bin Laden took on a cult-like atmosphere, it's said, by some.",
        "The CIA is suggesting - whispers behind closed doors - that this move reflects that bin Laden is no longer the same kind of threat, but that the power has been shifting.",
        "So, while the unit has disbanded, the hunt for al-Qaeda leaders has not, Michael Meyers, according to some in the CIA.",
        "Well, symbolically, how do you do this?",
        "How do you shut the unit that is pursuing public enemy number one in the eyes of the United States and lots of members of the civilized world?",
        "Reading between the lines suggests, to me at least, that there is a conspiracy - that the CIA already knows where Osama bin Laden is to be found.",

        "But, if not so, then…",

        "Gravely is right.",
