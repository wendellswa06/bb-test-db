        "So what's happened over the last ten to 15 years is the number of these local, onsite rescue teams has really dwindled, and more and more companies are contracting this out to fewer and fewer rescue stations--in both the coal industry--and the United Mine Workers have been saying, since at least 1995, that this is really crisis.",
        "And something needs to be done to provide more of these teams throughout the coalfields.",

        "It took more than 40 hours to get a rescue team to them.",
        "Is that due to their situation in travel and notification, or difficulties onsite?",
        "The entire answer to that won't be completely clear until the investigation is done.",
        "But what is clear is that it did take a number of hours, both for International Coal Group, which operates the Sago Mine, to actually call in anyone to help them--to call the state and federal regulators, to notify them of this accident.",
        "And it took several hours after that for rescue teams and regulators to actually arrive onsite to begin this.",
        "But they also were delayed by the conditions in the mine.",
        "But certainly, there's no question that if they had had their own rescue team, they would have been there faster.",
        "And, in fact, that company, International Coal Group, has its own rescue team at another one of its mines, the Viper Mine in Illinois.",
        "How much would it cost to have a rescue team really close to each coalmine in West Virginia?",
        "The numbers that the industry has cited during public hearings on this is around 200, $250,000 a year.",
        "And where would that money come from?",
        "Congress, when it passed the 1969 Coalmine Health and Safety Act, Congress declared that the cost of these teams must come from the industry."
