        "When the numbers reached about this high in 1924, the president and Congress changed the policy.",
        "And it slowed down immigration significantly.",
        "And we then assimilated through to 1965 and created really the solid middle class of America with assimilated immigrants.",
        "And it was good for America.",
        "What Sessions does not say in that interview is that the Johnson Reed Act excluded huge groups of people.",
        "It placed very low caps on immigration from Southern Europe - Italy, in particular - and excluded all immigrants from Asia.",
        "I talked to an expert on this law.",
        "Her name is Mae Ngae.",
        "She's a professor at Columbia University where she studies the history of immigration.",
        "And to her, it's striking that Jeff Sessions does not talk about those quotas and those limits when he discusses this law.",
        "Well, he doesn't talk about the racist architecture of the entire law, which was to favor immigrants from northern Europe.",
        "Its authors were very explicit about their intentions.",
        "And they were very clear who they wanted and who they didn't want.",
        "And it was very clear that it was based on race.",
        "Joel Rose, what exactly is Jeff Sessions issue with foreign-born Americans?",
        "Why does he want to limit them?",
        "Sessions frames this basically as an economic argument - that we should limit immigrants because they compete with native-born workers and take away jobs, especially from lower skilled workers.",
        "Also, immigrants use public benefits and cost taxpayers' money that way.",
        "Here's a clip from a speech that Sessions gave at the Heritage Foundation in Washington in 2014.",
        "This was, by the way, long before President Trump declared his candidacy.",
        "And here, Jeff Sessions praises President Calvin Coolidge for capping immigration back in 1924.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "He believed it was rational and sensible to swing the pendulum back towards the average-wage-earning American.",
        "And they did that.",
        "They passed laws that reduced the flow for a time - for, I guess, 40 years.",
        "And the labor market tightened.",
        "And as Coolidge predicted, wages began to grow, and we had a very strong middle class.",
        "So basically, Jeff Sessions here is crediting the postwar economic boom to limits on immigration.",
        "Most economists say that there are other ways - better ways to explain what happened in the postwar boom - for example, the GI Bill."

        "Sure.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And even he seems a little bit surprised by that at times because he's been on the fringes of the immigration debate for a long time.",
        "As a senator from Alabama, he worked to kill immigration reform proposals.",
        "But, you know, he was just 1 senator out of 100.",
        "And for many of those years, he was in the minority - in the minority party.",

        "I'm just astounded that President Trump made the miraculous intervention.",
        "Now I'm attorney general of United States.",
        "I find it really, really, really hard to leave after 20 years on the Judiciary Committee.",
        "We should note that President Trump himself sometimes sounds astounded that he made Jeff Sessions attorney general of the United States.",
        "But Jeff Sessions is clearly making the most of the opportunity to shape policy.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, Sessions is the driving force behind the zero-tolerance policy against illegal border crossings.",
        "That was controversial, to say the least, because it separated thousands of migrant families.",
        "Sessions has made dramatic changes to the nation's immigration courts, which he oversees.",
        "He's limited who can apply for asylum so that domestic abuse and gang violence claims generally don't qualify anymore.",
        "And he's been a big part of the effort to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which he says was an overreach by former President Obama.",
        "So it sounds like in this area - if not in all others - Sessions clearly aligns with the White House, no matter how often the president takes a potshot at him on Twitter.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, on immigration it's hard to find a lot of daylight between Sessions and the White House.",
        "Remember.",
        "Trump campaigned on America first, on cracking down on illegal immigration.",
        "White House Adviser Stephen Miller, who is well-known for his hard-line immigration views, used to work for Jeff Sessions in the Senate.",
        "And the White House really has had Sessions' back.",
        "They defended the zero-tolerance policy for a while at least - until the president decided to rescind it, when the backlash just got too loud."
