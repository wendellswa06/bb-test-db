        "What happens when Microsoft is competing for talent against what are, at the moment, hotter-seeming companies like - well, Apple would be the obvious choice, or even Google?",

        "And if the military says, you need to keep 500 people in Kabul and 500 in Baghdad, that's what the CIA does.",
        "And so it's had draw, you know, down into the ranks, unfortunately.",
        "And, you know, we're losing our expertise by putting so many people in these places when they could be easily manned by 10 people in each capital.",
        "That seems like a very small number.",
        "It is small.",
        "But the CIA - you have to look at it - when I was in through the '90s, would have maybe a thousand people, operatives overseas.",

        "So when I was in Beirut, there were just - and we (unintelligible) in Beirut, but no one was interfering with what we were doing.",
        "There were maybe two people there, and that's when the hostages were there, to give you an idea the scale we're talking about.",
        "And at some point, during the war in Iraq, the CIA station was up to 700 people, which is an enormous strain on the CIA, and it was politically mandated by the White House.",
        "And you go further to say that, indeed, going back many years, there has been a division within the CIA that there was a fundamental decision, that field operatives were unreliable, that we needed to rely much more on analysis in Washington, D.C.",
        "from photography and from electronic intercepts and other sources like that, and that's a good way to stay out of trouble.",
        "Oh, I think we believed that in the '90s.",
        "I think we thought that open source information was enough, satellites, intercepts, and that the directorate of operations and the operatives could only get us into trouble.",
        "Now, there's a certain, you know, justification for that opinion.",
        "And that is, you look at the Bay of Pigs, it was an absolute catastrophe.",
        "And it was 1961 when the CIA - the Cubans that were working for the CIA invaded Cuba and then, you know, it was a catastrophe politically as well as for the CIA.",
        "Now, I mind you that that operation was mandated by the Kennedy White House, originally by the Eisenhower White House."
