        "Well, purging has to do with the way that voter registration lists are maintained, and voter registration has become the big issue of the 2008 election, just as voting machines, as we all remember from Florida 2000, were the big issue of that election, and provisional ballots were the big issue of 2004.",
        "Voter registration is the issue that everyone is talking about in terms of the way the elections are conducted.",
        "And purging has to do with the practice of deleting certain voters' names from the list.",
        "Now, there are certain circumstances in which purging is perfectly OK, and federal law sets out a method by which voters may be purged under certain circumstances if they haven't voted in two consecutive federal elections, basically for a two-year period.",
        "Or maybe if they die or move out of state, that would be another reason.",
        "Precisely.",
        "If they die, move out of state in one of the - one of the purging issues that has been especially controversial in recent elections is the purging of felons in those states that disenfranchise people with felony convictions.",
        "The problems come when states either don't follow the law or adopt careless practices for striking voters from their lists, and the net result of that can be that eligible voters wrongly have their names omitted from voting lists.",
        "And the New York Times ran a story this year that suggested that in fact, a lot more eligible voters have been stricken from lists than new voters in some states.",
        "Yeah, that's exactly right.",
        "And in fact, overall, voter registration data across the country showed that between 2004 and 2006 the number of registered voters actually went down.",
        "Now, I suspect we'll see a sharp uptake in this election, but there is a real risk that when states apply aggressive purging practices - as they have been, in some cases, sued by the United States Department of Justice to make them do - we're going to have problems, and we're going to have voters whose names are taken off the list wrongly.",
        "And is this evidence of some vast conspiracy either right or left wing?",
        "Well, conspiracy may be too strong a word.",
        "But I don't think there's any question that both in long American - the longstanding tradition of American history and one that's continued to the present date, the parties will always try to gain the system to their advantage.",
        "Now some methods of doing that are, of course, perfectly acceptable.",
        "Every - each side in every election tries to register voters of its own party and voters likely to vote for its candidates.",
        "Unfortunately, what we've seen throughout American history and continuing until the present day is sometimes parties try to manipulate voter registration lists or otherwise rig the system so as to make it more difficult for the other side's voters to get out there and vote.",
        "There is also the allegation, widespread in Republican circles this year, that large numbers of ineligible voters are, in fact, being registered illegally.",
        "Right.",
        "And on this point it's especially important to distinguish between two different things.",
        "On the one hand there's registration fraud, and on the other hand there's voter fraud.",
        "Now registration fraud typically refers to phony registration forms being filled out on behalf of non-existent voters, and typically this happens when a voter registration group - and Acorn has been the example that's come up most often in this election - hires canvassers to go out and register voters for it, and sometimes those canvassers won't do the work they're being paid to do, will occasionally submit registration forms with names such as Mickey Mouse and Dick Tracy on them, and those get turned into Acorn or the other voter registration groups out there."

        "Now, Mickey Mouse's name may appear on a voter registration form but there's little or no evidence that Mickey Mouse has actually walked through the polling place door trying to vote.",
        "That would be voter fraud if someone who is not eligible to vote attempted to vote or attempted to double vote using a fictitious name.",
        "But voter fraud is extremely rare based on the evidence we have.",
        "So in other words, even if there are fraudulent voters registered, they don't vote.",
        "Right.",
        "Even if they're - and I wouldn't even call them fraudulent voters.",
        "I would say the names of non-existent people on the voter rolls.",

        "Well, I think the caller, Rosemary, is right to focus on the question of accountability and put specifically in the voting context on transparency.",

        "The truth is, we've got lots of examples from American history of electoral manipulation by insiders with paper ballots.",
        "Now it is certainly theoretically possible that someone could tamper with software on electronic voting machines and thereby distort the results.",
        "The solution, whether we're talking about paper or electronic voting systems, is to have good procedures in place, to make sure there's transparency from beginning to end, to have adequate testing, and to make sure that poll workers are trained on what to look out for.",

        "I think there is reason to believe it's - at least in some places, especially in some of the swing states where we've had heavy turnout in past elections, that the lines won't be as bad as they were in past elections.",
        "That's true for a couple of big reasons.",
        "One of them is that we've seen an increasing move towards early voting.",
        "That includes both mail-in absentee ballots as well as in-person early voting, and you know, here in Ohio we've got early-voting centers throughout the state starting 35 days before the election, and anecdotal evidence suggests that those have been very heavily used.",
        "And the big advantage of early voting is it can take the pressure off the polling place on Election Day.",
        "The other thing that's changed, at least to some extent, is that in some places we've got new voting machines and more voting machines in place that we had in 2004.",
        "And this new equipment - and this relates in part to the prior caller's question - actually does save lost votes and to the extent we've got more machines in place than we did in 2004, that may cut down on lines.",
        "The bottom line is no one should be discouraged or deterred from showing up to vote on November 4th by long lines, and you should check to see whether you're in a state that allows you to vote early.",
        "And I'd encourage voters to avail themselves of that opportunity if it's there for you.",

        "In 2000, the presidential election was conducted in Oregon entirely by mail with about 80 percent participation.",
        "The Oregon system resolves most issues of questionable ballots before the election and gets them resolved so that everybody's votes can be counted.",
