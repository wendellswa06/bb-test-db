        "Well, I just think that we're at a point of time in our political history where we don't trust each other at all, and the system that was put in place by our Founding Fathers was one where the secret ballot was sacred and gave us an opportunity to really voice our true opinion.",
        "And without that trust that we have to have in the system that all votes are going to be counted equally and be given true measure and true weight, we are at risk of losing what our democracy is supposed to be all about.",
        "Well, are both sides right to be suspicious?",
        "There have been signs of chicanery from both sides in the past.",
        "Yes, I think that at this point in time both sides have a right to be suspicious, but it's going to take both sides after this election, but obviously it's not going to happen - to me, it's not going to happen within the next 10 days or so.",
        "We're going to have to really move forward starting at 2009 to rebuild that trust so that we can maximize our political system.",
        "And you also write specifically about black voters, who have been notoriously skeptical of the political - of the electoral system.",
        "Yes, and a lot of times it's because we have created an us versus them.",
        "Without having the political diversity that African-Americans need to have with Republicans and Democrats, you automatically build up an us versus them.",
        "If you have it weighted so that 95 percent of a certain segment of America is on one side or the other, you don't know much about the other side and therefore if anything goes awry, the first thing that you're more inclined to do is be skeptical, be suspicious and keep that mistrust going.",
        "And it doesn't just stay within one election cycle.",
        "We're still hearing about the ghost of 2000 here in 2008.",
        "And there are also likely to be unprecedented numbers of African-American voters this year.",
        "Absolutely, and there should be.",
        "I mean, this is an historical election and the goal, as far as I'm concerned, even as an African-American Republican, is for those African-Americans, for our community to stay involved politically and then from there diversify in - like what I like to call, diversify our political stock to make sure that we are equally represented on both sides, that yeah, I'm moving forward.",
        "Well, that's an idea.",
        "At least 90 percent of the African-American voters expected to go to the Democratic candidate this year.",
        "And that's that, but that's not an exception.",
        "That happens every single year, for the most part.",
        "It's just going to happen more so because Senator Obama's on the ticket.",
        "But ideally, moving forward, when you start looking at these local elections out here in the Charlotte area that will occur next year, when you start looking at the mid-term elections that'll happen in 2010, we'll start seeing more of a political diverse identity from black America, and one that stays engaged in the process.",

        "But if we look at the examples that we find when we have black mayors and when we have black governors, it does not necessarily mean that African-Americans are going to stay engaged in the process.",
        "And that's the fear that I have personally, is that we're going to have a sense of euphoria for a period of time, and then we're going to slide back into the apathy thinking that, oh, well, Senator Obama looks out for the everyday person.",
        "We don't have to stay involved.",

        "We're going to have to still stay engaged because the government's supposed to represent us, not do things for us.",

        "Yeah.",

        "But if you look at the evidence, it's not founded.",
        "First of all, Election Day registration, which nine states now have, can result and does result in a significant increase in participation, somewhere on the order of five to 10 percent, and that's huge in the area of voting.",
        "Now in terms of the fraud concern, that's the argument that's always made, but if you look at states that have had Election Day registration, and three of them have been studied extensively because they've had it for over 30 years, you don't find evidence of increased fraud.",
        "And the reason for that is it's very difficult to register in multiple places and produce the identification that you have to do to register on Election Day and not get caught.",
        "And if you do get caught, you're at risk of being prosecuted for a felony.",

        "Spoiler alert.",
        "The reason why it's necessary to hire groups like Acorn, like the League of Women Voters to do voter registration is because not everybody gets reached for these other means of registering voters.",
        "Our system depends very heavily on private registration efforts.",
        "Now, we could go with a different kind of system, one like Canada has in which the government actually takes affirmative responsibility for going out to register everyone.",
        "In Canada, we've got 93 percent of eligible citizens registered compared to just 68 percent here in the United States.",
        "The political will, however, hasn't been there to implement a universal registration-type of system like Canada's in the U.S.",
        "This would also, however, cut down on these concerns about registration fraud because if the government took over registration, we wouldn't need, or at least wouldn't need to the same extent, these private groups to go out and register voters who maybe don't drive or for some other reason aren't reached through other means.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I'm very familiar with the situations in Cincinnati area, and in fact, I joined a letter with voting and civil rights groups opposing the action that Mr. Deters took in Hamilton County, that's the Cincinnati area here in Ohio.",
        "I think it is a real problem when officials, especially partisan officials, take actions that could reasonably be interpreted as an attempt to intimidate voting or registration and thereby to suppress the vote.",
