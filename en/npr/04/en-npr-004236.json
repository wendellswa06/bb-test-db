        "That's always been known.",
        "What's new about this is that those receptors that bind bird flu are really deep in the lung and so although people can get infected with bird flu and it can cause pneumonia, it doesn't spread from person to person because it doesn't, the virus doesn't reproduce itself, you know, in like the trachea and then the bronchi.",

        "Well, I think that people always knew, researchers always knew that in order for this to become a pandemic strain, the bird virus is going to have to bind to the receptors that are in that, are in the respiratory tract, specifically in the upper respiratory tract, I think that so-called alpha two six receptor.",
        "And you know, so the question is will bird flu mutate to cause that particular binding?",
