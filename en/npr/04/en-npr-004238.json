        "And he thought he was getting in trouble because the script was written so that all of a sudden, it's had all of the information, including his Internet surfing has been reported to human resources.",
        "That's really good.",
        "I was hiding around the corner, I looked at his face and he was red as a lobster.",

        "It was well worth it.",
        "Yeah, the getting the reaction - that seems to be the key moment in any practical joke, Eric.",
        "It is, but I had to quickly diffuse his fire so that he didn't panic beyond that.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There's a heart attack, and then there's amusement, you know?",
        "There's a big difference between those two things."

        "So Firefox is the Internet browser, and you can write extensions for it.",
        "So what somebody did around the office at Instructables, is they made a total confusion pack that on April Fool's Day it will do things like take you two steps back when you click a new link.",
        "And will only do this at random intervals that increase in frequency throughout the day, so you can stall this on, you know, your (unintelligible) computer, and as they go through the day kind of surf the Net.",

        "However, one of my coworkers who received the e-mail has replied back to me that she begun crying upon receipt of the message.",
        "She may be returning my favor, but her last message back to me was, shut it.",
        "I'll not try this again next year.",
        "And you do have to worry about - I guess, you know, there are people who do take these things very seriously even if only for 30 seconds.",
        "Oh, we got it - you have to be careful with what you do and make sure that it's reversible and all in good fun.",
