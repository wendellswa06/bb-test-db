        "And you've got US commanders saying they want to focus on a police force that's been weak and vulnerable to infiltration.",
        "And at the same time, a lot of people's attention has gone--shifted east in the last few weeks because of the Iran situation, defying the world with its nuclear program and seemingly daring the United States to make some sort of move against them.",
        "And further yet to the east, a whole new wave of violence in Afghanistan and on the border with Pakistan.",
        "A missile strike against that mountain village on Friday aimed at an al-Qaeda leader reportedly at least causing a lot of civilian casualties and a whole lot of new problems for the Musharraf regime there, which is our ally.",

        "Of course, he didn't.",
        "My impression of it is that he was about ready to but I understand that he found that he would rather wait until the November 7th re-run of the election.",
        "Well, and let's take that as our followup point then, because there will be a runoff between President Hamid Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah, his principal challenger.",
        "He finished second in the balloting this summer.",
        "How does this runoff affect the political landscape?",
        "Well, as far as the Obama administration was concerned, they were really very fast losing interest in the Karzai government.",
        "And this gives them a chance to get a government more to the liking of the United States and perhaps some of the European countries, as well.",
        "Again, I have the impression, nothing very hard, but I have the impression that they will go ahead with the election.",
        "That there's a very good chance that Karzai will still win something close to 50 percent, more or less.",
        "Now, then they will entertain ideas like having a coalition government, that is Abdullah as well as Karzai together.",
        "That is, I think, what they're now aiming at.",
        "Meanwhile, of course, killings continued in Pakistan.",
        "And let me get you to step back for a bit and assess what the growing conflict in Pakistan means for policy in the region."
