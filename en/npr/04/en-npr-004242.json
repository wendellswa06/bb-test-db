        "I'm thinking about the fact that we're talking on a day when the United Nations ambassador, Nikki Haley, has made more statements criticizing Russia for its involvement in human rights abuses, effectively, in Syria.",
        "And it makes me wonder if the odds of an improved relationship with Russia have gone down since the administration has taken office.",
        "I don't think the odds have changed one way or the other.",
        "I think the situation is, as I assessed it - and this is what, in fact, I said in my trip to Moscow, my meetings with Foreign Minister Lavrov and with President Putin is - my assessment is the U.S.-Russia relationship is at an all-time low, the lowest point it has been since the end of the Cold War.",
        "And I would tell you that their response was they didn't disagree with that.",
        "I said, we have a very low, almost no level of trust between us.",
        "And that - my statement on that was, this cannot be the relationship to exist between the two most powerful nuclear nations on the planet.",
        "We cannot have this kind of relationship.",
        "And it's in a downward spiral.",
        "We've got to stabilize it, and we've got to begin to understand how we're going to turn this around.",
        "Do your personal relationships in Russia help at all?",
        "Or is this really just a national calculation of interest, and they see their interest differently than the United States will see its interests?",
        "Well, I think Russia is going to act in Russia's best interest.",
        "This is what all nations do.",
        "I think to the extent that I have longstanding relationships with the leadership in Russia - to the extent that's helpful in that they already know me - they don't have to try to figure out who this guy Rex Tillerson is because they've dealt with me for so many years, perhaps that's helpful in that my ability to communicate is very straightforward, very candid.",
        "It's not nuanced because I have found in dealing with the Russian leadership in the past, that is what they respect.",
        "We are sitting in the George C.",

        "interests in the world.",
        "Is it different?",
        "And if so, how?",
        "I'm standing in the now almost completely Shiite neighborhood of Hurriyah in West Baghdad.",
        "In front of me is an abandoned Sunni mosque, one of about a dozen defunct Sunni mosques in this neighborhood.",
        "The one in front of me was bombed at the beginning of the sectarian violence.",
        "It seems forlorn somehow, a perverse monument to the sectarian cleansing that's taken place here.",
        "I think perhaps it's just articulated a bit differently.",
        "When the president says he wants to put America first, I think that is the correct position to take because I think too often we have compromised America's interest thinking that we were going to enhance it in the approach we take with others.",
        "I make of what the president has said, I'm willing to look at a broad range of options, but I want to know at the end of it that the American people have won."

        "But with that said, does that mean that if there were a need for another Marshall Plan, to spend billions of American dollars somewhere, the president would be open to that?",

        "- if it's going to put us on a stronger economic future and prosperity because of stability - we don't prosper well in an unstable world - then the president's going to be open, I think, to any plan.",

        "Richard, I heard you earlier on \"\"Morning Edition\"\" laying out what sounded to me to be a pretty dire prediction for not just the damage from the storm, but all the rain that's going to be coming.",
        "Yes, Alex, this is a big one.",
        "I mean, before it hit land it was a Category 5, which is so rare that only a couple of them have hit within recent history.",
        "And it fortunately tapered down to a Category 4, but was still packing enormous winds and bringing a huge amount of moisture with it.",
        "So this is not going to be one of those hurricanes that just sort of peters out when it hits land; anything but that, as matter of fact.",
        "It's going to--we'll be hearing about this for a while.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, it came ashore near Grand Isle, Louisiana, this morning.",
        "What has happened since then?",
        "Well, it first was heading right for New Orleans, which was a big concern because New Orleans is under sea level, as we've heard, and fortunately, it dodged somewhat off to the east.",
        "And so even though it brought a lot of moisture and a storm surge of rising water, it was not the absolute devastating hurricane it could have been for New Orleans, as far as we can tell at this point.",
        "And what it has done instead was it brought that huge pile of water into the Mississippi coast and elsewhere along the Gulf and brought in, you know, 20 feet of water, or 15 feet in places, and that created incredible coastal flooding.",
        "Plus, it's bringing in tornadoes with it and it's bringing a huge amount of rain that's going to carry all the way up as pit moves north towards Tennessee and Kentucky, and it's going to dump five, 10, 15 inches of rain depending upon the location in the next couple days up there."

        "And...",
        "Eventually, absolutely it will.",
        "And the only good thing is that this rain will take a day or two to fall out of the sky and then it goes into the rivers and so on, and so it will come down and fill the Mississippi, but fortunately, the projections right now for flooding are that it will not overfill the Mississippi.",
        "So New Orleans may not have to worry about that as much as it has to worry about just sort of mopping up from the storm surge and everything else much closer at hand.",
        "Where do you expect the storm to go in the next 48 hours?",
        "Well, where does the National Weather Service expect it to go, I guess would be the way to put it.",

        "Even--that's possible, yes.",

        "It'll spread rain as far as Atlanta, and it will end up in the Ohio River Valley and it will continue to dump rain into the Ohio River Valley.",
        "So--plus, it'll be packing very significant winds, which is something we don't think about hurricanes doing once they hit land; they tend to peter out very quickly.",
