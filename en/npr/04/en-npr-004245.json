        "But let me just want to say this thing about the probability, the fear of overrating how much money you could raise.",
        "Remember Phil Graham in 1996 raising a ton of money and then he was out of the race even before the Iowa caucuses.",

        "And to some degree, Democrats in both houses find themselves in a bit of a pickle, do they not?",
        "We thought on November 7th, 2006 that the American people spoke, that they were angry about the war in Iraq and they gave the Democrats the stewardship in both the House and Senate and the Democrats would be able to do something.",
        "But it's one thing to be in control, it's another thing to decide what to do.",
        "It's one thing to say that the war is wrong, that President Bush is wrong, that we need our troops out today, if not yesterday.",
        "But do you cut off the funding?",
        "Do you support a binding resolution that rescinds the 2002 vote that allowed President Bush to send troops to Iraq?",
        "The Democrats are really, really torn on this.",
        "And it's very interesting we thought, you know, a lot of people thought that well, you know, the voters have spoken, the war is going to be over.",
        "It's not that simple.",
        "And the question is if you introduced those measures also, can you get them passed.",
        "Let's bring in somebody who knows a bit about this.",

        "And Democrats have not been able to get through a resolution on a war in the Senate, though they passed the non-binding resolution in the House.",

        "A measure that would effectively, John Murtha says, block the surge in Iraq.",
        "Well, actually it would block the surge in Iraq if we were dealing with a president that had any respect for the three levels of government and we - but Bush doesn't.",
        "And he's not going to do anything that we say in that resolution, and I fully believe that in 2009 we're going to be having hearings saying, why didn't the president do what we told him to do in 2007?",
        "Well as yet, the Congress has not told him anything to do.",
        "Well, actually, his own majority told him, listed some things in the past, and he hasn't lived up to any of those.",
        "And we've had all kinds of things that he had to come back and report to the Congress if this or that happens, and none of that happened.",
        "And that was under Republican rule.",
        "Well, and now that the Democrats are in charge, if Congressman Murtha submits his proposal, do you think it can - well, can it get out committee much less onto the floor?",
        "I don't know about committee.",
        "I believe it will get out of committee.",
        "I believe that it will get onto the floor, but there is a lot of people who aren't going to vote for it.",
        "I know that because what we would like to have is a resolution dedicating funds to protecting our troops while we're planning to bring them home, and insuring that they get out of Iraq safely and that they get home.",
        "And when you say there's a lot of people who aren't going to vote for it, that includes a lot of Democrats.",
        "Yes.",
        "And is that a particular problem for the party?",
        "There is a wing in the party that's going to say, look, you guys were elected, you guys were given control of the houses of Congress to end this war.",
        "Why aren't you doing it?",
        "Well, that is the problem that we face.",
        "Many of us believe that on November 7th we were given the majority because the voters - certainly not in districts like mine, who have been against this war in the beginning, but Iowa and Ohio and northern New York - they elected Democrats in Republican seats because they believe the Democrats would actually do something to bring our troops home."

        "But it will also have - it will fund the surge and it will have the language that's added by Jack Murtha, which is good language.",

        "And in the meantime, our troops are dying, being wounded and they're not being brought home, and we're not returning Iraq to the Iraqi people so they can have their own sovereignty.",
        "It's sounds like to me that you certainly backed the effort but you, at this point, don't believe that this resolution can pass?",
        "Oh, I don't.",

        "I believe they're making a huge mistake.",
