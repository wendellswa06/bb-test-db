        "Apparently people are bilking hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Bakersfield Center, and it was a call center that the Red Cross hired some people to manage.",
        "And apparently it was very easy to manipulate the system, and people figured out how to do it.",
        "So those indictments are under way.",
        "Six people have pleaded guilty already.",
        "What kind of money are we talking about?",
        "How much?",
        "Hundreds of thousands of dollars.",
        "Now that's a small amount compared to all of the millions of dollars that were donated to the Red Cross after Hurricane Katrina, but still it's not an insignificant sum.",
        "And if you made a donation, you're not going to be very happy that your money went on to the criminal folks.",
        "The Red Cross is trying to get it back, of course, and they're hopeful that they will be able to do that.",
        "Have there been other cases of fraud, especially with the Red Cross or other responses to Hurricane Katrina?",
        "Yes, indeed.",
        "There are a number of things that the Red Cross has been doing to look and make sure that fraud isn't happening, but they're doing a lot of their own audits and they have found cases where people have tried to bilk the system.",
        "The other thing that's happened is that some people have set up fraudulent Web sites, too, pretending that they are the Red Cross and saying, you know, `Give to us,' even though you're not ending up giving to the Red Cross as well.",
        "So fraud happens in a lot of different ways.",
        "Sometimes it's people pretending to be Hurricane Katrina evacuees.",
        "And then other cases people just pretending to raise money for charity.",
        "So-called spoof Web sites where you go and put in your credit card number and happily give them money and they turn out not to be the Red Cross.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So how do these things happen?",
        "I mean, do they just crop up in any disaster or is this specific to Katrina?"

        "It's happened with every disaster, but what federal officials say is that people are getting more sophisticated about it with this disaster and in part technology has made it really simple to come up with a lot of frauds.",
        "And, you know, the larger scale of the disaster, the more people, unfortunately, con artists, come out and figure out that there are some ways to take advantage of a very difficult situation.",
        "And this is what we would call large-scale.",
        "I mean, donations for hurricane relief have reached $2.7 billion.",
        "How do, you know, small, relatively--you know, non-profit charities--granted the Red Cross is not small, but non-profit charities, how do they deal with money in such large scale?",
        "That is actually one of the big problems is that there is so much of it flowing in so fast.",
        "And non-profit groups have not had a good reputation for being very careful about setting up systems in general.",
        "There have been a lot of cases of fraud, sometimes among their own employees, of people taking money.",
        "And donors don't really like to pay usually for the kind of systems that charities need to be able to set up secure systems so it's not usually a big priority.",
        "Of course, they're very upset when they see their money taken away.",
        "But in some ways what we need to do as smart donors is realize that we need to encourage the charities to invest in those kinds of systems to make sure there is no fraud.",
        "That's fascinating.",
        "You know, when we were talking about this show--we were talking about how most Americans at this point anyway know that they should look at how much each charity spends on administrative expenses and so on and sort of target a charity that most of their money or a greater percentage of their money will actually be going to the recipients of, you know, relief aid.",
        "But you're saying that sometimes that administrative expense can be used to combat fraud.",
