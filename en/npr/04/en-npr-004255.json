        "Hi.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "My question is--I had donated to the Pakistan earthquake relief fund to the American Red Cross, and some of my co-workers were afraid to donate, because of any links to--or perceived links to terrorism.",
        "Has anybody else had that problem?",
        "Is it OK to just donate to local charities in Pakistan?",
        "Thanks for your call, Rupa.",
        "Stacy Palmer, are any of these problems of fraud specific to the Red Cross?",
        "No.",
        "And fraud can happen really anywhere.",
        "It's just--we focus on the Red Cross because they get so many of the donations.",
        "They got the lion's share of donations after this disaster, and they do pretty much after every kind of thing.",
        "Charities in the United States have to follow special guidelines to make sure that money isn't getting in the hand of terrorists, and they're very careful about that.",
        "And in some cases, some of the things that charities have said is that some of those rules stymie them from being very effective in their response, so they're actually working with the Justice Department to find some ways around it; that only they're effective and they're still safeguarding your money.",
        "But giving to a United States charity that's following those rules is a pretty safe way of making sure that you're not putting money in the hands of terrorist organizations.",
        "In fact, the current National Response Plan designates the Red Cross as the main organization in disaster relief, but there are proposals out there to require or to ask for at least greater coordination among non-profits to try and get rid of some of these problems.",
        "Has there been any headway on this?",
        "A little bit.",
        "After September 11th, groups realized they had a problem and they started developing some responses, but clearly, they aren't very far along because the response after Katrina, for example, was to a pilot project that really hadn't been tested very well, and that was one reason it didn't work.",
        "There were a lot of technology glitches.",
        "They really weren't prepared for the fact that there wasn't going to be Internet access or telephone access, and so, you know, it wasn't very easy to use a system that relied on those kinds of things to coordinate.",
        "So some of the same problems you see with the government response, the charity response has really been hamstrung, and we really need to find some ways to move a lot faster and put more resources into it so that we really are prepared for the next disaster.",
        "Seems like that's a problem across the federal government, charitable organizations.",
        "It's almost as if no one was prepared for this, even a few years after September 11th.",
        "The radios didn't work on the federal government's side.",
        "The charities are having trouble dealing with these huge donations.",
        "I mean, is there just a level of fraud that comes with any of this, or could something help the situation?",
        "One thing could--you know, if the--some easy measures were put in place and also if Congress was making sure that between disasters, charities were held accountable for making sure that they were reducing problems with fraud and proving their ability to respond, those kinds of things.",
        "And one thing that happens is this all fades out of our memory and is not the hot topic for anybody to pursue on Capitol Hill and so, you know, we go from disaster to disaster, don't really learn all of the lessons that could be learned.",
        "We learn some of them, but not all of them.",
        "So what do you think, as you look at these organizations, is the biggest problem that needs to be tackled?",
        "The biggest problem they need is they need expertise in terms of how to make sure that their systems work really well, and that might be stuff that they pay for, but it also could be donated.",
        "They need logistics expertise.",
        "They need the kinds of people at companies who are figuring out how to fight fraud.",
        "When you look at what's being done on identity theft, for example, some of that same expertise probably could help the Red Cross, and that's one thing that they really ought to take advantage of."

        "OK.",
        "Let me ask you one final question then.",
        "Does the federal government regulating these charities--will that help?",
        "It certainly could help in terms of their accountability, whether the federal government has the ability to test them, but just knowing that the federal government is checking up on you, that's a good monitor internally for the organization to do a good job, so it certainly could help.",
        "The federal government, of course, has its own problems dealing with now close to a hundred billion dollars going to Katrina.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So it's not sure that that's going to be the solution.",
