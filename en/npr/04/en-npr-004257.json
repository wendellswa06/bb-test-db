        "From over 30 years' experience with art dealers, I would say there most certainly are individuals out there in the trade that will turn a blind eye.",
        "Ken Perenyi is a professional art forger.",
        "He wrote about his career in the book \"\"Caveat Emptor.\"\" Perenyi says he faked thousands of 18th and 19th-century paintings and sold them to auction houses and art dealers over his three-decade career.",
        "In my experience, I've seen paintings of mine turn up in dealers' catalogs that they had to know about it, and they chose to buy it and sell it anyway.",
        "Still, it surprised everyone that a blue-chip gallery like Knoedler would get caught peddling fakes.",
        "The gallery had been in business since before the Civil War.",
        "Even other art dealers relied on its good name.",
        "Richard Feigen is a prominent dealer on the Upper East Side.",
        "He helped broker a sale involving one of the Knoedler forgeries but gave his commission back when the work turned out to be fake.",
        "Feigen says it's a reminder to art dealers not to cut corners.",
        "I think it will cause people to be much more careful because even a name as old as Knoedler is no guarantee, obviously, that you can be sure of.",
        "The Knoedler affair should also be a wake-up call to buyers, says Amy Adler at NYU School of Law.",
        "Yeah, a lot of these people were very sophisticated businesspeople.",
        "They'd made a lot of money.",
        "But they bought art based on sort of magical, romantic stories.",
        "It's the kind of transaction they would never would've engaged in had it been a regular business deal.",
        "But, Adler says fakes are getting better.",
        "And as the price of art has climbed, fewer experts are willing to make public judgments about a work's authenticity because they're afraid of getting sued.",
        "That can be very expensive.",
        "Just ask Ann Freedman's lawyer, Luke Nikas, standing outside a federal courthouse in Manhattan.",
        "The bigger the dollar amount, the bigger the mistake in the end if you get it wrong.",
        "If this had been a painting that was purchased for $5,000, it wouldn't be here in the southern district in New York.",
        "This would be over.",
        "But it was purchased for more than $8 million by a collector who thought it was painted by Mark Rothko.",
        "The trial is expected to last several more weeks, and Freedman's lawyer says she will take the stand in her own defense.",

        "And then at the same time, they also adopted the single presentation ordinance.",
        "And that said that you couldn't have any variation of a single brand sold in any store.",
        "So, for example, you could have Marlboro, you could have Camel cigarettes, but you couldn't have Marlboro Light, Marlboro Gold; you couldn't have menthol.",

        "But what is their legal case here?",
        "What are they basically saying is the reasoning that they oppose these measures?",
        "Well, they're saying that the percentage of warning labels that are required on cigarette packs in Uruguay go beyond what's reasonable to protect people from the harmful effects of smoking and that basically Uruguayans know - regardless of warning labels - that smoking is bad for their health.",
        "So these restrictions don't stop people from smoking; they just make them switch brands.",
        "They also say that the warning labels leave no space for legally protected trademarks, and these restrictions breach the protections of a bilateral investment treaty."

        "Well, the Republic University of Uruguay, in collaboration with a professor from MIT, did a study that showed that between 2005 and 2011 in Uruguay, smoking has gone down 4.3 percent annually.",
