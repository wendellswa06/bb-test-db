        "There is absolutely a difference.",
        "And I think, where the nexus of this is the issue of mandatory minimum sentencing and the way that it's used in pre-trial negotiation.",
        "So let me sort of flesh that out a bit.",
        "When you have a case where maybe there is questionable evidence, where there's questions of innocence, where there's questions of conduct of law enforcement during an arrest, traditionally, these are case - these are situations that would need to be litigated in the court of law.",
        "But what happens is an individual will sit down before a trial with a prosecutor and have an opportunity to take a plea deal.",
        "In a number of cases - there are 95 percent of cases that go through court, end up in a plea bargain.",
        "And so what the person - the prosecutor's going to sit down and say, listen, you're facing 15, 20, 30, your mandatory minimum based upon this particular conduct.",
        "And you can either take a plea deal now to a lesser charge or you're going to go to trial and probably get these mandatory minimums.",
        "For a defendant who may be relying on a public provision of counsel, who doesn't have the amount of time and resources to be able to provide and investigate this, it's a really difficult gamble to take.",
        "And so many individuals will just decide, well, you know what?",
        "I'm just going to take the plea, and I'm going to take some time in jail.",
        "And a lot of unanswered legal questions exist.",
        "And this is a result of these mandatory sentencing.",
        "Ryan, let me turn back to Karen.",
        "Just briefly, do you have any sense of how prison has changed your sons, their aspirations, their future?",
        "Things have changed in the South.",
        "But the act imposes current burdens and must be justified by current needs.",
        "The act also differentiates between the states in ways that are in tension with our fundamental tradition of equal sovereignty among the states.",

        "They're aging in prison.",
        "And they're - I want to say they're getting tough.",
        "You know, they're growing up in prison.",
        "So, you know, prison is not a good place.",
        "No one can convince me it's a good place.",
        "You know, and I look at them every day and that - how they age and how they fight to not be prison life.",
        "I send them all kind of magazines.",
        "I send them everything I can to keep them, you know, I want to call streetwise to what's going on.",
