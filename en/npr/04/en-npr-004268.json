        "That would divert the country away from the cleanest energy - wind, solar and geothermal power.",
        "What we're trying to avoid is building hundreds of new gas plants, locking us in for the next 20, 30 years and thereby making it impossible to make the swifter transition to clean energy.",
        "Nilles says it's a race.",
        "Coal is slowing down, renewables are closing the gap, and natural gas is a dark horse coming up on the outside.",

        "Archaeologists found the skeleton on the first day of digging.",
        "It has a curved spine - thought to be the result of scoliosis - though there's no evidence of a hunch, despite the picture painted by Shakespeare.",
