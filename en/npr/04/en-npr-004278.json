        "She logged nearly a million travel miles.",
        "So the argument from Democrats is that she was in the room, very close, dealing with these threats.",
        "The argument from Republicans is that they were - you know, these threats grew under her watch or shortly after.",
        "And what she has to overcome is that what her strength is is also her vulnerability in an election where voters have surged towards - towards outsiders, like Bernie Sanders, like Donald Trump candidates, who have tried to portray themselves as outside the foreign-policy establishment."
