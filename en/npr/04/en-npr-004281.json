        "You can find him described as a Marxist on some conservative websites, though Horwitt says Alinsky had an aversion to Communists.",
        "Part of his turn-off was the rigid ideology and really the lack of humor that he saw in almost all of the Communists that he even got to know briefly.",
        "Humor of a sort or at least theatrics played a big role in Alinsky's organizing technique.",
        "So says the Reverend Dr. Leon Finney, who started his career as an organizer in a Chicago group that Alinsky helped found in the early 1960s, the Woodlawn Organization.",
        "There were a lot of slums in Woodlawn, says Finney, and their organization had gotten no help from the city, the courts or the landlords.",
        "So, Saul's idea was we're going to get some of our black, our Negro people, to drive to the suburbs where the property owners lived.",

        "Opponents of abortion rights, for example, have picketed the homes of abortion providers.",
        "Over time, the Woodlawn Organization has grown and prospered and is now being investigated for playing fast and loose with government grant money.",
        "Finney has denied personally profiting from his work with the group.",
        "But back in the 1960s, picketing the slumlord's home worked, he says, by pushing the neighbors of the fictitiously named Joe Adams to take action when no one else would.",
        "His neighbors that really care about blacks that were marching around, they didn't want those blacks in their neighborhood doing anything.",
        "And so, they would call Joe Adams up and say, look, we don't care what you got to do, you get these blankety-blanks out of our neighborhood.",
        "This is a classic Alinsky principle, says Finney, take a negative, like the neighbors' racism, and turn it into a positive for your cause.",
        "But Dan Schnur, a political analyst at the University of Southern California, says when Gingrich mentions Alinsky's name, his audience doesn't know these details and doesn't particularly care.",

        "Not only does he get to link Obama to a noted liberal activist, but he gets to remind voters what Gingrich considers to be one of his own greatest strengths, his intellectual firepower.",
        "But in a debate in Florida last week, Gingrich's claim to be the big ideas candidate was belittled as grandiose by rival Rick Santorum.",

        "Well, you raise a good point.",
        "Jim Hardison, there are risks involved in changing that character.",
        "There certainly are.",
        "People start to get really attached to the characters that they've grown up with, and, you know, when it's an emotional attachment, it's not always particularly rational.",
        "And, again, I think the thing that really attracts us to characters are the flaws and imperfections in them, not, you know, the ways that they're perfect.",
        "Because that's how we see ourselves in them.",
        "So anytime you streamline a character to make it more attractive or more sexy, you run the risk that you will cut out the thing that made people connect with it.",
        "David, thanks very much and we'll..."
