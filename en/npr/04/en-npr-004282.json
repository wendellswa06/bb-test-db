        "But Blinder says even without this kind of spillover effect, the looming sequester cuts will slow the economy down at a time when it's already weak.",
        "He says the cuts could reduce economic activity by anywhere from seven-tenths of a percentage point to 1 percent.",
        "And a 1 percent reduction in economic activity means about a 1 percent cut in the labor market.",
