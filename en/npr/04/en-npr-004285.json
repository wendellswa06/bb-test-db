        "I do think she has a beef that the media treatment of Obama's been pretty friendly.",

        "But do you think it was more fractious than any other relationship between the press and a president?",
        "No, and I think this gets overlooked.",

        "Then access improved a great deal after Iowa, but it was sort of too late.",
        "Obama, curiously, has not given the press a lot of access.",

        "Obama's, interestingly, been able to get away with it.",

        "And what about her tactic?",
        "It seems that she's really ramped her - the criticism of the press in the last week or so, that she is getting unfair treatment, that for instance there was an article over the weekend in the New York Times suggesting that her campaign is imploding, and then her campaign flooded the paper with letters and calls for a retraction and that kind of thing.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I don't think it's a winning tactic.",

        "I mean, not too be too atavistic here, but if you show your neck to a mean dog, they're going to lunge at it.",

        "He's a shrewd guy, and it's not like he's baring his inner sole.",
        "There's a certain amount of caginess in these exchanges.",
        "But relatively speaking, for politicians to be as open McCain, very unusual, and it won him a lot of press support.",
