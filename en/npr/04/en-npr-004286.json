        "He runs an outfit called the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes, based at Arizona State University, and he is trying to figure out a better way to change the way the world uses energy.",
        "This is really the metabolism of modern industrial society, our use of energy.",
        "And changing that system is not about replacing a few technologies or advancing our level of efficiency along certain fronts.",
        "It means creating a whole new basis for the global economy.",
        "Sarewitz is skeptical that politicians can deliberately manage a transformation of that scale either through legislation or through climate treaties.",
        "He says for starters measures that will ultimately force everyone to pay more for energy are doomed both economically and politically.",
        "Politically, what you're asking people to do is to pay huge upfront costs for benefits for many decades down the road that they can't even anticipate or predict.",
        "And that is politically an extremely difficult sort of situation to manage.",
        "And even if the public became passionate about climate change, Sarewitz says it's hard to imagine how they would warm to the idea of making carbon-emitting fuels prohibitively expensive.",
        "Just try to imagine how much that will cost.",
        "The economic dislocation that would be created by getting to that sort of level would absolutely be immense, and it's easy to be casual about that or it's easy to pin that kind of argument on conservative Republicans or on the executives of oil corporations.",
        "But nevertheless it is absolutely true that you would be talking about something that would be completely destabilizing to global economies.",
        "Okay, enough of the bad news.",
        "Sarewitz isn't a naysayer or a cynic.",
        "But he has been trying to think of another way to deal with climate change.",
        "To do that, he has looked back in history to see how we managed other major transformations.",
        "One example is agriculture.",
        "The United States government created a highly successful, century-long effort to make food more abundant and affordable."

        "And it didn't do so by setting any particular target or timetable.",
        "It did so by investing in research, in development, and in - very importantly, in institutions.",
        "That's the model Sarewitz would like to use for climate change.",
        "The idea really is to take the political heat off of climate change and instead move this into the realm of policy wonkdom, where many, many small decisions made across many agencies, many types of policies, many domains, set the conditions for moving in the right direction without demanding that people accept that this is the most important problem in the world.",
        "Sarewitz is now hard at work trying to identify what institutions we need to drive that transformation in the coming decades.",
        "The ultimate goal is to make renewable energy about as cheap as fossil fuels; otherwise there's a little hope that the nations of the world will agree to tackle climate change.",
        "Sarewitz knows the Obama administration won't abandon its current path to craft climate laws in a treaty.",
        "But there is no reason why they can't at the same time - and I'm hopeful that they will at the same time - understand that the real action is going to be on the innovation front.",
