        "Now, Mary, I know you had something to say, but I just want to take a little turn here…",
        "Okay.",
        "…because I was really struck by something that you said earlier about how the women of Rutgers need to move on, and in a way I guess reclaim their own space in this.",
        "Right.",
        "And I want us to talk just a little bit - all of us are African-Americans, and I'm sure we all have our battle scars, not just from media conflagrations like Imus or O.J., but from face-to-face personal experience.",
        "And I just want to tell a very brief story.",
        "We don't have much time, so to make a long story short, I was working at another company at another time, and I found out that my boss told a white colleague that I had essentially taken his job because I was an affirmative action hire.",
        "Now, I wrote about the incident though not mentioning names, but it took me years to stop being angry.",
        "And those were years in which I didn't even take time to realize how much I actually had learned from that same person who was my boss.",
        "So reclaiming your experience is something that has to happen after you kind of grieve a racial incident.",
        "Don't you think, Mary?",
        "I think absolutely.",
        "And all I was going to say before was that I hope Imus lands somewhere.",
        "There ought to be a place for that kind of invective to be on the air somewhere.",
        "I believe in free speech.",
        "But yes, I've spent my whole life doing what I'm saying the Rutgers students ought to do, which is to take the blow, move on, throw another punch, and keep moving.",
        "From the time that I was a child, when I worked in the summer at 11 years old, taking care of some white people's baby (unintelligible) and played a record, and the woman told me when I came home that I shouldn't be playing that record.",
        "I didn't know what it was, it was classical music and I liked it, and she said, that's not for, you know, N's, you know, people like you.",
        "So these demonstrations haven't changed your mind at all?",
        "Or people who said to me - a student - in the last few years, white student, that he liked me because I reminded him of his nanny at home.",
        "Was that an automatic F?"

        "A faculty member said to me, oh, it's like Mammy on the old plantation.",
        "And the student didn't really see anything wrong with that.",
        "But you just pick yourself up off the ground and you, you know, you move on.",
        "Joe?",
        "Well, you know, I mean, being black in America is one hell of an experience, and I think that being black in America gives us a particular insight into America.",
        "And we seem - and at the risk of sounding like black people have all the wisdom, which we certainly do not (unintelligible) we are able to see white America and America in general, I think, in a way that white America cannot.",
        "And that is largely because we are - the media, television in particular, portrays white America, and certainly until fairly recently had very little of the way of really getting into the lives of black America.",
        "And so we kind of know our own situation, but we're surrounded by the larger white community.",
        "We see their lives on television, even the rich folks that we might not know personally.",
        "And so we have, I think, this kind of particular insight into white America that I think white America can really benefit from if there were more opportunities for the kind of really open and thorough discussion of race matters that I spoke about in the last segment.",
        "Let me let Nat in, because we only got a little over a minute left.",
        "How do we keep those lines of dialogue open?",
        "Well, one - I think I wanted to tell my story, Farai, but I guess…",
        "No. Please go ahead.",
        "I was going to say this.",
        "When I think about race, it's similar to what Mary and Joe said.",
        "I find that - and I'm a futurist - I mean, you know, I look at things long term - 20, 25 years out - but I'm struck by, at age 55, how even at age 55 I still live with ghosts, and they show up in the most unusual places.",
        "I remember not long ago, when my wife and I were helping a young member of our church whose wife had died unexpectedly, early mother, and they had children left, and so my wife and I were going to help them, help the two boys to buy some suits while the father was away."

        "One of the kids had to go to the rest room suddenly, and all I could remember - well, you know, look, this is a little kid who needs to go to the bathroom, and I asked the woman who was waiting on us, where was the bathroom.",

        "Books are different.",
        "They are individual statements or inventions by particular authors.",
        "I think book publishers would say two things.",
