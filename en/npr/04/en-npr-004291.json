        "And let's get started with, by far the most-asked question has to do with the Republican mantra that the health care law is job-killing.",
        "And in fact that is the title of the repeal legislation: Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act.",
        "A lot of our listeners, Julie, want to know, is the law in fact job-killing?",
        "Now, the CBO also said that there would be a reduction perhaps in low-wage workers because of the law, but they said that that would be small in all likelihood.",
        "And that's something that other analysts have agreed with.",
        "Let's move on to a question from Dane Schumacher(ph) of Huntsville, Arkansas.",
        "He writes this.",
        "He says he's a full-time farmer there.",
        "He says he lives off the proceeds from farm sales and he earns less than $15,000 a year.",
        "And this is what he wants to know: Will I be required to purchase health insurance?",
        "If so, how in the world does the government expect me to afford to do so?",
        "Well, in a word: No. People who earn less than 133 percent of poverty, and that's about $14,400 this year, will get Medicaid coverage which costs them nothing.",
        "Now, that's a big change.",
        "It used to be that to get Medicaid, you had to not only be poor but fit into a certain category.",
        "You had to be a child, or blind, or disabled.",
        "Under this new law, you simply will have to be low-income.",
        "So starting in 2014, if you are low-income you will be eligible for Medicaid.",
        "But what if, say, he were over that threshold even by just by a little bit, would he have to buy health insurance then?",
        "Also, if the lowest cost insurance policy would require you to pay more than eight percent of your income, you're also exempt from the mandate.",
        "So if you don't earn very much money but it's still too much to be on Medicaid, you will not have to buy health insurance under this law.",
        "Julie, we got a question from listener Theresa Stallman West(ph) from Los Angeles.",
        "Here it is: A friend of mine works for a law firm in New York City.",
        "The owners of the law firm said that when the new health care law takes effect, they will just refuse to provide health insurance for their employees and accept the government's fine for not providing it.",
        "They said this will be cheaper than actually providing the required health insurance.",
        "And she wants to know, if this is true, wouldn't all companies do this?",
        "The other thing we know is that people have surveyed businesses who say they - most of them plan to continue to offer insurance.",
        "It's a way to recruit and retain workers.",
        "In a way, Julie, does this question spool back to the question about is the bill job-killing?",
        "Because you do hear about businesses who say if the threshold is 50 workers, I'm not going to hire that - 51st worker.",
        "I'm going to keep under that threshold so that I don't face this situation.",
        "Well, that is one concern but also if they decide that it's cheaper to pay the penalty, not provide the health insurance, put the workers in the exchanges, then they could hire more people."

        "Julie, we have time for one last question and this one is from Dave Manley of Boston.",
        "Why does most of the current law not go into effect for several years?",
        "If the purpose of the bill is to expand and improve health care in the U.S.",
        "and reduce its cost, he wants to know, why the multi-year rollout?",
        "And that's why I think you've been hearing about a lot of these, you know, benefits that are already in effect about keeping kids on their parents' plans until they're 26, or the closing the Medicare drug benefit donut hole; things that are in effect now, because these big benefits are not going to go into effect until 2014.",

        "So this week, we're checking in with some small business owners to see how they've weathered the recession and if things have started to improve yet.",
        "Here's to you, Ms. Stamberg, happy 45th anniversary at NPR.",
        "A cynic remark that after having a book on the bestseller list for four years, you have a real - you can afford - you can't - really can afford a fact checker because you don't want to find out the truth.",
        "Well, that's a good point.",

        "Let's go to Molly, Molly with us from Boulder, Colorado.",
        "Hi.",
        "My question is, would you address the inherent conflict of interest between the publisher who is profiting off the book sales as well as the author?",
        "It seems that they might not have the utmost motivation to check the facts if they think that, you know, the book might sell..."

        "It's just something that's going to happen in the nature of doing it.",
        "But, you know, more cynically, I think, publishers do kind of protect themselves with their contracts.",

        "It emerged kind of - there's a tremendous efflorescence of them in the late '80s and early 1990s; Frank McCourt's book, \"\"Angela's Ashes,\"\" and Mary Karr's memoir, \"\"The Liars' Club.\"\" Both of those were questioned as to their authenticity and accuracy.",
        "Not so much a deal was made of it.",
        "And over time, the memoir has become really the dominant nonfiction if not literally form in the culture.",
        "So more and more of what we're reading comes under the guise of memoir and memoir is a very tricky form.",

        "There will be a little - there'll be some outrage and back and forth and indignation and apologies, and then we'll get another one of these books.",
