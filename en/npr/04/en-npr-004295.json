        "I mean, that was our philosophy.",
        "You can - if something looks suspicious, you can probably detonate it at a distance and then go in and see if you were right.",
        "We were not as scientific as the guys are now.",
        "But we had a lot of rifle grenades and hand grenades and we knew how to use them, as they say in the movies.",
