        "Haggis was invented in England, this food historian says.",
        "That's because of a reference she found in an English cookbook in 1615, predating any Scottish reference by more than a century.",
        "We talked to a former world champion haggis maker, and a Scot, who still believes haggis is 100 percent Scottish.",
        "And Kristine Donavon(ph) of Davis, California, writes that, history may back him up on this one.",
        "She writes: At the time the cookbook was apparently written, 1615, King James I was the ruling Monarch.",
        "However, until he ascended the English throne, Donavon continues, James was King James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary Queen of Scotts.",
        "Seems to me only natural that a man raised in Scotland would enjoy haggis, and that his cooks would prepare that delicacy for him even after his departure for England.",
        "Well, wherever it came from originally, apparently not every Scotsman or woman loves haggis.",
        "John Wild(ph) of Greenwood, South Carolina shared this story about a Scotswoman he once knew in Canada.",
        "He writes about helping her pack to move back to Scotland: She opened a cabinet in her kitchen and showed me 18 cans of Baxters Haggis.",
        "Her previous employer in the old country had sent her a can every year as a Christmas present.",
        "And Mr. Wild continues, unfortunately, she couldn't stand haggis, neither could her husband, even her dog turned up his nose.",
        "She knew better than to tempt her cat.",
        "Would you like them, she asked?",
        "Although I had never sampled a haggis, it didn't sound appealing.",
        "I declined her offer.",

        "U.S.",

        "They went back out on the square, and the military said: Okay, okay, we hear you.",

        "Well, actually no. And it's all a little confusing.",

        "In Egypt, they were talking about something that - a conflict that - protest that lasted, what, 18 days.",
        "Yeah, I think that there are lots of different kinds of revolutions, and we should probably begin with the very humbling assumption that no one ever knows what's happening in a revolution, really, and the legacies that the revolution creates become controversial forever.",
        "But one of the principles that made the revolution in America succeed is that it was a kind of evolutionary revolution - that is to say, it didn't - it overthrew Great Britain and George III quickly, but then it took some time to move to a nation state.",
        "And then after that, the full promise of the American Revolution was delayed, especially with regard to the issue of slavery.",
        "So a conservative revolution or a seeping revolution or an evolutionary revolution tends to be one that is the soundest and with rights and forms of government that stick.",
        "And those institutions were developed over a long period of time, and in a sense was the American Revolution - you wrote about it by saying that in a sense neither side on the revolutionary side, neither side lost.",
        "There were the people who wanted a strong state and people who wanted diversified control, and both won in a way.",
        "That's right.",

        "I would say that, for example, Egypt has a much greater chance of successfully negotiating this revolutionary experience into something stable, representative, transparent, rule of law, because Britain left some of those institutions in place.",
