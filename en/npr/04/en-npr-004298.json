        "Deborah Amos, is there any remnant of those institutions alive today?",
        "When we come back, we'll turn to Libya and the options open to Moammar Gadhafi if he's interested in giving up power.",
        "Is it better if he flees with his billions for a life in exile or if he's clapped away in chains for a war crimes trial?",
        "Stay with us.",
        "Well, I can't speak to that, but I will tell you that the idea of evolution here is simply not in the cards.",
        "Time is so speeded up.",
        "In the next 18 months or less, Egyptians are expected to vote for a parliament, a president and they'll be asked to ratify a new constitution.",
        "Eighteen months after 30 years of essentially being asleep during the Mubarak regime.",
        "And it also requires Egyptians to know about the issues of a constitution and the issues of rights.",
        "There are people here suggesting that the only way that you can do that is to set up technology - Wiki pages, Twitter discussions, all printed out in newspapers - and that moves it down another 100,000 people and then brought out to the villages, so that you can discuss it with illiterate Egyptians.",
        "It is a huge undertaking in a very small amount of time.",
        "And so you have to assume that there's going to be mistakes made in that kind of time.",
        "But the pressure is because, for example, outside donors need to know what kind of government this is before they begin donating again.",
        "It's hard to sign a contract until the currency stabilizes and that's not going to happen until there's a government again.",
        "So, evolution is not in the cards here.",
        "And that's going to make things difficult.",
        "We want to hear from out callers this hour about - well, what is it that defines revolution.",
        "800-989-8255, email us talk@npr.org.",
        "And Joseph Ellis, we just have a minute or so before the break, but technology surely has accelerated this and, well, the pressure of time in Egypt is going to be very daunting.",
        "I agree.",
        "I agree with the reporter there.",
        "Though I think the way to think about this is that once the constitution is passed, that's not the end of the revolution; that's just the beginning, and the key is whether the constitution establishes a framework that will permit additional change and reform to occur over decades.",

        "Egypt and Tunisia overthrew their leaders but not the governing system - or at least not yet.",
        "So what's a revolution and what's just a reshuffle?",

        "Hi, there.",
        "Go ahead, please.",
        "Well, I was actually kind of laughing at the guy that said it's an evolution.",
        "Revolution is - definitely you end up back where you started.",
        "It's now a basic fact of revolving around a point, and he said that the America has an evolution and I kind of - I don't really buy into that, considering America originally had a revolution against East India's Company and the monarchy.",
        "And they've seemed to have tried to create near-monarchies and they've certainly got the companies running the country again.",
        "So, I'd say that we do need more evolution and less revolution.",
        "And these Twitter-lutions(ph) are very odd.",
        "But, there...",
        "Well, Joseph Ellis, I'm not sure whether you can square all that history...",
        "Yeah, I'm not sure what I can make of that.",
        "I think that a revolution, in any modern sense of the term, is by definition a fundamental change in the social and political conditions and an overthrow of more than just a ruler.",
        "That would be a coup.",
        "But a fundamental change.",
        "In the French Revolution, overthrowing the aristocracy; and the Russian Revolution, fundamental change in the class system.",
        "And so, it is a shocking - the definition of revolution that the caller's referring to was the original definition of revolution from Copernicus.",
        "Copernicus' De revolutionibus; that is the coming around again, but the modern revolutions that have existed in America, Russia, France, China have changed our understanding of how to define revolution.",
        "Let's go next to John(ph), and John's with us from Long Island."

        "I just wanted to make people aware that revolution - the definition of revolution will most likely change very soon and I was stated before to the person who took my call that a shift in the consciousness, in the way we think, of humankind is the most important revolution of all kind because anybody can protest, anybody can scream, anybody can pick up a rock.",
        "Those are all primitive forms of rebellion, but to actually shift your mind towards the resolution and to come together as a true human species; a shift in consciousness, your mind.",
        "That is the greatest revolution of all.",
        "And Deborah Amos, it seems that's a pretty good definition of what happened there in Egypt when, as when people say, people lost their fear.",
        "I knew you were going to come to me on that because you're absolutely right.",
        "It is what happened here and - look, in the Middle East, not anybody can throw a rock and not anybody can protest.",
        "That's been the problem certainly in Egypt for the last 30 years.",
        "So anybody who was here on January 25th and looked around and saw people coming down out of apartment buildings and out of, you know, places that had no electricity, and taxicab drivers, and the dry cleaning guy, and the middle-class neighborhoods, all coming to the square at the same time.",
        "It was an extraordinary moment, a psychological moment in the Middle East.",

        "I was talking to a book publisher the other day, and she said, you know, for the first time I can order a book called \"\"I Want To Be President,\"\" which is an American book that, you know, would seem not controversial at all to us, but it was unthinkable to have it in this country for kids to read.",

        "There is.",
        "The people that make a revolution are usually particular radical, psychological people.",
        "It's unusual that the same people that can make a revolution can also secure it.",
        "That's one of the distinctive features of the American Revolution, 'cause you have to be capable of a radical act, and then of a conservative act.",
        "And as Deborah was talking, I was thinking in their twilight years, Adams and Jefferson used to debate whether or not the principles of democracy established by the American Revolution were transportable to other areas of the world.",
        "And Jefferson argued that they were; they were universal principles and they would eventually conquer every nation on the planet.",
        "And so he wouldn't be surprised what's happening in this springtime of revolution in North Africa.",
        "Adams said that it wasn't, that countries like Catholic countries in Latin America could never become democratic and he said the same thing about Muslim countries in the Middle East.",

        "Well, you know, we're talking about revolutions and, of course, many of them aren't successful; the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik revolution, I think most of that era.",
        "If you ask the people there were they happy, I don't think that they were happier than they were before.",
        "Same thing with Cuba.",
        "So I think a revolution really wouldn't be defined by necessarily changing the government necessarily.",
        "I mean, let's say you had a dictator, so you throw him out, it is possible if you had a new dictator - as long as everybody in the government, from the dictator down, really wanted the best for the country and the people and you had a very low level of corruption, I think then you have a revolution.",
        "It's interesting you raise that.",
        "And Joseph Ellis, I'm going to turn to you on that.",
        "There is a moment after the military success in the American Revolution when the elite in London believes, well, clearly, Mr. Washington is going to become King Washington.",
        "That's right.",
        "And there was a movement in the Continental Army to try to get him to accept the crown and he simply refused to do it, saying that it would have been a betrayal of all the principles they thought they were fighting for.",
        "He then again stepped down from power at the end of the second term of his presidency, setting a precedent that we now enshrine in a Constitutional amendment.",
        "So I think that the constitutional provision in the Egyptian constitution that restricts the president to two terms; if they can enforce that, that is absolutely crucial because what the historical pattern is, some one leader becomes the face of the revolution - whether that's Napoleon or Lenin or Mao or Castro - and then some kind of dictatorial situation exists.",
        "There're very few people that step away from power.",
        "The only one besides Washington that I know of is Nelson Mandela.",
        "And we've got to create a situation in which every leader, no matter how crucial, is eminently disposable.",
        "And Deb Amos, let me turn back to you in Cairo.",
        "There is as yet no person who has assumed that role as the face of the revolution.",
        "No, but you make a very crucial point that is very relevant to this one.",
        "And that is, can people who can make a revolutionary act also make a conservative one as the revolution moves forward?",
        "And we don't know that yet and I'll tell you why it's important here.",
        "The largest Islamist group in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, they weren't so good at being revolutionaries.",
        "In fact, they were late to the square.",
        "They did come but that's not their business.",
        "They are good at the conservative act.",
        "They are good at organizing.",
        "They are good at running for elections.",
        "The revolutionaries, the Facebook generation, are very bad at conservative acts.",
        "They want people to continue to go out on the streets.",
        "They're calling for another million person march on Friday.",
        "I don't think it's going to happen.",
        "But they don't know how to organize into political parties.",
        "So, the question here is, yes, it's important that now for the first time the presidential term is only two.",
        "But much more important is what happens in the parliamentary elections.",
        "You know, the starting gun how gone off, and we are going to have an election here in September and the people who are the most organized are the Muslim Brothers and the old party of Mubarak, the National Democratic Party.",
        "They are still around, and they still are very good at what they do in the provinces.",
        "You know, what you have is, let's say a prominent family who can get you a job or make sure your kid gets into university or even elementary school, for that matter - those people will still run - maybe under another name, but they are still the National Democratic Party, as it was run before Mubarak fell.",
        "So here it's a little bit more complicated picture than simply how long the president runs, and whether there's a leader of a revolution who doesn't feel like moving away.",
        "Joseph Ellis, there were, you know, obviously, elections in this country before an election for president."
