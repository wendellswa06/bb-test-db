        "If you read the Declaration of Independence, it doesn't have very much good to say about kings or about executives.",
        "And the specter of monarchy hung over every conversation about executive power.",
        "If you actually read the American Constitution, its definition of the powers of the executive branch, it's extremely vague because they were afraid to give it much power for fear that we'll create another monarchical situation.",
        "So monarchy is very much on the defensive in the early years of the new American nation.",

        "And you know, I found it very interesting in that the successful revolutions in modern history have kind of had this mentality of a continuing revolution.",
        "So it's not just a quick revolution, turnover of government and then, you know, boom, you're done.",
        "But they have this, like, common goal.",
        "Like in Cuba, they've had this common goal of public education and public health.",
        "And whether or not the results, you know, show any positive change, there's been this rhetoric going on of progressive positive change for the people.",
        "And I think, in the Middle East, if they're going to be successful revolutions, they really have to amp up this rhetoric about common good for the people.",
        "Well, continuing revolution also, in addition to the social programs you talk about, Ian, it also justifies emergency decrees - and we're in a state of emergency - throughout the existence of the revolutionary state.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And interesting, getting back to you in Cairo, we're talking about emergency decrees there.",

        "Well, the good news, of course, is that there won't be an emergency decree during the elections.",
        "But here, I think, is a point -and I want to go back to something that Joseph Ellis was saying - and that is this tension when you keep thinking we don't want a king back, and so you limit the power of the president."

        "And that has certainly not happened in Tunisia or in Egypt, where 20 of the 21 governments in the region have armies and governments that are controlled by the United States.",
        "Controlled by the United States is pretty much of a leap there.",
        "But I get your point, Santiago, on fundamental change of ownership of land, banks, media.",
        "Deborah Amos, that has not happened in Egypt.",
        "It certainly hasn't, and that is a question here.",
        "You know, Egypt, over the years, has moved to what's called a neoliberal economy, you know, a more open economy, not state-controlled, although the better definition would be crony capitalism.",
        "There were many, many, many sweetheart deals if you were close to the president, and certainly people who are in the ruling party were the recipients of fabulous sweetheart deals on land, on running factories in this country.",
        "And there is - many people - there are many people who want a reckoning, want an accounting of where the money went.",
