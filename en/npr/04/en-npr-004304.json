        "Hi, Steve.",
        "That's a problem because Morales was hoping this vote would give him a strong mandate and give momentum to his campaign which is designed to transform Bolivia into a socialist state.",
        "His opponents, though, are expected to win, as I mentioned.",
        "And the polls were showing that they'd win big.",
        "At least some of them in some of those key states.",
        "And that means that Morales' influence wanes even more in those states that are stacked up against him already.",
        "Juan, is there any idea how the government would function if Morales stays in but the governors are all of the other party?",
        "Well Morales is right now extremely popular in the high Andean plains, which has very large indigenous communities.",
        "And so the concern is that he is going to lose power in those states and that he will not be recognized in those states.",
        "In other words, that he will be ruling for half the country.",
        "And the other half is in the hands of people who are basically trying to mount a movement against the president.",
        "So it sounds like race is also, also plays a role in this.",
        "Race does play a role.",
        "The government is very much allied with indigenous groups here; the Aymara and the Quechua, and other smaller groups.",
        "And Morales is himself is from the Aymara community.",
        "He argues that the opposition opposes him because of his race and because he speaks for the indigenous poor.",
        "And there's certainly an element of race in all of this.",
        "Many of the opposition leaders, though, not all are of European extraction.",
        "But I believe that some analysts also say that Morales has been using the race card to sow divisions and paint his foes as racist.",
        "So Juan, remind us again what it is about Morales that has enraged his opponents so much.",
        "Morales hopes to inject the state into the economy, that's basically it.",
        "He's already nationalized some industries and he hopes to step those nationalizations up.",
        "He wants to implement a very broad land reform.",
        "And he's also formed tight links with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela."

        "After 22 years in the U.S.",
        "Senate and four years as governor of Alaska, Frank Murkowski could be facing the prospect of life out of office.",
        "In order to win a second term as governor, he first must survive tomorrow's Republican primary, and his prospects look dim.",
        "Murkowski faces two strong competitors and a record that many voters in Alaska are unhappy with.",
        "Anne Sutton reports from Juneau on the governor's troubled campaign.",
        "It's hard for people to admit their faults, and I'm no different.",
        "In a recent campaign ad, Alaska Governor Frank Murkowski faces the camera and the voters head-on.",
        "It's become painfully obvious that many of you are questioning your support for me.",
        "Whatever the reason, I admit I am not perfect."

        "It's probably as close as Murkowski's come to publicly admitting his reelection bid is in trouble, but independent polls show the 73-year-old incumbent trailing well behind two Republican primary opponents, former Wasilla mayor Sarah Palin and Fairbanks businessman John Binkley.",
        "But his attempt at a mea culpa may not resonate with a lot of undecided voters.",
        "Busy new mom Laura Hosey(ph) is considering the alternatives.",
        "As far as I'm concerned, the current governor has done a lot of things wrong, so I would say someone who has done the opposite of what he has - or would do the opposite of what he has done and try and repair some of the damage that he has done.",
        "Murkowski's unpopularity might seem counterintuitive.",
        "Income from oil makes up 80 percent of state revenues and record prices have results in a hefty budget surplus, though it's taking a hit from the recent Prudhoe Bay shutdown.",
        "Meanwhile, Murkowski's been working to clench a deal to build a $25 billion natural gas pipeline to Canada.",
        "You'd think that would create some political capitol, says University of Alaska political science professor Clive Thomas.",
        "Generally speaking, governors would be popular in that period, however they came across.",
        "But that doesn't seem to work with Governor Murkowski for some reason.",
        "I think that personality is the thing that probably has put people off the most, I would say.",
        "Murkowski started alienating Alaskans right after his election as governor, with a series of unpopular decisions - from appointing his own daughter, Lisa Murkowski, to fill the remainder of his U.S.",
        "Senate term, to eliminating a bonus program for elderly Alaskans, to doggedly pursuing purchase of a $2.5 million state jet for his use as governor.",
        "His gruff and overbearing style also rubbed some people wrong, but the former banker is trying to convince voters to focus on the future instead.",
        "We're about to embark on the greatest significant event since statehood, and that's the gas line, because it'll anchor the economy into this state for the next 50 years.",
        "At this recent Public Television debate, he cast himself as the candidate best suited to bring a gas line to Alaska, and most likely in November to beat former two-term Governor Tony Knowles, the likely Democratic nominee who is seeking a comeback.",
        "So far, though, the Republican-led state legislature has criticized Murkowski's proposed gas line contract with three oil companies, and despite his efforts to push it through, law-makers have put off action until after the election.",
        "Although Murkowski has suggested in recent campaign ads that all he really needs is a personality transplant, voters will decide tomorrow if more radical surgery is necessary."

        "There were more than 40 different products that the company recalled, and some of them included Tylenol infant drops, from grape to cherry flavor, Tylenol, also a liquid - cherry blast was one of the flavors, a bubble gum flavor was another - and children's Motrin, similar flavor assortment, and children's Zyrtec, which, in allergy season, I think, is something people might be using more of these days.",

        "So quite a few lapses in what are considered to be the quality standards a company like J and J should uphold.",
        "And were people at home noticing problems with this?",
        "Yes, that, too.",
        "There were more than 40 reports from consumers of dark flecks or specs in these medicines that the FDA said hadn't been resolved.",

        "What should people do if they have some of these medicines at home?",
        "First, I guess, where would they go to find out which ones are the recalled ones, and then what to do?",
        "Right, the J and J Web site has a list of these products.",
        "Also the FDA has a lot of information on their Web site explaining what the problem is.",
