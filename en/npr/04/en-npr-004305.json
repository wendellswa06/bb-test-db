        "We reported here yesterday on the formal declassification and release of the Pentagon Papers and we spoke with the man who leaked that compilation of documents about the war in Vietnam back in June 1971, Daniel Ellsberg.",
        "Vietnam is a fiasco for 30 years, essentially, that would not have stood the light of public discussion if, I think, the very documents in the Pentagon Papers had been available during that time.",
        "Well, today, another voice on the Pentagon Papers - the man who was assigned by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara to compile them, Leslie Gelb.",
        "Before he became a New York Times correspondent and columnist, before he became an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Les Gelb was director of Policy Planning at the Defense Department from 1967 until 1969.",
        "He joins us now from New York, welcome.",
        "Thank you, Robert.",
        "And tell me first about the assignment you got, to put together what came to be known as the Pentagon Papers.",
        "Well, in June '67, I was asked to put together a group of six people to answer a hundred handwritten questions about the Vietnam War.",
        "They were questions like how do we know that the kill count is accurate, not made up; how do we know that the Strategic Hamlet Program is effective; how do we know that pacification could work; what about the effectiveness of bombing.",
        "These are all the questions you would ask if you went to a Pentagon press briefing.",
        "And the group of six and I got together and talked about it.",
        "And I sent a memo to McNamara, saying we could answer these questions the way they're always answered at press conferences and do it in less than three months.",
        "But if you want us to answer them seriously, we'd have to sequester some documents and do some studies and then get back to you - and here are the kinds of studies we would do.",
        "And at that point, McNamara approved the monographs that were to become the Pentagon Papers, and said write them and let the chips fall where they may.",
        "Now, we should just point out here that the kind of questions that you mentioned, in addition to being - as you say - news conference questions, tough ones, were also - this was the stuff of what people were asking and saying at teach-ins and the antiwar movement in the United States, in all the polemics about the Vietnam War, people were arguing about these things."

        "He says it demonstrates that the U.S.",
        "was lying and duplicitous about how we got involved in Vietnam; if the public had known about those lies - and he would count as a lie, not say the story of the Gulf of Tonkin, that U.S.",
        "warships had been attacked, but the certainty with which it was said that U.S.",
        "warships were attacked and the justification for military action.",
        "He says if all of that had been known, the Vietnam War never would've happened.",

        "In this case, though, according to documents, FEMA was lining up most of its emergency supplies after the storm.",
        "FEMA's purchasing department became so overwhelmed, they then asked another federal agency, the General Services Administration, for help.",
        "Among the essential items needed: $2 million worth of ready-to-eat meals, $92,000 worth of Gerber baby food, half a million dollars worth of medical supplies and hundreds of other items, all purchased without bidding.",
        "Former FEMA Director Michael Brown told Congress this week he couldn't explain why they had to spend $200,000 at the last minute for body bags at the full price.",
        "I don't know, and that was a mistake, one that we should look at and make sure we don't do in the future.",
        "We should've had the contract in place before Katrina made landfall.",
        "The documents show FEMA was scrambling for ice, long an agency mainstay.",
        "Ice is used to keep medicine fresh and bodies from decomposing.",
        "But Michael Brown said he doesn't think providing ice is essential.",
        "I don't think that's a federal government responsibility to provide ice to keep my hamburger meat in my freezer or refrigerator fresh."

        "FEMA couldn't have anticipated all the expenses, but Clark Kent Ervin, the former inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security, says most of the no-bid contracts are inexcusable.",
        "There were so many no-bid contracts that money was wasted that could have been better spent, and that adequate supplies were not prepositioned.",
        "But Ervin says there's also a bigger problem that needs to be resolved.",
        "FEMA didn't have the money that it needed in order to be adequately prepared, but FEMA is not unique in that regard.",

        "He added: there is no dictatorship here.",
        "The referendum was defeated by a vote of 51 to 49 percent.",
