        "Did the staff at Homeland Security's detention center respond properly and humanely when this elderly immigrant got sick?",

        "She runs a respected group called the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center.",

        "I routinely hear those kinds of things, Daniel, unfortunately.",
        "It's the number-one complaint we get from detainees whenever we visit them in any of the facilities that are housed in Florida.",

        "Kerion Dawkins and others say the riot squads swept through the cell blocks.",
        "The riot squad was in their riot gear: knee pads, elbow pads, helmet, a shield and their baton sticks, the nightsticks.",
        "They say guards pulled detainees out of their cells one by one and grilled them: `Was Richard Rust your friend?",
        "Do you have a problem with what happened?",
        "George Brown says a captain unlocked his and his cell mate's door.",
        "And then he looked at me and he go, `You looked pissed off, man,' and I said, `Yeah, I'm a little upset.",
        "He said, `About what?",
        "I said, `You know, Captain, you know, the things didn't run the way it's supposed to.",
        "He took us out--he said, `Come here.",
        "He took us inside a TV room and said to",
        "us, `You know, there are places much worse than this that a guy can go to them,' and that's when I got quiet 'cause I knew what he meant by that, you know.",
        "`You play by the rules and everything's OK,' he said, which I took as `Listen, man, keep your mouth shut.",
        "Be quiet, man, and don't say nothin.",
        "I'm not saying any more, man.",
        "That's a threat.",
        "The detainees say every immigrant who spoke out about Richard Rust got marched off to the hole, the box.",
        "Detainees say they lock you in a tiny cell without windows.",
        "They say the warden sent more than 50 detainees to the hole for weeks.",
        "And the man who led the prayer service for Rust had to stay in the box more than three months.",
        "But a few days after Rust died, dozens of detainees who didn't go to the hole got together and they wrote this plea to the outside world."
