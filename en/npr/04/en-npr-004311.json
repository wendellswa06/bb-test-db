        "Well, what do you say to people who say this: look, these people are here to fill a need.",
        "If they weren't welcome in some way, they wouldn't be here.",
        "In other words, they are in Georgia to work on the farms, to work in the factories, and that employers need these people here, otherwise they wouldn't be there.",
        "Well, you know, I know of no other employment scheme or employment situation where the excusable answer for violating a law is that you need to stay in business and you need to make a profit.",
        "The law is crystal clear, and it says that you are not allowed to knowingly hire someone that is here illegally.",
        "To simply ignore the law, and to ignore it in the way that we've ignored it now for the last 30 some odd years, and then to say, well, the problem's so big, we can't now follow the law.",
        "That is a dangerous precedent to set.",
        "If we had companies who were violating child labor laws, as opposed to illegal alien labor laws, I don't think people would stand by so willingly and just say, well you know, the profit motive is all that matters here.",
        "These companies can't make a profit unless they violate the law.",
        "It's a strange argument.",
        "What is your response to all the demonstrations?",
        "Georgia has had tens of thousands of people march in support of immigrant rights.",
        "What's been your reaction to these demonstrations?",
        "Well I've, to be honest, not really had much reaction to it.",
        "I'm all supportive of immigrant rights.",
        "I mean, we're a nation built on immigrants, and so I support every right for an immigrant.",
        "Now, someone who violates our border and comes into this country illegally and then demands to be treated in the same manner as a U.S.",
        "citizen or a legal immigrant, yeah, I have a problem with that.",
        "At times, I stand here in almost amazement at the argument on the other side.",
        "I mean, we allow more people to come here legally than the rest of the world.",
        "We have a process for doing that, and because you don't want to stand in line and wait behind everybody else, now you demand we give you special rights.",
        "And that's just puzzling to me, but I guess that's up for our Washington lawmakers to decide.",
        "I just know this, in Georgia, the law is what the law is, and we intend to enforce it.",
        "Well, the demonstrations have been aimed in part at persuading people such as yourself to back down a bit from the legislation they've proposed.",
        "The question I would ask those people is should we be giving benefits to people that aren't legally eligible to receive them?",
        "I mean, sometimes we need to turn the question on the person who's complaining.",
        "I mean, surely no one's arguing that we ought to give benefits to a person who doesn't legally--or is not legally eligible to receive those benefits.",
        "I mean, we don't live in Utopia.",
        "We live in a real world where there's a finite amount of resources, and it is completely appropriate for the state of Georgia to ask a person who's applying for benefits whether or not that person is eligible to receive them.",
        "U.",
        "MOHAMED: (Foreign language spoken).",
        "She did however take issue with our decision to include in the debate over tenure in the story.",
        "She, like many of you, felt we tried to pack too much into too little time.",
        "Ms. Verba concludes: Leave the hot button issues for another story, and help remind the public that we teachers are human beings, not budget items."

        "Ms.",
        "Simpson says she's lived in Kansas for more than 30 years, but grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area.",
        "And on hearing the sound of that coaster, she had a visceral reaction.",
        "The smell of salt, the tangy taste of Ruth's hot dog, the slight sting of a mild sunburn, and the clattering of the Giant Dipper inching its way to the top - I was driving down a country road outside of Lawrence, Kansas, and at the age of 60 I wanted to thrust both arms up into the air and scream we're going to die.",

        "If there's even one thing we can do to reduce this violence, if there's even one life that can be saved, then we've got an obligation to try.",

        "Who's responsible for most of the killing in these neighborhoods?",
        "The short answer is groups of extremely active street offenders.",
        "So you mentioned Chicago, and we've been doing work in the most dangerous neighborhood in Chicago - or at least, until recently was the most dangerous neighborhood - West Garfield Park.",
        "And it's a neighborhood of about 90,000 people.",
        "And my colleague Andrew Papachristos, at Yale, has identified a network of just a few thousand street offenders.",
        "It includes, if you go back five years, most of the homicides that have taken place in that neighborhood.",
        "Then, forgive me, why isn't it easier to just isolate them, pick them up on a gun charge, somehow prevent them from committing acts of violence?",
        "That doesn't work, in part because there is a street dynamic at work that will tend to produce more such groups and more such individuals.",
        "What we want to do is change their behavior.",
        "The basic framework that's being applied now all across the country is to sit down and speak with them.",
        "And that is done by community figures, by law enforcement, by social providers.",
        "And in various ways, that conversation goes: we know who you are, we know what you're doing, your community needs this to stop, we would like to help you if you will let us.",
        "And this is not a negotiation.",
        "We're not asking.",
        "And we're putting you on prior notice of the law enforcement consequences that will follow if your violence continues.",
        "And it turns out to be quite remarkably effective.",
        "Do you think any of President Obama's executive orders address this kind of daily gun violence?",
        "The elements of the packets that have the most to do with this kind of everyday street violence are expanding background checks and addressing firearms trafficking.",
        "The kind of street offenders that we've been talking about don't walk into sporting goods stores and buy their guns.",
        "They can't.",
        "Most of them already have extensive criminal records.",
        "So, people steal guns from houses and such and they end up on the street.",
        "And what we call the straw purchasers, in which people who are legally entitled to buy firearms do so and then sell them on the street.",
        "All of this has been enabled by the fact that there is what's called the secondary market in firearms, which allows private parties to sell guns without federal recordkeeping and background checks and by what turn out to be fantastically small penalties for firearms trafficking.",
        "You can sell a vial of crack on a street corner and get more jail time than by selling dozens of guns on that same street corner.",
        "And changing those things will help.",
        "But I have to ask: having done reporting in Englewood in Chicago, I certainly had the impression there's so many guns that if you're able to stop the trafficking tomorrow, there would still be millions of guns on the street.",
        "There are not as many guns on the street and it's not as easy for even seasoned bad guys to get them as people think.",
        "And it can be even more difficult for them to get ammunition.",
        "So, any economist will tell you that if you raise the price of something you will sell less of it.",
        "And we have not done very much to raise the price of illegal gun acquisition.",
        "What else do you think might help some?",
        "The more we have learned about how concentrated gun offending is - this is, for all practical purposes, entirely a problem of seasoned criminal offenders - gang activity and drug market activity and robbery, homicide, all that sort of thing - the more evident it's become that there are these very commonsense ways of intervening with them to quite dramatically sometimes reduce their violence.",
        "And the commonsense package on this has always been to work both sides.",
        "You do something about how to get guns and you do something about how they use guns."
