        "Yeah, pretty much the same way.",
        "I want to agree with Bob.",
        "There was, I think at the heart of this, though, something that really struck me that Barack Obama said, and it had to do with how do you campaign against the presumptive, the guy who's beginning to emerge on the Republican side, and that's John McCain.",
        "Hillary talked about the fact that she could hit the ground running at day one.",
        "And in fact, that she would be a good commander in chief.",
        "Barack said, no, no. That's not how I think to beat this guy.",

        "We need somebody to make the tremendous difference here.",
        "In other, words a commander of peace, if you will.",
        "I think that's the same mistake the Democrats made with Kerry, trying to compete with a president - a sitting president of the United States - by offering up somebody who could pursue the war better.",
        "I think that there's - a least some Democrats have learned that you got to go a different way, and this was one of the sharpest differences to me in this debate.",
        "Let's talk about this for a moment.",
        "I want to play a clip from John Edwards.",
        "In several previous debates, he tended to side with Obama to double team Clinton.",
        "But let's listen to this exchange between him and Obama last night.",

        "The question is, why would you, over 100 times, vote present?",
        "John…",

        "You've criticized me for our votes.",
        "Right.",
        "We've cast hundreds and hundred of votes.",
        "What you're criticizing her for, by the way, you've done to us, which is you pick this vote and that vote out of the hundreds that we've cast.",

        "I think that they're - John Edwards has had one strategy and that's to try to distinguish himself against both of these candidates.",
        "He tried to, first of all, by first appearing to side with Barack Obama.",
        "The objective there was to try to muzzle Hillary Clinton to the side.",
        "That really hasn't worked.",
        "And so now he finds himself having to confront Barack Obama to try to make him stand out.",
        "Now, looking at this debate last night, I think he did a tremendous job.",
        "As a matter of fact, some people say that he won it.",
        "So he's got the changed strategy and I think we're beginning to see that with this debate.",
        "Robert, there were issues that were discussed last night.",
        "Health care was certainly big, so was the economy.",
        "And, as a matter of fact, just this morning, the Federal Reserve slashed a key interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point.",
        "Who in your view seem to score the most points with their economic proposals during the debate?",
        "I would think Mrs. Clinton had the more detailed discussion of that.",
        "She's the first of the three to had actually advance an economic program, and she was much more - I thought she was much more sharper in her statement of her ideas.",
        "And Senator Obama and Senator Edwards were, in a sense, kind of playing catch-up.",
        "But, again, I think there's fundamental agreement on the need for a package - economic stimulus package to be passed fairly soon.",
        "But I thought she was a little bit better on that.",
        "You share that view, Ron?",
        "I think that at the time that they've all put out their plans -we're talking about a difference here of $45 billion, John Edwards up to $75 billion for Hillary Clinton.",
        "At the time they put them all out, almost simultaneously, she didn't have a rebate aspect of it.",
        "Barack Obama did, so she went back and released another version of her economic stimulus plan, which had a rebate package.",
        "Part of that, of course, was result that the Senate Joint Economic Committee had held hearings and the rebate package was talked about there - and this was after the last debate.",
        "The candidates keep saying that they want to keep race out of the presidential race, but all week we have seen how much Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton even John Edwards have campaigned specifically for the black vote, which in the state of South Carolina makes up about 50 percent of the voting block.",
        "Here's my question, Robert to you first: What about the remaining 50 percent?",
        "Are they mostly white and are they being left out of the equation?",
        "Well, they are all mostly white, and I think Obama has a paradox of a black man trying to run de-racialized campaign.",
        "He clearly needs to win South Carolina, and he needs to win it with a good share of the black vote.",
        "But I think he also needs to pick up a good share of the white vote.",
        "Otherwise, I think the Clintons, if he wins, will attempt to paint his victory as - they will attempt to diminish his victory if he wins largely on the basis of black support.",
        "And so I think that was a very, very delicate game he is trying to play, particularly in South Carolina.",
        "He wants to appeal to the black vote, but he wants to do it in such a way as to not appear - if I can say it this way - appear black or appears to be - or appear to be appealing to black interest per se.",
        "Things are very difficult project that he's involved in.",
        "We have about one minute left for this with you, Ron Walters.",
        "And it's - Robert mentioned that he felt that Barack Obama must win South Carolina.",
        "But John Edwards, who was born in that state and is the only Southerner in the Democratic race and who has not fared particularly well so far - he has to win or at least have a very good showing, doesn't he?",
        "And how far did last night's debate go toward that, about (unintelligible)?",
        "Well, I think John Edwards is out of this, quite frankly speaking, because he doesn't appear.",
        "If you look at the polling in the other Super Tuesday state, you don't really see a John Edwards campaign.",
        "And so he's hanging on, hoping that he's going to be able to pick up some place, but he needed to score well on the debate last night.",
        "He did.",
        "But the politics of the matter, I don't think, is going to help him very much.",
        "I was surprised that this debate last night didn't lean more heavily on issues related to the African-American experience given the fact that they were sponsored by the Congressional Black Caucus.",
        "But I think one of the reasons that you didn't hear that was precisely what Bob said.",
        "Here's is very delicate balance that they have to walk, and so this debate, as far as Barack Obama is concerned and perhaps some of the others, could not be too, I think, unbalanced on the side of the black community."
