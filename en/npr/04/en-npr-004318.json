        "A Hugo is like a Pulitzer but from the World Science Fiction Society.",
        "I told Michael Chabon that his book sure doesn't sound like science fiction.",
        "Well, the book is flexible or agile in its approach to literary genres, but I think, more than anything else that's a mark of how flexible those genre distinctions can be and are.",
        "And I mean so, you know, the world of science fiction or let's call it the territory of science fiction has very porous boundaries.",
        "And there's definitely room in it for a work of alternate history, which is sort of the portal into which this novel passes into the land of science fiction.",
        "Your alternate history here is pretty - pretty alternate.",
        "Just a quick sketch?",
        "Well, you know, all alternate history, I think if it's done in the usual manner, it all starts with one change, one small difference.",
        "In the case of this novel, there was this bill that was introduced into Congress in 1940 and it would've allowed an unspecified but presumably rather large number of Jewish refugees from Europe to enter into the United States before, this is actually before the U.S.",
        "entered World War II.",
        "And it proposed allowing them to settle in Alaska on a temporary basis just as kind of a shelter to get them out of harm's way.",
        "But in the world of this novel, the plan actually eventually comes to pass, and as a result you have ultimately, if you combine the immigration before the war and then the people who came after the conclusion of the war, you end up with a couple million people living up there in Sitka, Alaska.",
        "Can I ask you, what do you think of other work that's going on in science fiction right now?",
        "Do you read science fiction?",
        "Yes I do.",
        "I still read science fiction, and I see all of kinds of diversity.",
        "I think - I find a very intense ongoing kind of intellectual and aesthetic debate in the world of science fiction.",
        "The people who are reading it and the people who are writing it seem to me to be engaged in an ongoing conversation about the fiction that they love on a level that I think is enviable, that would be a credit to the world of mainstream fiction.",
        "I understand the Coen brothers are working on a movie of your novel."

        "So to put that in plain English, that means Congress gave the Trump administration $1.6 billion this March for border funding.",
        "Correct.",
        "OK.",

        "It's not supposed to be for a newly constructed wall along the lines of what the president has been advocating for.",
        "So how does he get the other half?",
        "How did he bump it up to 3.2 billion?",
        "We think what he was doing was he was adding in a $1.6 billion amount that was in a Senate spending bill proposal which was not actually passed and signed into law.",
        "He sort of jumped the gun and said that we've already got this money.",
        "Well, that version of the bill is several versions too old.",
        "And we still haven't gotten any additional 1.6 billion.",
        "Do we know if the Trump administration has spent all of the money that's been allocated for the border in 2018?",
        "That's a good question, and the accounts differ.",
        "Democrats say that they've spent only a tiny fraction of that.",
        "But it's a little confusing because I think probably the different sides may have different definitions of what counts as a border wall.",
        "So it's really hard to piece together.",
        "Let me move you to the question of whether a lot of work has already been done on the wall, another claim from the president that you were fact checking.",
        "Back in March, he was tweeting out photos that he said show the start of the border wall.",
        "What do those photos show?",
        "So those actually show a replacement of an estimated 2.25-mile border wall in Calexico, Calif., that was originally built in the 1990s."
