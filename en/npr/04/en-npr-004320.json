        "It's going to cost us about 2,400 bucks in fuel, food and ice.",
        "And how much of that 2,400 bucks is fuel, and then, you know, what are you paying per day?",
        "Oh, I would say 2,200 of it was for fuel.",
        "That leaves $600 for myself, another man and the expense and cost of a boat.",
        "So Pearce just spent three days at sea working around the clock and doesn't have much to show for it.",

        "Go back five or six years and he'd have had another $1,500 in his pocket, because back then...",
        "I was paying below a dollar a gallon for fuel, and right now I think it's around 4.25, 4.30 a gallon.",

        "I mean, those high prices you were talking about in the '70s, everyone got the fear of God in them, and Detroit began, with a little prodding from Congress, began making fuel-efficient cars, consumers began behaving as if there was an end to oil.",
