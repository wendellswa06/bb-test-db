        "We'll try to fix that.",
        "Okay, thank you.",
        "And yes, immigration reform did produce a lot of pushback before, but I think that people do have a sense that Obama is pushing too far.",
        "On the other hand, this is really a difference of degree, not of kind.",
        "Obama is a standard-issue liberal, and the right has not been accustomed to this, and I think they are overdoing the threat that he poses.",
        "Let's get another caller in on the conversation, and we'll go to Mary(ph), Mary with us from Sonoma.",
        "Good afternoon, thank you for taking my call.",
        "I really have strong fears that the vitriol we're seeing has been unmatched in this country except for the times of our North against South, which of course led to a Civil War.",
        "And right now with the price of fuel, I just spoke with my boat broker this morning about selling my small boat, and he said nobody's buying anything, boats, permits, anything.",

        "I've had people key my truck, and it is it's a situation, I believe, where the majority of Americans feel as though our Congress is not governing with the consent of the governed.",
        "And I only thank God that those of us that are conservatives, patriots, are the ones who advocate and uphold the Second Amendment because I believe we may see, if this economy is allowed to collapse because of the socialist leanings of this government, that we will end up having to be the armed militia that the Constitution laid out for us.",
        "That's certainly worrisome.",
        "You know, those types of sentiments I think are worrisome, and I do fault a lot of talk radio hosts for turning Obama into the very embodiment of the left and of socialism.",
        "I just think that that's a grotesque exaggeration.",
        "You know, we've had a highly regulated economy for the last three decades, and Medicare was a massive government program.",
        "And for the right to complain about cutbacks in Medicare I think is a little hypocritical because they now are claiming it's an entitlement.",
        "Mary, we're up against the break, but thank you very much for the call, appreciate it, and we hope the situation in your case calms down.",
        "Getting your car keyed is no fun and certainly not getting apples thrown at you, appreciate it."

        "Well, certainly.",
        "I think the comparisons with the 1960s make a lot of sense.",
        "But in terms of the real violent rhetoric and the anti-statist rhetoric coming from some critics, if we go back to the era of reconstruction, 1865 to 1877, and then the period after, the period of redemption, we really do see at the local level people trying to take matters into their own hands and really being critics of the ratification of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, which basically provide for emancipation, citizenship and voting suffrage for black males."

        "And by the time we get to the 1950s and '60s, what we're seeing is that Jim Crow regime in its modern face, and that's where we think about King and Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson and civil rights marches.",

        "Yes, absolutely.",
        "And you know, what I'd like to chime in with is the point that the current mood, I think, is influenced by a lot of anxiety over the economy and people fearful about losing their jobs, losing their income, and this of course always heightens the tensions and worries in the country.",
        "What's really amazing to me is that, for example, in the 1930s when we went through that awful economic collapse, there were radical voices out there that were so pronounced and calling for really a kind of upheaval that could have transformed the society.",
        "And yet, and yet there is a kind of mooring to our system, the institutions that we continue to live by, that seem to hold us together.",

        "So, I mean, I think there are always social discontents in this country that add to this, but so far, at least, the institutions that bind the country together seem to be stronger than those that tear it apart.",

        "I think the reality, again in the '60s, when you had youth saying, you know, let's drop out of society and join and ashram and challenging bourgeois values of hard work and self, you know, deferred gratification, that really was a challenge to American society.",
        "I think today you have hot heads and hot voices, and I think again, talk radio can be a poison on the land, but basically the conservatives and liberals lead fairly similar lives.",
        "They embrace similar values, and we all are Americans.",
        "I mean, Obama is an American, and to demonize him I think is a big mistake.",
        "And we are going to pull through this.",
        "Again, this recent health care bill, it is extremely unfortunate that Congress and the president decided to ignore public opinion, but it is an extension of a part of American politics that we've lived with for a long time, which is the liberal notion that it can knows better than market players about how to regulate the economy.",
        "So I think, you know, we'll survive this, and I think ultimately, despite the hot rhetoric, people really do, I hope, understand that our institutions are strong.",
        "And the solution is the ballot box, not throwing bricks through windows, which is simply atrocious behavior."

        "My comment was that I think that a lot of the problems that we're seeing, whether you look at the vitriol about health care most recently or immigration coming up, or if you tied this to any of the periods in American history, it seems to me that you could look at those most contentious and divisive periods as periods where the federal government made some kind of decisive policy decision for everybody.",
        "So for all the talk about diversity and the exacerbation of, you know, the differences between people, you know, there didn't seem to be this kind of vitriol when Massachusetts enacted health care across the state because you could say, well, you know, that's them.",

        "Oh, yeah, absolutely.",
        "So we've got a mechanism to handle a lot of these disagreements, which are going to be more and more exacerbated by increasing diversity in the country, and that is the mechanism of federalism by allowing states and local governments to make those decisions for themselves.",
        "Well, let me put this thesis to Peniel Joseph.",
        "In the '60s, of course, you had people reacting, as you suggested, to the civil rights legislation.",
        "You also had people reacting to the federal government's role in enacting and enforcing the draft and the war in Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, whipsawed between two fires.",
        "Well, this is really about a debate at its core between what kind of democracy are we going to have.",
        "When we look at the Tea Partiers, they're going back to we talk about Senator Calhoun of South Carolina and Calhoun conservatives who have a very specific vision of American democracy, the talk about nullification, 1830s, don't believe in the rights of citizenship for blacks, voting rights for women.",
        "Then there's another vision, expansive vision, of American democracy, that I would argue in the 20th century is crystallized in FDR's New Deal.",
        "Even presidents like Harry S.",
        "Truman and Dwight Eisenhower actually further consolidate the New Deal, massive expenditures for highways and for the suburbanization of America, continued industrialization of America.",
        "And then what Lyndon Johnson does in 1965 with Medicare and Medicaid and immigration reform and the Voting Rights Act, which is passed on August 6th, 1965, is consolidate a further extension of that New Deal.",
        "What's interesting about Obama is that Obama becomes somebody who is thwarting what Ronald Reagan did, because Ronald Reagan is really a behemoth in terms of our history.",
        "He's a monumental figure because what he did was constrain the growth of government by arguing that big government did not work.",
        "What Obama does...",
        "Not the solution, it's the problem."
