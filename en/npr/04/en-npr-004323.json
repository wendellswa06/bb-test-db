        "It's the problem.",
        "What Obama does 27 years later in his inauguration speech, 28 years later, he says it's not about whether government is too big or small, it's about whether or not it works.",
        "And so what we see with the health care passage is the biggest piece of social legislation in the past 45 years, and implicitly, it's a piece of legislation that's trying to end the yawning gap between the haves and have-nots.",
        "But if all goes well, even a pork pie salesman will have a nice nest egg to help with retirement in 20 or 30 years.",
        "In the U.S., more companies are starting to auto enroll employees on their own.",
        "And at least a few members of Congress are interested in a law like the U.K.'s.",
        "Chris Arnold.",
        "NPR News, London.",
        "We have the biggest social inequality and economic inequality gap in America since the Gilded Age.",
        "And what this bill does is really try to have a vision of American democracy that's very expansive, that's very multicultural, multiclass, multi-generational.",
        "Think of the young people who are going to be able to be on their parents' insurance until the age of 26.",
        "So this is continuing FDR's vision without - people have criticized Obama for not having a big vision, a big picture.",
        "We can say - we can see what kind of liberal he is just through this enactment of health care.",
        "He doesn't have to call it the Great Society.",
        "He doesn't have to say he's going to do a war on poverty, and quite frankly, that wouldnt work in our current political climate.",
        "I'm sure Heather Mac Donald has a different characterization of the -what's happened in the past couple of weeks and, indeed, the Obama presidency.",
        "But, nevertheless, I did want to ask you, Heather Mac Donald, about - it does seem that there are periods - and Greg, thanks very much for the phone call -periods of reaction in - after long periods of Republican rule when a Democrat takes office, and you saw this in Clinton years, too.",
        "There were - there was visceral reaction to a Democratic president then, who had - he tried get health care through but, otherwise, more - less ambitious goals than Barack Obama.",
        "Well, I think both sides suffer from amnesia.",
        "They forget that they're engaged in the exact same behavior that they criticize their opponents of engaging in in the previous administration.",
        "So I - you know, I would hope that conservatives or Republicans would be a little more rational about themselves and about the opposition.",
        "The demonization of Clinton was way over the top and so, when liberals now said that the criticism of Obama is race-based, they forget that Clinton was accused of simply wild, you know, crimes that was - without any evidence whatsoever.",
        "And also, conservatives forget that they were very hotheaded about criticism of Bush.",
        "I think the media, too, is a little bit unself-aware because I don't remember outlets like NPR brewing so much about accusations like Naomi Wolfs against Bush that he was leading us to fascism and that Republican poll watchers were the equivalent brownshirts.",
        "So, you know, what feels extreme to a certain extent is based on your own political outlook.",
        "And where you sit, yeah.",
        "It may seem to many people that, say, opposition to racial preferences is an attack on the very core of civil rights, and that that is something that is deplorable.",
        "Other people might say that that analogy is extremist.",
        "So I do think that both sides tend to forget their own tendency towards extreme rhetoric when theyre not - when they're on the receiving end of it.",
        "We're talking with Heather Mac Donald of the Manhattan Institute, with historian Robert Dallek and historian Peniel Joseph.",
        "Youre listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News."

        "Sure.",
        "In some ways, what is happening now does remind me of the civil rights era of the '60s.",
        "I have looked at some of the news reports when they have the shots of the people holding their signs.",
        "And a lot of those signs are very racist slogans about Obama, and we can't deny that.",
        "And some of these same people who say these racist things or have these racist signs or who curse Obama, if you ask them if they were a Christian, they would say, I'm a Christian and I'm not racist.",
        "I was appalled that Sarah Palin advised the Tea Party folks to - not to retreat but to reload.",
        "When I hear the word reload, I think of a gun.",
        "I mean, that certainly, to me, did not send a very positive message.",
        "Well, let me ask Robert Dallek.",
        "There was interestingly a figure that we can cite from both examples, of course, that's John Lewis who was - we had on this program, remembering the 1965 march in Selma, across the Edmund Pettus Bridge when he was, of course, beaten and eventually made that march.",
        "But, of course, he was among those in Congress just this past weekend who was on the receiving end of some nasty epithets.",
        "The difference, Robert Dallek, is in those days that John Lewis was an outsider, very much a young organizer, and now is one - a long-established member of Congress, an exemplar of the state.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's a very good point.",
        "There has, of course, been a huge sea change in this country in terms of race relations.",
        "Again, I don't want to be Pollyannaish or suggest that there's no racism in this country.",
        "There is plenty of it, but the tone of things is very different in that regard - and as I said before, the very fact that we could have an African-American as a president.",
        "You know, Neal, I think in part all these rhetorical outbursts that we get in the country may be a way of giving people a catharsis rather than, you know, going to the extremes and doing violent things which, of course, occasionally does happen, but the rhetoric may be a form of outlet.",
        "I think back to the French novelist Honore de Balzac, who once said that praise be for the taverns in France, that the working folks would go there on weekends and work of all sorts of energy by drinking.",
        "And he said, if it werent for that, we'd have a revolution in France every Monday morning.",

        "It's so hyperbolic and unnecessary and unproductive of anything, and does add to the tensions and agitation in the country.",
        "And it will be interesting to see if this kind of intensity can be sustained between now and November, the next election day, whether this is going to be one arc moving up through a long summer or whether this is going to be something that is episodic and sporadic.",
