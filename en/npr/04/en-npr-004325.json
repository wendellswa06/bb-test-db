        "At least 32 million Americans will do that, suffer depression, over a lifetime.",
        "Antidepressants use shot up from about 13 million Americans taking the pills in 1996, to 27 million in 2005 - making depression, anti-depression pills, the most commonly prescribed type of medication in America, according to a recent study.",

        "Dr.�GREENBERG: Well, I named the book \"\"Manufacturing Depression\"\" because, like many people, I lived through the last couple of decades, during which those antidepressant figures skyrocketed.",
        "The number that you gave, the doubling as of 2005, is actually a quadrupling since the mid-1980s, and while I noticed there was a great deal of controversy about the use of the drugs and what they did and whether they should be prescribed, I also noticed that the idea about what depression was, was changing at the same time.",
        "And it occurred to me that the just as the pills had been invented, so, in some ways, the idea of depression had been invented.",
        "What do you mean, changing?",
        "Give me an idea.",
        "Dr.�GREENBERG: How the idea how depression had changed?",
        "Yeah, the definition of it.",
        "Dr.�GREENBERG: Largely, what had changed was the question of how common it was and how easily it could be seen.",
        "Those skyrocketing antidepressant numbers were also accompanied by skyrocketing epidemiological figures, which seemed to show that more and more people were afflicted with depression.",
        "And there were a number of ways to account for that, all of which may be true: better reporting, better testing, better surveillance.",
        "But it also was clear, particularly given the recent changes in the way psychiatric diagnoses are made, that in a way, the diagnosis had been tailor-made to the drugs.",
        "And moreover, the diagnosis had been made in such a way that if you showed certain symptoms, then regardless of where those symptoms came from, how you might come by them, what they might mean, then de facto, you were depressed.",
        "So the disease consisted of the symptoms, and the symptoms consisted of the disease.",
        "So, is ordinary human sadness being erased by a depression diagnosis, then?",
        "You're feeling sad?",

        "I think what happens is that there's, among people who might be sad, who might be demoralized, I think more and more, given the way that this message has gotten out, I think people you sort of have to consider it.",
        "If you're feeling bad and you're feeling demoralized and you're feeling apathetic and you're feeling sad for a long period of time, chances are very good that you're at least going to consider that there's something wrong with you that should take you to your doctor.",
        "And if you go to your doctor and complain about those things, chances are very good that he's going to tell you yes, indeed, you have this biochemical imbalance, and there are drugs which we can use to treat it.",
        "There's a pill for that.",
