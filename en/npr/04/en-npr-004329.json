        "I think part of what has happened is due to medication, that when you have something that is reasonably effective and doesn't have terrible side effects, and it treats conditions that are common, you know, you see those conditions more.",
        "Now, we can have the discussion about how effective the antidepressants are, but I think in general, if you're depressed, and it's really harming your life, this is a better time to be alive than any time in history.",
        "But starting that discussion, there was there's a famous article, I'm sure you are aware of, in the Journal of the American Medical Association that says that for people with these mild depressions or moderate depressions, that the antidepressants are no more effective than just taking a placebo.",
        "You take either the pill - it could be a placebo - or the medicine, and they just have about the same effect.",
        "Mr.�KRAMER: Yeah, and I don't buy that study.",
        "There are detailed, statistical reasons why that study is problematic, but let me say what I think the field sees.",
        "It looks as if antidepressants are good for specific, very tough types of depressions, so the kind of depression you have after a stroke, the kind of depression you take with anti-cancer you get when you take certain anti-cancer medication, postpartum depressions, the severe depressions that show up as being reasonably well-treated in that JAMA article.",
        "It's also good for chronic, mild depressions.",
        "If you look at the JAMA article, they start out by saying they're going to get rid of all studies of chronic, recurrent, minor depression, which is probably what most of what psychiatrists see because it's well-established that antidepressants work for that.",
        "It look as if depression antidepressant drugs have effects on people's personality styles, making them more assertive, and that seems to be true both for people who have depression over a broad range of depressive illness, and for -probably - normal people with nothing wrong with them.",
        "Also, these medicines are useful in a range of disorders, anxiety disorders, very serious mental illnesses that have anxiety or depression as components.",
        "So there's this one little hole that's complained about in the JAMA article, which in the end, you know, they screened 2,000 studies of depression and ended up focusing on six studies of two medications.",
        "So in this small study, they said the less-severe depressions that aren't recurrent don't respond well to these medications.",
        "And that very narrow finding, you know, appears in the newspapers.",
        "There's, you know, a cover of Newsweek saying that antidepressants don't work.",
        "And it seems to me both, you know, very unlikely.",
        "How could that be?",
        "It works in animal models and so on.",
        "How could that be?",
        "And also, you know, a little off to the side, most people getting antidepressants are not in that category, and most people with depression aren't getting antidepressants, which is probably more the problem."

        "Gary, would you say that they're overprescribed, though, with all those people getting all that medication?",

        "I think that the disease is overdiagnosed, and I think that's actually a much more fundamental problem.",
        "I think that the JAMA article is one of a series of articles that indicates that there's a distressing lack of robust effect for antidepressants in clinical studies.",
        "That wasn't the first article to say that they don't do much better than placebo.",
        "More just about half of the clinical trials for the antidepressants that have been approved failed to distinguish the antidepressant from the placebo.",
        "But it's possible that what's going on is something like what Peter just said, which is that these drugs are doing something for people.",
        "It's just that the Hamilton Depression Scale isn't measuring it, that in fact what's happening is that we've got a mismatch between diagnosis and drug, and that the diagnosis in some ways and I write about this in my book the diagnosis in some ways gives cover for people to take the drugs and physicians to prescribe them.",
        "But when you actually go to measure depression and the effect of antidepressants upon it, you don't get a good reading of what the antidepressants are doing.",
        "Trying to measure what the antidepressants are doing with the Hamilton is like looking for feathers with a magnet.",
        "So what we have is a drug that we don't maybe we dont understand very well, what it's actually doing.",
        "We don't have a good phenomenology of the way it alters our consciousnesses.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number, and there's some dispute about even how the drugs work in your brain, what they're doing in your brain -antidepressants.",
        "Dr.�GREENBERG: I think it's fair to say that nobody knows all of the implications of what we do understand about what antidepressants do in the brain.",
        "We know that they change metabolism of certain neurotransmitter systems, but we don't really it's a black box.",
        "You put the pill in, you get the behavior or the experience out, but nobody really understands exactly why that happens.",
        "Peter, you agree?",
        "Dr.�KRAMER: Well, I think that's right, although I think we know more and more and that - my fear is that the public thinks that the news about antidepressants has been really bad over the past 10 years, that these medicines look worse and worse.",
        "You know, they foment suicide, their withdrawal effects and so on.",
        "And I think most of the bad news about antidepressants, and most of the news about how they compare to placebos, was really out, with some exceptions, really has been available for 10 years, and what the news of the last 10 years concerns is just how these medicines work.",
        "You know, in the first instance, they change the way the brain handles these neurotransmitters.",
        "But it looks as if downstream, they really make the brain more resilient in certain ways."

        "That's our, sort of, working definition of disease.",

        "You teach people that there is a disease out there that the drug works for.",
        "And there was a doctor named Frank Ayd who was sort of the Johnny Appleseed of depression.",
        "He wrote a book called \"\"Recognizing the Depressed Patient.\"\" He wrote that book for Merck, and Merck distributed 50,000 copies of it to doctors across the country.",

        "And Peter, how hard is it to diagnose depression in patients, and what level they have it?",
        "Dr.�KRAMER: Well, I think one of the conveniences of this cookbook form of diagnosis is that it does make it easier for doctors in general to see depression.",
