        "That's her, Susan Stamberg, 31 years old, making her on-air NPR debut.",
        "Dr.�KRAMER: Right.",
        "Well, you know, I think there's all this worry about loss of sadness, and the there's a book about the loss of sadness by Jerome Wakefield and Alan Horowitz - which I disagree with - which says that depression is more and more impinging on sadness.",
        "And if you look at the categories that these, you know, psychologists and social workers, sociologists, raise as possible areas where sadness is kind of getting smaller and depression is getting larger, and you actually look at the data on patients, it turns out these patients aren't getting medication.",
        "Many of them aren't getting psychotherapy, either.",
        "But the kind of person who comes in with a concrete problem, where, you know, they just lost a job, they're only within a couple of weeks of the loss, they're feeling awful, they don't mostly walk out of doctors' offices with medication.",
        "So I think that, you know, the problem still remains more or less on the other side, that if you take kind of broad definitions of what's adequate treatment, a few weeks of a medication or four or five visits with a psychotherapist, very few people who meet this broad definition of depression are getting that treatment.",
        "And if you look at specialized groups like African-Americans, Mexican-Americans and so on, almost nobody's getting even a little adequate treatment.",
        "Is that because they are not showing up in the offices, or they're just not being treated well?",
        "Dr.�KRAMER: It's a mixture.",
        "Partly, you know, the drop-off occurs at every stage.",
        "First of all, even using these broad definitions, most people who are diagnosable with depression at all have severe depression.",
        "I mean, that's really where people cluster whom you find when you go door to door.",
        "But you know, it used to be said that about half of people with depression aren't diagnosed; about half of those aren't treated; and then looking at the last quarter, about half of those are treated adequately.",
        "So about one in eight people, it used to be said, was being treated adequately.",
        "And now we're maybe up to about one in five.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "Gary?",
        "Dr.�GREENBERG: Well, I think that there's the numbers of people who are diagnosed and the way that people are treated, those numbers don't line up very well.",
        "I think that's undeniable."

        "I also think that you've got a problem here because the disease that we're looking for, the kind of disease that we're looking for - that is to say, the kind with a biochemical pathogen - is only one kind of disease.",
        "Disease can also be seen as a way for as a form of suffering that we consider worthy of devoting social resources to relieving.",
        "And when you start to ask questions about people who are disadvantaged, people who are out of jobs and so on, their unhappiness there is a very important the fact that so many people can be diagnosed with depression may be an indication of a social problem, rather than some kind of epidemic of brain pathology.",
        "And one of those just this week was talked about.",
        "There was a study out just this week in the Journal of Psychotherapy linking obsessive Internet use and depression.",
        "Dr.�GREENBERG: Yes, and so do you you know, the standard question is: Is the Internet use causing the depression, or is the depression causing the Internet use, right?",
        "But they could both be indicative - the correlation could be indicative of something even further underlying, people who are feeling detached and alienated.",
        "That was the Journal of Psychopathology; I misspoke.",

        "Let's go to Sheila(ph) in Cleveland.",
        "Hi, Sheila.",
        "Hi, how are you?",
        "Hi there.",
        "We have, or I have a situation at home where I had my husband and two sons both go through short- and long-term periods of depression that did require treatment.",
        "And what was interesting is on my side of the family now mind you, you know, this is in my home, I'm living with these individuals, raising my boys - and on my side of the family, there's nothing, but on my husband's side of the family, there is some a severe chain of mental illness.",
        "His mother is schizophrenic; there was suicide, his uncles, his grandfather.",
        "So there is a weakness there that I often feel the boys possibly inherited.",
        "So I'd like to address the question of, you know, can it be genetically passed down?",
        "And in the instance of my husband, he's on long-term treatment and he absolutely - the drugs that - the medication that he's on have been - have been a savior.",
        "They saved his life.",
        "He was getting to the point where he could not function.",
        "You know, we're not just talking about sad on cloudy days, but we're talking about ceasing to do all the things in life that give a person joy and that he is capable of doing.",
        "And with my sons, they both incurred the problem as they went into their teenage years.",
        "And medication, shorter term, in the sense of, you know, like a six- to eight-month period for my one son and about a year for my other, managed to allow them to cope through the day as they fought through these situations and got on the other side of the issues, but it's very disruptive.",
        "So I'm curious about the genetic factor."

        "First of all, I'm so glad that Sheila called in, because we have been talking sort of up in the air, and these are serious disorders that affect people very gravely - are very disruptive to families or tough to deal with.",
        "And I think Sheila was talking about the level of depression that all the studies we're talking about count as major depression, that most cultures count of some kind of an illness and where the drugs, you know, have - medications have been shown to work.",
        "The depression is reasonably heritable.",
        "I mean, this question of what identical twins have and non-identical twins have less in common is interesting in mental illness - some things you think of maybe is less heritable or more so, so things like attention deficit disorder and autism, and that range of disorders are highly heritable.",
        "Depression is about at the level of things like common forms of diabetes.",
        "So it's fairly heritable.",
        "But you know, that being said, you can have an identical twin who's depressed and never be depressed.",
        "And partly that's because environment really does play a role, that we know that things like, you know, losing a job, terrible things like sexual or child abuse, trauma, that all kinds of losses and stressers have something to do with depression.",
        "And then when people are made vulnerable, ordinary stressers seem to have some effect.",

        "I'm glad to hear Mr. Greenberg address, you know, the possibility that depression is - has social factors that are accounting for the rise in diagnosis, as well as the manufacturing kind of angle I enjoy hearing about that.",
        "The other question I want to raise is the fact that, you know, we're treating depression primarily with an antidepressant rather than looking at depression as a multisystemic disease within the body, and really going after addressing factors like inflammation.",
        "You know, excess levels of arachidonic acid and low levels of vital omega-3s can lead to inflammation.",

        "The people that might be getting diagnosed with other kinds of depressions, if we had a way to distinguish them, might be people who are suffering from troubles like - can we imagine how much less depression would there be if we all didn't have to walk around worrying about paying for health care, paying for tuition, paying for retirement, if we didn't have to think about how we were going to run our households with two people working and still have time for our children.",
        "And the kinds of things that people complain to me about in my office, who would certainly qualify for some diagnosis of depression, are social issues.",
        "And our society doesn't do a very good job of taking care of people.",
        "Instead, what we do is, we have people look at increasingly - at their molecular biology, which very few of us have the capacity to understand, and say OK, the way to deal with that is to change your molecular biology.",
