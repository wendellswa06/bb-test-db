        "Is it just the president tweeting?",
        "It sounds like we're actually going to get some official guidelines here.",
        "What do they mean for transgender soldiers who are openly serving?",
        "Well, right.",
        "Well, first of all, this was reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by NPR.",
        "It appears that the new guidelines will ban openly transgender people from enlisting but leave it to Defense Secretary Mattis to determine whether or not to remove those already serving.",
        "Now, people who know Mattis say he takes the idea of service very seriously.",
        "He won't quickly kick out someone who raises a right hand and wants to join the military.",
        "He doesn't want to break faith with those in the ranks.",
        "But the White House wants him to assess whether a transgender service member is deployable.",
        "There could be possible medical issues that prevent deployment.",
        "And Mattis has said already on this issue that what's important is the readiness and lethality of the military.",
        "OK.",
        "So Mattis is going to have a lot of decision making when it comes to people who are openly serving now, but in terms of people enlisting, it sounds like that might stop.",
        "So that could really impact the recruitment of transgender people.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "They're basically saying, we don't want any more transgendered people enlisting in the military.",
        "That's the key point there."

        "One officer I spoke with yesterday estimated a thousand transgender folks in the military of more than 2 million.",
        "Advocates say the number could be up to 15,000.",
