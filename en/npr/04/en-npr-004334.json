        "He would frequently get together with Jim Angleton, who was chief of CIA Counter Intelligence.",
        "And they go out to Georgetown and have wonderful dinners and wine together.",
        "And Angleton never realized that here was a fellow sitting across from him who wasn't simply a top official in British intelligence, but also a spy for the Soviet Union.",

        "Airbus was once a European success story, but it's been struggling over the last year.",
        "It stunned investors in June by saying its new 555 seat A380 plane would be delayed in production by a year.",
        "The June announcement led to the ouster of the previous head of Airbus, who was replaced by Christian Streiff.",
        "Then, just this month, Airbus announced production delays would be even longer.",
        "And now, just three months into the job, Streiff himself has resigned.",
        "The problems in rolling out the super jumbo have been blamed on Airbus's corporate structure.",
        "It was formed by a group of European companies, and insiders say the lines have been blurred as to who should report to whom.",
        "Christian Streiff, a Frenchman, had also unnerved German politicians and unions by suggesting that work on the new A380 be transferred to France from Germany.",
        "Streiff has been replaced by Louis Gallois, another Frenchman, but one who enjoys better relations with the Germans.",
        "He immediately warned there were likely to be painful job losses as the company restructures.",
        "Airbus's problems have in recent months caused the company to fall further behind its main rival, Boeing.",
        "To date this year, Boeing has taken three times as many orders as Airbus.",

        "Well, bad news for those of you who take politics seriously, because a new study published this week in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that rapid judgments of how confident a politician look, people were making this incredibly fast, split-second judgments by just looking at the picture of somebody and saying, hmm, I vote for that person, or I wouldn't vote for that person.",
        "And the glance can only last for as little as one-tenth of a second.",
        "Wow.",

        "Give us a little thumbnail synopsis of what you did.",
        "Oh, the experimental paradigm is very simple.",
        "Participants are presented with standardized pictures of the winner and runner-up for various elections and we asked them to make a single judgment - who looks more competent.",
        "And we always exclude participants who recognize any of the faces.",
        "So ultimately, whatever judgments we get, they are based solely on facial appearance and not on prior knowledge of the candidate.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And so you ran these pictures by them.",
        "That's right.",
        "And basically, on average, the average participants can predict accurately about 56 percent of the races.",
        "But if you aggregate across a number of participants, let's say 40, just purely and statistical principles of aggregation, you can predict about 70 percent of the election outcomes.",
        "And yes, you mentioned in the beginning, even if you use fairly rapid presentations - so for example, we present the pictures for one-tenth of a second, which is not even sufficient to make eye movement, so that's a single glance impression, you can predict the outcomes better than chance level of 50 percent.",
        "Wow.",
        "Have you - is there any way to predict the candidates now or are they too well-known to try this?",
        "Well, that's very difficult.",
        "I personally don't do any work on the presidential elections, though I'm aware of the group - a group in Wharton business schools, and they actually - they're doing something along these lines and they're finding strong correlations for the Democratic candidates between their polls standing and their perceived competence.",
        "And to measure the competence, they use the judgments of high school students in New Zealand and Australia.",
        "So that's what you have to do."

        "What does it mean to look more competent?",
        "What does that mean?",

        "We have been exploring different computer models for face representation and finding out exactly what - people call this competence.",
        "And the initial work suggests that, unfortunately, it has to do a lot with masculinity.",
        "So more competent faces appear to look more masculine, but that's only the initial work.",
        "What we know is that people do agree when they make these judgments and that's what counts for our work.",
        "So they all independently pick the same criteria?",
        "Well, there's, of course, a lot of individual variation in these judgments, but by and large, people agree.",

        "Personally, in my lab, we studied the basic cognitive and neuromechanisms, how we people form impressions.",
        "So, for example, it wasn't news for us that you can make this judgment fairly rapidly because we have shown this before and it has been shown in different labs.",
        "So we know that people are very good; they engage in this fairly rapid spontaneous judgment from facial appearance.",
        "So in a sense, that was a nice extension to the political domain and to say, look, it's something that happens very quickly and presumably, it matters in really important outcomes.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now, you did the study - the participants, I would imagine -because you're at a university, where probably older teenagers or college students, young 20s, things like that.",
        "Would that be correct?",
        "Yeah, that's correct.",
        "Do you know if this same bias about, you know, competence might not be the same as people get older?",
        "They make judgments for a different reason.",
        "Well, what we know is that people from various ages and races, by and large, they agree when they make these judgments.",
        "Of course, the judgements vary as a function of the face that you are judging.",
        "So, in fact, all the people are judged to be more competent and competence also correlates with attractiveness.",
        "But people, by and large, agree.",
        "And in a nutshell, this will work against us if we have shown that judgments of Princeton students are very different, let's say, of the average voter.",
        "That should work against finding any significant effects of these judgments on the prediction of the outcomes."

        "Okay.",
        "You know, that's actually one of the experimental studies that we reported.",

        "So if you provide people with additional information like a party label, that completely changes the judgment, then people vote according to their party affiliation.",
        "But, in fact, if you rely only on facial appearance and you ask people to think carefully about and make a good judgment, this judgment is a significantly worse predictor of the election outcomes than these rapid gapped response reactions.",
        "You're saying it's a worse predictor if you ask them to think about it.",
        "That's right.",
        "And the reason why that is the case is because we don't do this judgment this way.",
