        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, the original findings were reported a couple of years ago and these new studies - they emphasize this rapid processing aspect.",
        "But actually, we did measure a number of different perceptions -trustworthiness, likeability, extroversion.",
        "And it's not random that competence is the one that make - predicts the outcome.",
        "Actually, if you ask voters or participants of what is the most important attributes you want to see a politician, the one that comes on the top is always competence.",
        "So it's not a completely rational process.",
        "People say competence is what matters to me, and they look for competence.",
        "The problem is that they're looking in the wrong place.",
        "I mean, presumably you should look for diagnostic information such as past performance.",
        "Well, and they can - they are able to make a snap judgment about competence just by that quick little flash of a face.",

        "I guess the insurance is that these politicians - to get where they are - you would assume that most of them are fairly competent.",
        "So there's already high pre-selection.",

        "When you say they were masculine looking, did that mean the most masculine-looking people were judged the highest?",
        "Well again, that's based on a different lineup for - not with the politicians where we actually use computer modeling represent faces and see if I exaggerate, let's say, I can take any face and make it more or less competent.",
        "And then they did, if I exaggerate it - so I go outside of the normal space of the face.",

        "Particularly on college campuses, no one wants to appear prejudiced.",
        "So these explicit judgments are not very reliable measures to what people are really thinking.",
