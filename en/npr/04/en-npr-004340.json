        "But when we talk about these stories in particular, we're talking about often situations that a lot of us have been in.",
        "I mean, you know, in passing, I was talking to a good friend of mine who works at BuzzFeed who's been on this beat too.",
        "And he just sort of brought up, like, hey, I've been stopped by cops three times a year since I started driving 20 years ago.",
        "And so a story like Sandra Bland, a story that begins with a police encounter that escalates and becomes something much darker really quickly, those stories are not abstractions to a lot of us.",
        "Part of the reason these stories have had so much traction is because people can imagine their sons and daughters and brothers and fathers, like, being the people in the stories - if not themselves being the victims in these stories."
