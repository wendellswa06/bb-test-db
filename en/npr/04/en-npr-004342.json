        "We don't really see getting behind Hillary Clinton as the same proposal as 2008 Hillary supporters getting behind Barack Obama.",
        "It's - it is a bitter pill to swallow, and so I think the challenge for Bernie supporters of getting behind Hillary is a lot bigger than Hillary supporters understand.",
        "Now, you wrote in a column earlier this week that a true Bernie Sanders supporter could never support Donald Trump.",
        "But you also said in that column that you yourself may not vote for Hillary Clinton, and I have to ask you about that.",
        "I mean, the fact is that officeholders get elected all the time because not enough people showed up in the polls to vote against them for the alternative.",
        "So how is suggesting that you won't vote for Hillary Clinton any better than voting for Donald Trump?",
        "I believe very strongly that there's no way you can support Bernie Sanders and vote for Donald Trump.",
        "Like, Bernie has said just as much himself, that his primary goal is to make sure Donald Trump isn't president.",
        "But I don't believe that saying you may vote for a third-party candidate is the same as voting for Donald Trump.",
        "How come?",

        "You know, I thought it wasn't true.",
        "I thought you could write as many nines as you want, and I'll write one followed by as many zeros, and then I'll subtract your number from mine, and it's going to be a lot of zeros and then a one.",
        "So I thought they can't possibly be the same.",
        "But what my friend said that convinced me was, no, they are the same because if you have infinitely many nines - you know, .999-forever - then there's no room for any number between that number and one.",
        "So they're functionally equivalent, or totally equivalent?"

        "I mean, because - they're the same number.",

        "But no, they're really the same number.",
        "And, I don't know, maybe it shouldn't be so shocking.",
        "There are other things, like, in ordinary language, sometimes we have synonyms.",
        "So it's sort of like that.",
        "It's just two - it's sort of a deficiency of the decimal system, in a way, that there just happen to be two names for this same point on the number line.",
        "Steven, you write about how words and word problems can actually fool you when you're thinking about math problems, and I'm thinking of one in particular.",
        "You write something very simple: Suppose the length of a hallway is Y when measured in yards and F when measured in feet.",

        "And most people get it wrong, a simple thing like that.",
        "What do they do?",
        "What's their conceptual problem here?",
        "It's - we would tend to think that you would translate the common-sense idea that one yard is three feet into something that sounds just like that in symbols.",
        "That is, if you ask students - or even, I'm afraid, sometimes their teachers - to write that, it's an easy trap to fall into.",
        "The common-sense move would be to say Y=3F.",
        "Now that's what it sounds like you would say.",
        "That's what you'd think if you translating the idea one yard is three feet.",
        "It just doesn't work, though, because if you plug in a number, like, say, well, plug in F=1, that would mean one foot.",
        "If you said Y=3F, that would say Y would be 3*1, which would be three.",
        "You'd say one foot is three yards, and suddenly it's backwards.",
        "Right, so it should be - yeah.",
        "So is the lesson here to sit down and not let your intuitive part take over, but sit down and think it out on paper?",
        "You can certainly think it out and realize by just trying numbers into a formula that there's something wrong.",
        "But there's a more systematic way in this case, which is the concept that science teachers like to teach of a conversion factor, that what we're really doing is trying to multiply by the number one, but we're writing one in a funny way, as one yard divided by three feet.",
        "You know, that's the same thing: one yard equals three feet.",
        "So, in fact, the correct formula is F=3Y, where the three is not just the number three.",
        "It's the three with units that three feet, you know, is one yard.",
        "Right.",
        "It's a little tricky.",
        "The main point is that the three is not a naked number.",
        "It has units on it."

        "That's it.",

        "But it's wrong.",
        "It's actually one man, one fence, three hours, because you've got to sort of visualize it.",
        "That is, picture each man painting his own fence.",
        "And so the guy on the left, it took him three hours to paint his fence.",
        "And the guy in the middle, it takes him three hours to paint his fence.",
        "And the guy on the far right, it takes him three hours to paint his fence.",
        "So you had three guys painting three fences in three hours, and it took each guy three hours to paint his one fence.",
