        "Well, I think I would put it at Cantor.",
        "Yeah, Cantor's the man.",
        "That's right.",
        "Cantor gets the credit for realizing that there could be different types of infinity.",
        "And so, first of all, as we say, you really weren't supposed to think about infinity to begin with.",
        "And when he did, several other great mathematicians used words like a disease.",
        "You know, they said: What is this disease that Cantor is introducing into mathematics?",
        "Yeah, he was really harshly criticized.",
        "He was.",
        "Yes, he was.",
        "And he also suffered from mental illness and had, it seems, an unhappy ending to his life.",
        "He ended up in a mental institution and was very severely depressed, I think partly because of the lack of recognition he was getting.",
        "But other great mathematicians realized that he had opened up fantastic vistas with his ideas about infinity, and they're pretty nearly universally accepted today.",

        "Hi, John.",
        "Hi.",
        "When I was in grammar school, we always had - this is going back to elementary and adding numbers.",
        "I went to a parochial school, and the nuns always wanted to make sure your totals were correct.",
        "Well, obviously, one way they said you could do that was to take the numbers that you're adding and subtract them from the total, and you'll get to zero and you'll be correct.",
        "But another way they showed us was something called casting out nines.",
        "And I never understood it, but it always worked, where you take each line of numbers, and you add them across.",
        "And they - if they equal nine, and then you - I don't know - you add them all the way down, and then your total, it equals nine.",
        "It always works, and I was wondering how.",
        "Steven, you know the answer to that?",
        "You know, I'm going to admit that I don't.",
        "I've heard of casting out nines.",
        "I never learned it, never been curious about it, and I don't know the answer to your question.",
        "Sorry.",

        "But given how advanced your son is, I think he might be ready for it.",
        "And it not only talks about Einstein the scientist, but it explains, at a level that a young student could understand, what the basics of relativity are.",
        "And it's really a nice book.",
        "It's from early 1970s.",
        "I hope it's not out of print, but a good library will have it.",

        "Well, yes.",
        "The legend - and, you know, I guess it's true - I'm not sure - is that Gauss and the rest of his classmates were - I'm not sure, so much, that it was a punishment as that maybe the teacher needed a break and wanted to keep the students busy for a while.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "So the teacher said, add up all the numbers from one to 100 and make sure that you get that answer right.",
        "Be very careful and do it correctly.",
        "And so Gauss realized that there was a shortcut, which is that instead of adding them by adding one plus two and then, you know, three to that, you could add them sort of from both ends, that as you add one to 100, that would make 101.",
        "Then you could add two to 99.",
        "That would also make 101.",
        "Then add three to 98 - again, 101.",
        "And so you would start to realize that if you do this, you're going to be adding 101 to itself 50 times.",
        "And so that's the answer - 50 times 101, which is 5,050.",
        "So he realized that very fast.",
        "And more or less by the end of the teacher's assignment coming out of his mouth, Gauss wrote it on a slate and walked up to the front and handed it to him.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "Let me move on to another subject because you talk about a lot of mathematical words actually come from Arabic - like the word for algorithm, for example - and there's a long history of mathematics that way, isn't there?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The Islamic world was the dominant source of learning, really, in the period that in the West is sometimes called the Dark Ages, after the fall of the Roman Empire.",
        "A lot of the great wisdom of the Greeks was brought through traders, you know, traveling across Asia to Baghdad and the Middle East, and also in Alexandria.",
        "So - and also great insights were developed by Arabic mathematicians."
