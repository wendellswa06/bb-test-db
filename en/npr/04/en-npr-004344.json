        "So the man that you mentioned, who gives us the word algorithm, is al-Khwarizmi, was a scholar around the time of, say, 800 A.D.",
        "in Baghdad.",
        "And he's the first one to figure out how to systematically solve the quadratic formula - the quadratic equations that we sometimes have to endure in high school algebra.",
        "What's interesting, actually, about the history of algebra - the word algebra, too, is an Arabic word, al-jabr, which means something like restoring, having to do with taking a term that's on one side of an equation and restoring the balance to the equation by moving it to another side.",
        "But the interesting thing here is that - I didn't realize this till I was writing the book - that what motivated algebra was Islamic inheritance law, that if a man had, say, two sons and a daughter, and then he dies and needs to leave some money, and maybe his wife is no longer alive, the rule in the law is that he has to give twice as much to his sons as to his daughter, but the sons have to get the same amount as each other.",
        "And so you can start to see it.",
        "It's like a little algebra word problem, and that's where algebra was created, to solve fair division problems under Islamic law.",
        "Why was calculus invented?",
        "Calculus had - I'd say the primary impetus was to understand the motion of the planets.",
        "That is people, in the time before we had artificial light, you know, before Edison, it was dark at night.",
        "And people would sit outside and look at the sky and noticed that the planets were these odd objects that moved throughout the year, and they moved in complicated ways.",
        "They didn't just seem to go forward.",
        "Sometimes they'd go backward.",
        "So that's where the world planet comes from.",
        "It's a wandering object, the planet, the wanderer.",
        "So anyway, people knew about the planets, but they couldn't really understand their motion very well.",
        "There was the old Ptolemaic system that was good enough for making calculations, but it didn't really - actually wasn't the right picture of what was going on.",
        "So to understand the detailed motion of the planets and also motion of things on Earth, projectiles, calculus solved both of those problems in one stroke.",
        "How did the ancients figure out what the constant pi was?",
        "Pi has been around a while, right?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, early on, it was an experimental thing.",
        "You could take rope and just wrap it around a wheel or something that is always a pretty good approximation to a circle.",
        "And so it was known - just from pretty careful measurements with strings or ropes, that it was a number a little bigger than three."

        "Maybe we should remind your listeners that pi is the ratio of how far it is around a circle, a circumference, to how far it is across a circle, the diameter.",
        "And so it was known to be around a little bigger than three.",
        "But Archimedes gave the first systematic solution to the problem of approximating pi by replacing a circle by a shape that is almost a circle but has straight sides.",
        "But I'm sure he would agree that understanding math too, you start to see the unity of nature.",
        "You can see, like, say, in the case of the Fibonacci numbers, that plants are intimately connected to, you know, a geometry of other - I don't know - now I'm not going to come up with a good example.",
        "That is like picture a hexagon or the shape of a stop sign, that's an octagon.",
        "You know, that's - those are six- or eight-sided shapes.",
        "They're not perfectly round, of course, there you have corners.",
        "But if you put an octagon, let's say, or a hexagon inside of a circle so that its corners are on the circle, it turns out it's quite easy to figure out the perimeter of the hexagon.",
        "And then you can use that as an approximation to the circumference of a circle, but it's not really right because it has corners.",
        "So you have to - well, Archimedes' idea was that a circle should be thought of as a polygon that has more and more sides.",
        "Like, instead of just six, he did - first he looked at a six-sided figure, then he did one with 12 then 24.",
        "And by the time he got to a 96th-gon, he was able to prove that pi, whatever that number is, is somewhere between three and one-seventh, and three and tenth-seventy-first.",

        "Wow.",
        "It's pretty good.",
        "So it's really close.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "And I started to think, this is a lot like things I was learning in physics class where there's pushing and pulling going on.",

        "And the best current thinking on this is that it has to do with biochemistry, that it's not a matter of anything but this - that when seeds form, there are certain biochemical inhibitors that are put out that tend to make it difficult for another seed to form near that.",
        "So the best place to form on the sunflower head is where the concentration of this inhibitor substance is low.",
        "And that tends to be sort of on the opposite side of the sunflower head, let's say, from where the given seed was.",
        "Yeah.",

        "They're not conscious.",
        "It's just that they're growing where there's the least biochemical inhibition.",
