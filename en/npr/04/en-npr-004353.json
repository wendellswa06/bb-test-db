        "There are little collars that fit around each cable; they're cone-shaped, and this is cone-shaped as well.",
        "So, when you run them through, you put the cone-shaped anchor on the wire, you pull it back into the anchor.",

        "That engineer record review and working with the foremen is the first line of the inspection.",
        "There's two other levels of inspection and testing that occur for the materials and workmanship and the placement of the steel and the different elements of this structure before it even gets to Mn/DOT.",
        "So, there is three lines of inspection that occur before Mn/DOT inspects it.",

        "What the record seems to document, however, memos that we went through and the various interviews that we had, that in a slow process of deterioration of a bridge, many decisions have to be made along the way and funding considerations enter into those decisions as to whether or not to elect one option or another option to proceed.",
        "And so we believe that, yes, funding did influence decisions along the way.",
        "Right.",
        "I mean, Rosenstein is the Justice Department official who directly oversees the special counsel's probe, so his firing could affect the progress of that investigation.",
        "And remember, the special counsel just won a conviction and guilty plea from Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.",
        "Robert Mueller's team is also talking with Trump's longtime attorney and fixer Michael Cohen after he pleaded guilty to fraud charges.",
        "Beyond that, there would also be political fallout, especially if Rosenstein were to be fired just before the midterm elections."
