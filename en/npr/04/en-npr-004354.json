        "Kavanaugh, who denies the charges, also wants a chance to testify and says he wants to clear his name.",
        "Last night, the committee's Republican chairman, Chuck Grassley, set a deadline of 2:30 this afternoon Eastern time for Ford to agree to appear before the committee or else, Grassley said, the committee was going to go ahead and vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the high court on Monday.",

        "On the one hand, they are eager to get Brett Kavanaugh confirmed and on the high court as quickly as possible.",
        "On the other hand, Republicans know they're facing a big deficit with women voters in November, and they can ill afford to look as if they are either ignoring Ford or creating a hostile hearing environment.",
