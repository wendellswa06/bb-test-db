        "If convicted, they could face life sentences.",
        "Foti says he had probable cause to make the arrests based on the eyewitness testimony of four employees of LifeCare Hospitals.",

        "The eyewitness testimony outlined in a 10-page affidavit alleges chilling acts by Dr. Pou and the two nurses.",
        "At one point, the witnesses alleged they saw Dr. Pou and the nurses filling syringes and stating that a decision had been made to administer lethal doses to patients on the seventh floor.",
        "One witness said Dr. Pou requested additional syringes filled with saline, presumably to ensure the drugs would be thoroughly flushed through the patient's system.",
        "According to the affidavit, Dr. Pou and the nurses were seen walking in and out of patients' rooms and instructing remaining staff to pull sheets over the heads of deceased patients.",
        "Foti said four patients, ranging in age from 61 to 90, were injected with the potent drugs morphine and Versed.",

        "The Des Moines Register poll had made what was either a very interesting judgment call or an extremely trenchant observation about the 2008 race, they assumed an unusually large share of the Democratic turnout at least, if not the Republican turnout as well, to be first-time caucus goers - we heard a couple in Michele Norris' piece - and independence.",
