        "Seventy-two percent of the people in this poll who were backers of Obama had never caucused before.",
        "And for Hillary, it wasn't much larger.",
        "It was 58 percent.",
        "Certainly, whether - if there is a very high turnout of first-timers, it's going to advantage Obama.",
        "If on the other hand it's what - there are fewer old timers, more people who've been there before, it's going to help Hillary and Edwards to some extent.",
        "On the Republican side, what questions are you looking to see answered?",
        "Well, what we've seen so far in Iowa and elsewhere is the emergence of a divide with - what had been a previously very unified Republican Party.",
        "We have the Christian conservative supporting one candidate, Mike Huckabee in the Des Moines Register poll by a margin of 57 to 19 over Romney, and then, the moderates and liberals supporting Romney by almost the same margin.",
        "And will that divide be as sharp as this poll number suggest?",
        "Which of these two candidates will prevail and will it, in fact, be social conservatism that drives preferences or not?",
        "And though, one number that we may not know until late at night and even then is how many people took part in the two caucuses.",
        "That is this is - the Iowa is a state that goes either way in presidential races and whichever party generates more enthusiasm could actually win this state.",
        "That's right because independents have an opportunity to go either way, and there's - as you've mentioned earlier, there's a pretty high concentration of independents, particularly on the Democratic side of the race.",
        "Thank you, Andy.",
        "You're welcome."

        "Today, their names are more familiar than Godfrey's, but that hasn't stopped commentator and radio producer John McDonough of putting together this remembrance of a much earlier \"\"American Idol.",
        "During television's first decade, Arthur Godfrey was the most omnipresent, watched, listened to and talked about personality in America."
