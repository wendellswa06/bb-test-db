        "And more lately we've seen Education Secretary Betsy DeVos backing off of that guidance, and that really is setting up this tension between what I call the softs and the hards on school discipline.",

        "And for students, of course at any sign of disrespect or disruption, the hards would say, you should suspend; you should expel; you should arrest if necessary.",
        "And this is an approach you can really date back to 1994 with the federal Gun-Free Schools Act.",

        "In Broward County, in Florida, for example, you had at least one student arrested for throwing a spitball.",

        "And in the meantime, the education secretary, Betsy DeVos - help us understand the thinking there.",
        "Well, you know, what we're seeing from Betsy DeVos and her Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education is that they are slowing down on a lot of the investigations that were pursued by the Obama administration.",
        "So that means that when there are concerns about race and discipline in schools, it's less likely that her department's going to be serving as a mediator of those disputes.",
        "And we're also seeing that, you know, hardening schools is an avowed part of the mission of the School Safety Commission that was set up after Parkland by Trump and is headed by DeVos.",
        "So where does that leave the debate at this point?",
        "You know, Audie, any time that you have bereaved parents, there is going to be an impetus to change something.",

        "So the softs say, yes, we could harden our schools into fallout shelters, but this is where students, young people are spending most of their waking hours.",
        "They need to be comfortable, welcoming places.",
        "Fear and anxiety and stress - that all contributes to an unsafe atmosphere.",
        "And then the hards say it's restorative justice that's been taken too far and, you know, we can't just be, you know, having kids acting out with absolutely no consequences.",
        "So I think what both sides agree on is that it might be easy to lay down hard-and-fast rules, but the really hard way is to create relationships and make students feel safe and give them - of course pay for the supports to do that.",
        "And many are questioning, why is it that we have money for police officers and for guns in schools but we don't have money for counselors and other kinds of supports?",
