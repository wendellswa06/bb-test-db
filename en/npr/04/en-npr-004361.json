        "He's a reporter for The New Yorker magazine, and last month he spent time in Syria, reporting on the rapidly devolving situation there.",
        "We reached him at his home in England, and he told us about one moment that has stayed with him - his visit to a place called Clocktower Square, in Homs, the site of intense clashes over the past year.",
        "This was the heart of the city and there were, literally, no people around.",
        "The bus pulled alongside a building, and we were told we had - literally, five minutes.",
        "As I came back to the bus, I saw a large man with a beard and a stocking cap on, speaking in very good English but clearly, in a state of hysteria - almost asphyxiating with emotion.",
        "He couldn't - the words didn't come out.",
        "When they did come out, he was saying, what are you doing here?",
        "What are you doing here?",
        "You have to go there, over there; Baba Amr - to these neighborhoods, not here.",
        "And he was speaking of the Sunni neighborhoods across the sectarian lines and in the city, which is, of course, the ones that are precisely besieged now.",
        "And then someone said, what are you afraid of?",
        "And he said; I'm not afraid of the soldiers with helmets, but the ones who wear sports clothes - I'm afraid of them.",
        "And he was referring to the secret police that we'd all seen.",
        "And indeed, as we spoke - and I looked around the edges of the crowd and suddenly, there were 15 or 20 strange, very, very scary looking men who had moved in.",
        "And they were, you know, whispering to each other.",
        "They were looking at him very, very aggressively.",
        "And I thought I was witnessing a man basically committing suicide.",
        "Finally, we were pushed in the bus and in the kind of commotion, I couldn't see what happened to him.",
        "But just as we left, he yelled out, take my name!",
        "take my name!",
        "Otherwise, I'll be on the death list tomorrow.",
        "I've heard through activist circles in London that that man was actually a very prominent lawyer.",
        "I don't know if he's still alive but that he was able - somehow, he managed to be taken away by his friends before he was grabbed.",
        "But he could no longer go back to his home after that moment.",
        "And he was taken to one of the secure neighborhoods controlled by the Free Syrian Army.",
        "He noticed people were laughing even though he never actually says anything especially funny.",
        "Godfrey was like that, full of affable mischief and monkey business.",
        "Godfrey's charm was nurtured by a team of writers who share his penchant for deflating pretense and sacred cows.",
        "One of them was a young war correspondent turned humorist named Andy Rooney.",

        "And I was here at CBS looking for a job at CBS News.",
        "And he said, well, come on over and see me.",
        "So I got a job with Godfrey in 1949 late.",
        "And I was with him for five years.",
        "It was an interesting experience."
