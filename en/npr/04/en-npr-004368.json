        "Still, there are some indications that Pollard's release wouldn't be quite as controversial in Washington.",
        "He has spent nearly three decades in jail and could soon be up for parole.",
        "But his potential release might not have the impact Kerry needs to move the peace process forward.",
        "The secretary cancelled plans to return to the region after Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas announced that he would seek membership in international agencies as a Palestinian state, something he had promised to put off during the talks.",
        "Kerry says he still thinks the parties want to find a way forward.",

        "(Soundbite of Mr. Deng Xiaoping, 1974)",
        "The real worry is that if financial institutions start seeing greater and greater problems in the prime market, that their earnings will fall, and they indeed may become more restrictive in credit and that could lead to even a greater slowdown in the economy.",

        "British Prime Minister Tony Blair was at his country's embassy in Washington yesterday.",
        "He took off his jacket and strolled outside.",
        "He paced a green lawn, talking with his chief of staff, the way you'd expect a prime minister to do in a movie.",
        "In Tony Blair's case the movie is almost over.",
        "He's on his way out of office.",
        "And when he came in off the lawn, he sat down to talk about it.",
        "After a decade in power, Blair is unpopular in his country.",
        "That's partly because of his support for the president who just had him stay over at the White House the night before, and especially because of his support for the war in Iraq."

        "Have you notice opportunities being missed where you just don't have the resources, the political capital, the troops to do what you want to do elsewhere in the world?",
        "No, I haven't notice that, but I have noticed that there's been a fall in the confidence than in your country and in my country there has been in what we're doing in Iraq, and at the moment we're in a very fragile situation with our opinion.",
        "And that's where you've got just very carefully to analyze what is actually happening there in order to see what you should be doing.",
        "Help me out there a little bit, because people have heard your defenses of the war, people have heard president Bush's defenses of the war, and many people nevertheless have grown tired of the war and turned against the war.",
        "Yeah, of course.",
        "What is it that you know that nobody else knows?",
        "I don't think is that I know anything that nobody else knows, but it's a question of - look, the reason why people in Britain, people in America have lost patience, to an extent, is because they see the carnage and the bloodshed going on, and they say this is now four years after the fall of Saddam, so if that is still happening, that must mean that the thing is wrong.",
        "And the truth of the matter is, it is being driven largely by al-Qaida on the one hand, Iranian-backed elements on the other hand who are linking up with a minority of extremists inside Iraq in order to do maximum damage so that people do lose faith.",
        "I want to ask you again about missed opportunities, and I want to stipulate that you feel that on balance it's better to be in Iraq than not.",
        "And certainly better than if Saddam and his two sons were still running Iraq, in my view we'd just have a stack of different problems.",
        "But as you look over the last several years, haven't there been occasions when you've had to say to yourself, I might have been able to make progress on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Iraq is in a way, drains energy, drains credibility, or there any number of issues where you just did not have the time or the capital to deal with them?"

        "I don't - you know, if you take the Palestinian issue, the reason why there's not - you know the reason why there isn't progress in Palestine in the way there should be is because the same forces are at work.",
        "Look, there's absolutely no doubt at all that you could get a Middle East peace process that would deliver an independent, viable Palestinian state and an Israel confident of its security, living side by side in peace.",
        "The reason you can't is that every time we get anywhere near progress, the same terrorism erupts.",
        "Well, there was a time that people hoped, perhaps you hoped, that the war in Iraq would make it easier to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians; perhaps it's ended up being the opposite.",
        "I don't think it's being the opposite.",
        "But I think that if you are able to make progress in Iraq, it will help enormously the forces of progress everywhere in the Middle East, which of course is why the forces of reaction are trying to stop us.",
        "This is a global movement founded on a perverted and warped view of Islam that is everywhere.",
        "Which is able to send its people to Iraq to get trained and back out again.",
        "Well, but they were able before that to send them to Afghanistan.",
        "Unfortunately, there are some of them being trained in Pakistan, they're being trained now in Africa.",
        "You see, if I have a criticism of our policy, if you like, the only way you are going to knock out this terrorism eventually is not just through the force of arms, but through the force of ideas.",
        "Freedom yes, and democracy yes, but also about justice, which is why progress on poverty in Africa matters in my view.",
        "I think a deal on climate change matters, even for this broader picture, and the Middle East peace process matters.",
        "Do you think that the Western world has been a little slower to come around to paying attention to an issue like climate change, which you've called the single most important issue we face, because of the distraction of the war?",
        "Has it been harder to get public attention?",
        "No, I don't think it is, but I think there is an issue which we're trying to resolve now in the context that the G8 Summit in the next few weeks, which is how do you get a climate change deal that involves China and India and the developing world as well as American and Europe and Japan?",
        "Why does China, for example, have to cut its emissions in order for you to cut your emissions in Britain?",
        "Well, it doesn't, but the reality is, if we shut down the whole of Britain - nothing emitted, within two years the growth in Chinese emissions would wipe out the difference we would make; that's the reason.",
        "China is almost at the same level of emission today as America, and within a few years will pass it.",
        "If you don't get China and India and America in this deal, you're not really where it's at, I'm afraid.",
        "I want to ask another question about how your country has changed during your 10 years as prime minister.",
        "Is it a little harder now, maybe even a lot harder, to define who's British and what that means?"

        "I think immigration is one of the toughest issues for any modern democratic country.",

        "And also raised questions about Islam versus Christianity versus anything else, raised questions about homegrown terrorists in some cases.",
        "Yeah, but you know, the way we defeat that is to bring people of different faiths together and let those sensible moderates, majority voices in Islam be heard, to go back a bit to what we were talking about before.",
        "But my view is you will never defeat this unless you - you don't just argue against the methods of these terrorists, but also their ideas and their presumed sense of grievance against the West.",

        "The nature of the world today - I mean, I'm convinced of this - that its defining characteristics is interdependence.",

        "And I always kind of imported that notion.",
        "You believed that part of it.",
