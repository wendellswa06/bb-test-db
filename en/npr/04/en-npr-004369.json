        "It looks like a sword in the sky in some of the photographs with one tail kind of sticking out in front and the other behind.",
        "We happen to be going by the comet in just such a way that we see the tail sticking out on both sides at the same time.",
        "Now, this is a newly discovered comet - a pretty great story about how it was discovered in the first place.",
        "Because he has proven to me that he has the ability to listen, to be a thoughtful, thorough, well-schooled leader.",
        "Beyond being timely, an obituary has a more subjective duty, to assess its subject's impact.",
        "Franklin Roosevelt and John Kennedy were presidents who died in office.",
        "They were works in progress, but when a person lives long enough, history gains a sort of cooling off that brings perspective.",
        "It merely awaits the proper hour.",
        "On my watch on the Evening News, we reported the obituaries of Dwight Eisenhower, Helen Keller and John Wayne.",
        "More recent obituaries remembered Bob Hope and Ronald Reagan.",
        "They all celebrated the end of long and productive lives.",
        "Such deaths are surprising in the moment only because they are suddenly so specific and final, but they're not unexpected and some are collectively anticipated."
