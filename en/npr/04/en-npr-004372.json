        "She had a job working for one of the New Deal agencies, the Farm Security Administration.",
        "I wonder: Why did the government send out photographers to those places?",
        "In the beginning, the first job of the photographers was to show the conditions that existed across the country.",
        "Then as the 1930s went on and the government programs had been implemented, her job shifted to photographing the success, presumably, of these programs.",
        "Of course, Lange being Lange found that things weren't working out in the field quite as well as the bureaucrats would like.",
        "So she took photographs by 1939 not only of the successful programs but also of conditions that continued to persist.",
        "You focus on the year 1939, after she took \"\"Migrant Mother.\"\" Why 1939?",
        "In 1939, she started writing longer reports to go with her photographs, which were really stories from the field."
