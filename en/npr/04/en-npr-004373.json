        "Well, you know, former President Clinton did cause some heartburn for Democrats on Monday, when he said Obamacare is, quote, \"\"the craziest thing in the world.\"\" It's not entirely clear what he meant by that.",
        "He seemed to be saying it's crazy that insurance companies are raising premiums even though they've got millions of new customers, thanks to the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Now, Bill Clinton tried to walk that back yesterday, saying the president's signature health care law had done a world of good.",
        "But he did say middle-class people who make too much to qualify for government subsidies on their health insurance are seeing big increases in their premiums.",
        "And that is a real issue.",
        "Hillary Clinton has said she wants to patch the Affordable Care Act, not repeal it as Trump and Pence want to do.",

        "Pence did say on CNN last month, I think it's inarguable that Vladimir Putin has been a stronger leader in his country than Barack Obama has been in this country.",
        "He said stronger, not better.",
        "But this was one of several times when Kaine attacked both Pence and his running mate, Donald Trump, for praising Vladimir Putin.",
        "Certainly, both Pence and his running mate see Russia as playing an outsized role under its strongman leader on the world stage, while they paint the United States as being somewhat in retreat under President Obama - and, by extension, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.",
        "Now, Obama and Clinton, of course, would argue otherwise.",
        "They say, look, Russia has been isolated and its economy imperiled by Putin's adventures, both in Ukraine and in Syria.",

        "It seems to me like the topic of the photograph is this gesture of these two small children with this - in front of this truck piled with possessions, and then Lange tells us, when you read the story, that this family is from Oklahoma.",
        "They have nine children, and they've been on the road for three years, and then she says still carrying a roll of kitchen linoleum."
