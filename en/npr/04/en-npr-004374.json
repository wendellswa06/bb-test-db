        "Michael Sullivan, NPR News, Hanoi.",
        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Andrea Seabrook.",
        "All right.",
        "So, that's one story from someone who saves.",
        "What about the rest of us?",
        "With me now is Richard Thaler.",
        "He's a professor of behavioral science and economics at the University of Chicago, also coauthor of the book, \"\"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness.\"\" Welcome to the program.",
        "Dr.",
        "RICHARD H.",
        "THALER (Behavioral Science and Economics, University of Chicago; Coauthor, \"\"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness\"\"): Thank you for having me again.",
        "Well, now, we have long bemoaned in this country that we are not a nation of savers.",
        "Now, people are beginning to save because they really don't have much choice, if they've got extra money, because putting it in the stock market, they're going to lose a lot of money.",
        "So, does this crisis give us an opportunity to change our habits and once again become a nation of savers?",
        "I definitely think yes.",
        "I think that we need, as a society, to change our habits.",
        "The crisis that we are now in emerged because, collectively, we all spent beyond our means.",
        "Now, a lot of people say, a lot of economists say, it's probably not a good idea for us to become like Japan and become a nation of savers, because after all, consumer spending makes up 70 percent of our economy, and if we're not out there buying things, how can the economy recover?",
        "I think the most we can hope for is that we become less a nation of debtors.",
        "The national saving rate for the last few years has been essentially zero.",
        "In December, it jumped to two or three percent.",
        "This is not Japan.",
        "So, I think that what's true is that households, throughout the '90s and the first part of this century, were living beyond their means.",
        "So, I think we're going to see a period of a few years of retrenchment in consumer spending, and that may prolong this recession - it won't prevent it from stopping - but it may last a bit longer than it might, but that's necessary.",
        "We can't sustain an economy where we spend $102 out of every $100 we make.",
        "I'm wondering, the last time that we were faced with such a grave economic crisis, most people say, was back in the Great Depression, when people did save and learn how to save.",
        "And did we see a mass behavior change as a result of the Great Depression?",
        "Well, I think there is some evidence that people who lived through the Depression were permanently prudent.",
        "Now, it's very difficult to determine cause and effect in these kinds of things, but there is some evidence for that in the data.",
        "For example, if you look at the data, say, in 1980, people who were going into retirement at that time had no mortgage debt to speak of.",
        "People would take out a mortgage, and they would pay it off.",
        "And certainly in my parents' generation, paying off the mortgage was one of the big goals in life.",
        "That seems to have completely vanished in the last 20 years.",
        "Now, you see people in their 60s with - taking out new 30-year mortgages."

        "So, I think we do need to establish a new, or old, if you will, set of norms that where people do strive to pay off their mortgages before they retire so at least they have their home equity to help finance their retirement.",
        "And keep in mind that we live longer than we - than our parents, our grandparents did, and so, we need to save even more rather than less.",
        "But I do think that we do slowly learn lessons.",
        "We won't repeat exactly the same mistake.",
        "So, another real-estate boom and another boom of home-equity-financed consumption, we probably won't have another one of those for a decade, but what will happen after that?",
        "People do have short memories.",
        "And we used to laugh at our parents who lived through the Depression.",
        "And I think people in their 20s now may be - well, people in their teens now will be laughing at the old folks that will be in their 30s who are living responsibly and not knowing what they're talking about.",

        "How much do you personally worry about global warming?",
        "The people at the Gallup Poll have been asking that question every year since 1989, and according to their latest polling figures, there's been a bit of an uptick in the numbers: 55 percent said they worry about climate change - that's up about four points from last year.",
        "That still leaves a lot of people doubting that climate change is important.",
        "Well, my next guest says it doesn't matter what people think about climate change, they still share some common ground on other energy issues, and that's all we need to start tackling, to start tackling the problem, he says.",

        "Is that right, you say - I've heard you said it's toxic to talk about climate change, but you can get agreement other ways.",
        "I don't say it's toxic to talk about climate change.",
        "What I do is, when I meet a skeptic, I say hi, I believe climate change is real, the science is happening, it's happening, and I think that the solutions are going to make life better for just about everybody else.",

        "And they say no. And I say: You're not going to change mine either, are you?",
        "And they say no. I say: OK, let's table that.",
        "And we've already come to an agreement on tabling that, but we've had a respectful conversation.",
        "And from there what I'm finding is that when you ask anybody, do you like solar energy, the answer is yes.",
        "And the numbers are like 70 percent of Americans love solar energy.",

        "It was all part of a broader system of measuring and comparing body parts to help police departments organize thousands of criminal records.",
        "In 1884, Bertillon's system helped Parisian police identify more than 200 repeat offenders.",
        "His work became so famous that in one of Arthur Conan Doyle's stories, Sherlock Holmes was once called the second-highest expert in Europe after Bertillon.",
        "His reputation, though, faded as more police departments learned that fingerprinting was a simpler way to ID people.",
        "Still, his style of mug shots became the standard.",
        "And Jonathan Finn, a police photography expert who wrote \"\"Capturing The Criminal Image,\"\" says he is still very much with us today in other ways.",
        "Whenever you go through an airport or at a train station or anything else and somebody asks to see your identification document, that all has roots in the late 1800s and the work of people like Bertillon and his contemporaries.",
        "Back at NYPD headquarters, Wilhelm Figueroa says he thinks of Bertillon whenever he comes across an interesting mug shot.",
        "It could be an interesting curve of the ear, a unique tattoo.",
        "It could be a unique port-wine birthmark.",
