        "Yeah, I think when people hear climate change, global warming, and it gets hot, I think they think - it's clear that, like you said at the top of the show, the numbers are coming in higher.",
        "And then when it's really, really cold, those numbers go down because that's just misinformation.",
        "I mean, just the fact that we're debating climate change at all is - actually, it's a victory for the folks in the '80s and '90s from the fossil fuel industry who just wanted us to debate it.",
        "That was a game plan.",
        "It's the same exact game plan as the tobacco industry.",

        "We were naive.",
        "And when I met this guy named Bernie Karl up in Alaska who's revolutionizing geothermal power by using water that's much cooler than thought possible to create energy - he's in the 180, 200-degree water temperature; it used to be that you thought you'd have to at least make steam - he's doing all this great work, but he doesn't believe climate change is caused by humans.",
        "And so when I met him, I realized, wait a second, if he's revolutionizing geothermal power, and he's going to do more to solve climate change than I am, and he doesn't believe that climate change is caused by humans, maybe there's a lot of smart people and dedicated people who like clean air and clean water who don't think climate change is caused by humans but still have great ideas.",
        "It made me realize that maybe a lot of those people were being sort of kept out of this tent, you know, and to me that was the biggest light bulb moment, unexpected, from when I was filming.",
        "Speaking of filming, can we expect to see a sequel in the works here?"

        "Yeah, well, you talk to Ray Mabus, and you talk to Brigadier General Dana Pittard down at Fort Bliss, and you find out that having their bases be sufficiently powered so they're in charge of their energy is national defense.",
        "And when Pittard got to Fort Irwin, where we filmed him in the movie, where he was before, Southern California Edison, like his second week, said, oh, by the way, we have to turn off the power line to your base, we have to do some work on it.",

        "And they're doing it for self - they're doing it for national defense, absolutely, 100 percent.",
