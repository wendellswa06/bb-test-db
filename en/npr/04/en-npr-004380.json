        "Well, Stone is the sixth Trump associate to be charged by Mueller in this investigation, the 34th individual overall to face charges.",
        "And over the course of this investigation, Mueller has documented multiple contacts that Trump associates had with Russians or with Russian proxies.",

        "There's a line in the indictment that caught my eye.",

        "It appears they finally have.",
        "Believe it or not, at first consumers thought, oh, $3-a-gallon gas prices are temporary, but when it started to sink in that high prices were here to stay, people started actually driving less.",
        "Now, the all-important summer driving season will soon be upon us.",
        "Is demand going to tick up this summer and nudge prices up even farther?",

        "And yet, here was this man who was supposed to be God in mortality, and then to see the very human, the very carnal side of this man was incredibly overwhelming because I could no longer deny the reality of the incongruency: what we were taught versus what was really going on.",
