        "Yavuz Baydar, a columnist at the English-language Today's Zaman newspaper, says the military and its supporters are still powerful players, but Turkey has evolved to the point where governments fear the displeasure of the voters more than that of the generals.",
        "But it is certain that the military now realizes that the periods of coup - is over.",
        "It has, actually, already entered - phase of negotiations with the government.",
        "The government's political win over the generals comes at an important time for Prime Minister Erdogan, who's ramping up the campaign for a series of constitutional reforms, which go to a public referendum next month.",
        "Erdogan is framing the vote as an opportunity to repudiate past military coups and to rewrite the constitution drafted under the military's influence after the last one in 1980.",
        "You know, it helps a little, Anthony.",
        "But again, if everything runs smoothly.",
        "Inventories are up.",
        "That's true, because there's been this drop in demand, but that always happens during the winter, and demand usually goes up a lot in the summer, and usually refineries are able to pass higher oil prices along to consumers at that point.",
        "But if demand doesn't pick up and we have big inventories of gasoline sloshing around, refineries aren't going to be able to do that.",
        "Now, another thing to keep in mind that could actually nudge prices up is, you know, we're competing for oil with a lot of growing economies.",
        "India and China, they have voracious appetites.",
        "We already consume about 25 percent of the oil that's produced in the world, but we have a lot of competition right now.",

        "Generally our primaries have been in June.",
        "It's literally been decades since candidates have treated California as more than simply an ATM machine to cough up money to be spent in other states.",
        "They are spending some time here, not non-stop campaigning the way they did in Iowa or New Hampshire.",
        "But they are spending some time here in between going to those other places, and as well as, of course, raising money, because that's what California's role tends to be mostly.",

        "They call him a RINO, a Republican in name only, because he has championed a lot of issues that they disagree with, from gun control to abortion rights to environmental protection."

        "Come the general, he probably would play a bigger role because you would have a bigger turnout.",

        "That matters because Democrats are the poor(ph) opposite of Republicans.",
        "And so because we have such a large and growing independent vote, the voters of the two parties themselves are fairly ideologically rigid - liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans.",
        "And anybody who campaigns in California for a party nomination, either for state officer or president, has to confront that fact.",
        "So given that fact, who do you think is in the best position?",
        "Having said that, I would say at the moment at least John McCain is for the Republicans because he's been showing signs of life lately.",
        "And Giuliani, who was leading in California for months and months and months, has faded probably to third place.",
        "That said, it's really very tight among the two or three contenders: Giuliani, Romney and McCain.",
