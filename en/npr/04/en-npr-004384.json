        "How is this whole thing playing out in the Jordanian press?",
        "Locally, in the Jordanian press, there's been a bit of a clamp down from the government.",
        "Over all, the feeling on the street is anger over all in terms of the issue.",
        "Jordanians were lukewarm to the coalition even before this hostage crisis.",
        "But now with the sacrifice of life being played out, you know, in the press, it's really turned public opinion against this war.",
        "When you say public opinion has turned, has the Jordanian population been animated by the fight against ISIS in general?",

        "You know, Abdullah, why are we fighting this war?",
        "Why?",
        "So really, there has been simmering anger.",
        "And I think that if this pilot is not returned to Jordan safe and sound, we'll see a much louder rejection of the U.S.",

        "Can you tell us about the Iraqi woman who's being imprisoned in Jordan?",
        "The detainee in question that is part of the proposed prisoner swap is Sajida al-Rishawi.",

        "And Rishawi has been on death row for the past decade.",
        "In terms of the Jordanian public, it's just not seen as, you know, a highly valued detainee.",
        "Most Jordanians are all aboard this swap, even for the Jordanian government.",
        "I think that they would make the swap 100 times out of 100.",
        "So really what we're seeing here is a kind of a backlash against Jordanian policy.",

        "According to most opinion polls, only 40 percent of Jordanians view the Islamic State as a terrorist organization.",
