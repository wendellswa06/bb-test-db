        "I mean, the policies that he began in '91 opened up the Indian economy to global competition, and that hurt a lot of people in India who were quite secure in the earlier closed regime.",
        "And also, he started the early steps of privatization of India's huge public sector, which didn't go down very well with the trade unions in the public sector.",
        "And finally, he reduced a lot of the controls that government used to exercise on business, and therefore was not very popular with politicians and government officials.",
        "Don't forget that India was operating in a new world, a post-Cold War world in which India's long-time friend, the Soviet Union, had just disappeared.",

        "How would India have seen itself up until just a few years ago, and how has that changed over the last few years?",

        "But I think the difference is that in the Cold War period, the U.S.",
        "moved closer to Pakistan and China, and so India moved closer to the Soviet Union.",
        "And with the disappearance of the Soviet Union, India had to rework its relationships.",
        "And certainly, the opening up of the Indian economy that Manmohan Singh began provided opportunities for a lot of American companies to move into India and look at the Indian market.",
        "A recent poll by Louisiana State University shows more than 60 percent of residents share Krummels confidence in the citys upgraded flood protection.",
        "Theres no question that the amount of work done in the past few years has been impressive.",
        "Throughout the area, old floodwalls shaped like the letter I, have been replaced by new, more stable floodwalls, shaped like the upside-down letter T.",
        "More than 350 miles of levees and floodwalls ringing the area have been raised, strengthened, and in some cases, armored with concrete.",

        "You know, we took lessons learned form Katrina.",
        "Were building a true system and were building it in a true form that provides perimeter protection.",
        "I think a true lesson learned is, dont allow flood surge to come into, basically, peoples backyard.",

        "Katrina came in and the levee around St. Bernard Parish and the levee around the New Orleans East acted like a funnel.",

        "It was about 18 feet high at this point with a seven foot wave.",

        "Once the surge barrier and the rest of the upgrades are complete next year, Corps officials say New Orleans will be protected against a 100-year storm event.",

        "But even something that large, it would hit this and would stop most of it.",

        "Hes spent some 14,000 hours studying New Orleans flood protection since Katrina.",
        "He believes that, even with the new upgrades, the levees and floodwalls are more of a patchwork quilt than a true flood protection system.",
        "If and when the big one hits, Bea says, theres still likely to be significant breaching of levees and floodwalls.",
        "And the reason for that is not the strong links that the Corps has built, but because of the weak links in the system that pre-existed Katrina.",
        "Bea says a repeat of the Katrina destruction is unlikely.",
        "But, a major hurricane is likely to bring flooding, and possibly, loss of life.",
        "He believes that the 100-year flood protection plan for New Orleans is inadequate and many others here agree.",
        "John Barry is a board member of the areas Flood Protection Authority and author of Rising Tide, about the 1927 Mississippi flood.",
        "He says the promise of protection against a 100-year storm can be misleading.",
        "Storms, he notes, dont pay attention to statistics.",
        "And over a period of 100 years, roughly your lifetime and your kids lifetime combined, theres a 63 percent chance that you will see a storm greater than the protection system.",
        "So, when you understand that, then you begin to understand why it is not a very good level of protection.",
        "Even the Corps acknowledges that New Orleans needs more than 100-year protection.",
        "Its a hurricane-prone city where half the land is at or below sea level.",
        "But improving flood protection further is a question, not of engineering, but of policy and money.",
        "And thats a question not for the Corps, but for Congress."

        "Now, the budget has been criticized by some economists who say that the plan is too optimistic, and the GOP Senate Leader Mitch McConnell says the plan has three flaws in his view which are: it spends, number one; taxes, number two; and borrows too much, number three.",

        "If it does, it will be highly successful because the stimulus had a lot of opposition but it passed.",
        "It got 60 votes in the Senate which meant several Republicans had to vote for it.",
