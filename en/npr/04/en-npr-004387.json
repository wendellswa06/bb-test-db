        "It would take a while.",
        "You couldn't do it overnight, and you shouldn't try to do it overnight.",
        "After all, we are in a recession, and we may stay there for a while.",
        "And so I'm not advocating that we cut the existing deficit this year.",
        "I am advocating that we legislate, right now, some measures that will slow the growth of spending over time and raise revenues over time.",
        "And if we do it now, it can be less painful and more feasible than if we continue to kick the can down the road, so to speak.",
        "You've been watching this process for some time.",
        "Nowadays, it's very common for people to tell you, I'm really concerned about the economy we're leaving to our children.",
        "And how do you understand the loss of traction for addressing the budget deficit over the years?",
        "Is it just a feature of the recession right now?",
        "Is it the boredom of the Washington press corps and paying enough attention to it?",
        "How do you understand the defining, the deficits down that you've observed?",
        "Well, I think it does go to some of the problems in political life right now.",
        "I, along with a group of others, have spent a lot of time over the last few years going around the country, giving talks to ordinary citizens about the fiscal future we face.",
        "And we find that the public is very concerned about the issue and that they get it, they want something done.",
        "The problem has been that most of the people who must take action need to get themselves re-elected - or want to get themselves re-elected.",
        "And it's very hard to get re-elected if you have cut spending or raised taxes.",
        "So, the problem basically is a lack of political will.",
        "We think these monuments, similar to the Confederate monuments, are part and parcel of the same movement of white supremacy within America.",
        "And they all need to come down.",
        "I'm actually standing right now at a corner and I'm watching traffic flow.",
        "And one of the best places to see the theater of forces and energy - which is, if you're a physicist, that's what you're interested in - to see them applied is through traffic.",
        "Now, if you're in a car, you never really get a chance to feel the force and energy 'cause you're not expending it.",
        "You step on the gas, you go.",
        "Who cares?",
        "But if you're on a bike, you see why bicyclists don't want to stop often.",
        "It's because if you have - if it's your muscles that are going to go into getting yourself started again, which is essentially the physics of it, you see why on a bicycle - if you come to a red light, it's easy for a car to stop and start again.",
        "But for a bicyclist, it's their force and their energy that has to get you going.",
        "So that bike in motion wants to remain in motion.",
        "Right.",
        "Newton's First Law, one of the best examples of physics in a city that you can see is Newton's First Law of Motion.",
        "Adam, look at that intersection where you are right now and tell me if you're seeing other laws of physics that are coming to bear in traffic.",
        "So, I'm looking at a red light and a bunch of cars all stacked up right now.",
        "And what's going to happen is when the light turns green, the cars are going to get going.",
        "But they all don't get started at once.",
        "First, the first row of cars starts moving and then the second row of cars behind them can get moving.",
        "And then the third row of cars can get moving."

        "So, what's actually happening is there's a wave which is moving backwards, a wave of rarefaction or cars spreading out.",
        "The cars moving forward is the wave actually that moves backward.",
        "And that same kind of physics is exactly what happens in an exploding star, for example, the same kinds of fluid motion of what physicists call a rarefaction wave occurs both in traffic when the traffic is beginning to accelerate as occurs in an exploding star when the star - the gas in the star is blown outwards.",
        "So you're looking at the traffic in front of you and you're not seeing, you know, Nissans and Hondas.",
        "You're seeing exploding stars on some level?",
        "I do, actually.",
        "That is - and when I see it, I'll get so excited because it's like, oh, my God, there's an example of a rarefaction wave.",
        "Adam, we've been talking about Isaac Newton and, of course, Newton had a lot of things to say about gravity.",
        "How does a city help us see the forces of gravity at work, besides everywhere?",
        "Right.",
        "The best place to see what Newton was telling us and, actually, even to go beyond it is elevators, because gravity and elevators really go together beautifully.",
        "So I'm now in front of a very tall building here and we're going to walk inside and go over to the elevator.",
        "So, when the elevator starts, you feel your legs buckle a little bit as the elevator is rising.",
        "And when the elevator comes to your floor, you feel a little bit light as the elevator decelerates.",
        "Now, the beautiful thing about that is that is exactly where Einstein started in thinking about gravity.",
        "When he went beyond Newton, he was doing all of these thought experiments about what happens in an elevator as you accelerate and decelerate.",
        "So, when I was a foot messenger in New York City - I had a job doing that for a year or so - I used to carry a little red ball with me and I would try and catch that moment.",
        "I'd throw the ball up in the air and I'd try and catch the moment when the elevator either accelerated or decelerated and then you could see the ball in space.",
        "It would either slow down as it rose or speed up or, sometimes, right in mid-motion, it would hang there for a second.",
        "And I would get so excited because there I was reading the same physics, the Newtonian physics and the Einstein physics, I was seeing it real - the stuff that I had just been reading beforehand.",
        "And, of course, the people in the elevator all thought I was a little crazy, but I didn't mind.",
        "They might have just been waiting to see when you were going to start juggling."
