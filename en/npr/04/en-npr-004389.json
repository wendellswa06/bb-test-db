        "And, you know, my only theory is, you know, the rise of, you know, the consumerism and some more modern access to consumer products in Mexico and their inability to, you know, effectively dispose of them, you know, on a standard that maybe more industrialized nations have.",
        "And it's very disconcerting because I heard you mention, you know, what the birds are doing and what other wildlife does mistakenly with these products.",
