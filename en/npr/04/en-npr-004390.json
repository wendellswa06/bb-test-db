        "This is what the ocean was supposed to be like.",
        "That moment, I realized everything we had lost, and also that there is hope for the future.",
        "So if you dive in the places that are not protected, you won't see many big fish.",

        "So that we are doing so many things that are, yeah, unseen, behind the scenes that can be more dramatic than the plastics or the balloons.",

        "Actually, spearfishers typically target big fish, and the big fish are the very ones we ought to target for keeping alive.",
        "They're the survivors, the ones that have shown the test of time.",

        "And the projections, going forward, to the middle of the 21sth century don't look good at all if we continue at the level that we're now trying to impose on the ocean.",
        "The trick is a combination of having large, not just small - although small areas count - but large areas where we agree to let the natural systems be themselves and not take the fish, havens for the fish, if you will, and that coupled with small areas and policies that really are more realistic.",
        "We have - are still living by policies - were formed when we thought that the ocean was infinite and its capacity to yield whatever we wanted to take, and our job was to build bigger nets, bigger ships to travel further and deeper.",
        "And we've done that and look at what the consequences are.",
        "We need to think otherwise about the value of fish as something more important in many ways alive than they are dead, just as we came to that understanding with whales.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think there is nothing wrong with using the ocean.",
        "We just can't use it up.",
        "And there's nothing wrong with eating fish, but not at the rates we are eating fish now.",
        "We are taking fish out of the ocean faster that they can reproduce.",

        "And this summer, we're seeing some early indications of some bleaching again.",
        "And in addition to that, here's an interesting change that I've been noticing, and I wonder if Sylvia or the other panelist has seen or heard of this happening anywhere else.",
        "On the island of St. John, we're noticing corals establishing themselves on the roots of mangroves.",
        "So this is not a normal association, a normal place where you would find corals existing.",
        "But maybe there's some relationship between the slightly cooler areas of the water amongst the mangrove roots.",
        "That's an interesting question.",
        "Of course, when you talk about bleaching, bleaching is very bad for corals.",
        "It means the life has been taken away and it's merely the dead bones of the animals.",

        "I know, Enric, you've traveled around a lot of coral recently.",
        "Yes.",
        "And what we've seen is that, you know, if we protect the place, you know, we cannot protect the place from getting warm.",
        "So global warming is overarching.",
        "It reaches the entire ocean.",
        "However, in the places where the ecosystem is intact - when you have find all the species from the corals to the top predators to the sharks - when we have the machinery, the entire machinery with all the piece of working, the system is more resilient; which means that it can recover from these impacts.",
        "So in this pristine places in the middle of the ocean where there is no direct human impact, where there is no fishing up ocean, where the ecosystem is well protected; or in marine reserves where the ecosystem has recovered, the corals bleach, but they recover, because the system has evolved to function well to recover from disturbances like this.",
        "So one way to buffer the short-term effects of global warming is to create these marine reserves to bring back all of these parts of the machine, so the ecological machine, the ecosystem can work as it's supposed to be.",

        "If everyone contributed like this and was conscious of curving polluted runoff, it could make a huge difference.",
        "And indeed, that effort has found a way in many places in the Chesapeake, but most places in the Chesapeake, you cannot see the bottom.",
        "That is a fact.",
        "It's a combination of having destroyed the filtration systems - well, we've eaten it - at the same time that we've added so much that is not natural to the Chesapeake.",
        "But it's wonderful thinking about what it was like when John Smith came to the Chesapeake, like 400 years ago, thinking about it over the centuries and the decades and imagining a future that can be again.",
        "The ingredients are largely still there.",
        "It's our behavior that will make all the difference."
