        "In some ways, we're the luckiest people ever to live on the planet.",
        "As depressing as some of this news is, this is the first time in all of human history that we have the capacity to understand how important the natural world is to every breath we take, every drop of water we drink, everything we care about.",
        "Now, we understand, or have a capacity to understand, that it matters what we do to forests, to rivers, to the ocean, to wildlife.",
        "There was a time, not long ago, in like, the middle of the 20th century, when the attitude largely was that it doesn't matter, that our job is to use the natural systems right up to the end and it wouldn't make any difference.",
        "But now, we have the capacity, through - well, through satellites up in the sky, through submersibles that dive deep into the sea, through the computer technologies that enable us to, for the first time, link things together.",
        "When I was a child, we didn't know about the mountains that formed backbones down the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans.",
        "We didn't know that we have the capacity to eliminate 90 percent of the fish, the big fish in the sea; did not understand that our actions could change the nature.",

        "Now we know, and that truly makes us the luckiest people ever, because we also know that there's still half the coral reefs out there.",
        "We've lost 40 percent of the plankton and - since 1950, but not all the plankton is gone.",
        "Good thing, too, since that's where most of the oxygen that we breathe comes from.",
        "And now that we know, we can do something about it.",

        "Is this even possible?",
        "Exactly.",
        "This is what we're talking about.",
        "These hot spots, this marine reserves, they are like national parks in the sea.",
        "These are areas at work.",
        "And this - really, this one of the signs of hope.",
        "These are good news.",
        "When we protect these areas, the fish don't die much fast, they take a longer time to die, they grow larger, they reproduce.",
        "And after a few years, there are so many fish that they spill over the boundaries of these reserves, so fishermen can catch more outside.",
        "And we were in the Mediterranean this June on an expedition, and we asked some fishermen if they were happy with the marine reserve there.",
        "And they said, oh, we're so happy, without the reserve - you know, we couldn't be fishing.",
        "And this is our savings account.",
        "And there are so many things that you can do, individually, or you can do as an organization",
        "And I just like to say that on Monday and Tuesday, here in Washington, there was a meeting of conservation organizations, philanthropists, the government people, scientists.",
        "And we got together to create - well, an alliance that already existed - but to create a network, a very strong network of ocean lovers, ocean stakeholders called Mission Blue, with the goal of restoring the health and productivity of the ocean.",
        "Sylvia and I were here with other colleagues.",
        "And it was really, really hopefully.",
        "It was really fantastic to see all these people who have dedicate their lives to save the ocean realize that alone we cannot make it happen.",
        "I just want to go back to a point you mention before, that the fishermen who almost always resist the creation of such areas because they say these are waters of families and our businesses have fished for years.",
        "But that after a few years, they actually support these reserves?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "As you say, Neal, the fishermen are the first to complain when you talk about creating a reserve.",
        "But after a few years, they realize that without these reserves, there is no future for them.",
        "And fishermen are part of the solution."

        "There are some underwater robots but it'd be nice to be able to have Enric go down and check it out for himself or any of you or any - we have thousands of airplanes and thousands of ships, but what about being able to go beyond where divers can go?",

        "And so how do we show people what's there?",
