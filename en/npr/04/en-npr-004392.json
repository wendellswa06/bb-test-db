        "One of the reasons Enric and I are associated with National Geographic is that it's a way to reach people effectively through magazine, books, television, online and any other form of communication we can muster.",
        "Another reason for hope, though, because going back to the middle of the 20th century, for better or for worse, we didn't have iPhones and we didn't have, you know, laptops and iPads and all the other things that now are in everybody's hands all over the world.",
        "We can communicate in ways that didn't exist before.",

        "If it's not, you throw it back.",
        "Our neighbors to the north in Canada can sell baby lobster tails the size of shrimp I've seen before.",

        "And you're suggesting that different regulations in different countries are making this kind of a - what needs to be perhaps a more regional or global effort difficult?",
        "Yes.",

        "It's interesting, we're talking about the Chesapeake Bay earlier, and they do the same sort of thing with rockfish, as they call them there, striped bass as they're called everywhere else in the world, that if it's too big, you have to put it back, so - also too small.",
        "And obviously, that's not necessarily an approach for salmon, which are caught in different ways, but these kinds of approaches, is this the kind of thing that needs to be done?",
        "That does represent a change of attitude.",

        "These are just a few of the milestones Dr. Varmus recounts in his new memoir, \"\"The Art and Politics of Science.",
        "And now, as a presidential adviser, he is faced with a bunch of whole new challenges and opportunities in science and the public understanding of science.",
