        "Mm-hmm.",
        "I would like to know which development you think would be more harmful to America's prestige in the Muslim world, which is worse: an Iranian government that has nuclear weapons, or an Israeli military strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.",
        "But we have to be able to make that same argument to other countries that might aspire to nuclear weapons, and we have to apply some of those same principles to ourselves so that, for example, I'll be traveling next month to Moscow to initiate start talks, trying to reduce our nuclear stockpiles as part of a broader effort in the international community to contain our nuclear weapons.",
        "And would you urge other nations to restrain themselves until you can complete that process?",
        "Well, that's going to be the challenge.",
        "That's why we're so busy around here all the time.",
        "Let me ask about one other challenge, if I might.",
        "Is your effort to engage the Muslim world likely to be complicated or even undermined by the fact that you're escalating a war in a Muslim country, Afghanistan, with the inevitable civilian casualties and other bad news that will come out of that?",
        "But I am somebody who is very anxious to have the Afghan government and the Pakistani government have the capacity to ensure that those safe havens don't exist.",
        "And so, you know, and it's - I think will be an important reminder that we have no territorial ambitions in Afghanistan.",
        "We don't have an interest in exploiting the resources of Afghanistan.",
        "What we want is simply that people aren't hanging out in Afghanistan who are plotting to bomb the United States.",
        "And I think that's a fairly modest goal that, you know, other Muslim countries should be able to understand.",
        "That's President Barack Obama.",
        "He spoke with us yesterday at the White House about a problem that touches nearly all his foreign policy goals.",
        "It's the strained relationship between the United States and the Muslim world.",
        "The president faces sharp criticism from many of his efforts to correct the U.S.",
        "image abroad.",
        "Yesterday, former Vice President Dick Cheney launched another defense of the Bush administration.",
        "The current president told us simply that he thinks Cheney is wrong."

        "And I don't in any way begrudge, I think, anybody in debating, sometimes ferociously, these issues that are of preeminent and importance to the United States.",

        "Now, while many residents of this coastal West African city may not fully follow the complexities of the recent financial turmoil on Wall Street and beyond, the Senegalese are no strangers to the word crisis, their own existing daily crises just trying to survive.",
        "Night has fallen in Dakar and street vendors are desperately trying to offload a few more items before the close of business.",
        "They were too busy to talk.",
        "But one young man walking down the street, Moustapha Diouf, was keen to share his views on the impact of the global financial crisis.",
        "And while the initial issue was Sputnik and nuclear competitiveness, now, especially because of President Obama's views on science, we expect it to be much more wide-ranging.",
        "One of the things that has impressed me about Barack Obama from the first time I met him is that he seems to understand the connections between training and educating and importing scientists to create a workforce, the effect of science on our energy policy and on climate change and industry and the economy, on manufacturing, on information technology and on health - all the things that are central to what he would like to achieve for the country.",
        "That's why, when he says - as he said the other day, putting science back into its rightful place, he means at the center of generating knowledge that's useful to the country.",
        "And he's said to many of us in interviews that he sees science as a centerpiece of his new administration.",
        "How do you know you'll get any real time with the president?",
        "Well, of course, it's a little hard to know that, but one of the things that is really extraordinary is here we are, the administration's only a few days old, and we're having this conversation.",

        "But I think the fact that he's paid attention to this up till now augers well for the future.",
        "Obviously, (Laughing) he's got a lot of things on his plate, and we don't expect to have a lot of his time, but certainly we expect, I think, reasonably, to have some.",

        "The country is in difficult shape economically.",
        "On the one hand, part of the answer is to include science in the stimulus package, and there're many good reasons to do that that most people have probably not thought about.",
        "You know, when you give a grant to a scientist, you're not simply paying in the abstract for an idea, you're paying for a scientist to do work, which means having people in his or her laboratory who get a salary, and it means buying equipment and materials that are frequently made by an American manufacturers.",
        "We know from studies that have been carried out that there is an immediate local effect of spending on science in the community because of the salaries and the expenses.",
        "And then, there's a long-term effect of the return to the country from government spending on science, estimated by most economists to have about a 150-percent return.",
        "So, there are many reasons to make this kind of investment, but the investment is going to be short-term, rapid impact investment.",
        "And we, as scientists, know that science is a long process, and it is necessary to think about how science budgets will fare over the long haul.",
        "And there, the problem is pretty difficult because we know that the economy is in difficult straits, and it's going to be difficult to increase domestic spending on anything.",

        "It's not just - it's a memoir about your life, but along the way, you explain the science that you're involved in and the science of genetics so wonderfully that any lay person can really understand it.",
        "Well, I appreciate that.",
        "And one of the things that's interesting - and I talked about you taking the road less traveled because you never started out to be a scientist, did you?",
        "No, I was - my father was a physician, and I was of course, like any Jewish boy growing up in the suburbs of New York, labeled as a future doctor.",
        "And I don't know, I accepted that label for some time.",
        "I went off to Amherst College and frankly, was rapidly seduced by lots of other things - running the school paper and thinking about becoming a journalist, loving philosophy, dabbling in physics.",
        "Amherst was a place where you could do that very easily and think about different careers.",
        "And by the time I was college senior, I was headed for a career in literature, and indeed, went off to graduate school and only then sort of woke up to the fact the I was going to leave a lot of other things behind, especially science and medicine.",
        "I was one of the lucky ones who was able to go to the National Institutes of Health, and at the age of 28 - a very advanced age in today's science training program - was thrown into a lab to do stuff that was extraordinarily abstract for someone who was used to treating patients and reading novels.",
        "Suddenly, I was asked to explain how one little molecule regulated genes and bacteria.",
        "It seemed like an abstraction, but then I learned this stuff is fun.",
