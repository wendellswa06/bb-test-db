        "Well, there was an implicit threat, but what happened was that the president then issued an executive statement that said that his administration would not specifically spend money on research that would create embryos for research use.",
        "And indeed, that is a reasonable position.",
        "And you know, the stem cell wars that we're fighting now are not about that particular issue.",
        "But the issue is an important one, because if we ever had stem cell therapies that were shown to work but we needed stems cell that have a certain genetic property that prevented them from being rejected when they're used for therapy, it might, in some cases, be necessary to consider making embryos of a certain type to generate cells that would not be rejected.",
        "And I think it was the exceptionalism that bothered me.",
        "My feeling was that we could have regulations that made - that created a need to have a clear rationale for taking the step that many people would at least want to think about.",
        "So...",
        "President sort of made an end around the panel, right?",
        "What he did was to - I wouldn't call it end around.",
        "He responded to one aspect that he didn't want federal funds to be used for.",
        "That was not done in legislation; it could always have been changed.",
        "Right.",
        "And it was not a prohibition of stem cell research.",
        "The fact is that no stem cell research was - well, let me step back here one second.",
        "When that report was issued in the end of '94, there was no human embryonic stem cell research.",
        "It was only embryo research to be contemplated, but that research could well have included the derivation of stem cells.",
        "And when that was achieved a few years later, it was achieved through the use of funds from industry and private funds that were controlled by the University of Wisconsin.",
        "Is it a far gone conclusion then that the president is going to lift the restrictions on the embryonic stem cell research?",
        "Well, I don't have any insight into foregone conclusions, but during the campaign, Senator Obama did indicate that he expected to lift those restrictions, which as you know, are not restrictions on all stem cell research.",
        "They were restrictions that prohibited the use of cell lines derived after 9 p.m. on August 9th, 2001.",
        "Right, that special speech he made.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly.",
        "That was a congressional - a presidential directive that has, of course, influenced the way in which stem cell research has been funded.",
        "And since there have been nearly a thousand new lines generated since then, and many of them are better than the lines that were in existence when he gave that speech, those of us who support stem cell research feel very strongly that it should be reversed."

        "On the other hand, there are still many aspects of stem cell research that cannot be funded or will not be amenable to funding with federal monies until further congressional restrictions are removed, including a famous amendment, called the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which prohibits the use of funds for research that would damage or destroy an embryo.",
