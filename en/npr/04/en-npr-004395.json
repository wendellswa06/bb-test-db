        "Absolutely.",

        "OK.",
        "We'll get an answer.",
        "Well, let me just say briefly that science is constitutively an international activity.",
        "Scientists from all over the world meet fairly regularly to share their findings, and the findings are published in journals that, one way or another, are made accessible to people.",
        "Sometimes you've got to pay subscription fees, but as Ira knows very well, I've been a proponent of trying to make the scientific literature even freer and much more accessible."

        "And now, there are ways to reduce the costs of publication and to pay the price that always remains in publication upfront with author's fees, at which point, the articles can become completely free to anyone in the world who's got an Internet connection."

        "I could, although, I would also point out that we need to be cognizant as scientists of the potential applications of what we do.",
        "And science, especially in an economy that's hit as hard as ours has been, needs to be done with a recognition that while - I'm, you know, an enormous proponent of basic science and the joy of discovery and giving free range to our imagination.",
        "The public and people who make decisions about science funding need to understand that what gets done in the arena of basic science does make it, through a series of steps, to the kinds of applications that the country needs, that our economy is built on science in a very, very substantial way.",
        "Well, and you know, so little - this - in 16 years since you wrote this - as a journalist, so little of science is actually getting out to the public now.",

        "I don't think it's all bad news, but I agree with you, the number of science reporters has gone down.",

        "What would be a good sign for you?",
        "One good sign always comes back to budgets, and I think that's very much on the minds of all scientists at the moment, that healthy, predictable, steady increases in science budgets to allow people to go into science with the reassurance that if they do a good job, they compete effectively, they will have stable careers in science and be able to do the work for which they spent 10 to 15 years training.",
        "Second, ensuring that our training institutions are healthy and that we are training people to be, not just scientists, but to understand evidence-based learning and rational thinking.",
        "Of course, the third aspect, which is sort of self-evident, is that I would like to see science discover important things and help turn important discoveries into useful instruments of societal improvement, and that's - you know, it's hard to make some specific predictions."
