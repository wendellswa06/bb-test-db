        "What don't we know about cancer that we need to know?",
        "Well, one surprisingly simple thing we don't know yet, but we are rapidly learning, is the full repertoire of genetic damage that's occurred in a cancer cell.",
        "We know the principles.",
        "We know some of the damage.",
        "We've learned how understanding that damage can lead to better therapeutics and - but we've also only in the last few years had the tools for analyzing a cell's genome - the complete collection of genes that would allow us to develop a sophisticated and complete picture of what's wrong with a cancer cell.",
        "I think that's - and you know, in saying that, I have to emphasize that what's wrong with the question when we're going to cure cancer is that cancer is not one disease.",
        "It's many different diseases arising in many different tissues.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's one of the things we learn from the genetic analysis."

        "What would you be wanting to focus in on?",
        "Well, look, there's no one thing that you focus in on because cancer is a complicated problem.",
        "There are many different cancers.",

        "Yeah, you know, the blank check is…",
        "Is it not the right question?",
        "It's not the right question because, for better or for worse, there are things that money can't buy.",
        "One of them is genius, and having brilliant people working on problems and having ideas, having the leisure - an escape from grant writing to actually do the work that they're supposed to do - these are the things that create opportunity for the leaps of genius that get us where we want to be.",
        "There are some other things that are obviously important that are simply going to be expensive and require training of clinical investigators, and the most obvious is just doing more clinical trials.",
        "We have a lot of new drugs coming through the pipeline.",
        "Testing those drugs appropriately, having incentives for doctors to conduct clinical trials and patients to enter them - very important.",
        "We've made a lot of progress in pediatric cancer for a very - to a very large extent because virtually all pediatric patients were at academic health centers.",
        "They were encouraged to enter clinical trials, and we made a lot of progress.",
