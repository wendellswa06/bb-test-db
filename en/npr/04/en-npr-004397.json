        "The Braceros were supposed to receive part of their payment after they returned to Mexico, but that never happened.",
        "And now there's a dispute over new efforts to pay these workers.",
        "Jordana Gustafson reports.",
        "When they first came to the U.S.",
        "in 1942, these migrant workers were considered soldiers of the field.",
        "They were Mexico's contribution to the World War II effort, coming in to pick up where drafted American soldiers had left off, picking fruit in U.S.",
        "fields, and driving spikes on U.S.",
        "railroads.",
        "Each week, 10 percent of these workers paychecks were deducted and transferred to Mexico, where they were held by Mexican banks.",
        "This was meant to entice the workers to return home once their contracts expired.",
        "There are reports that a small returned Braceros did receive their money, but millions of others never did.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Well, of course, the public hasn't been well-educated on these issues and, of course, we've gotten away with running large deficits for a number of years now, and nothing terrible has happened.",
        "So people say to themselves, well, we might as well just keep borrowing.",
        "So I don't want to imply it's easy to get the public to focus on this.",
        "But let's go back to 1992, when Ross Perot was running for president, and he focused on this issue like a laser beam, and he got 19 percent of the vote.",
        "And when Clinton was elected because of the Perot showing in the election, Clinton felt he needed to focus on the deficit.",
        "So by the year 2000, we were actually running surpluses in the federal budget.",
        "Of course, the way the Democrats would also recall that is that along the way, they were ousted from virtually every majority they enjoyed in 1994.",
        "And so I'm not entirely clear that the political payoff was appreciated by Democrats when Bill Clinton became a deficit hawk.",
        "I think that's a good point.",
        "There may be a political price to pay.",
        "We have our current president saying that he'd rather be a good one-term president than a - OK two-term president.",

        "Ina, after 15 years now, why is California's three-strikes law still so controversial?",
        "Melissa, it's because the third strike doesn't just apply to violent or serious crimes.",
        "Anyone who's had two violent or serious crimes somewhere in their past, the third strike can be any felony.",
        "There are two dozen states that have laws similar to this.",

        "In fact, he's a wedding photographer.",
        "The three-strikes law arose out of a personal tragedy.",
        "It was the murder of his 18-year-old daughter Kimber(ph).",
        "As she lay dying, Reynolds made this wow.",
        "If I could do anything to prevent this from happening to other kids, I would do everything I could.",

        "In 1992, Kimber Reynolds was leaving a popular local restaurant when a couple of guys came by on a motorbike and tried to grab her purse.",
        "Then one of the men — without warning, literally, without provocation — pulled out a .357 Magnum, which is one of the most powerful handguns in the world, and placed it in her ear and pulled the trigger.",
        "Reynolds began working on a three-strikes ballot initiative after he learned that the men responsible for Kimber's murder were both repeat offenders, and there seemed to be a lot of them out there."

        "Those were his final criminal acts in a long list dating back to his childhood, a familiar tale to Mike Reynolds.",
