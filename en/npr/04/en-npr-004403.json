        "Most of the people don't raise their hands in that room because most people don't realize that a portion of your holding is being siphoned off every year to pay the fund's cost, whether it's marketing the Super Bowl or paying its managers.",

        "In a sense, Neal, I think w can think of your portfolio experiment is already having done that, you could maybe mentally, at least, think back and think that thousand dollars has been sitting in that rollover CD and in effect, you're willing now to take advantage of anything that you or our community out there see out there in the markets.",

        "And I'm not here to talk that down at all.",
