        "So it's more of a head game than pitching?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Are you concerned at all that you might get hurt in softball and won't be able to play any instrument?",
        "Well, I had already thought about that, but I would get really worried being hurt on my hands, because I wouldn't be able to play the piano or trumpet.",
        "But thanks to God, he's helped me and he's kept me safe.",

        "I'm also focused on the mound.",
        "Ah.",
        "So it's the same thing, being focused in both things.",

        "Well, like, playing the piano in front of a lot of people, I get nervous at times and it's also in softball, because the teams get rowdy and you get a lot of stress.",
        "So I get used to it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You stay in that zone that you're in.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yeah.",
        "But, again, you know, that's attention that can distract you on the mound.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So you're handling it.",
        "Yeah, I'm handling it.",
        "Are you autographing your picture in the magazine?",
        "Not yet.",
        "Well, be careful about that because you don't want to wreck your hand, right?",

        "Well, actually, there are different points of views about the new president.",
        "Most, you know, important problem of Iranians that has been considered by many is the financial problems, economical problems and also the unemployment.",
        "If you want to talk about the new president, I should say that he had some words, you know, stressing on solving such problems.",
        "If he comes to bring his words into action, I think it would be great.",
        "But if not, you know, we have to regret that, once more, Iranian people went to go and vote for someone who didn't bring his words into action.",
        "Did you vote for him?",
