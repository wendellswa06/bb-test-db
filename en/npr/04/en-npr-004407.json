        "Jennifer, you mentioned that cities are also trying to crackdown on immigration.",
        "What are they trying to do?",
        "Give us some examples.",
        "Well, dozens of them have passed or considered laws.",
        "And generally, they impose penalties on businesses who hire illegal immigrants or fine landlords who rent to them.",
        "But none of these have taken effect because human -civil rights groups have jumped in and challenged them systematically.",
        "Again, saying it's a federal issue and that the laws proposed are unconstitutional.",
        "Now, an ordinance in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, has become a bellwether and a model.",

        "My layperson's bet was that he was waiting to see what Congress would do.",
        "But in any case, whatever he decides, people on both sides expect this to be appealed, so we could be on hold a while there to see whether cities are deemed to have the right to act in immigration.",
        "And what about those who worked as hard as they did to oppose this Senate bill?",
        "They must be pretty happy.",
        "Right.",
        "But again opponents came from all sides, so presumably they're happy for completely different reasons.",
        "One irony here is that some of the loudest opponents who labeled this bill as an amnesty have gotten what they wanted - it's failed.",
        "But the upshot, as some see it, is a continued de facto amnesty, because now a whole slew of enforcement measures that were in the bill are not going to be passed.",
        "And some will probably try to address this piecemeal, but I don't know if that's going to succeed.",
        "Meanwhile, you do have the immigration agency continuing its own crackdown.",
        "In recent years, we've really seen it step up workplace raids and deportations.",
        "Frankly, it's still a drop in the bucket compared to the millions of undocumented here.",
        "But some argue, if you can just make it difficult enough to be here, then businesses on their own will stop hiring immigrants - illegal immigrants, or immigrants will decide not to come.",
        "I think that's probably happening on a small scale, but I'm not sure it's going to be enough to make a real sea change in the way things are.",
        "Okay, Jennifer.",
