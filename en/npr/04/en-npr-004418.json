        "Obviously, that's one way of dealing with this.",
        "It's also very risky, though, because every time we interview retirees, we find that 40 percent of them find that they had to retire earlier than they wanted to either because of their health status, their spouse's health status, or perhaps they've been outsized.",

        "Last year, there were 65 percent of the workers who were currently saving for retirement.",
