        "The good news is many of those employers have already resumed them, and we have found out when they are resumed, employees tend to come back and contribute even at higher levels than they were before.",

        "Those were belt-tightening measures at the worst of the recession.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now, I wonder, younger workers, are they saving more than they were a decade ago?",
        "Well, they are, but in essence, in large part it's because the traditional form of pension plan most people are aware of, the defined benefit plans, have become less and less likely to be there for these individuals as employers have frozen them or closed them to new employees.",
        "So in essence, they have no choice but to save on their own, through 401(k) or defined contribution plans to be able to supplement Social Security.",
        "The defined benefit plan that the old kind of well, we used to call it a pension plan.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And those are less and less common these days, and more and more people are in the 401(k)s, which depend on, as opposed to the company saying you are guaranteed that you will get X amount of money per year if you retire at X age, this is going to depend on whatever investments your 401(k) plan is invested in.",
        "Well, actually, you will probably have the choice on where that's going to be invested, but it's going to require the employee to participate in the first place, contribute a sufficient amount of money and the employee to decide on an intelligent investment asset allocation.",
        "And that's sort of interesting that half of the people you surveyed here, or who answered the survey, said they never sat down and calculated how much they're going to need for retirement."
