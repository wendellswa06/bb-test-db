        "That's right.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean if you replace a diet high in refined carbohydrates and sugar - this is what the research is showing - with a lot of plant-based fats, such as olive oil and nuts, then, yes.",
        "I mean experts such as Walter Willett say there is clear evidence that these plant-based fats lower the risk of heart disease.",
        "And it's also clear that eating fatty fish has a similar beneficial effect on our heart.",
        "OK.",
        "Olive oil, potentially good for us; fatty fish, beneficial.",

        "There's growing evidence that there's something about full fat milk or yogurt with a little fat in it that could be protective against heart disease.",
        "Now it could be the kind of fatty acids that make up the dairy fat, or it could be something else entirely, some other compounds in milk.",
        "Scientists don't know.",
        "But it's an active area of research.",
        "And I think the lesson here is that you can't just judge the healthfulness of a food simply by reducing it down to its fat content.",
        "So what you're talking about here and what we heard in your piece, are experts pretty much on board with this?",
        "Well, no. There's a lot of controversy here.",
        "All of these studies that question the link between saturated fat and heart disease have led to a lot of questions.",
        "And understandably, you know, this is challenging what had become almost gospel.",
        "The fear of fat runs really deep.",
        "And, the American Heart Association says it does stand by its advice to limit saturated fat.",
        "But here's the common ground.",
        "All of the experts I spoke to, including those who challenge the old assumptions about fat, and groups like the American Heart Association, they tell me that they mostly agree on what a healthy pattern of eating looks like.",
        "A healthy diet is one that adds in, you know, a huge variety of fruits, vegetables, legumes - so peas and beans and whole grains, nuts.",
        "And this is basically the Mediterranean approach, right?",
        "We've heard of that.",
        "Walter Willett told me that if you look at studies of the Mediterranean diet - which is linked to longevity and good health - there's a little bit of everything, including yogurt, cheese and small portions of meat.",
        "So that doesn't sound like a fat-free diet, does it?"

        "You can give something to 1,000 people and not see anything; you give it to a million people, you might see something.",
        "But they're being pretty careful to check that out.",

        "They're not expecting that this time around.",
