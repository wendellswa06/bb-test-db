        "I don't think we can micromanage a single tariff at a time on that sort of approach.",
        "On the other hand, we do need to understand that when we allow products full access to a market that are done in countries with significantly lower wages and lower environmental standards and lower labor standards, we completely undercut the ability to make things in the U.S., to have a supply chain in the U.S.",

        "And what I think is particularly interesting is that among African-Americans, not everyone thinks that mobility is equally likely, and it's the black middle class who is most skeptical of being able to attain the American Dream.",

        "Yeah, Jennifer Hamer, we would be remiss without suggesting that we have seen great growth in class structure in this country over the last 40 years for African-Americans, and noting that this is truly, class, a social construct which many people suggest takes into account education, occupation, wealth and income.",
        "And we should note that there is a difference between wealth, obviously, and income.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think one of the mistakes we make when we talk about class is we end up talking about just income or we talk about lifestyle or we talk about social capital; that is, attitudes and behaviors that are passed on from one generation to the next.",
        "And whe--I think the best way for us to think about class is to think about access to resources and access to opportunity.",
        "And we find that African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans are less likely to access opportunities and have less wealth.",
        "And this is something that's historical; that is, it's moved through time in the United States.",
        "And when we talk about wealth, that's something that's passed on from one generation to the next.",
        "And so if your grandfather owned property, then you're more likely to own property and more likely to be able to access quality education, higher education and higher income.",
        "But we find that this isn't something that has worked the same for different groups over time.",
        "Elizabeth Cole, is it fair to state, though, that when you talk about class and you look at those four groupings that wealth really is the biggest muscle of the four?",
        "Well, I think that that's true for a number of reasons, probably most importantly is because of the four, wealth is the only one that can be passed on intergenerationally.",
        "And even though we've seen growth among African-Americans in the other three aspects of class, wealth has not changed that much.",
        "So I saw a recent figure that at the time of the Emancipation Proclamation, African-Americans as a whole possessed 1/2 of 1 percent of the nation's wealth.",
        "And in 1990, African-Americans possessed 1 percent of the nation's wealth.",
        "So wealth has not changed very much at all, and it's wealth that gives you that stability when something like income, which is much more fragile, gets taken away.",
        "That being said, we are seeing, over the course of the last decade or so, a group of African-Americans who really can find themselves in what we consider true wealth and who will indeed be able to pass their wealth on to generations, and conceivably, without any systemic downturn of income will be able to do so for more than one generation.",
        "That being said, can we look at that at all as a silver lining, or are these people the anomaly?",
        "Well, I think...",
