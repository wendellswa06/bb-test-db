        "I'm sorry.",
        "Elizabeth, go ahead, and then pick up after.",
        "Well, ladies, I wish we could have put a slightly brighter picture on this, but the truth is the light, as they say, and perhaps people will start to look at this situation as it is.",
        "And as we move toward trying to close this gap, we hope that this discussion will, in fact, shed some truthful light on these numbers.",
        "Elizabeth Cole's a trained psychologist and associate professor at the University of Michigan, and Jennifer Hamer is associate professor of sociology in the African-American Studies and Research Program at the University of Illinois.",
        "Ladies, I thank you for joining us today.",
        "Well, I think there's two important things to keep in mind about that group.",
        "First, it's a very small group that's unrepresentative of the black middle class as a whole.",
        "So when you look at black middle class families as defined in terms of income, on average the net worth of white middle-class families is double that of black middle-class families.",
        "So a Michael Jordan or an Oprah is really not representative of what's going on for the black middle class as a whole.",
        "I'll leave it at that.",
        "What do you think, Professor Hamer?",
        "No, I agree completely.",
        "In fact, if you look at the highest fifth of--let's say that you're comparing whites and blacks--and you look at the highest fifth, you find that the net worth for whites is about $133,000, and for blacks, their net worth is 40--is about $44,000.",
        "So even when we talk about the topper--the upper groups, we still find significant differences.",
        "So what do we look at when we look at these numbers?",
        "Can we find a silver lining?",
        "If we talk about the miniscule number, albeit applauded by those of us who watch these people grow--and whether we want to admit it or not, we are still African-Americans, a very small community, and find pride in people who attain this status--if that is such a miniscule number, and by definition, 42 percent of African-Americans are born in this country into poverty, when we look at those two numbers and juxtapose them, is there a silver lining out here, Dr. Hamer--Professor Hamer?",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "I wish I could say that there was a silver lining out there, but I think what we find is that wealth and income distribution, of course, that they're distributed unequally in the United States, but we also see it, this inequality, perpetuated through our institutions.",
        "So we see it in education.",
        "We see it in the labor market.",
        "We even see it in the criminal justice system.",
        "So I wish, yes, that we could say that there's a silver lining, but at this point, I see that there is such inequality that it's going to take a long time to overcome.",
        "Elizabeth Cole, what's your thought there, and what's your thought in trying to close this tremendous gap between African-Americans and whites, in particular, not only with wealth but education, the job market, etc.?",
        "Well, I hate to put another pessimistic spin on it, but I think that another potential downside of the attention that the few extremely wealthy African-Americans receive is that a number of social-psychological studies have shown that when dominate group members read stories about the success of minority group members, they're more likely to attribute failure among certain minority group members to their own shortcomings rather than systematic obstacles.",
        "So they're more likely to think that the reason poor blacks are poor is because they just can't cut it.",
        "So that's another downside of these few examples of extreme visible wealth."

        "I was going to say I think that one thing that we could take away from all this is that there's still a real need for programs like affirmative action.",
        "So sometimes when we hear opposition to affirmative action, it's framed in terms of we've had such growth in terms of occupational mobility and education for African-Americans, and by paying attention to the huge gaps that still exist in wealth and how important that is for intergenerational economic stability, that might still be a good rationale for continuing affirmative action.",
        "Unless we forget--when we talk about the social construct and talk about education and occupation, income and wealth, perhaps more than any other country, certainly in comparison to the countries we mentioned before, that it seems easier to climb that ladder.",
        "Race really should be injected here--Should it not?--when we talk about class in this country...",
        "Oh...",
        "...as a factor?",
        "...I completely agree.",
        "And I think all too often when people raise the issue of class, it's done in such a way as to substitute for race.",
        "So they point to a few examples and say, `Why should we have affirmative action for Bill Cosby's children or for Oprah's children?",
        "What we really is class-based affirmative action.",
        "But when we look at the way class and race work together, I think you see that race is not declining in significance.",
        "And your thought?",
        "My thought is that we also need to talk about gender because we have an intersection of race, class and gender.",
        "And once we insert gender, we find that women are actually at the bottom when it comes to income and wealth."

        "It's a very ambitious plan to re-engineer many city streets, in the process taking away traffic lanes and street parking to make bike lanes.",
        "This is something that has to be done very carefully in a small city like San Francisco, where it's really a zero-sum game.",
        "You don't - you mostly have two-lane streets in the neighborhoods with parking on each side.",

        "And the city now has to do environmental-impact report on the bicycle plan, which they should have done in the first place.",
        "Now, I gather, and correct me if I'm wrong, that you are a little bit skeptical of whether or not riding bicycles really is more environmentally friendly.",
        "Well, I did - it's not environmentally friendly if you take away a traffic lane on a busy street, and create traffic jams.",
        "You know, you have cars idling in traffic.",
        "So, ditto for the parking problem, which anybody who knows San Francisco at all knows can be very, very tight and very difficult.",
        "Now, you also argued that bikes can hurt the economy.",

        "Well, you know, we have a tourist economy in San Francisco.",
