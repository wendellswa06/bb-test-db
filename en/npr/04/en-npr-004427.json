        "All right.",
        "Let's see if we can take a call while we still have you on the line.",
        "We're going to go to Kevin who is in Grand Rapids, Michigan.",
        "Hi, Kevin.",
        "Hey there.",
        "I would agree with the idea that your guest is making in terms of the thorough planning before any execution, although I have very different reasons for it.",
        "I was in - excuse me, Barcelona, Spain, earlier this year.",
        "And Barcelona has a program called Bising, which is a membership-based public bike system where they have bike racks and you have a magnetic card, and you can check out a bike and ride it all over town.",
        "And it's a very interesting - especially in a kind of a tourism-oriented area, a very interesting concept.",
        "But what I think they didn't do all their homework on was putting in the bike lanes in a real comprehensive way.",
        "So, my wife and I would be riding around on our Bising bicycles around Barcelona and we would be in a bike lane, come up to a plaza, and the bike lane would disappear.",
        "And so the idea of having bike lanes is great but when it comes to a situation like that, where they're not thoroughly planned-out, well-marked and so on, it can actually cause more snarls both with bicycles and cars and also with foot traffic because kind of the default behavior with bicycles is, if you're not sure where to go, you're not going to go into traffic, you're going to go up onto a sidewalk or through a plaza.",
        "And so I would think with San Francisco or any other city that's planning how to bring more bicycles into the mix, that that's one thing they really need to think is from the end-user's, bicyclist standpoint, how is it all going to be communicated and is it going to be clear that there's always a place for the bicyclist to go and not cause pedestrian or traffic snarls.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, thanks for your call, Kevin.",
        "So that seems to me there's an argument in your favor, Rob, that you should be thinking these things through very carefully before you start...",
        "Yes, especially in a small city like San Francisco where, as I say, it's mostly two-lane streets in the neighborhoods.",
        "And that's also one of the issues is that the way that this plan was being rushed through the process, the neighborhoods didn't really know what was in the bicycle plan.",
        "People in neighborhoods need - shouldn't have this sprung on them overnight.",
        "They need to be in on this process.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, there's two sides to this argument, as we know, so joining us now from our bureau in New York is Noah Budnick.",
        "He is the deputy director of Transportation Alternatives; that's a cycling advocacy group in New York City.",
        "He's also chairman of the Thunderhead Alliance for Biking and Walking.",
        "Noah, thanks for joining us.",
        "Thanks for having me, Lynn.",
        "So, I assume you've been listening and I'm wondering what you think of what Rob has been saying.",
        "I mean, do you think that the potential is there for bikes to cause more pollution and create more traffic problems rather than fewer traffic problems?",
        "Well, there's a myth that I have to bust right off the bat, which is that transportation is elastic, and it's not a zero-sum game.",
        "It's accepted in every highway manual street design guide used around the country.",
        "It's common knowledge amongst the highest echelons of traffic engineers and planners that removing lanes of traffic doesn't translate into worse congestion.",
        "In fact, case after case has shown the opposite to be true, which is that as long as we provide drivers with choices and freedom to choose alternatives like bike lanes or better sidewalks, buses, ferries, you know, bus lanes, better transit, they'll make use of these modes.",
        "And that'll help get people out of their cars and reduce traffic congestion.",
        "And there's an observation that you made that I think it is very astute, which is that bikers and walkers are really fighting over the scraps, and what that does is, it leaves us to duke it out with each other."

        "Which I think bicyclists do sometimes, they get a bit self-righteous about SUVs.",
        "It's right.",
        "When you're pedaling, you feel really good, you got those endorphins pumping, you feel good about what you're doing.",
        "But Transportation Alternatives - we've been advocates for bikers and walkers for over 35 years and that's our top priority, is making sure that these two groups get along well because these are the most environmentally friendly, healthy and really economically friendly ways to get around any urban place or downtown or, you know, any dense part of anywhere in the world.",
        "So we need to make sure that the streets are designed to accommodate them first and then see how we can officially move people.",

        "I don't think there's any experts, you know, that can really contradict what people see on the streets every day.",

        "With all those bikes on the road, we're seeing more run-ins between cyclists and cars.",
        "That's our focus today, cars versus bikes, and the search for peace on city streets.",

        "Puts on classes.",
        "And I had ridden for 40-odd years before I took a class, and I was amazed; in one weekend, I learned more than I had the previous four years.",
        "And since I've become an instructor and assisted other people - I see other people, you know, grabbing a hold, learning, getting their self-confidence, knowing what the laws are, knowing what for both cyclists and for motor vehicles, and making it a viable alternative to other forms of transportation."

        "OK.",
        "Noah, I'd like to know what you think about that.",
        "And I have to - I have to ask you for all those drivers on the roads.",
        "Why it is - I think this is the biggest pet peeve for drivers, which is why it is that bicyclists think it's OK to go through red lights, to go through stop signs, to not obey the rules of the road in the same way that cars do?",
        "There's a great study from the University of California at Berkeley called \"\"Why Bicyclists Hate Stop Signs.\"\" And you can Google it, and it looks at two parallel streets, one with stops signs and relatively low traffic, and one with stop lights with much heavier traffic.",
        "But more people rode on the street with high traffic because they knew that they could make consecutive green lights and not slow down.",
        "Because when you're pedaling you don't want to slow down because it's a major inconvenience.",
        "And I think that Gene has a really good point about....",
        "Major inconvenience for drivers, too, to slow down.",
        "But it causes accidents, and bicyclists cause accidents doing that as well.",
        "Well, I haven't - you know, the city of New York did a very comprehensive study the last 10 years of bicyclist crashes and fatalities.",
        "And really, the contributing factors mainly were driver inattention and speeding.",
        "And after that study came out, we partnered with the city, with the Departments of Health, Transportation, police, and actually with Triple A as well to promote a PR campaign called Look.",
        "And it was aimed at both cyclists and drivers, and the goal was to get people to be more aware of traffic on the streets, to get drivers pay attention to cyclists.",
        "But also, like you're saying, to get cyclists to be more aware of the traffic rules that they are to follow.",
        "And the transportation alternatives always remind cyclists that they are subject to the same laws of drivers, and really to gain the respect of people, that it's important for cyclists to follow the rules.",
        "But we have to remember that - that our roads in this country for, you know, the past 50, 60 years have been designed for cars and cars only.",
        "You know, it's barely - you know, that there's room being made for pedestrians, and there is as many conflicts between turning drivers and people trying to walk across the street in New York as there are between cyclists and drivers, or cyclists and pedestrians.",
        "So, you know, again, it's because the design of the streets are rooted in moving only cars.",
        "And that's a problem, and that's a sign of a failing transportation system.",
        "And, really, what we need to do is redesign the streets so that they'd get people options to get around other than in cars.",
        "The streets need to be complete streets and provide safe space for biking, for walking, and if you need to drive, space to do that as well.",
        "All right.",

        "Well, as part of that, a driver, I guess, had struck a biker who was a part of this - part of this group.",

        "But I was hoping that the panelist could comment on a growing movement that's been occurring in Europe lately that's kind of surpassed the complete streets movement, and is moving towards looking at streets more as a social concept - context and taking away divided lanes that separate cars from bicyclists from pedestrians.",
        "And essentially making it an environment in which everyone needs to exercise a little bit of caution and understand that there are a number of modes of transportation going on, and it's more of the social environment in an environment designed specifically for the efficient movement of traffic.",
