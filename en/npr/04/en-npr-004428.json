        "Not that we've heard of very much.",
        "I think that most of the cities are trying to, you know, kind of things like pamphlets and educational programs, but there is nothing mandatory.",
        "You now, its always seemed a little - kind of interesting to me that, you know, that people could kind of bike carefree but, you know, that there's quite a few restrictions in terms of driving.",
        "And so, I think, you know, as we go more and more, there is going to be a bigger emphasis on education and so that people kind of understand how to do, you know, get over these kind of initial growing pains of more riders and how they coexist with drivers.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "I just want to say that it really can work, but I think the most important thing, more important than the right kind of bike lanes or anything, is education.",
        "Because here in Denmark, riding bikes is just part of the culture, everybody rides bikes.",
        "They are encouraged from kindergarten, and parents are encouraged to get their kids to ride to school and - so it's really a big part of the society.",
        "One - another really nice thing, I mean, you are talking a lot about bike lanes and social streets and everything like that.",
        "The great - a great thing that they have here is whole towns are connected by bike paths that are away from the streets.",
        "So parents never have to worry about their kids being in traffic.",
        "So I just was wondering if you knew anything about the way it's set up here, and if you could compare it.",
        "That's an interesting question, Daisuke.",
        "Did you know if cities across this country are studying or looking at what Europe has done because, you know, I know the first time I really saw really good bike lanes was in Germany many years ago, and I remember thinking, well that's a great idea.",
        "Because even then I thought there were, you know, problems between drivers and this was like 20 years ago, and I thought that might help take care of some of these problems, if you had really well-marked lanes.",
        "Yeah, I think Europe is the model in terms of how to find that balance, how to strike that balance between bikes and cars.",
        "You know, Denmark is a great example.",
        "There is also Amsterdam, which is, you know, another great bicycle city.",
        "You know, I think that most cities are studying the best way to do this, and it's not easy, you know.",
        "Obviously, there's proponents on either side.",
        "And I found kind of an interesting one in New York recently when I was there on a trip and walking through this Chelsea neighborhood.",
        "I saw that they have kind of bicycles - their own lanes now - in terms of not just bike lanes but a curve in between the sidewalk and the road, and then the bicycles come through there.",
        "And then these bicycles also have their own traffic lights as well.",
        "So I think more and more cities are putting forth the infrastructure to make this happen.",
        "I mean, I think the west - the northwest has been a little bit ahead of the curve, especially a city like Portland.",
        "And Boulder has been really ahead of the curve, in terms of setting up a lot of infrastructure so that it makes it easy for bikers to commute to work or even, you know, drop their kids off for a play date or whatever the case may be.",
        "There's been a lot of work done there.",
        "All right.",

        "And I just want to remind our audience that you are listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And Daisuke, I was just wondering, in cities like Portland, Oregon I think you mentioned that things - there are lot of bikers there - things seemed to be working out there.",
        "What are they doing right?",
        "Well, Portland is, I guess, widely considered America's most bike-friendly city.",
        "I think that their kind of bike push started a long time ago - you know, maybe even well over a decade ago in terms of putting in bicycle lanes.",
        "I think it started - it starts basically with kind of the citizens of that - the residents of that city, you know, being kind of outdoorsy and enjoying the physical activity of riding bicycles.",
        "And so, once that kind of base has been set, you know, they do a good job of kind of establishing bicycle lanes.",
        "Then they do a good job of kind of linking not only trains and buses so that trains and buses will carry bicycles.",
        "They put forth things like a program where in downtown Portland, you can go and walk into a health club that you are not necessarily a member of and take a shower for a small fee.",
        "You know, there's all sort of great things that Portland has done over the years to kind of encourage, you know, bicycle ridership.",
        "And I think, you know, it's not a one- to two-year process; it's a decade-long process.",

        "Hi, Andrea.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "I want to say, yeah.",
        "I do agree, Portland has done some amazing things, but there's been kind of, like the first generation of bicycling activists really wanted to get the bike lanes on all the major streets and wanted to share the streets with the cars.",
        "And I think the new thing that the city is really been pushing in the last several years has been bike boulevards, getting bikes completely off of the main streets.",
        "And just giving, you know, really nice access to various parts of town without having to be on the big streets, because that makes people who aren't confident bike riders really nervous.",
        "I mean, I've been riding my bike - I rode it in Chicago for years.",
        "I was totally part of Critical Mass, and I still get really nervous having to, you know, stop in the middle of the road and make a left-hand turn properly, and hoping that the person behind me will actually see me, you know?",
        "And it's - but I will say that even in Portland, where things are really bike friendly, things aren't perfect.",
        "And I think that - my biking friends will, you know, not agree with me at all - but I do think that some sort license would be completely appropriate because it's - you know, I see people doing really, really, really dumb things on bikes.",
        "And, I mean, obviously, I see bad drivers constantly, but this being the first time I've actually had to own a car, I become so wary when I have to, you know, deal with a bicyclist because I know that they're not going to necessarily act like I would expect another driver to act.",
        "You know, and you - just yesterday, I saw some kid, you know, completely take a left turn in front of a car that was coming at 35 mph and not - and he just expected the car would slow down for him, and I'm just like, this is- it needs to be something that, you know, if you are going to share the road with the cars, you have to be expected to be responsible for yourself also.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for your call, Andrea.",
        "So it seems like what we are hearing over and over again, Daisuke, is that maybe a little politeness on the part of both drivers and bicyclists is in order, as well as maybe some training and education.",
        "So that might help, but thanks so much for joining us today, Daisuke.",
        "Thank you.",
