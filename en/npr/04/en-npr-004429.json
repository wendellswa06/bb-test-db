        "Officials say there's not a gas shortage, but there is a problem with gas distribution.",
        "Sal Risalvato, who heads a group that represents New Jersey gas retailers, says nearly every gas distribution terminal in North Jersey - the places where tank trucks fill up - are offline because they don't have power.",
        "Delivery trucks are having to go either to Pennsylvania, and they are also having to travel down to South Jersey to the terminals that are stationed along the Delaware River across from Philadelphia.",
        "That has substantially slowed down gasoline deliveries to retailers.",
        "Risalvato believes the situation will improve over the weekend as power is restored to more gas stations and to the distribution terminals.",
        "In the meantime, it's making it tough for people like Rob Mangum.",
        "He was at Nabath's Exxon station, waiting for the next gas delivery.",
        "To wait for gas, Mangum said, he was forced to take time out from his work delivering food for Meals on Wheels.",
        "We're out right now trying to find gas.",
        "If we won't get gas today, we won't be able to deliver tomorrow.",
        "I got food in my truck right now, but it's more important to have gas, or they won't be eating tomorrow, either.",
        "At a Hess station not far away in Irvington, I arrived just as a tank trunk pulled in with a gasoline delivery.",
        "It was a good thing.",
        "More than 200 people were there waiting in line with gas cans.",
        "An undetermined number of cars stretched around several blocks.",
        "At the head of the line wearing a relaxed smile after a four-hour wait in his Toyota Camry was Tim McPleasant.",
        "He said he wanted to fill it up, but at this point he wasn't particular.",
        "Hopefully.",
        "Hopefully they'll let you go.",
        "You'll take whatever they'll give you, right?",
        "Whatever they give me, 'cause I'm - see, I'm on E.",
        "No complaints right now."
