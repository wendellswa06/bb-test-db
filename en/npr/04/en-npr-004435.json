        "Tell me about the candidate you were researching in Arkansas.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "You know, it's interesting because we did see the impact of Citizens United and all that money out there in the presidential election, but I don't think it created opportunities for more of that deep background research in general.",
        "I think it went into advertising.",
