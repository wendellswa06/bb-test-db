        "I think everybody is pretty surprised that General David Petraeus will come here and run the Afghanistan war.",
        "The sense was, I think, that General McChrystal's deputy, Lieutenant General David Rodriguez, would likely take over.",
        "But when you think about it, Petraeus does make sense.",
        "Of course, he's well-known for turning around the Iraq War, with the surge of forces there two years ago.",
        "Also, he heads Central Command, the military command that includes Iraq and Afghanistan.",
        "So he has close relationships with President Hamid Karzai and also, officials across the border in Pakistan.",
        "Now, also, Petraeus is well- known for writing the Army's counterinsurgency manual in the theory - the focus in this kind of war should be on protecting the population, and not in killing Taliban.",
        "So for all those reasons it makes sense but clearly, many people were really surprised by the choice of Petraeus.",
        "Since Petraeus wrote the Army doctrine on counterinsurgency, does this strike you as a strong commitment by President Obama to continue that counterinsurgency strategy there?",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "And of course, the president himself said that there are no policy differences between him and General McChrystal.",
        "It was all a question of conduct, and what General McChrystal said in that Rolling Stone article.",
        "And the president, of course, said that those comments undercut civilian control of the military.",
        "So it really came down, again, to a question of judgment and a question of conduct, and not really a question of policy here.",
        "Tom, I want to ask you about something specific in the Rolling Stone article.",
        "There were comments in that article that some soldiers are unhappy with the rules of engagement established by General McChrystal, that the mission to protect Afghan civilians means putting American troops at risk.",
        "Have you heard those complaints?",
        "Yes, I have heard those complaints, particularly with Marines out in the western part of where we are now, in Helmand province.",
        "They complained that they think the rules of engagement are too restrictive and they can't really go after the Taliban now because they have to be so concerned about killing innocent civilians.",
        "Now, clearly, you know, they don't want to kill innocent civilians, but they believe their hands are tied in going after the Taliban.",
        "There's a lot of concern about that.",
        "Tom, thank you very much.",
        "You're welcome, Michele.",
        "That's NPR's Pentagon correspondent Tom Bowman.",
        "He was speaking to us from Kandahar, Afghanistan."

        "And so, I think he just kind of fancied to write his own poetry and make connections in any way that he could, sort of like his inventions but just, you know, using words instead of machines.",
        "Well, I guess, like his inventions were a little different, Longfellows' poems had things like a meter and rhyme.",

        "He says, inventors must be poets, that they might have imagination.",
