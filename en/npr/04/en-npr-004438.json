        "There have been some rock bands with African-American members, Bloc Party for example, from the U.K.",
        "Yeah, great band.",
        "But it hasn't really changed much since the time when you guys really broke out.",
        "You know, I don't know if I agree with that because it hasn't changed enough, but it has changed to a certain degree.",
        "You know, it didn't start with us.",
        "It's not going to end with us.",
        "I mean, with the rise of the Afro-punk movement alongside the Black rock coalition, with bands from, you know, TV On the Radio to the Noisettes.",
        "You know, a very good friend of ours, William DuVall, is now the lead singer of Alice in Chains.",
        "Right.",
        "And that would have been literally unthinkable.",
        "For one of the seminal bands of that movement to have an African-American lead singer and for that to be accepted is tremendous.",
        "Not enough has changed, but the landscape is vastly different than it was when we came on this scene.",
        "I mean, it was like - when you think about a band like Bad Brains, what they went through, and we're standing on the shoulders of The Isley Brothers and Bad Brains and, you know, many people who are not remembered as well as they should be now.",
        "And now, we see a whole new landscape of artists, from Tamar Kali through the Bloc Party and so on.",
        "You know, it's still a struggle, a struggle for identity, and a struggle for recognition, a struggle for marketing dollars, you know, especially now that the record business is collapsing.",
        "But having said that, you know, the best days of rock 'n' roll are ahead of it.",

        "Well, I should - I misspoke.",

        "Last year, he was playing as a freshman on the varsity team on special teams, which is a very big deal.",
        "If you have kids, you know what I mean, and he was tracking where the ball was going.",
        "It was away from the play of the ball.",
        "He didn't see the kid from the other team, and it was a helmet-to-helmet hit.",
        "He was going forward and he got hit on the side of the head, and he was literally thrown off his feet almost in a somersault.",
        "I didn't see the hit, but I've seen the tapes of the hit.",
        "And he immediately got right up, finished the play on the field and jogged off.",
        "The trainer asked him how he was.",
        "He said I'm fine, don't worry about me, and continued to play the rest of the game, didn't really have any problems with the play-calling or participating and never voiced any complaints.",
        "After the game, my husband asked him if he was okay.",
        "He said yeah, I'm fine, no problems, and that was Friday night.",
        "The next day, he played in the JV game, so he got up at six and we had him at school at seven.",
        "He never complained of anything and played in the JV game and was starting to have a lot of problems.",
        "He was having trouble with his memory and play calling and, unbeknownst to us, had a pretty severe headache and nausea, and after the game went up to the coach and told him he thought he had a concussion.",
        "So that's how we learned.",
        "And the advice, as I understand it from Tom Goldman's story that he did with you, was from the coach, was well, you know, take it easy the rest of the weekend.",
        "And if there's a problem, talk to the trainer on Monday.",
        "Well, the coach at the game on Saturday told him to check in with the trainer on Monday.",
        "But when he came home, my friend, who happens to be our pediatrician, called me for a social reason and asked what the score of the game was.",
        "And I said oh, and by the way, Billy thinks he has a concussion.",
        "And my husband and I didn't think too much of it.",
        "My husband had a concussion, was knocked unconscious in a football game in high school and, you know, three days later was back playing.",
        "And, you know, we thought we'd keep an eye on him over the weekend, give him some Tylenol, he'd be fine.",
        "Fortunately, my pediatrician was more well-versed on the subject and asked a series of questions and immediately called the high school, and arrangements were made for Billy to be evaluated at the University of Pittsburgh Concussion Center.",
        "And then you found out that things were a little bit more serious than you'd thought.",
        "And I should explain you're not just Billy's mom, you're Dr. Hagberg, and your husband is a doctor as well.",
        "That's right."

        "Well, neither of us would have cause to see anyone with a concussion in the course of our practice, and so there wouldn't be any reason for us to know the current research.",
        "And initially, you know, we didn't know how severe the concussion is.",
        "You know, there was an evaluation, and it's an evolving process.",
        "And unfortunately, Billy continued to become worse over time, over many weeks.",
        "And it turned out, in fact, that one of the things that made the condition worse was the fact that he'd gone on to play that second JV game the next day.",
        "Right, continued to play in the varsity game and played the next day.",
        "And he doesn't have a lot of accurate memory the next day, so we're not sure if he had any more hits.",
