        "The fact is is that Dr. Collins - Dr. Mickey Collins, who Margaret mentioned from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center - says on-field management these days is a lot better than it's been in the past.",
        "But still, things are missed.",
        "And things are missed because in this case - it seemed to be - because Billy, for reasons that he feels guilty about, you know, didn't really tell the trainer what had happened or what he felt had happened.",
        "And so the trainer, you know, kind of went away.",
        "Now some say the trainer could have, you know, pursued it a little more and asked a few more questions.",
        "But we should say that this school where Billy went was lucky in many ways.",
        "They had a trainer on the field.",
        "No state in the union requires a certified athletic trainer to be on the sidelines - not just for football, but for soccer, wrestling, basketball, lacrosse, field hockey, hockey, all these sports where kids get concussions.",
        "And that's a real problem.",
        "The school also had the proper testing, this ImPACT test that Billy took over and over to assess his status as he was recovering.",
        "The school has access to that as well.",
        "About 1,000 in the country have that.",
        "So, you know, lots of people - there were omissions, there were people who missed things, you know, but this school was set up better than others, really.",
        "And Margaret Hagberg, I have to ask you, the reasons - at least quoted by Tom in his story - your son, you know, wanted to tough it out, didn't want to be seen to be - he was embarrassed enough by the hit without saying, you know, gee, I feel woozy.",
        "I need to come out of the game.",
        "Of course, he's going to feel guilty about that, but at the same time, he's, you know - it's not his fault.",
        "Well, I don't believe it's anybody's fault because the concussion occurred.",
        "The questions come in what happened after the hit.",
        "And that's - you know, in retrospect it's easy to be critical and say this should have been done or that should have been done.",
        "But I think it's unrealistic to expect the coach and the trainer to keep every kid in their eye during every play.",
        "I - my husband and I feel terrible that we didn't know more and ask more questions.",
        "If we had asked him more questions on Friday night, we never would have let him play on Saturday.",
        "But we didn't have that fund of knowledge available to us.",
        "And even afterwards, when we realized he had a concussion and we looked up what was available to us - my husband's an orthopedic surgeon - we didn't even - we couldn't even find the information that Dr. Collins gave us.",
        "You know, subsequently, I've read everything that I could find on concussions.",
        "But it's amazing that even though the information's been out there for several years that it hasn't trickled down.",
        "And I would say most parents wouldn't know anything about it.",
        "The only people I found that knew anything about it were other parents in the school whose children had sustained concussions.",
        "Well, after we come back from a break, we hope to speak with some of them.",
        "We'll also be speaking with one of the country's leading experts on this injury.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It was fun listening to that segment.",
        "I was imagining how the folks there in the tournament, how they created those little Miis, what they probably look like, because you can create them so that you have grey hair and probably even sensible shoes.",
        "Well, that's the question.",
        "Obviously, Billy's story certainly raises - the big issue here is recognition and awareness.",
        "And, you know, this is both a clinical problem, and it's also a broader public health problem in that I really think it's a shared responsibility.",
        "And when we're working with athletes in our clinic we, you know, we learn a lot from their stories and their situations.",
        "And many times the athletes themselves recognize that something's different, but often don't have the judgment at that moment to pull themselves off or to recognize it.",
        "Or they might, you know, not want to lose playtime.",
        "You know, as we know, coaches may or may not be all that familiar, and I think in Billy's case they were actually quite fortunate to have an athletic trainer.",
        "But as you say, with many players on that field to be responsible for, or in a game where that athletic trainer may not be there.",
        "So, you know, we definitely believe that knowledge and awareness of this problem is central amongst a variety of individuals - the athletes, their teammates, parents, obviously the coaching staff, and hopefully athletic health personnel such as athletic trainers on the field - so that there can be that early detection and a very standard and, you know, appropriate clinical evaluation on the sideline with some very specific guidelines for not putting a player back in, you know, and then would be followed up afterwards.",
        "So it is a complex issue on the one hand, but knowledge and awareness is, I think, the bedrock to better identification, better recognition.",
        "And Tom Goldman, we don't mean to put the onus entirely on high schools and middle schools or even colleges.",
        "This is a problem that the National Football League, for example, is just coming around to recognizing."
