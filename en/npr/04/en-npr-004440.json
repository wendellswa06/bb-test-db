        "Well, I just wanted to relate my story and kind of give a comment.",
        "In high school, as a junior, I played linebacker and center for a small school in Washington, and on a goal-line stand I tackled the running back at the knees and I was kneed right on the top of my head and played the rest of the game.",
        "This was maybe the first quarter, but with really odd synesthesia, smells, sights, difficulty concentrating on the plays, things like that.",
        "But I think my comment is that between the adrenaline and the machismo that goes into football, you know, you're trained to tough it out and, you know, play hurt and everything.",

        "But Dr. Gioia, we should point out that certainly not all concussions, as we've heard about a car accident a moment ago, certainly not all concussions are sports-related.",
        "But do kids like Jens, do they tend to under-report?",
        "Yes, they certainly do.",
        "And there was actually a nice study done by Dr. Mike McCrea up in Wisconsin with his colleague, Kevin Guskiewicz in North Carolina, where they asked high school athletes at the end of the season who had not reported their concussions the reasons for that.",
        "And one was that, you know, standard I don't want to lose playing time.",
        "But the other problem was that athletes - or the other set of problems -athletes actually didn't recognize that the symptoms they were experiencing were that of a concussion.",
        "They didn't realize that they were serious enough for that.",
        "And so, we have an education problem here that compounds the fact that the athlete doesn't want to lose playing time.",
        "And the CDC has put out a very, very nice tool kit for coaches, athletes and their parents that really allows or provides some good education on the types of symptoms, the possibilities and the risks associated without recognition.",
        "And they're materials that we use regularly at all levels, not just high school, but we use it with middle school, with elementary school coaches, parents, kids.",
        "So it's education, and having that material in front you can be quite valuable.",
        "And again, I want to go back to the issue of the teammate.",
        "Many times, the teammates who are next to their colleague, whether it's in a huddle or on a soccer field or in a lacrosse game, or actually let's also bring up the competitive cheerleading and other areas where, you know, the injuries can occur, it's very important that those teammates take some responsibility for their friends and their teammates and recognize when something's not right with that individual, and really help them off the field and alert the coach, the athletic trainer or some responsible adult.",
        "Jens, how are you doing?",
        "Fine.",
        "I didn't suffer any effects.",
        "I might have had a headache the next day.",
        "But beyond that, I didn't have any effect.",
        "And Tom, I think you...",
        "I would echo that kids don't necessarily know when they've had a concussion.",
        "I think maybe there's kind of a range of head bumps all the way up to a concussion.",
        "And you get your bell rung occasionally in football and you assume that it will go away.",
        "And sometimes it doesn't.",
        "And you don't know when it's, when it's severe enough to be a concussion, and maybe that's education.",
        "Tom, I heard you try to get in there."

        "Right.",
        "And maybe this is jumping ahead too quickly, but I think it's an important thing to talk about, perhaps Dr. Gioia can do that.",
        "When we're talking about the problems of education, about educating teammates, about educating trainers, I think it's also important, and specifically with children, you know, it's important when you're recovering from concussion what I've learned is that physical activity should cease to help the brain recover, but also cognitive activity as well.",
        "And for kids, that involves going back to school.",

        "In that some teachers, they don't see a cast on a kid's leg or arm, and they think, well, they're not hurt because they look fine if they've had a concussion.",
        "But it's very difficult, and it's a problem I'm sure Dr. Gioia has encountered with his patients of how to get them back into school and how not to make them think too much at first, that kind of thing.",
        "Yes, it's, you know, when we identify these issues, we look for what are called exertional effects.",
        "And that is when there is physical activity, it's increasing your heart rate, it's pumping blood through the brain.",
        "When you're concentrating, again, you're increasing blood flow to the brain really at a time when the brain is trying to slow itself down, repair really that electrophysiological problem that's going on there, really the electrochemical process that's really thrown out of kilter.",
        "And by overexerting mentally or physically, we actually see an exacerbation of symptoms and the potential for a prolonging of the injury and the symptoms.",
        "And it's a, you know, on the one hand, we don't want to be excluding kids from life's activities, but at the same time we have to manage them very, very carefully.",
        "We're talking with Dr. Gerry Gioia and Tom Goldman.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And Dr. Gioia, what advice can you give parents about what to do proactively and what to do when they think their child may have had a head injury?"

        "And the bay's sort of at the bottom of the drain of a huge area of land.",
        "So everything that goes on on the land is affecting the bay.",
        "Scientist Ken Staver is with the Wye Research and Education Center, which sits on the bay's eastern shore.",

        "It is ailing, but many of its symptoms, the disappearing underwater grasses, declining crab and clam populations, aren't visible to a casual visitor.",
        "And the biggest cause of its ailment isn't obvious either.",
        "The Bay is choking on plant food, nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous dissolved in the water.",
        "And where do most of those nutrients come from?",
        "Ken Staver says farmers spread them mostly in the form of chemical fertilizers on their fields.",
        "That's what you're looking at here is one of the grain fields that would produce something that goes into poultry feed.",
        "Or cattle feed or human food, but in this area that grain with all its nitrogen and phosphorous goes mostly to big poultry operations, giant warehouses filled with tens of thousands of chickens.",
        "So as operations are concentrated on the flatland on the eastern side of the bay, most of those nutrients end up in manure, big stinking piles of chicken you-know-what, that no one wants to haul very far.",
        "The issue is when you concentrate animal production, you bring in feed for those animals.",
        "And then the economics have not been there for that waste, the nutrients in that waste to be redistributed back to the crop land where the grain came from.",
        "Instead it's been spread on fields close to cattle barns or chicken houses where it wasn't really needed.",
        "From there too much of it washed into the Bay.",
        "Staver says the solution to this part of the Bay's problem is send that manure, hundreds of thousands of tons of it, back to the fields where the nutrients originally came from.",
        "It's simple, at least in theory, but also inconvenient and expensive.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, it got me thinking about what Nintendo has been doing the last couple of years.",
        "They've got this brain-age series of games that are meant to kind of combat Alzheimer and dementia, kind of keep the brain agile, on both the Wii and the portable Nintendo DS system.",
        "So, Nintendo has definitely, like, kind of been leading the way, at least in the gaming world of these kind of games marketed toward an older, kind of unexpected audience.",
        "And they've really embrace them."
