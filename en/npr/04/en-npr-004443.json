        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "It was a long goodbye, but Sandra Day O'Connor finally retired yesterday when Samuel Alito was confirmed and donned the famous black robes of the Supreme Court Justice.",
        "Today, Justice O'Connor officially begins life as a civilian.",
        "For a look at what retirement might hold for her, we turn to Joan Biskupic, the Supreme Court reporter for USA Today and the author of Sandra Day O'Connor: How the First Woman on the Supreme Court Became It's Most Influential Justice.",
        "Thanks for being with us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "First of all, what was Sandra Day O'Connor doing yesterday while Samuel Alito was being confirmed?",
        "Actually, she was at the Supreme Court, and when he was sworn in, in a private ceremony, she was there.",
        "And then she left town.",
        "She's back in Arizona, she'll teach a class at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and kind of go about her life, as you say, as a civilian, for the first time in 25 years.",
        "We're talking about the life and legacy of retired Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.",
        "If you have a question, give us a call at 800-989-8255, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Was there any kind of a ceremony marking her departure, or did she just went off?",
        "No, it's funny that you ask that Lynn, because in the summer of 1981 when Ronald Reagan introduced her to the nation, you can't believe the fanfare, you know, the nation had gone nearly 200 years with only men at the nation's highest court.",
        "Her hearings were the first ever televised.",
        "Justice Lewis Powell said at the time, The town is agog over the first lady justice.",
        "There was so much hoopla, and then to have her fade away like that is a contrast.",
        "But I should say that there will be more formal goodbyes at the Supreme Court.",
        "The Court is now, actually, in a little bit of a recess, and won't formally be back for about three and a half more weeks."

        "You know, some might argue that she was at the height of her power.",
        "She was known as the 'swing vote justice', although I think that was a label she didn't like very much.",
        "But, why leave now?",
        "Many people felt that she was playing a really crucial role on this court.",
        "You know, that's absolutely right, and I would argue that she was.",
        "You can hardly name an area of the law that she was not, not only the swing vote, but the one who had crafted the standard under which other cases were decided: abortion, affirmative action, the separation of church and state, voting rights, campaign finance.",
        "But what the situation was, her husband of five decades was ill, and on July 1st when she announced her retirement she said that she wanted to spend more time with her husband John.",
        "And he is ill.",
        "That afternoon, Arlen Specter, the Senator from Pennsylvania, confirmed that, yes, John O'Connor does have Alzheimer's.",
        "So she wanted to spend more time with him.",
        "They're both 75-years-old.",
        "But I don't think she's going to fade from the national scene at all, she just won't be deciding the law of the land.",
        "And I gather from what I read that that was very characteristic of her.",
        "In fact, this idea that she, she's putting family first.",
        "And that in fact she'd already been taking care of her husband while she was still on the court.",
        "That's right, he used to come visit her in chambers and stay there.",
        "She, as a young woman in the state legislature in Arizona and then as a state court judge, she really continued to do a lot of the traditional female things.",
        "She didn't put her career over her family, she wasn't the kind of feminist that we imagine from the 1970's who really had to give up some personal life to break barriers.",
        "She raised three sons, she insisted on being home for dinner.",
        "She entered cooking contests.",
        "She used to say things, like, I like to wear dresses.",
        "They're more feminine than pants.",
        "So she, it was actually a wise move.",
        "Not only was it part of her, sort of, make up, to be more feminine, but I think it was also a shrewd move because it disarmed the men in some ways.",
        "When she came to Washington there she was, greeting the senators who would vote on her confirmation with her handbag dangling from her arm.",
        "And she presented a very non-threatening image, but as we all discovered, behind the scenes, she was quite effective in besting the brethren at their own game.",
        "Yeah, And what is she going to be remembered for as a Supreme Court Justice?",
        "What's her legacy?",
        "Well, first of all, you can't take away the fact that she was the first woman.",
        "Yeah.",
        "A biological function."

        "One of my very first assignments on News & Notes was for a month-long series on addiction.",
        "It looked at things like gambling, shopping, substance abuse.",
        "And I was assigned the segment on food addiction.",
        "So at first, I wasn't sure what route to take with this segment.",
        "In our editorial meeting, we discussed possible guests for this show, like nationally syndicated radio host Big Boy, or American Idol's Randy Jackson.",
        "They've both had weight-loss surgery.",
        "So I thought that they wouldbe great for the show because I knew people would be able to relate to them, but I didn't know if their stories really represented food addiction.",
        "And that was something we really tried to define in this segment - what is food addiction?",
        "Is there a difference between someone who overeats, and someone who is literally addicted to food?",
        "So for the answer to that question, we turned to addiction specialist Marty Lerner.",
        "He directs the Milestones in Recovery eating disorders program.",
        "News & Notes' former host, Farai Chideya, asked Marty Lerner to explain when someone crosses the line between overeating and food addiction.",
        "(Soundbite of Interview)",
        "It's very similar to other addictions.",
        "For instance, if I can borrow an analogy between a heavy social drinker and an alcoholic, there comes a time when someone wakes up in the morning and they look back and they realize, instead of them controlling their consumption of alcohol, now the alcohol is controlling themselves.",
        "So one of the earmarks of food addiction - or any addiction - is to find yourself in the quagmire of wanting to not engage in a behavior or consume a substance, and finding yourself compelled to do that despite the consequences.",
        "So a loss of control is one earmark that delineates someone with a bad habit versus someone who has an addictive process they're involved with.",
        "So who did you end up finding for the piece?",
        "I turned to Overeaters Anonymous for our guest, Vic(ph), who is a recovering food addict.",
        "And Farai started off the interview by asking Vic to give an example of a day when she completely lost control of her eating.",
        "It wasn't a day.",
        "It was the day before, and that day, and the next day.",
        "But anyway, OK, so I wake up in the morning, totally hung over.",
        "Dr. Lerner, Marty, described very well, you know, having lost control.",
        "So I wake up.",
        "I feel terrible, and the last thing I want to do, I think, is - in my rational brain - is eat because I feel so bad.",
        "And yet, I know that if I take one bite of anything, I'll be off and running.",
        "And I'm scared.",
        "I'm really scared.",
        "I'm living a totally isolated life and I'm - because of this food addiction.",
        "And I'm scared because I'll do it to myself again but...",
        "Let me - let me just ask one thing.",
        "When you say hung over, do you mean hung over from overeating or hung over…",
        "Oh, yes, purely overeating.",
        "But what's an overeating hangover feel like?",
        "Well, OK.",
        "I've just woken up from a night of terrible sweat, tossing and turning because of the excesses in my gut.",
        "I - my head feels like it's stuffed with concrete cotton.",
        "Every nerve in my body feels like its got acid on it.",
        "I feel completely demoralized, ugly.",
        "I'm also physically bloated.",

        "All right.",

        "Yeah, what did - yeah, you were saying that you were afraid to start eating but I'm...",
        "OK.",
        "But then - OK, I would be afraid to start eating but there was nothing else to do because I was dirty, I was - I couldn't fit in my clothes.",
        "I had no friends left because I was so isolated with the food.",
        "So there was nothing left to do but eat, and if I stopped eating for one second, I might remember something.",
        "Oh, and by the way, all the time that I would be eating, I - well, not all the time but at the beginning, when I would start out eating, it would like the - a break for my imagination and I'd sit there stuffing my face and thinking of all the great things I was going to do when I got through eating, what a success I would be.",
        "But soon those thoughts would be supplanted because I was just terrorized by what I was doing to myself.",

        "(Soundbite of interview)",
        "It sounds to me, and maybe I'm wrong, that what Vic has been going through was an extreme case.",
        "How extreme was it and what, you know, and you hinted at this, what make someone an addict as opposed to a social overeater?",
        "Sure, and to be honest with you, I don't really think that Vic's case is too far from most of the cases that we work with here at our center.",
        "I don't know if maybe Vic, if she's been in treatment, if she could speak to maybe some of the other people that she knows but her case really does just seem like one of the - just - if I can use the word, normal cases, that we see here quite often with someone who truly has food addiction; it is this severe.",
        "So Sonata, what was it about this piece that stood out for you?",
        "Well, Vic described her struggle with food addiction so vividly.",
        "I think we hear people depict their struggles with drug addiction in movies and on television, but I don't think we've ever really heard of food addicts speak so candidly and descriptively about their addiction.",
        "I also thought Libby Bier was an important component to this segment because she explained that although Vic's story seemed to be an extreme case of food addiction, her struggle really is not that unique.",
        "Let's talk about you for a minute, OK?",
        "We said in the beginning that you came here as an intern, and I know that you have worked - you worked at a newspaper for a while and I know you worked at CBS.",
        "But in terms of on-air or working in a television - I mean, in a radio talk show, news opinion setting, this is the first time you've really done that."
