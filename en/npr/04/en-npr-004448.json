        "JR.: Oh, yeah.",
        "In fact, the recipe is in my book for pineapple curry.",
        "It's interesting that you brought that up, because that's actually one of the more obscure dishes because you wouldn't think that a sweet fruit would make a tasty curry, but actually, it does because, you know, you've got the sweet-spicy thing going on.",
        "And, you know, I also have a recipe for mango curry in my book, too.",

        "So Amy is right.",
        "And, you know, she's done some of the best estimates on this, given what information is available.",
        "But clearly, when you're talking about half a trillion dollars or more, and a lot of that money is being mixed up for different things, it's very difficult for the Congress in its oversight role to really get a sense of what is direct war cost and what are other things that really aren't that related.",
        "And the Congressional Research Service is a nonpartisan organization that's supposed to really help members of Congress evaluate what they are allocating money for.",
        "And this report that Amy Belasco did is really about the allocation of money, not so much how it is spent in the end.",
        "Do you have any way, as a reporter, of really following the money to the final destination, to how it is spent on, you know, an item by item basis?",
        "Or do you have to rely more on these numbers that deal with how it is allocated to be spent?",
        "Primarily, we rely on the figures they layout, how it's allocated or what particular accounts, if you will, the war money goes to.",
        "But clearly, there are other ways to get at this issue.",
        "For example, when it comes to the contracting to outside firms to do a lot of the heavy lifting in Iraq, that's something that can be tracked by going back, looking at the contracts, seeing how much has gone out, how much these companies have received.",
        "But, you know, it's very difficult.",
        "The Pentagon in the past has been more willing to put out, for example, just a monthly cost of the war.",
        "It hasn't been as willing to do that.",
        "I know there are a couple of newspapers that have filed a Freedom of Information Act request to get the Pentagon to be a little bit more forthcoming in providing some of these up to date estimates.",
        "Because even the Congressional Research Service will complain that the Pentagon doesn't provide a real detailed picture of what is coming in; not just to what's coming in, but what's going out and where it's going out.",
        "And from what I understand from these Freedom of Information requests, the Department of Defense, the Pentagon, is obligated by law to submit some accounting of what it's done, and it hasn't updated those recently.",
        "Correct.",
        "It hasn't been doing it very regularly, and once in awhile these figures will get out to the press or will be leaked to the press.",
        "But it certainly does not seem to be something that the budget officials over at the Pentagon are very interested in doing, which is to just put out on a regular basis their best guesstimate, if you will, of what they're spending and generally where it's going.",
        "They haven't really done that."

        "But how does it, in very rough terms, breakdown for what's going to Iraq, what's going to Afghanistan, which is heating up and what's going to other aspects?",
        "Well, I think generally it's roughly in the ballpark of maybe $380 billion for Iraq.",
        "Perhaps another $80 or $90 billion for operations in Afghanistan and then a much smaller slice for these other operations.",
        "For example, after 9/11 when the United States started to conduct round the clock air patrols of the United States, something that was called Operation Noble Eagle, that's included in that.",
        "But that element has steadily gone down over the years.",
        "And the real cost driver has been the Iraq conflict, because Afghanistan has stayed relatively stable in terms of the operational cost.",

        "It's about $507 billion, which is an enormous amount of money and it has significant effects on the budget deficit.",
        "We borrow monies to pay for it.",
        "And the chief difficulty I have with not having a better grasp on the numbers is this means that we really don't know what we're facing in the future, either.",
        "So, Bryan, some estimates I've seen say that spending on the war could exceed $800 billion in total in the coming years.",
        "So what will this do to our nation, and I don't mean just in terms of defense, I mean on a larger level in terms of, you know, debt, deficit, Medicare, Medicaid, all of those things.",
        "Clearly, it puts enormous pressure on the deficit, the longer this conflict goes on.",
        "And, you know, it's like when you're balancing your checkbook.",
        "If a huge sum of money is going to one thing, it means that some of these other accounts are going to get shortchanged.",
        "So clearly, domestic programs, other government funds are going to have to be scaled back the longer the Iraq War and some of these other conflicts go on.",
        "But, you know, in the end, you know, I think it's very difficult to predict how much it's going to cost.",
        "Certainly more detailed figures from the Pentagon, a more detailed picture of where the funds are specifically going would help, but you know, a lot of it depends on how many troops are in Iraq.",
        "And if the current level of 160,000 troops or so stays constant, then clearly there's going to be a huge cost down the road.",
        "If those troop numbers are reduced, the costs could start to edge down.",
        "And there have been some predictions, or some people have tried to sketch out, well, how much would the war cost if we cut 50,000 troops?",

        "Some members of the House Armed Services Committee have crunched some of their own numbers, particularly on the Democratic side, and have predicted that, you know, we're talking of a cost $20, $30, $40, $50 billion long after the war just to reset, as they say, to reset the Army, to get it back to where it was.",
