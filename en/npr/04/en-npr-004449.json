        "So I just think, okay, if that's what a cigarette can do, let's just draw a bunch of them, everywhere.",

        "The image world - there's a section of the book where your two characters are staring at the ceiling.",
        "It's a wet spot on the ceiling that the rain is coming through.",
        "And seeing images, different characters, different shapes as they emerge and saying, oh, wait.",

        "The fact of the matter is, it is just a stain on the ceiling.",
        "But if you shift your mind, or if for - or something happens and your mind is shifted, it turns into this other thing entirely.",
        "And what's happening in the brain when that takes place is the stuff that I'm getting more and more interested in, and the value of it.",
        "The stuff that happens when you tap in to that ability to see shapes and let the line flow.",
        "Right.",
        "Or - it actually happens to us all day long.",
        "It's so ordinary that people don't even notice it.",
        "But the quickest way I can show it is, it's that same thing when you're walking down the street and suddenly, you know, down through - past the bakery, you smell the smell and there's your Aunt Carol's kitchen...",

        "...and it just comes flooding back.",
        "That is an, I think, an extraordinary event, because what happens is the time that you're in, the real time where you're walking down the street is somehow taken over by this flood of this other time in your past that you didn't ask for.",
        "And it comes and if -when I say to people, particularly when I'm teaching writing.",
        "Because in my feeling now, writing and drawing aren't that different than any - they're not different from each other.",
        "So when I'm teaching writing, what I tell people when they say they wish they could write is, I always say, okay, you know, we were going to freeze frame that moment of Aunt Carol's kitchen, it seems like it's just a picture, but I could ask you to turn around in it and tell me what's to your left and what's to your right, what's behind you.",
        "I could ask you to tell me what time of day it was, what season, and you would know the answer to this.",

        "And that's kind of the - whenever I do a book, I'm usually guided by a question or something that I'm trying to tease out.",
        "And I was trying to figure out why drawing this dang monkey made me feel so good.",
        "And then the other monkey you mentioned is the meditating monkey...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...which was a monkey that I - you know, after - remember there was that series of catastrophic - that catastrophic time of 9/11, and then going to war and then Katrina, and these things that kept happening.",
        "And at that same time, I started to lose - I have several friends that died all at once.",
        "And I found myself compelled, like this weird, shameful compulsion to draw cute animals.",

        "And...",
        "So, the world is going to hell in a hand basket, you're drawing Bambi.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I'm drawing dancing dogs with crowns on, you know?",
        "And, like, really friendly ducks.",
        "But I found this monkey, this meditating monkey, and I found that once - when I drew that monkey, it's not that it fixed the problem.",
        "But it did shift it a little bit, or provide me some kind of relief.",
        "And that's when I started to think, maybe that's what images do, because I believe in all my - with all my heart they have an absolute biological function, that they're not decoration.",
        "They are not an elective, that they have a function.",
        "And when I saw that just making these lines for this monkey over and over again, it reminded me very much of being 12 - about 12 and falling in love with the song that you couldn't stop playing over and over and over again because it fixed something or it made the difficult time more bearable.",
        "So I am starting to look for places in the ways that people do that.",
        "And one of the ways people do that is in doodling.",
        "You'll see people do it all the time.",
        "And I think what they're doing is making a very boring meeting, for example, more bearable.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Even just by - just by - it's just a micro shift, but it's enough so that it can make it so they - you know, you don't - you can stand to stay there and you won't lose your job.",

        "And as I draw, sometimes the words come first, sometimes the picture comes first, but they all flow together in such a way that the bottom line, in my experience, in what I'm doing, my life's major, as a friend once put it, is communication and I'm hoping that it continues to work.",

        "And that is such a profound statement, Ms. Barry, because I'm often asked where from comes this stuff and how does it happen?",
        "And I say, like the wood carver often says it emerges from the wood.",
        "It is my hand in action.",
