        "You know, it sounds braggy to say, but it's tiny.",

        "Anyhow, I was babysitting this kid and he couldn't write yet and so I said, I'll write down a story.",
        "And he would only tell me the story one word at a time and he wouldn't tell me what it was until I finished writing.",
        "And that story had - it had classic story structure and it was a really good story.",

        "That would be a very slow way to write a novel, with frosting.",
        "But the second slowest, I think, is with a paint brush.",
        "And so I started to use that and I immediately became very interested in how, just like Jeff was talking, move your hand with an object in it and a story starts to come."

        "Written out the alphabet and the first ten numbers.",
        "And then I come to understand later in the book, that you were making an argument that these are very specialized lines.",

        "Why are you doing -- you're doing the alphabet, but you're making it - and it works.",

        "So I think that there's - it's an unsuspected loss and I think it's a huge loss, because for a lot of people that's the last place where drawing stays with them, that and doodles, is in their handwriting.",
