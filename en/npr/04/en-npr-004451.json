        "I think you're right.",
        "There's another thing, too, though, is that when, you know, a lot of times people think of solving problems as there's always one solution.",
        "While it may be true that sometimes there's always one answer, but that doesn't mean that there's only one path to get that answer.",
        "And sometimes it's nice just to sort of follow your stream of consciousness towards the answer.",
        "You know, allow the students to help guide you towards an alternative path to the solution.",
        "You know, to plan the solution in advance is sort of to rob the students of the creative process.",
        "That's right.",
        "And also to rob that living experience that happens when a teacher and - well, living experience that happens in a good conversation, the same thing.",
        "And I think what you're talking about is reciprocity, is an action that is responded to and an action that's responded to instead of, unfortunately, like I am after a couple drinks, where I just wait for you to stop talking so I can get in there with another one of my great ideas.",
        "And unfortunately, that's not a good conversation, in that that memorable thing that happens can't happen if somebody's just hogging the, you know, the parade.",
        "Michael, thanks very much.",
        "Oh, thanks for your time.",

        "Yeah, I'm a science fiction writer and about, I don't know, 15 years ago, the poet Jeff Skinner convinced me after about two months' bout with writer's block, that I should get off of my laptop and try writing by hand in notebooks.",
        "And I did that for, you know, 12, 13 years.",
        "And then about two years ago, switched back to the laptop just because of the ease of, you know, electronic submissions - it's so easy that way.",
        "And you know, you can just attach a file and you've submitted a story.",
        "But I've noticed I've lost some things in that process.",
        "I pay attention to the grammar check and the spellcheck, and it changes the way I write.",
        "And in some ways I think it makes me less creative.",
        "You know, when - I use the word palamate, which is like web-footed and it had that red bar underneath it, I'm just - it drives me nuts.",
        "And I change things.",
        "It makes my grammar more Queen's English, I guess you would say.",
        "And I look back through the notebooks and I'm finding - I swear the sentences are not grammatically correct, perhaps, but they're original.",
        "They're interesting.",
        "And there's...",

        "Yeah.",
        "And I don't think creativity is - it's in some ways a very irrational process.",
        "And when you're writing in a program which is telling you the forms you should write in, when you add those forms, they're derived from the most rational process, which is, you know, using algorithms.",
        "And these people, they're sort of boxing us in and it's really, I think, deadening, at least for me, the writing.",
        "Hmm.",
        "I think you're absolutely right there.",
        "One thing that writing does give you is it takes longer.",
        "So I always say to my students, it's like -because the computer, what happens is when the story is going and then it stops, it always stops.",
        "That's the thing no one ever told me, is it always stops.",
        "Just like when you're dancing on the dance floor, and you're dancing and suddenly, you have to fake dance because you're out of the groove.",
        "But, you know, if I only knew that everyone was fake dancing at a certain point.",
        "But when it stops, in a computer, what people tend to do is look over what they've already read and start picking on it, you know, fixing it there before they even know what the whole piece is.",
        "So I feel that writing by hand gives just that extra time.",
        "And there's this great Canadian writer named Ryan Knighton.",
        "He began to go blind when he was 19.",
        "He teaches writing.",
        "And he has to hear all his students' submissions.",
        "He has to hear them.",
        "He has the speech-to-text thing.",
        "And since I've known him and started reading his work, now I use speech-to-text to hear his work.",
        "And it's a completely different experience hearing it than reading it with my eyes.",
        "There's just something - and I think it might have to do with the physical touch, which was what hearing is.",
        "You actually are touched by something.",
        "I don't mean internally.",
        "I mean, your ears literally are.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Andrew.",

        "As a jewelry designer, most people assume I work with beads and behind a bench, but I actually draw the concepts out by hand.",
        "The company I work for then sends the images and details to our factory for the sample to be produced.",
        "It is really a great way to make a living since I can draw at work.",
        "Sometimes frustrating due to all the parameters the industry has to deal with, but I get to see my concepts come to life.",
        "I also work with computers to create jewelry designs, but all of the original concepts are first done by hand, which I did not understand.",
        "And this from Richard in Kansas.",
        "I'm a realtor.",
        "I started my drawing my listings so that I had something interesting and cheap to reproduce for promotional pieces.",

        "Exactly.",
        "When I was teaching drawing right about - it's about age nine, 10 and 11 when people start to become very worried about their drawing.",
        "And when I was teaching a drawing class to people who are that age, I taught them - we drew our hands, but instead of drawing our hands, I said, we've got to make a map of our hands.",
        "So that we made a map and all the lines were like streets.",
        "And, of course, I let them name the streets because they were hilarious.",
        "Huh?",
        "JR.: There you go.",
        "And so there was something different about drawing something like it's a map, than like a picture that's supposed to be good or bad.",
        "And, again, I think all of it comes from - it's that motion of the hand that does - that makes a shift in the brain.",
