        "Well, it's always difficult to say.",

        "But for the Muslims, I was inspired by this filiere des Buttes-Chaumont, by this group of eight or 10 years ago.",
        "And this group was responsible for the Charlie Hebdo attacks.",
        "The attacks back in January.",
        "Yeah, and apparently there's still some connections with this group and the group that did the last attacks of Friday.",

        "Yesterday, more than 9,300 people crossed this border on foot.",
        "Today, new laws are in effect that make that illegal.",
        "Last night, as you mentioned, police dragged chain-link fencing and barbed wire across one of the last holes in the border fence, effectively sealing off this European Union frontier.",

        "Well, so as Hungary, you know, seals off this border where people were coming through without visas and documents, now that the only way to get across this border might be to go through actual border crossings where you have to show visas, I mean, what can these asylum seekers do now?",
        "So I'm at one of those regular border posts along the highway.",
        "There's a checkpoint where people with proper documentation - visas and passports - can cross.",
        "It's closed now because of the commotion this morning with people protesting.",

        "And if accepted, then they'll await possible settlement in other countries, according to those quotas that European politicians have so vociferously been arguing over.",

        "Are there other routes that they can take to Germany or elsewhere?",

        "Before Ferguson, adoption had started.",
        "It was rolling along, but there was still a lot of skepticism.",
        "But after Ferguson, a lot of that skepticism changed, especially on the part of officers.",
        "When their departments don't buy them, they often buy them themselves.",
        "They buy their own personal body cameras.",
        "And it's because when they looked at Ferguson, they started to worry about what would happen if there was an incident and there wasn't video to prove their side.",
        "And they started feeling vulnerable not having the cameras.",
        "And departments, as we've all seen, feel a lot of pressure to adopt them.",
        "So I'd say that is probably the most immediate effect of Ferguson.",
        "What about actual techniques that police use?",
