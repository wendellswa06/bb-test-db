        "I tell people where I live and they are like, where is that?",

        "Its design preserves the orchard and its meadows in perpetuity.",
        "A land conversation easement protects 70 percent of the land from ever being developed and across the country in suburban areas inundated with development projects many municipalities, 30 in Pennsylvania, have been begun to mandate such preservation in new residential developments."

        "It's certainly more challenging to try to get this kind or project approved and more challenging to build it as well, but it's definitely more rewarding.",
        "Fuller says designers conserve land by building homes closer together and on smaller lots.",
        "That actually costs them around 7,500 dollars less to build compared to traditional ones.",
        "That's because the smaller lot sizes mean fewer roads and sewage lines are needed.",
        "On top of that, since the houses are surrounded by open space, builders can charge 10 to 20 percent more for them.",
        "The downside Fuller says, is smaller lot sizes can make local planning boards nervous, especially if they haven't already bought into the concept.",
        "Density is something that people are afraid of, you know, they think that if the lots are smaller than the values are lower, it will change the values of the adjoining houses.",

        "But even with the more difficult approval process, developers across the country are preserving tens of thousands of acres in this way.",
