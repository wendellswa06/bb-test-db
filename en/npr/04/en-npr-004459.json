        "They're very popular.",
        "LAPD right now in Los Angeles, they're right in the middle of a big crash course for all 10,000 of their officers, learning some of these new concepts.",
        "And you hear a lot of that talk, and it's coming out of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, which was this effort that came out after Ferguson to think through new strategies for changing the way police work in the United States.",
        "So, you know, from the top down, you're hearing a lot of interest in changing the mentality of policing.",
        "But it should be said that all of this change really is still voluntary.",

        "But when I talk to them off the record over a drink or something like that, there's a lot of skepticism.",
        "And one of the reasons they're sort of feeling under siege right now is first of all, from the legal point of view, they're worried that now prosecutors may go after them for political reasons because of this new change in the air whenever they make what they believe to be an honest mistake in use of force.",
        "And there's also this sense that they're in danger on the street.",
        "The statistics don't bear this out.",
        "They aren't being shot more since Ferguson.",
        "But there's still this sense that they've got to be tactically ready.",
        "And there's very little interest, in a lot of the officers I've talked to, in, say, dialing back their use of SWAT teams on drug raids, that kind of thing.",
        "I was talking about this with Peter Kraska, who's a professor who's been tracking this process of what he calls the militarization of the police.",
        "And he put it this way.",
        "They're digging in their heels with this notion that they actually are policing a very dangerous society, a well-armed society, and armored personnel carriers, for example, are a reasonable reaction.",
