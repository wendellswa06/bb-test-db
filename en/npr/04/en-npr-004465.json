        "Well, the short answer is there is a historical reason for it.",
        "I spoke with Rick Edmonds.",
        "He's a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, which is kind of a journalism think tank - founded by a newspaper-owning family, by the way - and Rick Edmonds says there is a good reason for this tradition.",
        "It's been part of what has kept many newspapers strong editorially, and it was set up to allow a family to honor traditions and commitment to editorial quality in good times, in less good times for the business.",
        "And this is a time when all of that's being put to a test.",
        "So Madeleine, in essence, the argument is that the news business has a special role to play in a democracy, and therefore it should be insulated for short-term market pressures.",
        "And Rick Edmonds, he's just said there that this is the time when that's being put to a test.",

        "And we're not sure at this moment that even some of the Bancrofts want to go for a premium like that.",
        "Well, Steve, should the public that consumes the news, should it care about all this?",
        "Because, you know, will they get a markedly different product?",
        "Well, you know, I guess I have to say as a journalist I have to confess the bias that I see what we do is having a special role in a democratic society.",
        "So with that caveat in mind, let me say as neutrally as possible, there are several areas, I guess, in society where people are facing this question of whether market forces should ever be trumped by larger social needs, and you hear this all the time in the health care debate.",
        "Defenders of that principle in the media argue that you are already seeing what happens when companies with other interests get into the news business.",
        "At the extreme, you get this all Anna Nicole Smith all the time syndrome and less of a debate about things like health care or the direction of the Iraq war."

        "And I end the book a week later, when the 82nd Airborne comes into New Orleans and the crisis, at least that first phase of it, is starting to be pacified and we're heading into a new post-Katrina phase.",
