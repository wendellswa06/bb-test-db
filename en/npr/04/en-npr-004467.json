        "From the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia to the tear gas in Tahrir Square, from a traffic circle in Manama to the liberation of Libya, NPR's Andy Carvin has found new ways to gather and report the news.",
        "In our new digital world, thousands of people used twitter to provide play-by-play of the Arab spring.",
        "Andy gathered their tweets and their videos, tracked back their contacts to develop new sources, appealed to other users to help him check facts, and their stories spilled out to the entire world in real time as history unfolded in front of their smartphones.",
        "If you used social media to report on an event, what worked, what didn't?",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",

        "Later in the program, Ambassador Thomas Pickering tells us about what needs to change in American security abroad in the wake of the attacks in Benghazi.",
        "But first, NPR's senior strategist Andy Carvin and his new book \"\"Distant Witness: Social Media, the Arab Spring and a Journalism Revolution.\"\" Andy's with us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Congratulations on the book, and nice to have you back on the program.",
        "Thank you very much, Neal, I appreciate it.",
        "And have to begin by asking you: You don't stop.",
        "I mean, your phone's in your pocket for the first time in hours, I'm sure, but...",
        "Right, my hands are shaking slightly from the DTs, but I'm controlling myself.",
        "But I'm sure you're monitoring events in Egypt still.",
        "Yeah, things are still very tense, especially in cities like Port Said, which have declared themselves independent and have been under one form of state of emergency or another for several days.",
        "New videos have surfaced today that are most likely from a couple of days ago but showing snipers taking out protestors from snipers' nests in different parts of the city, footage that's very reminiscent from some of the footage we saw out of Yemen a year and a half, two years ago.",
        "Meanwhile, there have been new meetings taking place between the opposition, the National Salvation Front, along with one of the most conservative religious parties that sometimes has been aligned with Muslim Brotherhood but have also been at loggerheads with them at times.",
        "And so once again, almost on a daily basis you feel the political alignment shifting."

        "It's very volatile.",
        "But at the same time, I think we need to take this in the context of other geopolitical shifts that have happened in history, whether it's the fall of the Berlin Wall, et cetera.",
        "These things don't get solved overnight.",
        "There are going to be ups and downs, highs and lows that will last for years.",

        "In Egypt for example, the military has made veiled threats of getting involved if the government can't get its act together regarding security in the country.",

        "There are plenty of unresolved issues and possibly, tougher negotiations to come.",
        "NPR's Peter Kenyon has this look ahead.",
        "Perhaps inevitably, how people judge this six-month freeze, and limited easing of sanctions, depends on whether they believe the next step - a comprehensive agreement - is possible or not.",
        "Secretary of State John Kerry made the case for nuclear diplomacy in Geneva.",
        "If this first step leads to what is our ultimate goal, which is a comprehensive agreement, that will make the world safer.",
        "The next phase - let me be clear - will be even more difficult, and we need to be honest about it.",
        "But it will also be even more consequential.",
        "More consequential and as of now, all the more urgent.",
        "As Iranian leaders point out, the enrichment of uranium above 5 percent is being suspended, not scrapped.",
        "And while Iran won't be adding new centrifuges, or finishing work on a heavy water reactor at Arak over the next six months, neither of those projects will be mothballed."

        "Likewise, the international side is giving Iran a relatively small increase in revenue as some sanctions are eased, but they can also be put back in place quickly and even increased, as Congress has repeatedly promised.",
        "In essence, both sides have called a timeout from the old status quo of increasing sanctions versus an increasingly dangerous Iranian nuclear program, to see if it's possible to prove that Iran means what it says when it denies any desire for nuclear weapons.",
        "Critics, including Israeli leaders, tend to focus on the downside risk.",
        "If the long-term talks collapse, will Tehran emerge closer to acquiring a bomb?",
        "If the interim agreement holds, experts say the answer should be no. The breakout time - the time it might take Iran to dash toward a stockpile of weapons-grade uranium - would be lengthened by about a month or two, meaning U.N.",
        "inspectors on the ground almost daily would have more opportunity to detect such a move than they have today.",
        "But what if Iran has a secret nuclear facility?",
        "It wouldn't be the first time.",
        "Analyst Ali Vaez, at the International Crisis Group, says it's important that the next stage include more tangible steps to keep the diplomatic momentum going.",
        "And I think, actually, the high tempo of diplomacy that we have witnessed over the past few weeks is going to be maintained, and the two sides will try to back up the first step with additional interim measures because otherwise, it would be very hard to protect the process from criticism.",
        "One such step could be for Iran to respond to concerns raised in U.N.",

        "Much remains to be done, including establishing how long any comprehensive agreement might last.",
        "But right now, Iranians who have long wished their country would move beyond the confrontational approach favored by former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, are savoring a hopeful moment.",
        "Trita Parsi, head of the National Iranian American Council, can't help thinking about what might happen if things continue unexpectedly to go well.",
        "Because now, this more constructive approach has yielded a better result for the Iranians than the confrontational approach of Ahmadinejad.",
        "That will have repercussions for domestic policy, human rights, and the movement towards democracy as well.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC, CHEERS)",
        "Analysts say such change remains uncertain, at best.",
        "But if the cheering crowds that greeted Iran's nuclear negotiators on their return to Tehran are any indication, Iranians seem more than happy to push the hard-liners - for the moment, at least - off center stage.",
