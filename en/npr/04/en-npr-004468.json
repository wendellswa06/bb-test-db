        "And now you're talking about new storms, severe storms that could last for years.",
        "Is New Orleans prepared to face that?",
        "Is the Gulf prepared to face that?",
        "No, it is not.",
        "Let's make that very clear.",
        "I'm sitting here talking to you from New Orleans, a city that has no schools, that has an electrical grid that, with a strong tropical wind will be out, blacked out for days.",
        "There's garbage and debris everywhere, and with the exception of the, what they call the Sliver by the River - French quarter, Garden District, Uptown - the outlying areas of greater New Orleans are a disaster zone right now.",
        "We still have hundreds of thousands of displaced people, and we don't have either the levees being built properly, the floodgates being built properly to even sustain a Category 1 hurricane right now.",
        "So it is the summer of hope and prayer in New Orleans that we just can dodge the big bullet and get the Army Corps of Engineers back to building in the fall.",
        "In the whole cycle of a year, we might be able to at least be able to at least have levees to protect the city for a Category three hurricane.",
        "The big debate down here is, why not build them to five?",
        "And it's become almost a cliché now, but the notion that the Dutch could save land from the sea by building in the Netherlands their extraordinary system of dykes and levees -and the same with a city like Venice, which is essentially underwater but is a world class city of antiquity, really - New Orleans should be treated the same way, meaning we've got to put money into the infrastructure of the greater New Orleans area.",
        "But right now, there's no leadership coming nationally, demanding that there be a Marshall Plan for the Gulf south.",
        "So the repairs efforts down here are coming in in trickles, but we've never prioritized this the way I think great presidents would have, and said we're not going to lose one of our - perhaps one of the most beloved American city all over the world, and such a creative culture that's developed here.",
        "What's your vision for the new New Orleans?",
        "That we finally understand that jazz was the great gift to the world in the 20th Century.",
        "It's a freedom music that came out of blues and out of the struggle from the middle passage through slavery.",
        "That the cuisine in New Orleans is world class and famous, that our architecture is irreplaceable.",
        "And that we have to care about culture in America, not just business.",
        "That we have a sacred obligation to make sure that New Orleans exists for future generations.",
        "In the same way, we have to protect the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone from mining or mineral exploitation.",
        "We have to protect this great urban center and not just treat it as a ghost town or Cajun Atlantis, as some people are calling it.",

        "So, for example, one of the videos today, people were able to identify the location as a particular market in - a fish market, I believe in Port Said.",
        "So then you know it was Port Said.",
        "Right.",
        "And because of the time stamps on it, you were able to tell when it was shot?",
        "Well, we're still looking at the time stamps because if you make a copy of a video, it's possible that it will essentially erase that initial information.",
        "And so what people were initially claiming as brand new footage from today quite possibly is from the 28th, when things got rather dangerous there.",
        "And so we don't conclusively know one way or another yet.",
        "And I know you're a worldly man.",
        "Are you familiar with the fish market in Port Said, or...?"

        "I can't say I've been there yet, but I did look it up on Google Maps today.",
        "So you could tell aha, it looks the same.",
        "From above it looks like it could reasonably be that location.",
        "But ultimately I did have to talk to people who were either in Port Said or had just talked to people there, and they were able to describe the location after watching it.",
        "And that goes back to a fundamental part of what you've been doing, is checking stuff out.",
        "There is - going back to I think in Tunisia in the early days, there's an instructive moment when a picture comes up on one of these services, and it says: This is the embassy.",
        "And you looked and said no, no, it's not the embassy.",
        "Right.",
        "In that particular case, someone was circulating a photo saying it was the Tunisian army in front of the French embassy.",
        "Well, it was partially correct.",
        "The problem was is they took the picture from an angle that did not show the embassy.",
        "They actually showed a Catholic cathedral across the street.",
        "And so while the photo was essentially correct in the location of where these troops were, it caused confusion online because there was no clear embassy appearing in this picture.",
        "And that's something that would happen very commonly.",
        "I would see videos from Tunisia that would say four people shot dead in Kasserine, which is a city in the central part of Tunisia, and you'd watch the video, and there would be people running for their lives, and you'd hear gunshots, but there's no evidence of people actually getting shot.",
        "And so a lot of context can get lost through real-time dissemination of information, especially when people are in somewhat of a state of panic while they're sharing it.",
        "And obviously these are not professional photographers, either.",
        "For the most part they aren't.",
        "Among them you will find people that do have some experience as freelancers and the like, but the vast majority of them are people who simply have a cameraphone or some other device that allows them to shoot footage easily.",
        "There are a number of iconic videos and photos that have come out of places like Tahrir Square where you show - see armies of people holding up their hands with their iPhones or their Android phones recording what's going.",
        "Even when Moammar Gadhafi was killed, and the body was put on display in a city in central, the central coast of Libya, you can - it's sometimes hard to actually see the corpse because there were so many people shoving their cameraphones into the face of the body."

        "I was actually in Fukushima in Japan for a number of years as a teacher, and when the earthquake hit a couple years ago, and the nuclear power plant went down, we as the group of us that were there and the group of us that were still there, used Facebook and YouTube specifically to transmit information and make sure that people were all right."

        "And it's interesting, of course your first thought would be, well, this is Japan, you can depend on the government to provide accurate information.",
        "It turned out no you couldn't.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "In fact - I'm sorry, in fact a number of people, Japanese people that I know used Facebook to communicate and find out if their family members in other areas of Fukushima were safe because they weren't getting the information from the government that they needed.",
        "Andy?",
        "I think Fukushima is a fascinating story when it comes to looking at how the public gets involved in capturing a story.",
        "Almost immediately after the earthquake, within a matter of moments, you would start to see tweets coming from the region, and then the videos began to pile up, then the discussions on Facebook.",
        "How do you characterize it?",
        "For me what was the most fascinating was starting to see volunteers sending Geiger counters to the region because there just wasn't enough information.",
        "So what you and your colleagues participated in I think in many ways was the most powerful role citizens played.",
        "And so, you know, we tend to abuse the word citizen in terms of citizen journalism and all that, but you could say you were all acting as citizen scientists in the public interest.",
        "And I think in the grand scheme of things, the public was grateful for those actions you took.",
