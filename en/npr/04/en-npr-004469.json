        "And it's interesting, just going back to his story that part of what you look for to start your investigation is a whole bunch of tweets with letters like OMG and WTF.",
        "Yeah, it's interesting that when people make exclamations online because they've experienced an earthquake or something, they speak - they write in ways that are similar to the way they speak because they're so comfortable in the medium that it doesn't occur to them to say something more formal than that.",
        "And so it's not unusual for when there are initial reports of an earthquake happening somewhere, we'll search for the WTFs and more profane phrases to narrow what's happening.",
        "And so we did the same thing when the Fukushima earthquake happened.",
        "I was - I spent the first several days involved in our coverage on that trying to find sources on the ground.",
        "But after a while, I decided to pull out of it.",
        "Once the story shifted from a natural disaster story to a nuclear energy and nuclear science story, I felt I was no longer able to contribute constructively to that conversation because I wasn't acquainted with the science.",
        "And so while the citizen journalists continued to go about their work, it then became necessary to bring in other types of experts to discuss the health and pollution ramifications.",
        "Andy Carvin is with us today, and he is talking about his new book, which is called \"\"Distant: Social Media, the Arab Spring and a Journalism Revolution.\"\" If you've used social media to help report on an event, call, tell us: What worked?",

        "It essentially read, in saltier language, Mubarak thugs are riding in on camels and horses.",

        "Right, the Cairo Museum.",
        "And you were getting so much information sitting here in Washington, D.C., but so much information from all these different vantage points, from people at different places as the struggle went on, as Molotov cocktails went whirling through the air.",
        "Tell us what that was like.",
        "Well, in the days leading up to that, I had been able to pull together a list of sources among the protestors, probably 30, 40, 50 people.",
        "And on that particular day, which the locals now call the Battle of the Camel because of the people on camelback attacking them, they spent almost 18 hours trying to prevent these essentially thugs coming in with a variety of weapons trying to clear the square.",
        "So it was a siege.",
        "And what I found incredible, after a number of hours in this, I had gotten to interact with people in different places over a battle space that's probably about one square mile.",
        "It's a much bigger space than you might realize when you think about a square.",
        "It's not - it's bigger than a typical square.",
        "And as I began to picture who was placed in different locations and the roles they were playing, it gave me this distinct sense of being in a virtual helicopter, flying over the battlefield, being able to visualize what's going on, a type of situational awareness that I don't think I would have been able to achieve if I had been stuck in one corner of the square.",
        "And over a year later, I was in Cairo and did get caught in a rather vicious fight that happened there, and it turned out to be the case.",
        "I could - I was essentially caught between police lines, and I could see everything, hear everything, tasting the teargas in my mouth, but I could only really understand what was happening in my immediate frame of reference just because the action was spread across such a large field that I lacked that sense of situational awareness.",
        "Ironically when I was able to step back out of Tahrir and go online on my phone, I felt like I knew more at that moment than I did when I had been physically present."

        "So that idea of seeing this tremendously complicated incident through all of these different individual perspectives enabled you to I guess approximate the fly's eye and get the whole picture.",
        "Right, and it's a different type of picture.",
        "Reporters on the ground are able to capture these extraordinarily visceral moments, that chance when you get to look someone in the eye and capture their fear or their pride or whatever they're experiencing at that moment.",
        "And so I think in many ways what I was doing online nicely complimented the work that NPR reporters were doing on the ground because they tackled the topic from two very different perspectives.",

        "And so while NPR made its plans to get reporters inside the country, I was able to start building a source network within the country identifying who was more reliable than others, what connections they might have to different factions and militias.",

        "All I did was create an animated GIF, this is a small, moving-image file, and posted it on the social networking website Tumblr, and this received thousands of comments and replies and re-blogs.",
        "This provided a whole different audience than the original media, which had only largely been seen on Spanish-speaking networks in the United States like Telemundo and Univision.",
        "This, I just think creating that sort of social media application exposes a whole new group of people to these sort of sources that would not usually see the light of day.",
        "And not - well, analogous to what you do.",
        "Yeah, and I think amplification is the perfect word for it because people are essentially - on social media they are organized as networks of friends and colleagues and communities.",
        "And so when one person posts something, and it resonates with the rest of their community, it has the potential of moving down to a next generation of users.",
        "And I think your example of the animated GIF being passed on Tumblr, Tumblr is a sort of online community where animated GIFs are a very popular thing to share.",
        "That's G-I-F.",
        "G-I-F.",
        "It's a file format for images.",
        "It's one of those images that are kind of grainy, and they - or they loop again every five or 10 seconds.",
        "They've become a rather trendy way of sharing footage for - over the last year or so.",
        "But what I find fascinating about this notion of amplification is with that type of power also comes great responsibility because there are always the risks of amplifying information that's incorrect or not with the proper context.",
        "And so for example when there's a battle going on, or more recently in the case of the Newtown massacres as news outlets and citizen journalists were circulating claims about a second shooter, a maroon van somehow getting involved, rather than just completely ignore that conversation spreading online, I would go out of my way to tweet it but in the context of asking people for independent confirmation.",
        "What other news sources have commented on this?",
        "How have they verified it?",
        "And so there are some occasions where amplification without adding context or questioning the context can be risky."
