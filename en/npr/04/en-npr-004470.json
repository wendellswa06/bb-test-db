        "And most of the people in his network who were helping him comprise these manuals for Libyan revolutionaries were also youngsters like himself or college students.",
        "They ranged from college students to young professionals with nursing backgrounds, Special Forces backgrounds, some still active in their professions, some not.",
        "And what I find most fascinating is they didn't know how old he was, either, until they were well on their way creating these manuals.",
        "And so I imagine at that point they figured well, yeah, he's 15, but he seems to know what he's talking about.",
        "And I've talked to Libyans who were in the field in battle zones, like during the liberation of Tripoli, and they've told me that these documents they created played a tremendous help in helping them getting organized.",

        "That is exactly what we're talking about doing.",
        "Unbelievably small, limited kind of effort.",
        "I am expected to produce a story for each shift I work, and or, report breaking news.",
        "Sourcing stories at 12 AM at night can be hard, so we've turned to Facebook and Twitter to find residents willing to comment on the issues.",
        "Other journalists in our newsroom are also working with first responders to set up Twitter accounts for local fire departments, et cetera.",

        "It's very heartening to hear that because one question I haven't been able to answer is will these methods apply in other types of journalism?",

        "How did you do that?",
        "Do you do it through multiple corroborating sources, locally, or are you using outside media to corroborate the stories?",
        "Do you have the same problem?",
        "What media are reliable?",
        "What I would end up doing is I would ask my Twitter followers to help me dissect what was in this footage.",
        "I have a number of people who follow me that are native Arabic speakers and know a variety of dialects.",
        "They're people who grew up in many of these towns, cities and villages that have experienced fighting and protests.",
        "And so, for example, when we first received videos that were reportedly out of Libya, you know, it was understandable that some news networks, they were hesitant to show them, because there's - there are so few people who've experienced covering Libya.",
        "But my Twitter volunteers would come out of the woodwork and say, oh, I recognize.",
        "That's the courthouse in Benghazi.",
        "Or if you hear what they're chanting, you can tell it's a Libyan accent from the way they pronounce the letter G rather than the letter Q.",
        "And so it's that kind of insider expertise that you may not have yourself, but if you have a community of people who have a vested interest in what you're reporting, they can be very helpful."

        "And so I'll often have to re-tweet a number of times, saying, this is unconfirmed footage or unconfirmed reports.",

        "What level it would get to remained to be seen, but to have pretended that you didn't know something was happening, I think they really dropped the ball on that one.",
        "What's the future?",
        "The future is, I think, many news organizations are starting to invest in staff who are much more comfortable utilizing social media, both in terms of mining it for, in real-time research, for breaking news, as well as to identify potential members of the community who can assist them in their coverage.",
        "But as I said earlier, it's still relatively unproven.",
        "It's - let's face it, it can be a risk of an editor to say OK, I want you to spend 50 percent of your time hanging out on Twitter and when it's all hands on deck because a major story is breaking, I expect you to stay on Twitter.",
        "That can be nerve-wracking for any manager in the news business.",
        "But ultimately, I think, if we're going to evolve and incorporate new methods, ultimately, it does take a certain amount of experimentation and trusting your reporters to be professional about it."
