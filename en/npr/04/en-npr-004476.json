        "What does it look like from a Republican point of view?",
        "I think on the Republican side of the fence, that Barack Obama represents a formidable candidate for the Democrats.",
        "He is not politics as usual, as so many of the candidates that you see running right now on the Democratic side have been around Washington, have been part of the problem, if you will, some of the discord that a lot of the American people find with politics as usual in Washington.",

        "So Donna Brazile, is that indicative of what you think the national response from the black community will be to Obama?",
        "Well, currently she is leading Mr. Obama by at least 40 points in national polling.",
        "She's attracting about 60 percent of African-Americans.",
        "He's attracting only 20 percent.",
        "His problem, again, is name recognition.",
        "Most African-Americans are not familiar with him.",
        "While he gave a very, you know, dynamic speech at the Democratic National Convention, I do believe that it's his challenge, like the challenge of all the other Democrats, is to introduce themselves to black voters and to earn their trust.",
