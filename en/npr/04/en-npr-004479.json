        "This is hardly a problem.",
        "We don't think of measles killing children, but immunization has helped to bring that down significantly, as well as oral rehydration.",

        "There are still an awful lot of very poor people in India and a lot of very poor people in China, but those proportions have begun to change drastically.",

        "Thanks, Burt.",
        "I mean, I think that one of the things that's been interesting is that over the last I'd say eight years or so we've had a huge dispute globally over reproductive health services, a period where the U.S.",
        "government did not fund family planning because of an interpretation of what, in fact, family planning meant, and therefore not providing funds in areas where they thought it meant that abortion services would be provided, even if even though services were provided to women after a failed attempt at an abortion.",
        "So it's a but in the meantime, you family planning was essentially flat-funded for eight years.",
        "That meant that women didn't have access to the means to prevent unplanned pregnancies.",
        "Some fear that it means funding is going to be taken away from treatment and for - you know, we have four to five million people now who are alive because there has been treatment made available for HIV and AIDS."
