        "You know, a mother dies every minute from complications at birth because there was no birth attendant and nobody who knew how to address complex obstetric problems.",

        "It may be from botched abortion, which is all too prevalent, unfortunately, or other complications.",

        "But does the progress suggest that in the countries that are not showing progress, they can look at models and say, right, if we do what they did there, we can see comparable progress?"
