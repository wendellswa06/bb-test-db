        "So that - the idea that some people are resistant to, but - is integrating all these services, in other words, improving the health system, and therefore being able to reach people whatever their health issue may be, whether it's the need for family planning services or reproductive health services, making sure that the HIV/AIDS services and all of those health needs are in one place so that people don't have to avoid the HIV/AIDS center, because it'll be just wherever they go.",
