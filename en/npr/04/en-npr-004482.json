        "This brought attention that's been rare during Cuomo's tenure.",
        "Despite his famous name, Cuomo has kept a low profile in his first two years.",
        "Unlike Christie, he avoids national political shows and stayed offstage during the Democratic convention.",
        "But deals he's brokered in a chronically dysfunctional state capital have stoked talk about his political future.",
        "Cuomo's rebuilding plans now rely on more than Albany lawmakers.",
        "He wants comprehensive infrastructure upgrades to protect from fiercer storms.",
        "To pay for it, he's asked Congress for $30 billion.",
        "On an Albany AM 1300 radio show, Cuomo acknowledged his timing is bad.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF RADIO SHOW)",
        "They'd rather not deal with it, because of the fiscal cliff and everything else.",
        "But I'm the governor of the state of New York, and this state needs help, and it's my job to make sure they know this state needs help.",
        "For both Cuomo and Christie, their reelection - and any larger political ambitions - hinge on how well they maneuver these post-storm politics.",
        "Cuomo has an easier path to follow here.",
        "New York University political scientist Patrick Egan says Cuomo's attention to climate change and infrastructure aligns with his party.",
        "Governor Christie, meanwhile, has to lobby for recovery funds without further alienating his Republican brethren.",
        "He doesn't want to sound like a taker, to use the language of some conservatives, and so he needs to think about how to - if he makes a request at all, to make a request that sounds justified and realistic.",
        "So far, though, Christie's approach has earned him some new fans.",
        "A recent poll asked New York City voters which political leader performed best after Sandy.",
        "At the top of the list, over Democrats Andrew Cuomo and President Barack Obama, was Republican Governor Chris Christie.",

        "For some people, the juxtaposition of a sectarian civil war unimpeded by intense diplomatic effort has a familiar ring and that ring recalls the war in Bosnia in the early 1990s.",
        "Yugoslavia had come undone.",
        "The patchwork of Serb, Croat and Muslim populations descended into a bloodletting.",

        "And when you've written recently about Syria, you've invoked the experience of Bosnia Herzegovina.",
        "Do you feel a resonance of Bosnia in the current diplomacy over Syria?",
        "Yeah, I think it's very like it was in September/October 1992, a complete mess.",
        "And it doesn't surprise me these negotiations have been very difficult to establish and will take time.",
        "In those days, some faulted you for advancing a peace plan which accepted the facts on the ground and it was said, by doing so, rewarded Serb aggression.",
        "How did diplomats solve this problem?",
        "How do you reconcile the desire to, say, keep the Syrian regime at the table, even though it's a regime that, we heard yesterday, tortured and murdered detainees by the thousands?",
        "It is very difficult.",
        "I mean, if you stay in judgment with them, if you start taking sides, of course, you'll be no use at all.",
        "So the main thing is to be extremely polite.",
        "But, I mean, we had to, as you say, withstand a great deal of criticisms from people who seemed to believe that you could a perfect solution from an wholly imperfect solution.",
        "There will not be a resolution in Syria without some very messy compromises.",
        "Keeping the country together will, itself, be a triumph.",
        "Back in the early 1990s, you faulted Washington for encouraging the Bosnian Muslims with false hopes that lead them to fight on.",
        "You said they were dreaming.",
        "Are the Saudis, the Turks, the Qataris, are they now falsely encouraging Syrian rebels to fight beyond a point that makes any sense?",
        "I don't think you can pack up fighting unfortunately at this stage.",
        "You have to stand your ground.",
        "What I think you should try to do is get local cease fires and if you like, some form of humanitarian relief coming through.",
        "All this time, you're trying to form structures which can give people a measure of security and, to some extent, decentralized power.",
        "And then on top of it, you're trying to construct an overarching organization for the whole country."

        "Well, first of all, let me explain a couple of facts.",
        "The problem with an oil spill is not just the amount of oil that's spilt.",
        "It's where it's spilt.",
        "And it's the kind of oil that's spilt.",
        "In the case of the Trinidad and Tobago spill, it was in the tropics, it was in July.",
        "It was - there was a lot of sun.",
        "And the water was very warm.",
        "The air was very warm.",
        "The trade winds were blowing.",
        "And about 50 percent of the oil spill simply evaporated, and the rest was largely consumed by oil-eating microbes, which attack oil because it's a natural substance.",
        "And light Arabian crude, which was cargo of these ships, is the most volatile and the most unstable of all crude oil pumped from the earth, so more of that evaporates.",
        "Now that evaporation is not an entirely harmless process.",
        "I mean, it's greenhouse houses and so forth that go off.",
        "But it leaves a lot less there to coat birds.",
        "The heaviest parts of the oil, paraffins and asphalt and things like that, become tar balls and they sink to the bottom of the oceans, which is what happened there.",
        "But by the time the oil spill was stretching toward Granada, one of the experts that I interviewed estimated that it was such a thin sheen, it was about what your wife finds in the sink when she's washed the salad bowl, he said.",
        "Huh.",
        "And that was essentially what happened.",
        "Now, what I hear you say, though, is it happened in July, it was hot.",
        "There was a lot of sun, a certain kind of crude.",
        "It sounds like maybe that was a very difficult scenario from, say, the Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska?",
        "Very different.",
        "You ask the same - experts I talked to said if this same cargo had been a tarry viscous kind of oil that's pumped out of the north slope of Alaska, and if it had happened in the Arctic, that same oil would be, would have been with us for a century.",
        "So it's very much a question of the environmental conditions and the type of oil.",
        "We have someone on the line who actually worked on the Valdez oil spill.",

        "Good, what your experience there?",
        "Well, I went up to Alaska hoping to work actually on the oil spill with my siblings, and we were actually not allowed to work on the oil spill.",

        "I didn't say it wasn't.",

        "Your caller, who talked about the Exxon Valdez, that spilt 270,000 barrels of oil - 270,000, okay?",

        "What makes it to the surface is only a small fraction of what's being ejected from the well.",
