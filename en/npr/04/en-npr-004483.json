        "I mean, I know the Louisiana marshes very, very, very well and I care very much about them.",
        "And the seriousness of this is unquestionably great, but there are also processes at work in the natural environment about which I think most people are ignorant.",
        "And these things are breaking down this spill as we speak.",
        "And the wider it gets and the more it spreads out, the more of it evaporates and the more little bugs eat at it.",
        "Now, even after the bugs eat at it and some of it sinks to the bottom, obviously there'll be some effects.",
        "But it won't be as bad as if all of the crude undiluted, unattacked, unevaporated had hit all of the wetlands.",

        "I worked for a company that innovated a process for washing beaches.",
        "And we use cement booms and a hot oil torch.",
        "Basically we pump water from the Sound, heated it up, ran it through a boom and washed oil.",
        "We were doing excellent.",
        "It was actually working.",
        "The problem became - we were - we did too good.",
        "There wasn't any way to pick up the oil.",
        "It only had like two skimmers in the whole - three skimmers in the whole task force.",
        "It became a logistical nightmare.",
        "I can tell you that that heavy oil, besides being, of course, sticky and thick on the beaches way out at the mouth of Prince William Sound, not only was it everywhere and messy, it was impossible to move because of the heaviness and the cold water.",
        "Now, when the process was - when we were in the process of cleaning, even though it was working on a smaller scale than we would like to have seen, it was still working.",
        "And then (unintelligible) threw a monkey wrench into the works, turned everything upside down, because from our perspective it appeared we were doing too good, and a lot of people were laid off very - about halfway through the spill and they just kind of threw money at it and didn't do any real work.",
        "But it became a political issue (technical difficulties) to begin with, we were working with the tides, waiting for the tides to - to go to high tide and then we'd follow the tide out.",
        "Thus, we were able to move oil with the tides and they flipped everything upside down.",
        "What I'm trying to - my point is here that I don't - you know, fortunately, in the warm water down there, they might have, you know, be able to get more of it to evaporate like the gentleman was saying.",
        "I really pray for those people that live around down there.",
        "But the political and - the oil companies and the political side of that overtook the logic and the reasoning.",
        "And I really hope that that doesn't happen.",
        "I was out there for six weeks.",
        "I have tons of pictures.",
        "And I really hope that when a system is put into place that will allow cleanup and allow the citizenry to become involved, I really hope that will happen.",
        "I really hope that BP and other agencies, Coast Guard and whatnot, will allow the citizenry to mass up and, you know, give them the money to get the booms and bring in the skimmers and bring in the technology.",
        "There are a lot of people down there that work in the oil fields and whatnot that actually understand what to do."
