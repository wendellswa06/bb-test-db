        "Well, there is a strong strain in the Australian ethos of anti-elitism.",
        "Rupert Murdoch saw it as his holy writ, if you like, to challenge the prevailing elites at the same time as he supped with all of the most powerful people in the world.",
        "I think a big part of it was when he arrived in England he found a very, very class conscience society.",
        "Murdoch challenged that and really put it right back to the English by taking ownership of the institutions that they had always regarded as their own.",
        "David Leser, before we let you go, I want to ask, how is this story playing in Australia?",
        "Is this big news there?",
        "Oh, it's huge.",

        "He owns 70 percent of Australian newspapers.",
        "70 percent?",
        "Seventy percent.",
        "And in a number of capital cities the only newspaper you can buy is a Murdoch newspaper.",
        "Certainly this story is everywhere.",

        "Speaking of the fiscal cliff, let's take a minute to review what it is and how it all began.",
        "Imagine yourself standing on top of a cliff and it's December 31st, New Year's Eve and you're looking down, way down, toward New Year's Day.",
        "That's the deadline, the day a lot of fiscal policy will change and nearly all of us will feel it unless Congress acts.",
        "Congress, along with the White House, set that deadline to resolve the long nasty fight over budget deficits and the debt ceiling back in the summer of 2011.",
        "Our political leaders thought it would be a good idea to increase the stakes of failing to find ways to reduce the deficit to create an incentive for compromise.",
        "So they established automatic cuts and tax hikes that would take effect on January 1st, 2013, the fiscal cliff.",
        "But no compromise has yet emerged, so here we are in November headed toward that fiscal cliff.",
        "If Congress does not act before the end of the year there will be across the board cuts in spending to everything but entitlements.",
        "That means education, defense, food stamps, national parks, you name it.",
        "And there's the other side of the package, the Bush era tax cuts expire, so taxes will go up.",
        "And the cliff gets even higher when you add in the fact that some stimulus measures are expiring January 1st, including the payroll tax holiday and extended unemployment benefits.",
        "So both consumers and the government are going to have a lot less to spend if we go over that cliff and that could push the economy back into recession.",
        "Here's a request for you.",
        "While our leaders work on backing us away from the fiscal cliff, you might get tired of hearing that phrase over and over.",
        "Do you have a new metaphor for us?",

        "NAACP President Benjamin Jealous issued this challenge to the Tea Party...",
        "You must expel the bigots and racists in your ranks or take full responsibility for all of their actions.",
        "Last night, delegates at the convention unanimously approved a resolution echoing Jealous's words.",
        "It said that while the group believed in freedom of assembly and people raising their voices in democracy, the Tea Party should repudiate bigoted statements, images and any racist leaders."
