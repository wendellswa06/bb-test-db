        "And let me just remind our listeners that we are talking about the latest report and the state of news media for 2008, with Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.",
        "If you'd like to join the discussion, give us a call at 800-989-8255 or send us an e-mail to talk@npr.org.",
        "What I found really interesting, Tom, especially if you've been looking at these reports over a period of time, is that what you found was that the newsroom is where the experimentation is taking place and its advertising that's falling behind and doesn't know quite how to deal with digital media.",
        "Yeah, and that's related to the same phenomenon that the audience is sort of staying with old media in a lot of ways.",
        "Online, there is no full-page ad with lots and lots of information.",
        "Every ad is pretty small.",
        "Online, a newspaper needs to get in the TV ad business with video ads.",
        "Well, they don't have salespeople that know TV ads in the newspaper.",
        "And they don't have really print ad people at the TV station.",
        "So the newsroom is figuring out how can we give our print reporters a TV camera, how can we get give our radio reporters a digital camera to shoot video?",
        "But it's actually turning out to be harder on the business side to figure out, well, all those clients you have that went away, you're going to have to find new clients to sell advertising to or maybe you're not going to sell advertising, maybe you're going to sell search.",
        "You're going to have to sell an entirely different product now.",
        "That's turning out to be harder than, okay, you told the story in audio, now tell it visually as well.",
        "Yeah, and that's a problem for the news media, if the advertising part of - can't keep up with them then who's paying for what they're doing?",
        "Another way of looking at this is that the audience for The New York Times, what's produced by that newsroom is actually greater than it's ever been.",
        "And almost as most people go to The New York Times Web site now has read the paper in print.",
        "But The New York Times makes 93, roughly, 93 percent of its revenue from the print edition and only about 7 percent of its revenue online.",
        "So every time a reader shifts from a print reader to an online reader, it costs The New York Times money.",
        "So you also see that the business - that the newsrooms of newspapers across the country and to some extent, television stations.",
        "The news people are saying, well, let's figure out how we can monetize this.",
        "Let's figure out how we can sell the story.",
        "So the news people are getting more involved in the business thinking, and that wall…",
        "Instead of go to the - yeah.",
        "…is sort of disappearing.",
        "Well, is that a good or bad thing?"

        "Well, you know, that news people would say it's a good a thing as long as they're coming up with a business plan.",
        "I'm sure they'd say it would be a bad thing if the business people were kind of put the news plan.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting, though, do you think that the news people - just because I've been covering these reports for a while, I feel like it sounds like this year you're saying there's been a turn in the mental - in the thinking of the news people that they've finally have come around instead of feeling like our industry is dead.",
        "They're saying, oh, it's not dead; it's just we have to look at it in a different way.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And that's a good thing.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, we started this and you cover the first one in 2004 and at that point, we said, you know, there's very little innovation going on in traditional newsrooms online.",
        "I think they've moved from fear to anger to acceptance to, this year even, enthusiasm.",
        "And that's a real shift.",
        "I mean, just absolutely no question, you hear people saying - and we have a survey of journalists as part of the report - the majority of journalists say they think that journalist writing, blogs is good for journalism, that citizen news sites are good for journalism, that citizens posting comments on their stories are good for journalism and that splitting their time between their old platform and the new platform is a good thing rather than something that's spreading them thin.",
        "Those are findings I think would have meant just inconceivable three or four years ago.",
        "Yeah.",
        "If you'd like to join our discussion about the state of the news media, give us a call at 989-8255.",
        "I'm talking with Tom Rosenstiel, the director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism.",
        "You know, some of the ways that - you were just talking about blogs, something else interesting in this report is that it turns out that some of these sort of user-generated sites are not going to play as bigger role as it was thought.",
        "Yes.",
        "Two things about that struck me.",
        "One is that news people are saying, well, wait a second, it's fine to get tips from citizens and have them come in our stories but having them actually post content, we're finding it to be not as helpful as we thought.",
        "The other thing that we found that was interesting was when you go to the citizen news sites, they act very much like the old news sites.",
        "Right, that was interesting."

        "Interesting, too, Tom, that you point out in this report that - and there's an understanding, I think, of this - in the newsroom as you say that there is no longer one single finished news product, that this a 24/7 service.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "Yes.",
        "The idea that journalism is going from being a product to being a service, how can you help me?",
        "You know, it's - I go to your Web site at NPR and it's fine and you got your story there and that's a lovely story.",
        "But know I want to find out where else can I go and where can I buy this product, and how do I reach that person, and I'd like to suggest the next story to you, and by the way, let me tell you what I think of your story.",

        "You know, I guess, my comment is that this political season, when I first started watching the news, you know, it was exciting just the in-depth coverage that you were getting.",
        "But quite frankly, it's been going on for so long that I've definitely hit the fatigue point.",
        "And, you know, I just don't want to watch the news anymore because it's more of the same thing or it's getting to the point where it almost begins to feel contrived and that the story, they're just keep digging and digging into the minutia of that - you kind of lose track of the big story with the political argument.",
        "I'm just fatigued with that aspect of journalism",
        "Well, Tom, this is something that your report, in fact, does point out, which is that the news media, the agenda of a news media continues to sort of narrow rather than broaden, and I think you point out that Iraq and the campaign, I think, it was 25 percent of all the content in the news media was on Iraq and the campaign.",
        "In fact, if you were to take Iraq, Pakistan and Iran, those three countries, take them out of the mix and you take out hurricanes as sort of one-time events, that the entire rest of world made up less than 6 percent of all the news coverage that we monitored last year, and that includes Afghanistan and China.",
        "The problem here is as the financial pressure increases and your audience spreads across more platforms, you actually have fewer reporters at each outlet and everybody's cutting back, buying people out.",
        "And so you actually, even though there's more media, the number of reporters at anyone of those places is smaller, so their sort of peripheral vision is narrowed even though it seems like we have more media.",

        "And the front page of a Web site has links to dozens and dozens of stories, and that notion is growing even more.",
        "I mean, the current thinking is that 50 percent of every Web page, even an interior page of a Web site, should be devoted to navigating to other things because there is no front page to a Web site anymore; you might enter from anywhere.",
        "And the net effect is that the power shifted to the consumer, to be their own navigator, to be their own editor.",
        "And that means if somebody goes to the NPR Web site or The New York Times Web site, that they should be providing them with links to other Web sites.",
        "They shouldn't be worrying about those other Web sites being competition for them but that these are just links.",
        "A year ago, we saw - we did a big study of Web sites and found that most of the traditional Web sites are what we called walled gardens.",
