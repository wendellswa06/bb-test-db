        "Donna Reynolds, who listens on member station WABE in Atlanta, posted this comment on our Web site: Ms. Bartoli has a profound respect and sympathy for the Castrati and the unique social position in which they found themselves.",
        "They were both admired and sought after as musicians, while at the same time viewed as less than persons worthy of respect in their own right.",
        "I applaud Ms. Bartoli and the producers of this wonderfully provocative and evocative multidimensional work of art and commentary.",
        "Jeff Fox of Sarasota, Florida found a link between the sacrifice made by castrati and the pro football players I spoke about in my essay last week on brain injuries in the NFL.",
        "He writes: Today we no longer require young, often poor young boys to go this barbaric route to rock idol status; indeed, though we have substituted a far more barbaric path to fame.",
        "Today, all that we require of our often poor young men is that they be willing to sacrifice not only their future physical health and manhood but very possibly their future fullness of humanity.",
        "The potential loss of brain function due to repeated traumatic brain injury that many players suffer is a powerful repudiation of considering football, as today's game is played, to be a civilized sport.",

        "He helped the singer through customs in Alberta and accepted the offer of free tickets, and he was suspended.",
        "In his defense, he says he did ask two supervisors if he could accept the tickets, both of whom told him no. It's MORNING EDITION.",
        "We're going to take a few minutes to talk about rallies happening today in dozens of cities across the country called the March Against Sharia.",
        "Sharia is a legal and philosophical code derived from Islamic scripture and tended to guide observant Muslims.",
        "Marchers say Sharia law and Muslim immigration is harming America.",
        "In Syracuse, N.Y., marchers turned out to support President Donald Trump, and they were met by other demonstrators who are calling the rallies anti-Muslim bigotry.",

        "So, first of all, who organized these rallies and how many were there?",
        "Well, this was a group called Act for America.",
        "It's a lobbyist organization that's had close ties to the Trump administration, and they've been active for a number of years passing state-level bills that target Islamic law and also refugee policies.",
        "They organize the protests nationwide looking at about 19 different states where they say these rallies were happening.",

        "I saw people on both sides of the street actually wearing uniforms, a lot of military militia-style fatigues on the pro-Trump anti-Sharia side of the street.",

        "The organizer of the main event here was Lisa Joseph.",
        "She describes herself as a Jewish woman who believes that Muslim Sharia practices could be a real threat to American society, though, she couldn't point to any examples of it actually being implemented in the country right now.",

        "People in the Tea Party movement have been holding rallies for more than a year now calling for limited government and protesting the Obama administration.",

        "We've been leaving the president hanging.",
        "The president's been out there pushing these real solid policies: health care, jobs, stimulus, education reform.",
        "And those of us who consider ourselves to be his allies, haven't been doing our part in being out there, pushing hard enough against his opponents and explaining why it is we're for what the president is doing while they're saying what they're against."

        "The implication of the recent events in Egypt was not lost on President Obama when he spoke from the White House last Friday, after it was learned Hosni Mubarak was stepping down.",
        "Egyptians have inspired us, and they've done so by putting the lie to the idea that justice is best gained through violence.",
        "For in Egypt, it was the moral force of nonviolence - not terrorism, not mindless killing, but nonviolence, moral force - that bent the arc of history toward justice once more.",
        "According to Shibley Telhami, a professor of Middle East Studies at the University of Maryland, they argued that ousting a figure like Mubarak could only come about through force.",
        "What we've seen here is exactly the opposite - that the people of Egypt and really the people of Tunisia have done so peacefully, in a manner that bin Laden has not been able to do in any country by force.",
        "Telhami calls the recent events in Egypt bin Laden's nightmare.",
        "But he cautions the process is not yet complete and hardly irreversible.",
        "If, in fact, this experiment, this revolution succeeds and people see that these peaceful demonstrations are bringing about change, al-Qaida's power will diminish considerably.",
        "The risk, of course, is that there will not be a smooth pathway to democratic and representative government.",
        "Some fear the possibility that the Muslim Brotherhood, the oldest Islamist group in Egypt, may be a stalking horse for militancy.",
        "After all, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaida trace their foundation to some common sources.",
        "But there are big differences between the two, says Dan Byman.",
        "One of the biggest is that the Brotherhood has renounced jihad and violence.",
        "Skeptics may say that was simply tactical, that it was forced to do so.",
        "But nevertheless, that renunciation was something that Zawahiri and al-Qaida have been quite critical of."

        "Should Egypt descend into political chaos, it could present an opportunity for bin Laden and other extreme groups, says Dan Byman.",
        "The biggest risk is that if the revolution in Egypt fails, if it goes back to another dictatorship of some sort, if it dissolves into chaos, that this will vindicate bin Laden; that this will show his message that there should have been an organized jihadist leader of this, it will show that to be correct.",
