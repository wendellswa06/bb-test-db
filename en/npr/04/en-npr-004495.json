        "The program is a pilot that will involve fifty-one hundred families from six of our highest poverty communities in New York City.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And who's paying for this?",
        "The program has been funded by a collaboration of philanthropic entities.",
        "And the mayor's thought in starting this is it - it's very new, it's very different from more traditional approach to social services.",
        "And to give it a better chance, we really ought to fund it privately.",
        "Test it with those philanthropic dollars.",
        "It's a perfect role for foundations to have, to try new innovations that aren't necessarily proven.",

        "And so we've engaged them to help us to design the program and to put together the evaluation framework.",
        "It's a random-controlled methodology, so that we'll have a group of families, who are participating in the pilot who will receive benefits and a comparable group that will be tracking simultaneously, so that the outcomes for those two groups will be definitive in whether or not these incentives have actually changed the investment and health education and workforce development that we're looking to invest in.",

        "And we found it intriguing enough when the mayor appointed a commission to study the experience of poverty here in New York City and asked them to find innovations across the country, and now we discovered across the world, of things that might make a difference.",
        "This program, the Conditional Cash Transfer program, it came up time and time again.",
        "And quite frankly, initially, when we heard it, we didn't really think that it was going to be relevant to us here in New York City because the economies of those countries, where they are in place, tend to be very poor.",
        "But the more we looked at it, the more we realize that there is many things in common with areas of very high concentration of poverty here in New York City, where there is such isolation of those communities from the opportunities that exist just a couple of subway stops away until it really - it - we were asking ourselves the question, can this very different approach work here as well as it has worked in other countries?"

        "And we want to break that cycle by changing the outcomes for the children in the household, around their well-being on health matters, on, you know, dental visits, and changing their outcomes in their education, not just school attendance, but the - how they do on standardized exams and whether or not they're advancing through the grade levels at age-appropriate times.",
        "Then, we're building that international Conditional Cash Transfer model by adding in an adult workforce component - incentivizing full-prime employment and skills development.",

        "The problem is, most of the incentives that we create are more long-term.",
        "That is we try to embed those incentives, not just within day-to-day behaviors, but we try - and this sounds a little bit Calvinist - but we try to get people to look to the long-term, to do something today so that there's a reward five years from now or whatever.",
        "And for young people in grammar school, you know, was to get to a good college and so forth.",

        "And there are high costs of those transactions that are not the same calculations that exist in better-off households.",
