        "Our guests are Linda Gibbs, New York City's deputy mayor for Health and Human Services who's going to be overseeing this program, and Douglas Besharov, a scholar in social welfare studies at the American Enterprise Institute and professor of public policy at the University of Maryland.",

        "Many of these programs have the following difficulty: You want to encourage the people who don't do something to do something so you give them some money or some other incentive.",
        "But you have the other 80 percent of the people who are already doing it.",
        "As I understand, Opportunity New York City - the benefit, so to speak, will go to everyone who achieves a certain thing, for example, getting a library card, and would include all of the people who already would have gotten a library card, or go to people or children who pass a proficiency test even if they would have passed it anyway.",
        "Is that right?",
        "That's right.",
        "And in designing the program clearly what we were looking for here is - in what areas are the current outcomes just simply substandard?",
        "And these neighborhoods where the program is targeted, our high school graduation rate is below 45 percent.",
        "And so there's a huge gap in performance.",
        "And so while those who graduate who would have graduated anyway will get the benefit.",
        "What we're really trying to figure out is in the allocation of resources, is it a wise investment to incentivize the families directly with these cash benefits if it will the graduation rate, for instance, up 20 or 30 points?",
        "So, is that amount of money for that movement worth it?",
        "And that really was the challenge in designing the program.",
        "What areas should we incentivize?",
        "How much should each incentive be worth?",
        "In some cases, simple transactional things - $50 for a library card versus $400 for an on-time graduation.",
        "And how much movement does it create in the outcome.",
        "And all of those things will have to be calculated.",
        "My bet is that we've a lot of this off.",
        "And we're going to have to learn as we go along, whether we over-incentivize in some cases, or whether we made an amount so little that it simply didn't have an impact?",
        "Right.",
        "And what complicates this, and this is why I ask the question, is we're so used these days to talking about cost-benefit analysis.",
        "And the cost here is now not just cost to the people who wouldn't have been graduating otherwise; it's a much larger cost if you ever put a scale on it.",
        "And therefore, the impact on the people who wouldn't otherwise have graduated high school, the improvement on the high school graduation rate, for example, has to mean much greater than you would otherwise supposed to make this a…",
        "Yeah.",
        "I was going to - I think what he's getting at is how you measure success?",
        "If it's two percent more, is that going to be enough, or if it's 20 percent more?",
        "(Unintelligible).",
        "Thank you.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yes.",
        "And we have to look at that.",
        "But then we also have to look at the very high cost associated with the ongoing poor outcomes.",
        "And so, a lower graduation rate is not the cost simply of that person not graduating, but it's also of the cost of what we know is going to happen in their future lives.",
        "They are twice as - they're twice as likely to live in poverty than someone who graduates from high school.",
        "They are more likely to be involved in the criminal justice system.",
        "So with all of these, it's about seeing the immediate improvement around the outcome that's being incentivized, but it's also trying to change all of those other trajectories where there will be other public cost incurred if we don't improve the outcome."

        "It's a more human development approach.",
        "And so, what we've done is we have - the idea is to take these long-term goals, which is really the challenge, and break them down into very, very small sort of bite-size pieces.",
