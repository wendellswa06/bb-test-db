        "Assuredly, monetary incentives will offset the cost of health care and time off, but does incentives really address the root causes of poverty?",

        "It's just the way to protect their job like we do with family medical leave when people are sick, so that they can feel, okay, I can go, still come back, have my job and I'm able to feed my family.",

        "And I wonder, Linda Gibbs, what do you think of that?",
        "Well, there is - we have - it's a little complicated, but there is a special component of our program that is attached to just adults related to their adult workforce skills and development.",
        "And that segment of the program will be tested for households that have Section 8 vouchers, those are federal housing subsidies.",
        "Right.",
        "And it is possible in that program that we will have an adult-only initiative to evaluate.",
        "And I think overall, the goal here is really to think about not how to subsidize individuals while they are poor, not how to, you know, simply relieve the condition of their poverty but how to change their life chances of living in poverty in whether that's a single adult living alone or whether that is a family with children.",
        "And importantly here, what we know is, generation after generation in many of our communities, unfortunately, poverty is just persistent.",
        "And so it is important to look at a two-generation approach, where it's not just incentivizing and supporting the head of household but helping to think about how we can change the outcomes for the children in those households so that they don't repeat that cycle."
