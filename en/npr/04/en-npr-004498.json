        "At homeroom in the morning.",

        "Linda…",
        "And I tend to agree with the caller, but there's always two sides of this.",
        "So the business incentives that we have are sometimes accused of penalizing people who smoke, you have to pay more health insurance or life insurance because you smoke.",
        "Or should you have to pay more health insurance because you're overweight?",
        "My employer, indirectly, is penalizing people, I think, for not physically fit.",

        "Why, you could view this that they are actually rewarding you for remaining fit and not smoking as supposed to penalizing…",
        "Well, carrots and sticks are - depends on the recipient I suspect.",
        "But Linda Gibbs, let me ask you, how long are the philanthropies - the foundation's prepared to support this study if Mayor Bloomberg says it's going to be years after he's all left office before we know whether it works or not."
