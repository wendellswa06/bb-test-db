        "24\"\" was novel in the beginning because of its fast pace, but it seems that they're running out of plot and substituting with this constant torture.",
        "Either he's tortured or he's torturing.",
        "And \"\"CSI: New York,\"\" in order to differentiate itself from the other \"\"CSIs\"\" or \"\"Law and Order,\"\" seems to have substituted plot by just showing blood and guts.",
        "And I stopped watching that, too.",
        "Law and Order\"\" seems to have a little bit more plot and occasional but much less graphic violence, and I would much prefer plot over graphic images.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "This is very much a theme that's comes up.",
        "I read a blog every week after - the night after \"\"24\"\" airs and - on ew.com for Entertainment Weekly - and all the - many, many of the comments are exactly what this listener is saying, is saying I was a real fan of \"\"24.\"\" I love the acting.",
        "I think Kiefer Sutherland's terrific.",
        "But they're really going way too far in the direction of torture and it's making my family and I uncomfortable.",

        "I remember when they tried to turn Freddy Krueger into a series, which they had on during prime time.",
        "And I saw it one time I think on the Family Channel, and it showed a poor girl who had just had a dream and was being pushed with razor blades across the ceiling.",
        "I think some of the people who make these have their own issues.",

        "It's not a new book.",
        "It came out about 10 years ago, called \"\"Forbidden Tales of the Bible.\"\" And in there you can find everything from rape, incest, you name it."

        "But with video games, they - when you see like a television show, or something like that, it's always that passive observation.",

        "I think the thing is though, if you're going to have your kids play that, you have to be there and play it with them.",

        "Well...",
        "Yeah, I think that's true.",
        "I think that that shows the technology generation gap.",
        "I think that parents know they should watch some of these TV shows with their kids, but they don't realize that when their kids go off and play these video games that parents could care less about, they're not really monitoring that.",
        "They don't have no idea the level of violence that some of these, the most popular games, contain.",
