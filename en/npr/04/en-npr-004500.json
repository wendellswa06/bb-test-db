        "I do.",
        "Interesting.",
        "We've got an e-mail from Lily(ph) in Kentucky.",

        "We're a country at war.",
        "Could this contribute to a rise in violence in our entertainment?",
        "You seem to be suggesting it's all directly connected.",
        "Well, I don't think it's necessarily directly connected, but I think it's significant that this rise in torture films and torture on television cop shows happens at a time when America's at war and when it's known that guards have been torturing soldiers - excuse me - prisoners in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.",

        "Yes, thanks for taking my call.",
        "The first thing I wanted to say was just that when it comes to the difference between regular television and cable, HBO and some of these - there's a lot of violence involved.",
        "However, another caller had mentioned the lack of plot and story on the television networks.",
        "That's where cable is really, really popular.",
        "It's not just that there's violence.",
        "It's that there's excellent stories, there's excellent plots.",
        "And I think that's what brings the viewers to that, not just the violence.",
        "I think the violence is just more of a realistic - and they get away with it because it's on HBO.",
        "But it seems like the plot and stories is what brings people in.",
        "And then (unintelligible)...",
        "Or is it - Stephen, is it the shock value?",
        "You can't see this on broadcast TV, and that's what brings people to it.",
        "And they may stay for another episode if they think it's well written and well acted.",
        "It does sound as though this concern about Sharia law was actually shorthand for something else.",
        "So what is that something else?",
        "And then the last thing I wanted to make a quick comment on, which your gentleman was speaking to a moment ago.",
        "I think there's much more of a direct connection between seeing more torture and more violence, especially more torture and more military-type of situations, on television and films as it relates to what's going on with our current administration, with our current, you know, world politics, the war in Iraq.",
        "It seems like in terms of the show \"\"24\"\" specifically started doing more torture and really started increasing - that became kind of the focus of the show - right around the time that we started having a debate and we discovered the...",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Joel Surnow was recently profiled in The New Yorker and was describing himself as one of the rare, quote, \"\"right-wing nuts\"\" in Hollywood.",

        "Doesn't that show there is some sort of I think support for, there's some attempts to actually normalize or glorify or glamorize this so that it's more palatable to the public that we're actually torturing people in other countries?",
        "I think that's the case, yes, indeed.",
        "I think that America's been having a flirtatious little affair with torture.",
        "And now America's started to think that maybe torture isn't all, you know, he was cracked up to be.",
