        "So she could see into those who obsequious, those she thought were disingenuous, and she took straight aim at people like that.",
        "She saw straight through Senator McCarthy, and he was saying that he was just going to call her Alice, and she looked at him and said, the truck man, the trash man and the policeman on the block may call me Alice but you, Senator McCarthy, will call me Mrs. Longworth.",
