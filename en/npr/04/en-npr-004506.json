        "Well, Neal, you know, one thing I haven't thought of until your intro just now, it's like death is a great career move if you're a pop star, right until they make a film about you.",
        "I think that we have to limit this somewhat to films about recording stars.",
        "There were in the old days some - you really couldn't be a pop star until the days of electronic media.",
        "Amadeus Mozart was a great star.",
        "He was a pop star.",
        "And I found an early talkie that probably put paid to Grace Moore's career when she tried to play Jenny Lind around 1930.",
        "But you couldn't really be a superstar until there were recordings and radio.",
        "So as a result, this is a genre that really gets going in the 1940s and '50s about people who were stars around World War I.",
        "So, that you got \"\"The Jolson Story\"\" and you got \"\"The Great Caruso\"\" and you got, a little bit later, \"\"The Fabulous Dorseys\"\" about the Dorsey Brothers.",
        "And then of course, once we moved in to the time when rock and roll was actually a memory, the floodgates opened.",
        "So these have got to be films about recording stars.",
        "Well, also, there is sort of a sub-genre.",
        "And that's movies about composers, the \"\"Yankee Doodle Dandy\"\", \"\"Three Little Words\"\", \"\"The Cole Porter Story.",
        "Right.",
        "Exactly so.",
        "And \"\"Words and Music\"\" about Rogers and Hart.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There were - actually Cole Porter has been treated twice, once by Cary Grant and once by Kevin Klein.",
        "It's - when they started looking - it was a kind of a genre, and when they started the all-singing, all-talking, all-dancing musicals in the late '20s and early '30s, they looked for composers' biographies and song writers.",
        "And when you mention things like, you know, death and drugs and abuse and that sort of thing, I remember being approached once -somebody wanted to do a film about Duke Ellington, and this producer, the more we talked about it said, you know, it's a little bit like the '40s and '50s when they did George Gershwin, and they did Franz Liszt, and somebody wanted to do Antonin Dvorak, and they realized he had a happy life.",
        "There was nothing, you know, really - and Ellington, despite his many setbacks and ups and downs, didn't really - it's not really the stuff of drama in the way that, you know, say a Judy Garland would be.",
