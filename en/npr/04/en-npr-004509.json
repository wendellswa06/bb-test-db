        "Well, I think we've identified at least 150 tipping points in the last few months, so I never know which is which.",
        "But this Corker statement I thought was significant.",
        "He's not been a leading anti-Trump conservative.",
        "He was under consideration as Trump's secretary of state.",
        "He's from a very red and conservative state, and he tends to choose his words very carefully.",
        "And so I think this was a real signal that what happened in Charlottesville, Trump's moral equivalency between Nazis and Klansmen and white supremacists and their opponents, really has been a problem for him.",
        "I think we're going to see what will other Republicans do.",
        "It is still striking that there aren't that many Republicans who have been willing to join Bob Corker.",
        "Yes, they've attacked white supremacy and Klansmen, but they haven't gone after Trump by name the way Corker did.",
        "And then of course we're going to see if the departure of Bannon changes the equation with Capitol Hill.",
        "Ramesh, what do you think?",
        "Republicans in many states can look at the polls and see that Donald Trump is as popular with his voters now as he was a few months ago.",
        "Would you expect Corker to remain an outlier or to hear similar statements from more Republicans?",
        "I think there's been a gradual erosion of President Trump's support among Republicans, more among officeholders than among voters but in both groups.",
        "I think a lot of Republican officeholders over the last year have been telling themselves that the president was - that Trump was going to change, that the responsibilities of office would change and that his advisers would change, that there would be a pivot and a change in his entire direction and strategy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The doctors are very reluctant to tell you what is going unless he gives consent.",
        "And when you're dealing with someone who may be psychotic and they say no, I don't want him to know anything, you, so frustrated as a parent because you can't intervene.",

        "The state shut them down overnight with the institutionalization, as soon as the federal government said we'll start taking care of people through social security, through federal payment, people with mental illnesses.",
        "And overnight there is no place for them to go.",
        "Where are they gone?",

        "So to understand where we're headed, people in free societies by and large turn to the press for information, and we'd like to think the news media give us facts and ideally the context to draw our own conclusions about the world around us.",

        "At the same time, though, if you pick up your local paper, chances are much of that is devoted to news about the school board or flap over downtown development.",

        "He attacked corporations.",
