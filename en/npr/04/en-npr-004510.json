        "Right, and on any given day a story from around the world might have the legs to--and just sort of the--in our judgment an interest--general public interest to make the cut on page one.",

        "Well, how do you gauge that interest?",

        "You've written extensively on the globalization of media.",
        "Are there a variety of sources?",
        "Sure.",
        "The first thought that comes to my mind when listening to Mark is, in a way, how things haven't changed so much.",
        "Mark didn't expressly refer to the wire services, but I would bet that Associated Press is going to be a very significant source of both national and international news for Mark, and AP is a cooperative of approximately 1,500 daily US newspapers, and it is a very significant source of news for them, for most of them.",
        "Most of them don't have--don't field their own correspondents in overseas countries, or if they do, just a very small number.",
        "So one thing I take from Mark is that in this respect, globalization or not, at the local level, things don't seem to have changed that much.",
        "So secondly, the second thought I have is that, as Mark rightly says, there are many more sources in--that we can access through the Web, so that has changed, that we do have--as news consumers, we have access to--I'm tempted to say an infinitely broader range of sources than we used to.",
        "Probably...",
        "Is it--is there a problem of vetting and credibility, though?",
        "Yes, that's one issue.",
        "The--many of these sources that we can access over the Internet do not have the branded, if you like, credibility and trustworthiness that people often attribute to the mainstream media.",
        "But we can also use the Internet wisely to access other brand-name sources.",
        "We could use it to access stories from Reuters, for example, or Bloomberg or even Agence France-Presse, which is the French-language--well, not only French language, but the..."
