        "I'm the managing editor of the paper out here in the Aleutian Islands, and I just wanted to point out that for these local papers, there's a very small weekly--and I had just come from a daily--we're very much dependant on those wire services and the Associated Press, and you know, while they are cooperatives and we do have some interaction with local editors at the AP, they really have at times kind of an overwhelming, distant organization, and we're dependant on what they decide is worthy international news and how they cover it, and I don't even know if our local editors have that much input into the way the international coverage works.",
        "I--it's a good question.",
        "It seems to me that if you're relying on, say, two wire services or one, in the case of some newspapers, one wonders about the blanket or the depth of the coverage, Oliver.",
        "Unidentified Woman #3: (Speaking Thai)",
        "Yes.",
        "Very interesting comment that we've just heard from there.",
        "Associated Press, it needs to be said, despite the problems that have been referred to, it is a quite an unusual model.",
        "It is a quite an unusual structure, that cooperative structure, and although it may be a flawed structure, I suspect that when you compare it with some of the other providers of global news, you find even less connectivity, if you will, between the central organization and the customers or the clients.",
        "But it's interesting to hear, certainly, that even a cooperative structure may not be as responsive as people would like it to be to information needs, to news needs at the local level.",
        "Thanks for your call, Drew.",
        "You know, one organization that's been at it for quite a while is the British Broadcasting Corporation, the BBC.",
        "A veteran in the international news business, Richard Sambrook, is the CEO of BBC World and director of BBC's Global News Division, and joins us now by phone from the Toronto Airport.",
        "Thanks so much for being with us.",
        "Hi, Frank.",
        "Tell us a little bit--you know, we got into this whole business of cultural bias and sort of how you choose news stories.",
        "How has the BBC manage this question over the years?",
        "Well, it is a very complicated question, and (unintelligible) a number of factors.",
        "Firstly, we broadcast in 43 languages, and obviously if you're broadcasting to a country in its own language, then your news agenda, if you like, is gonna be tailored to the interests of that country.",
        "But we also broadcast in English in radio and in television and now, of course, we have the Internet as well, and that's a global service and, therefore, not tethered to any one set of interests or of national interests in any way."

        "And all of these things--it's like any other form of news judgment really.",
        "It's an art, not a science, but you have some criteria by which you try to make the information as tailored or as relevant to whatever audience you're trying to address.",
        "The difficulty for a big global service like CNN International or BBC World is that it's literally a global audience, and for the BBC, that goes back--we have a tradition going back 80 years as far as global services.",
        "We try and think of ourselves, if you like, as looking down at the world from 30,000 feet.",
        "We don't try and project British interests particularly.",
        "I'm sure some people would say that we can't avoid that.",
        "We're bound to have some kind of British interests wrapped up in our selection.",
        "But we don't try and project British interests.",
        "We try and take a kind of neutral global take on international events.",
        "But when you say a global audience, I mean it really isn't a global--well, if you think about that, we think about people in their fields, people in their offices all around the world, but you as a broadcaster have to have an audience in mind in order to target the message somehow, to fashion that message.",
        "Who do you think--who do you think is...",
        "Yeah, we have a number of different audiences, and this is where it gets complicated.",
        "In some senses, of course, we are sometimes a lifeline service in parts of Africa, in the villages in Asia or in countries that are going through crisis, in Iraq or more recently in Afghanistan.",
        "We've become at times a staple source of information.",
        "At the other end of the scale, like NPR, the BBC's audiences in North America, the most kind of media-saturated society in the world, our audiences are growing at the minute because what we're offering in terms of a global agenda is very different from what people can get anywhere else in that market.",
        "So for those people who want that, they know where to come and find it.",
        "And in the middle, there are, of course, the developing countries--and Asia is the prime example of this, which is very fast, very rapidly developing their own media.",
        "India is a good example.",
        "India now has--I think it's 43 news channels of its own.",
        "And there we have to find our own place in terms of not trying to report India to the Indian population, but trying to report global issues which have some relevance and resonance in that country.",
        "Oliver Boyd-Barrett, you hear what BBC is going through, struggling with this changing environment, this global environment.",
        "Overall, is that the picture?",
        "Do you find the old standards are having to adjust?",
        "And what kind of adjustments are they making?",
        "Yes, I think this is--I suspect that this is still a process of transition.",
        "This is a relatively new phenomenon, broadcasters that have if not global reach, certainly very impressive reach across many, many different nations, and I think this is still a process of transition, still a process of learning how best to tailor news services to such an incredibly complex and heterogeneous market.",
        "The BBC, BBC World does have perhaps an advantage inasmuch as it came out of, it sprang from the older BBC World Service, the radio service that was--Richard used the term a lifeline--but was regarded by many people in the ex-British colonies and elsewhere, parts of the developing world, often countries which suffered under fairly, very often authoritarian regimes, that the BBC World Service, being a radio service, did achieve fairly spectacular reach into populations of some of those countries with a much less biased or a much less censored or controlled account of what was going on in the wider world.",
        "...(Unintelligible).",
        "So--but--so the BBC--as I say, I think that is an advantage that it enjoys.",
        "In a way it's even more complex for some of the other players, like CNN.",
        "We have an e-mail that asked the question--well, makes the observation that, `When I travel out of the country, CNN advertises for shows about the Middle East, Africa and Asia.",
        "Programs are not available in the US.",
        "Why?",
        "Ellen wants to know.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks for the call, Alan.",
        "He raises, of course, the echo effect--the fact that it seems like there's a lot of sources, but really, at the top, there are two or three, four or five giving consolidation who are generating the news, and everything else is derivative."

        "So that sounded a lot like Donald Trump in 2016.",
        "Does the president have a new message for 2020?",
        "I think that's a marketing judgment that CNN makes with respect to what it believes that its viewers, its consumers in the United States expect and want and are used to, and I expect the logic runs along the lines of, well, in the United States there isn't that much of a demand for an international or a global perspective, that people are much more interested in local and national issues.",
        "And that, I think, is--and I'm sure Richard and others would speak much more professionally or could speak in much greater depth about this--but that seems to me to be the real challenge, is that people's information needs are locally situated.",
        "People are situated in local cultures, and they want news or they want information which speaks to them as being so situated.",
        "So it's a very difficult judgment, a very difficult call, I feel, for these ...(unintelligible).",
        "They are locally situated in an ever, more interconnected world, and so as we heard from our first caller...",
        "Yes.",
        "...it was very important to her to hear about what's happening in other places, to understand why certain things may be happening in the US.",
        "So I will put the question to you, Richard.",
        "In the end, it does become a marketing problem, doesn't it?",
        "It becomes a question of: Will they watch this if I put it on?",
        "Well, of course it does.",
        "I don't think it's simply a marketing issue.",
        "It's about trying to serve your audiences in the best way that you can, but you're absolutely right that there is this kind of tension between the local and the global, and what audiences want is a global news with a local resonance, although they want to understand the global significance of what's happening locally to them.",
        "And the extent that broadcasters are able to encompass that tension, I think they could be more successful, and that really means trying to regionalize services where you're able to, at least at certain times of the day, in order to be able to kind of bridge that local-global span.",
        "I mean, I think the other thing you were talking a little earlier about, whether there's a kind of domination of Western global broadcasters and so on, but the other thing that's happening that's relevant to this is, of course, new voices are coming on the scene, and we're seeing that particularly with Al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya and new broadcasters in the Middle East who are, you know, very well funded and privately funded, by and large.",
        "But also, as I was saying before, in parts of Asia there's now a very dynamic local media growing which, it seems to me, is gonna break out sooner or later in a global sense.",
        "And, of course, on the Internet, the barriers to entry, the costs to entry in terms of Internet news sources are now very low indeed.",
        "So I do think, you know, we are in, as Oliver was saying, a point of transition, and I do think we are at a point where we are gonna see a mushrooming of different voices and different regional voices coming out and being available around the world."

        "Richard?",
        "I absolutely agree with that, and I think portrayal particularly of developing countries is a very important and I think in some ways an increasingly important issue.",
        "It's something we think very hard about within the BBC.",

        "Issues of portrayal like that, I think, as I say, are becoming increasingly important.",
        "But also, in terms of giving a rounded view of the world, I think people in the United States and in Europe need to understand how important the economies--and Asia's a good example, India's a good example--with the IT industry and the outsourcing and so on that's going on there, the economies of other parts of the world touch their lives very directly now, and people need to understand the rounded picture of what's happening in other parts of the world.",

        "I've noticed that when the AP runs a story, you see it hundreds and hundreds of times across the US, not only in newspapers but in TV stations, oftentimes watered down.",
        "And it shows you sometimes how much little reporting is going on, this being rehashed over and over.",
        "Now they do have things like Al-Jazeera and Xinhua from China, and, of course, they'll have their own opinion or editing of the news, but I just wanted to mention Google.",
        "Have there ever been allegations of a cover-up and efforts to keep this scandal out of the news media, although certainly it hasn't been kept out of the news media, what's the latest?",
        "...I mean, I think the interesting thing about Google News, of course, is that it's an algorithm.",
        "It's basically automated.",
        "And what Google are now trying to do is to build into that algorithm something about the reliability of the sources, so that it doesn't just throw up anything.",
