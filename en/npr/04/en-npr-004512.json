        "But related to the bigger issue, as well, for all of us in the news business, which is--if an automated system like that can provide something which, as your caller said, is of real value to him and he checks it every day, where is the value of the human judgment and mediation and intervention?",
        "And, you know, obviously, I would argue there is a judgment in having people make those decisions about what's newsworthy and how to present it and how to explain the context and so on.",

        "And if I think back across earlier attempts of this kind, I would say that those that are the more successful tend to be the ones where, even if there is a government connection, they manage to control that government connection somehow.",
        "So, for example, Agence France Presse is partly government financed, but these days, not too many people worry so much about that partly because I think they know that the structure of Agence France Presse incorporates the voices of news media as well as of journalists.",
        "Andres Iz--well, let me put that question--I'm going to stop you there and put the question to Andres Izarra, who is, after all, minister of information in Venezuela: How big a role is the Venezuelan government going to play in news production?",
        "Well, TeleSur is based in Caracas.",
        "The main facility will be based here.",

        "We're trying to expand our capital base so Brazil can have, also, a share, and so we can have a multinational company running the station.",
        "In that way, we are trying to have, as the professor was saying, the majority of voices that we can have, so editorially we can manage all the issues in a more different way or a more plural way."
