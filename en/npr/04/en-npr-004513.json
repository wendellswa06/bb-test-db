        "The Transportation Security Administration's entire budget is a little over $4 billion.",
        "Secondly, it would take a lot of time, because you're talking about--and that would potentially disrupt the flow of commerce.",
        "One thing to keep in mind with cargo is that a lot of it comes in huge packages, the size of a filing cabinet or even larger, and there isn't really a lot of technology that can screen that kind of stuff.",
        "You can't put it through the kind of luggage scanners you see in the airports 'cause it just won't fit.",
        "So you also don't have technology that's readily available to start screening this.",
        "And, you know, the way to screen a large package is to break it apart and put it through screening machines, but that takes an extraordinary amount of time.",
        "Gosh, I hate to say it, but can't they figure out some way to do it?",
        "Have the cargo have to be at the airport two days before--I mean, I'm just--it seems like such a glaring security problem when you have everybody--you know, all the passengers--going through--being put through security checks and having had to deal with this.",
