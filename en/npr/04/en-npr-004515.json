        "You just gave them the Hershey Kisses before this?",
        "That's right.",

        "Now, the relationship was the same.",

        "Well, just one last question before I let you go, which is, if indeed we are as irrational as you would have us, does behavioral economics pretty well make a mess of regular economics and say, that can't be describing human behavior since it's not the way we behave?",
        "That's right.",
        "So behavioral economics flies in the face of standard economics in two ways.",
