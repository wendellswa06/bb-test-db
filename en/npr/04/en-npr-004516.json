        "And I don't know the reason for not doing that.",
        "I don't know how reliable they are, but I guess if the TSA is using them for luggage, then they must consider them reliable.",

        "Well, I know when I was working our dog, we had a 100 percent find rate over the course of three years.",

        "So it just seems to me to make sense to utilize what we've already got and we know how to use.",
        "Well, one thing to keep in mind is that when you're talking about inspecting cargo going on an airplane, you're not talking about one airplane leaving a day.",
        "You're talking about, at a large airport, hundreds of airplanes leaving a day.",
        "And I don't know whether you could have a team of dogs working whatever--16 hours a day, non-stop.",
        "I think that there may be an issue...",
        "Well, no, it would have to rotate through multiple teams, of course, but...",
        "Right, and what I'm saying is...",
        "Meant to be a round-the-clock operation, you're saying, Tom.",
        "...is that--right.",
        "It's one thing to test things in a laboratory or use things every so often, but the airport environment is an incredibly difficult environment.",
        "So when you're talking about using some kind of technology, even if it's dogs, you have to make sure that dogs can actually operate in an airport and do, you know, hundreds, thousands of packages for hours and hours a day.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "The things that are looked at in terms of evaluating cargo is that the TSA likes to look at the chain, the supply chain--how something gets--where it went--you know, what path it traveled to get to the point where it's ready to be loaded in an airplane.",
        "And the TSA--one of the devices it has is something called the known shipper program.",
        "The idea is that if Wal-Mart is shipping something and you know Wal-Mart is safe and Wal-Mart can prove to the government that it has a very secure supply chain, then that can be considered safe cargo.",
        "So it's, I think, done largely by analyzing where has a certain item that's going to be shipped--where has it been?",

        "Hi, Tony.",

        "And we found out to our dismay at the last minute that they'd changed the rules.",
        "We've been doing it for years, but all of a sudden we weren't a known shipper.",
        "We had to fill out all kinds of paperwork and we couldn't get the stuff on the plane right then.",
        "So you couldn't just take a giant box up and say, `Send this to my Aunt Mary,' unless they already knew you.",
        "And our stuff was, you know, TV monitors, cameras, all kinds of electronic stuff that, if it were scanned, they wouldn't have no idea whether it was a bomb or not.",

        "Yes.",
        "Yes, because they recognize--they look at the history.",

        "The exact same products have been shipping back and forth between those two airports, and/or similar equipment, and they know who you are and they check into it.",
