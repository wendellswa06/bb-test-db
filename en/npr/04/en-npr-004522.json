        "What's interesting is what's not in Congressman Ryan's plan.",
        "There's no mention of the president's healthcare law.",
        "And remember, that was the original reason for the government shutdown, Republicans' desire to defund Obamacare.",
        "What Ryan suggests instead is some combination of changes to entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security to cut the deficit, and tax reform that he says would encourage economic growth.",
        "Now, this is not the sweeping change to Medicare, the voucherization of that program that Congressman Ryan's proposed in the past.",
        "Instead he's calling for more modest changes, some of which the president himself has put forward, although in Obama's blueprint, those changes are always accompanied by additional tax revenue.",
        "And that's something that's missing from Congressman Ryan's plan.",
        "Well, how is Congressman Ryan's article and his proposal being received?",
        "Well, some of the most conservative Republicans are not ready to give up their attack on Obamacare yet.",
        "They see that as an easier target than more established programs like Medicare or Social Security.",
        "Republican House Speaker John Boehner appeared to throw those conservatives a bone this afternoon.",
        "He went on the House floor and leveled a new attack on Obama's insurance exchanges, which went live just as the shutdown began and which continue to suffer from plenty of technical problems.",
        "How can we tax people for not buying a product from a website that doesn't work?",
        "How can you give big businesses a tax break and leave hardworking families out in the cold?",
        "This is why we need to sit down and have a conversation about the big challenges that face our country.",
        "What's interesting here is that Boehner starts out talking about Obamacare and within three sentences he shifts gears to talking about the big challenges that face our country, which might be the kinds of budget challenges that Ryan's talking about.",
        "Leaders in the GOP recognize they're not likely to move the president on his signature healthcare law, but having shut down the government and rattled financial markets with the debt ceiling, they feel like they have to get something other than what Boehner calls unconditional surrender.",
        "Well, Scott, looking ahead to that meeting tomorrow at the White House, the president and House Republicans, is that a suggestion that President Obama is abandoning or at least softening his no-negotiation stance?",
        "Not necessarily, although the president will be meeting with a smaller group of Republicans than he hoped to.",
        "He had wanted to invite all 232 House Republicans, which would've more like an audience than a negotiating session.",
        "Instead, Speaker Boehner plans to bring a smaller party, fewer than 20.",
        "He says a meeting like this is only worthwhile if it's focused on finding a solution.",
        "White House spokesman Jay Carney repeated the president's message that he's happy to talk, but only after a couple of conditions have been met.",
        "When it comes to our budget priorities, he has always been willing to negotiate, just not under the threat of shutdown or continued shutdown.",
        "If Congress opens the government, if Congress raises the debt ceiling, then of course he'd be willing to sit down and negotiate with lawmakers over our budget priorities."

        "These singers insist their mission is not a religious one.",
        "The group consists mostly of self-described atheists who nonetheless share a deep reverence for the hymns, psalms and motets of the 16th century, as NPR's Joel Rose reports.",
        "Every other weekend, the Renaissance Street Singers come together on city sidewalks and train stations and public parks - anywhere they can find an audience.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF GROUP SINGING IN LATIN)",
        "On this summer afternoon, 15 singers gather under a bridge in New York's Central Park.",
        "They launched into a free two-hour concert of music by Palestrina, des Prez and other composers who lived more than 500 years ago."

        "I talked to people in the diplomatic corps and the economic ministries, and they're the ones who are really pushing for a trade deal as soon as possible to relieve the economic pressures that I just talked about.",
        "But people in the defense ministries, in industrial policy, they say China should play hardball.",
        "They see the U.S.",

        "Talks are happening in September, but optimism for those talks is pretty low right now, simply because there are just so many issues on the table that have yet to be addressed - issues like tech transfers and Chinese government subsidies.",
        "But the stakes are pretty high because if there's no deal reached on September 1, President Trump has said there are going to be 10% tariffs on the remaining $300 billion of Chinese goods that have not yet been tariffed.",
