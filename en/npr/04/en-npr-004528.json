        "So, if a house gets foreclosed on in a decent neighborhood, investors snap it up very quickly.",
        "Also, a lot of people still owe more on their mortgages than their house is actually worth and so then they can't sell their house, and that keeps houses off the market.",

        "That earned them a bunch of enemies in Washington.",

        "But Fannie and Freddie are such big parts of making homeownership possible for Americans and if they're making so much money, why would the president say he wants to close them?",
        "Well, the question is what to do next going forward from here, and there's three schools of thought.",
        "So, the conservatives, some Republicans, they want to just get rid of Fannie and Freddie and blow them up and let the market sort it out.",
        "Then on the left, there are some Democratic lawmakers who want to keep Fannie and Freddie but turn them into fully public utilities.",
        "The compromise would be to get rid of Fannie and Freddie but still keep the government in housing to some degree to guarantee that people could get stable, affordable 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, all that good stuff, for the middle class.",
        "That's what he president's throwing his weight behind.",
        "But details are still being figured out.",
