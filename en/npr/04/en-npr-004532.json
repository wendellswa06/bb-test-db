        "Well, he issued a statement saying that all Mahdi Army operation should be frozen while the organization restructures and returns to what he says are his - its original principles.",
        "He included some other orders that you could see it as a way to test his immediate influence over his followers.",

        "So in - it provides law enforcement, it provides protection for people in Shiite enclaves such a Sadr city.",
