        "Yesterday, Williams suffered a crucial setback when the California Supreme Court refused to block his execution.",
        "Now his fate is in the hands of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
        "As NPR's Mandalit del Barco reports, Williams is reaching out to his supporters from death row.",
        "Stanley \"\"Tookie\"\" Williams was a legend on the streets of LA even before he became the most high-profile inmate on California's death row.",
        "Williams co-founded the notorious Crips street gang, then turned anti-gang crusader and was nominated for multiple Nobel Prizes.",
        "Now the call for clemency has attracted an eclectic group of ex-gangbangers, death penalty opponents, the NAACP and several Hollywood celebrities, namely rapper Snoop Dogg, once a Crip himself...",

        "And those plantings aren't simply decorative - more about that in a minute.",
        "First, Glomski gives me the back story about his career.",
        "He was a microbiologist studying the deadly anthrax bacteria.",
        "Really, it all started up pretty well.",
        "He got a PhD from Berkeley, then went to the Institut Pasteur in Paris for postdoctoral work.",
        "He landed a job at the University of Virginia and got grant funding to get his work started.",
        "My lab was well-funded until, basically, the moment I decided I was not going to work there anymore.",
        "And I probably could have scraped through the rest of my career as I had been doing.",
        "And I would've had regrets.",
        "Glomski came face to face with the reality that many scientists face right now - competition for research dollars is fierce.",
        "Grants take a long time to write, and only 1 in 8, on average, gets funded.",
        "The secret to success is play it safe - very safe.",
        "You're focusing on basically one idea that you already have and making it as presentable as possible.",
        "You're not spending time making new ideas.",
        "And it's - the making new ideas, for me, personally - that, I found rewarding.",
        "That was what my passion was about.",
        "It wasn't about how to make this idea most presentable so that we can get it funded.",
        "I recognize that's the reality, but that ultimately squashed my passion for what I was doing.",
        "Historically, the big payoffs in science come from out of the blue - oddball ideas - unexpected byways.",
        "That's what research was like for his old mentor in Berkeley.",
        "But Glomski sees that disappearing today.",
        "He had an idea to track anthrax inside an animal using a scan rather than a scalpel."

        "He wrote three proposals to fund this idea - all of them got rejected.",
        "You have to actually be much more conservative these days than you used to.",
        "And being that conservative, I think, ultimately hurts the scientific enterprise because everybody's basically trying to be so conservative - to do things that ought to work or things that are expected to work, that you're losing out on the cutting-edge research that really is what pushes science forward.",
        "Glomski saw a dreary career ahead of him.",
        "So at the age of 41, he quit.",
        "So now instead of helping to reduce the risk of deadly anthrax, he's applying his imagination and creativity towards something that's much more personally satisfying.",
        "Think back to his garden of hops and grapes and absinthe.",
        "He's starting his own distillery, Vitae Spirits.",
        "I look forward to the day when I sit on my front porch with a friend or a new person I met.",

        "They're enjoying it.",
        "Glomski knows other young scientists who have hung up careers in science because the horizon seems so much narrower these days.",
        "And that concerns him.",
        "I think many of the people who are leaving are the ones that have good options elsewhere.",

        "Really big-picture stuff.",
        "When I was a very young scientist I told myself I would only work on the hardest questions because those were the ones that were worth working on.",
        "And it has been to my advantage and my detriment.",
        "Advantage because his big ideas have garnered real respect in his field, but detriment because despite writing a blizzard of ambitious grant proposals, he can't get his ideas funded.",

        "The country has invested into me alone, 5 - $6 million, easily.",
        "Add that up across all of the people that that happened for - we're taking all of this money as a country - we've invested it, and we're saying we don't care about it.",
        "These days, science for him is an after-hours avocation.",
        "I bought my self a $10,000 computer a couple of years ago that I can run pretty much any simulation I want.",
        "And Patterson has watched with some trepidation as his daughter, a fresh college graduate, is hoping, herself, to launch a career in science.",

        "So the methods, how exactly they passed the virus from ferret to ferret, what types of ferret, how many ferrets, how much virus they put in and most importantly the genetic changes that occurred when the virus was able to pass from one ferret to the other.",
        "And why would you need to know those things?",
        "So we don't understand why the H5N1 viruses do not transmit among people, and this kind of experiment gets at that, why the virus is not able to be transmitted.",
        "We can't do that experiment in people, obviously, so we use an animal model, which is the ferret.",
        "Dr.",
        "Henderson, you believe it was the correct call to hold back that data.",
        "I do believe it was, no question about it.",
        "Tell us why.",
        "I think we're dealing here with a very serious organism, which if indeed it did spread well among people and killed as many people as it has to date, occurring as individual cases or small groups of cases, and that is a death rate of more than 50 percent, we would have a real disaster on our hands.",
        "So how this organism spreads is important, but once it is - the information is made widely available, I think the fear is that this will be a point of experiment for a number of people, and we have to worry about an accident in a laboratory, release, escape by some means.",
        "Dr. Racaniello?",
        "So this is a common misconception about H5N1 avian influenza, that it's highly lethal.",
        "The number of 50 percent lethality is quoted widely.",
        "What that means is half of the 600 people who have been admitted to hospitals die.",
        "But we don't know how many people have been infected, and there is some good evidence that many more people have been infected without being sick."
