        "However, since back in 2003, there have been many studies done of patients and the individuals in their family, in their village, contacts in hospitals and so forth.",
        "The transmission rate is extremely low.",
        "We're looking at one or two cases, and thus we're seeing - counting the cases that way, and these are more than 20 studies.",
        "You would see that the death rate was right around 50 percent, and that seems to hold up from the small outbreak to small outbreak.",
        "The study in Thailand is a distinct exception to anything that's been seen.",
        "There have been about 17 or 18 such studies done, starting in the late 1990s, when these viruses first infected people up to the present, and there are a handful that show seropositivity in certain populations.",
        "I think we need to go into rural Asian populations that have contact with poultry and really get at this.",
        "Before we do that, we can't say that this virus is 50 percent lethal.",
        "Dr.",
        "Henderson, if there is so much concern on your part and the part of others about the outcome of this research, why was this study given the go-ahead to begin with if it might have turned out this way?",
        "Well, I think decisions with regard to research are usually in the hands of investigators and their institutions.",

        "However, I think it's important to point out that there is precedent for a group of scientists to get together and, working with government, impose restrictions on the use of a virus, which was highly lethal and would have an enormous effect if it was - got into the population.",
        "And that pertains to smallpox virus, which carries a case fatality rate, death rate of about 30 percent.",
        "Most of the population of the world now, roughly 75 percent, are fully susceptible to it.",
        "We don't really have enough vaccine to control it, and the concern was that if it got out, began to spread, we'd have a hard job controlling it.",
        "It was felt to be serious enough that it was decided that only two laboratories would be allowed to work with the virus.",
        "And those two laboratories, one in Moscow, one in Atlanta, two laboratories with a history of working with it, and secondly that any protocols that they wished to implement, studies, would have to pass muster with an international group of scientists in regard to the need for doing it and risk and so forth.",
        "Both are working in high-security laboratories.",
        "Now, that provision has been in place more - really more than 10 years, and it is still being adhered to today.",
        "Now this is not to suggest that H5N1 would be handled in the same way, there are different conditions here, but what has been established is a precedent where there are a group of scientists and governments who decide that this is too serious a virus or organism to be circulating, and we should keep this under the closest of supervision.",

        "We could control it.",
        "So it poses less of a threat in terms of transmission and less of a case fatality rate than does H5N1.",
        "But H5N1 is in the outer limits of the spectrum, and the question is: Are we willing to go through experiments to make the virus, a mutant virus available to a number of different laboratories, to risk the possible escape from the laboratory of that virus, or are we going to control it much more severely and hold the data and maybe have the discussion?",
        "But keep the discussion focused on an agent which potentially is now, I think, many agree, potentially a catastrophic virus.",
        "I think there is no reason to assume that this virus will transmit among humans based on the ferret experiments.",
        "Ferrets have been shown to be wrong over and over.",
