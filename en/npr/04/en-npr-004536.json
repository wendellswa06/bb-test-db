        "I'm Ira Flatow.",
        "We're talking this hour about two bird flu studies that may not be published in the fall due to security concerns.",
        "Talking with Dr. Vincent Racaniello, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, and Dr. D.A.",
        "Henderson, professor of public health and medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.",
        "Our number is 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Lots of - what was the - let me just get - bring us up to date.",
        "What is the status of those studies?",
        "Are they being just held up, the details?",
        "Well, my understanding is that journals are negotiating with the NSABB to determine exactly how the papers will be phrased.",
        "Let's go to Raul(ph) in Columbia, South Carolina.",
        "Hi, Raul.",
        "Hi.",
        "I had a question regarding the leaking the details of the study.",
        "So science says that it wants this information to be open and that perhaps specific details of the study should be distributed within a particular group of approved scientists.",
        "But how exactly do you create those (technical difficulty) for – who is an approved scientist?",
        "How do you evaluate who's trustworthy?",
        "Does someone coming from an academic institution, such as Duke or Harvard, does that just immediately make them eligible to receive information?",
        "Is there some sort of test that we have to give to ensure that the people who receive this information are trustworthy?",
        "How do you create those guidelines and evaluate who can receive this information?",
        "Dr.",
        "Henderson, you want to tackle that?",
        "Sorry, what?",
        "Well, I think that is a real problem, and I think the more that this information is disseminated even to - even a small whatever arbitrarily limited group is there, there's going to be - it's a challenge, and more people are going to be involved in experimenting.",
        "And I think there's no question about it.",
        "Scientists are curious people, and this is set out as a real challenge.",
        "I think what is needed is for the science community to be fully educated as to what the real risk is here.",
        "If the real risk is, as I perceived it and I know a number of my colleagues do, this is a virus that we shouldn't really be experimenting with, even - except under the most rigid circumstances of safety.",
        "So one mistake in one laboratory and one escape with the pace that influenza normally spreads, you don't have a chance of stopping it.",
        "And we've looked at this again and again.",
        "I've been involved with the most recent epidemic, 207 – 2007 back in 1957, we tried to stop or contain outbreaks of influenza, and it was just impossible.",
        "It was beyond you before you could really do anything about it.",

        "I fully appreciate the need for virologists to be educated about biosecurity, and I also would like the biosecurity specialists to be educated about the science underpinning our views on this.",
        "And again, the science says that this is not a large threat, the use of ferrets, the natural course of the disease, not being transmissible, the wrong case fatality ratio, all of this is something you need to consider beyond just worrying about someone nefarious getting hold of this information.",
        "So here, you're saying there's a dispute between microbiologists who actually work with the viruses and epidemiologists who study the spreads of diseases.",
        "Is there a disconnect you're saying?",
        "So I have talked with many influenza virologists about it, and they are, to the number, all in favor of releasing this information.",
        "The caution is being raised by epidemiologists and biosecurity experts, which is, of course, their job to do so.",
        "So there - yes, there is some kind of disconnect, and they have to get together and talk about this.",
        "Dr.",
        "Henderson, do you think you could modify your views a bit if you spoke more with them or are you pretty set in the way you believe?",
        "Well, I - it sounds to me like maybe Dr. Racaniello is pretty set on the way things he believes in this case.",
        "And I think we're looking at it, yes, in different ways, but I think there are a number of virologists who are fully in accord with what I've been talking about.",
        "And there a number of virologists who have been very supportive of the restrictions that have been imposed on smallpox.",
        "At the same time, I think there is a concern here and the public health concern ultimately, that is our concern, the health of the public.",
        "And what is worrisome is not necessarily that you have somebody with malicious intent, but that you have an experiment done and in which in all good faith proper measures are taken and an escape occurs.",
        "This has happened before.",
        "It will happen again.",
        "And so that at this point in time, I think Doctor Racaniello was right.",
        "I think what we do is stop where we are, right now.",
        "And we had that dialogue, or we had that discussion about the - among the people concerned as to where we go from here.",
        "But meanwhile, I would say, I don't think it would be wise to publish it.",
        "And I would say, let's have the discussion as he suggests.",
        "How quickly could - if you've now just decoded the virus, how quickly can you make a vaccine for it in advance of any other research that you might?",
        "Well, if you make an egg-based vaccine, it takes you six months minimum to that.",
        "If we make a - but the other vaccines which would be quicker to plant, based ones, as I mentioned, they're faster, but they're still experimental.",
        "So it's still a long time, and we're always behind the curve when a pandemic emerges.",
        "We're always very late in hitting that first outbreak with vaccine.",
        "How long did it take for this vaccine to mutate itself - the virus to mutate between the ferrets, going back and forth?",
        "Yes.",
        "For influenza, they are very good models because they do a lot of the things that we do when we get flu.",
        "They sneeze and cough and get a fever and so forth."

        "So then, what is wrong with Doctor Henderson's reading here?",
        "If they can - if ferrets can pass it easily between them - the two of them, and they're good models for humans, why are they not good models for human-to-human transmission?",
        "Well, the key there is the word model.",
        "It doesn't tell you everything that you want to know about human infection.",
        "As I referred to earlier, there are many occasions where a virus that does X in people, doesn't do the same thing in ferrets.",
        "Plus, we have this long experience with human infection with H5N1, and it simply has not transmitted, except it infects people that have contact with sick birds, for example.",
        "So I think all of that information argues against that virus being able to transmit in people.",
        "On the other hand, do you think you microbiologists might stop, as Doctor Henderson says he might think about, and have a conversation first about...",
        "He - this is a good idea.",
        "I think, instead of publishing a watered down version of this paper, just stop.",
        "Don't publish anything and have this discussion.",
        "That would be fine.",
        "I think it's a travesty to publish a paper which doesn't allow anyone else to reproduce the results.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And you'd go for that, too, Dr. Henderson?",
        "Well, I think, yes.",
        "I think this makes sense.",
        "But I think it's a little more than passage from ferret to ferret.",
        "If I understand the studies that were done, there was one set of passages which had became more transmissible.",
        "There was another passage which was not successful.",
        "One would - might assume that there are differences between the two viruses that emerged.",
        "And the differences between the virus that we're looking at with regard to the virus that caused the transmission and the - its beginning parent, these are studies that - and information's needed.",
        "I think it's not quite so simple as just passing it from ferret to ferret.",
        "And anybody is likely to do it.",
        "I think that there are some other problems here.",
        "And I think we need to have a hard look.",
        "And I think a varied - you got to have some sort of group has to look at it.",
        "If you can't make a huge group looking at it and handling it, what you're looking at is a small group making some decisions.",
        "But I think the penalty we pay if we make a mistake could be very high, indeed.",
        "And maybe we're...",
        "But you - but then, again, you have no concrete suggestion of how to choose that group of people.",
        "It's going to have to be arbitrarily selected.",
