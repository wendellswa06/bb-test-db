        "I mean, folks want to know, but the message is really why did the regime handle it in such a sloppy manner.",
        "And what we see time and again and what they don't seem to understand about the modern media context and the power of social media, the growing power of social media in China, is that they can no longer go back to their traditional Communist Party playbook and suppress all information, because if they don't come out with some sort of an explanation, then the rumor mill and the social media blog space and so on goes crazy.",

        "If you were building a classic ukulele from the acacia tree on Hawaii, you'd use something called koa.",
        "But a guy named Joe Lutwack in San Francisco - who is very environmentally focused - said, is there a way that we could build a premium instrument but do it in a way that was eco friendly, and consequently helped create a number of interesting materials, including one that he calls e-Koa.",
        "And so he won't give us too much on what goes into those ingredients, but what we know is that these beautiful instruments aren't just used by everyday people, but the guy who's known as the Jimi Hendrix of the ukulele space - a guy named Jake Shimabukuro - even uses them himself.",
