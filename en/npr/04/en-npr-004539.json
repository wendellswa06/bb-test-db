        "And to it's to a fine art now, really, where they spend five years effectively coronating the new person.",
        "Xi Jinping was highlighted as the next leader going back to the last party congress in 2007.",
        "So barring some serious divisions within the Politburo, and if that's the case we're all in big trouble, you know, Xi Jinping will emerge as the top leader.",
        "In the future, will anyone talk about anything but the terrible repression during this period in China's history, particularly the repression of Tibetans and other minorities?",
        "Human rights have not been - come up, Chris Johnson?",
        "So I don't think whatever was going on with him was political.",
        "That said, I agree absolutely with Robert that there is something going on within the Politburo.",
        "I personally think Bo Xilai's case is a major driver.",
        "My own sense is that they are a little more divided, frankly, over whether to pursue a public trial or whether it's too sensitive, and they need to handle in the sort of party's internal discipline system.",
        "Star chamber, yeah.",
        "That's right, and that's one possible reason.",
        "I think the other, though, is, you know, what's interesting about this transition is it's a bit trite to say, but I think we're starting to see some real manifestations of it, this is the first time in their history that they are pursuing a leadership succession without the careful hands of revolutionary credentialed elders like Mao Zedong, like Deng Xiaoping.",
        "And so what you have is a bunch of rival interest groups, none of whom have clear paramountsy(ph) over the other ones and all of whom want a slice of the pie.",
        "And, you know, the other factor of course here is that there are rumors that they are going to downsize of the size of the Politburo standing committee, China's top decision-making body, from its current nine-member structure to seven.",
        "And just like here in Washington, when you try to reduce the size of a bureaucracy, there's always going to be infighting.",
        "There's going to be vested interests who are going to lose out.",
        "And my own sense is that's making the competition all the more intense.",
        "And speaking of rumors, of course the trial for murder of Bo Xilai's wife, who was convicted, of course, they're always convicted in China, and rumors that, well, she didn't speak on her own defense.",
        "Was that her?",
        "Was that a double that they had sitting in for her?",
        "Mystery and opacity in China as we try to reconcile the differences and the disconnect between an opaque political structure and an emerging superpower.",

        "Beijing, remember, continues its diplomatic standoff with neighboring countries over ownership of several disputed island groups in the South and East China Seas.",
        "In the ceremony to launch the new carrier, the defense ministry said the new ship would help protect national sovereignty, security and development interests.",
        "Outside analysts, though, are less sure.",
        "The carrier is a refurbished Soviet ship that China bought from Ukraine.",
        "For the next few years, at least, it'll be used only as a training vessel.",
        "China has no planes that can land on the carrier as yet.",
        "Still, the government clearly hopes that the country's first aircraft carrier will boost national pride and patriotism at a key moment for the Communist Party.",

        "Hi, Neal, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, I want to start off with saying that I have kind of a skewed perception of China.",
        "I'm ethnically Vietnamese, and you know, traditionally the antagonism between the two countries has been great.",
        "So I will say that I am a little bit biased.",
        "But my question is, you know, the perception of China is that there's corruption everywhere, particularly in the courts, with Bo Xilai's wife, you know, suspected of having a body double attend court.",
        "What kind of reformation will the new incoming leadership do to reform the court system?",
        "Chris Johnson, any ideas?",
        "Yeah, I think that's a great question.",
        "It's a fundamental point, and I think it lashes up very nicely with what Rob was saying a few moments ago, and that is that for these kind of reforms to go forward, going forward, it's going to be a situation where the party is going to have to retreat a little bit, whether it's from the economy, from the judicial sector, from, you know, a number of these key areas."

        "And those are the hardest things for them to do.",
        "The reality of the situation is they started taking some steps in this direction in the 1980s, when Deng Xiaoping was really riding high in the reform process, and they had a process called political structural reform.",
        "There was an effort to separate party and government functions, basically, and during that time we did see the courts develop a little bit of independence.",
        "That has all eroded tremendously in the last few years, to the point where the party basically is more involved in the court system than it ever has been.",
        "And with that being the case, you're going to always have that political flavor to all of these decisions that are being made.",
        "The leadership definitely recognizes this as a problem.",
        "There is a lot of talk out there that the new leadership has a sort of reformist leaning.",
        "Xi Jinping has supposedly been having salon-style meetings with some of the key reformist thinkers within the party.",
        "But we'll have to see how much of that's going to be real, and even if he has that intent, will his colleagues on the emerging Politburo standing committee allow him to move in that direction?",
        "You just came back from China.",
        "That's right.",
        "Who do you talk to when you're there?",

        "It's supposed to be a plug-in car that's called the Electric Very Light Car, and, you know, we're building the all-electric model for them, you know, so that they can market that one out there to other - even with their gas car.",

        "But to be entirely frank, one of the chief things that I always find in going there, the best thing you can do is just get out, walk the streets and talk to the people and hear what they're thinking and seeing.",
        "It really does give you a good flavor for the ground, and it plays exactly to what Rob was discussing earlier about the huge disconnect between all the interests in the West and in other capitals about what's going on in the leadership and how little the people actually care.",
        "Rob, does that sound like the same kind of people you talk to?",
        "Yeah, absolutely, and I think that, you know, it is slightly sort of disconnected.",
        "You talk to some of the policy people, but then you talk to the people, and sometimes they're living in two different worlds.",
        "I mean, just to talk specifically about that legal - the question of legal reform, I think this very neatly encapsulates many of the things we've been talking about.",
        "They desperately need to reform the legal system, but they can't because if they start to give any independence of any sort to the judiciary, then they won't be in control of it, and the whole essence of the system is that the party has to control everything.",
        "And I think we should say frankly that there are many people, and I'm sure Chris speaks to them as well, they're not necessarily at the very top, but there are people within the Chinese government who have quite, you know, liberal thinking about things and will admit freely that China needs to reform.",
        "The question is, who's going to be brave enough to take that first step when legal reform, even basic political reform, could lead to the whole thing unraveling.",
        "So they are just - as I said, they are a bit stuck on this.",
        "Meanwhile, the economy is slowing, they're relying on the - economic growth has always been their source of legitimacy.",
        "They no longer have ideological legitimacy.",
        "Of course they don't have popular legitimacy.",
        "And that, of course, brings us to what you were talking about in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, looking for another kind of legitimacy, and that is in nationalism and nationalistic legitimacy as the champion of the rising China, which is the historical China, which is the great China.",
        "And this is very worrying internationally, diplomatically, within East Asia.",
        "Our caller mentioned she was ethnically Vietnamese.",
        "You might see it as an irony that one of China's great rivals at the moment in one of those disputes in the South China Sea is communist Vietnam.",
        "Of course rivalries between Vietnam and China have long surpassed any Leninist solidarity they may have felt for one another.",
        "But at the same time, Chris Johnson, we had the spectacle this week of the Chinese media, the mainland Chinese media cheering on Taiwanese fisherman in the East China Sea as they sailed to protest against Japan."

        "Yeah, strange bedfellows, but it's one of these situations, and what's interesting about that is that, you know, the Chinese Communist Party, this is one of the many ways in which it can be so pragmatic and so flexible in that it is willing to often adopt, you know, the so-called nine-dash line, this sort of, you know, claim that they have in the South China Sea.",
        "That goes back to the Chiang Kai-shek regime, you know, and so when it suits their interests, they are more than willing to work with their compatriots in Taiwan.",
        "But you know, more fundamentally I think the issue is - what's striking about this is for the last 20 years, you know, all parties seemed to find a way to be able to put this largely aside and to focus on - they have been very unsuccessful with joint development but to just kind of focus on economic building and so on.",
        "It's only really within the last couple years that this has really flared up.",
        "I think it's also very important to underscore, of course, that the nationalism issue is not just a problem in China, it's a problem in these other nations as well: Vietnam, the Philippines.",
        "And then you have a broader problem, frankly, of weak leaderships in a lot of these places.",
        "Japan, you know, constantly changing prime ministers, you know, this sort of issue.",

        "I mean, does the relationship between Taiwan and the United States change because of all this, or you know, what's the story with Taiwan?",
        "Rob, we saw Japanese and Taiwanese craft exchanging water cannon fire, but apparently just a sort of symbolic shot across the bow.",
        "And then everybody retreated, and everybody thinks it's going to be contained.",
        "Taiwan is, Chris Johnson was mentioning, was trying to enforce its claim to these Senkaku Islands, as the Japanese call them.",
        "That's right, and I think the American role is very important.",
        "And I mean what you just described in East Asia is rather scary, isn't it?",
        "It sounds a bit like late 19th-century Europe.",
        "And so - and it is, in many ways: the emergent nationalism, the industrialization, the emergence of new nationalisms."
