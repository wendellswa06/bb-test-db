        "You know, America's relationship with Taiwan is changing as China becomes more important.",
        "Of course as you said, this new leader of the LDP in Japan who might be the new prime minister is a real hawkish former prime minister, Shinzo Abe.",
        "So things are changing, and America is going to need a very flexible but very robust and very engaged policy in Northeast Asia over the coming years.",
        "Email from Gareth in Walnut Creek, California: Is there any justification in comparing the reporting on China today with the reporting on Germany in the 1930s?",
        "Germany was an economic powerhouse then, as China is today, but now nobody talks about the economic power of Germany during those terrible years.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, first, let me address the first point which I think is that there are parallels, and this is, you know, Secretary Clinton herself mentioned this issue when she was visiting Beijing earlier this month, where she underscored the idea that what we are looking for is an answer to the age-old question of how a status quo or enduring power manages the rise of a new entrant to the game, and can that happen in the absence of conflict.",
        "And the historical record is pretty poor there.",
        "Not good, no.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "That's right.",
        "And so this is really the fundamental issue.",
        "On the human rights issue, obviously, yeah, continuing to be a major problem in China.",
        "We see, I think, particularly now that the economy is struggling, the leadership becoming very concerned about social stability.",
        "They were rattled pretty badly by the Arab Spring where frankly they way overreacted in my personal opinion and showed some fragility, really, by doing so.",
        "But in this case now, I think we're seeing them really get concerned about some of these demonstrations.",
        "Their approach, for example, to these anti-Japanese demonstrations, which were occurring right outside my hotel window when I was in Beijing, was very instructive in that regard, and that, you know, they know how easily that anti-Japanese sentiment can tip into anti-government sentiment.",
        "They happened to come on the anniversary of the Japanese invasion of China during the Second World War."

        "Well, traditionally, they, Chris Johnson, see any information about the upper leadership as espionage.",

        "Last week - I guess, a couple of weeks ago, we had the chance to talk are Robert Kaplan, whose new book is out called \"\"The Revenge of Geography,\"\" and he pointed out that if you look at the East Asia from a - the view point of a Chinese admiral, he sees a whole bastion of American allies that boxed China in from Korea to the north, to Australia to the south, Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines.",
        "He sees China - we - the United States keeps saying we don't want to contain China.",
        "He sees - he looks at that and says I am contained.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's absolutely right, and I think while it's extremely important, as I think we've both been saying, to have robust policies towards China and to be aware of the dangers of a growing China.",
        "I think it's also very important to try to see things through China's eyes as well, just so that we can better understand why they behave the way they do.",
        "I mean, don't - never mind Australia, Japan, South Korea.",
        "How about Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, all around their northwest side?",
        "A growing relationship with India and now Myanmar.",
        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "Burma, old Burma has completely turned and its - and Thein Sein, the president, is smooching with Hillary Clinton in New York.",
        "So there's concerns within China, and this is laid on top of 150, 180 years of paranoia.",
        "And, you know, many of the historians listening will know about the century of humiliation, the arrival of the British gunships in the 1830s.",
        "And it's so deep.",
        "It's in Chinese's DNA.",
        "It's in their - always in their psyche to be paranoid about Western intentions.",
        "And so I think it is important that we understand that, so that in the West, we don't get, you know, ahead of ourselves in our policies.",
        "And again, we come back to the early part of the 20th century.",
        "I mean, the - no one wanted a war, right?",
        "But somehow, it happened.",
        "So it's a matter of engaging very cleverly and robustly, but not stupidly, in terms of pressing Chinese buttons that's going to make them react more."

        "And this is, I think, also the fundamental dilemma that the U.S.",
        "faces right now, is how do we allow for and how do we accommodate China's desire for some strategic depth along its periphery when the space within which it would want to have that strategic depth is loaded by our allies and where our allies wish to be and partners and friends in the regoin wish to be operating.",
