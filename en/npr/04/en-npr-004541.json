        "No, (unintelligible), no.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Bonnie, what got you interested in your career, and what's driving you now to work with these kids?",
        "Well, that's a good question.",
        "In fact, that's being asked of all of the mentors here, and they were even forcing us to show pictures from high school.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Oh, I hate it when that happens, right?",
        "Yeah, so the students would realize that we were once young.",
        "And I think what they're learning is that some of us - and Jack and I are sort of alike in this way - knew what we wanted to do when we were very young, but many people decide later on.",
        "And so you end up - we're providing sort of a large array of options.",
        "But I was one of those young children that was fascinated with space.",
        "I grew up on a cattle ranch in eastern Washington state.",
        "So I had big skies out there, as well, not just Montana.",
        "And we went out and looked for Sputnik.",
        "And I looked for shooting stars, and I could see the Milky Way, and I just knew that was something that I had to be involved with, and that's how I became an engineer was so I could be involved in it.",
        "And Jack, is it possible, and in what ways do you mentor these kids?",
        "What does it mean to be a mentor for these kids here?"

        "Well, that's a very good question.",

        "We just hope it's sort of...",
        "Do you show them your fossils...?",
        "Well, I didn't bring any fossils, no. No, I think, you know, it's just sort of tell them about what we do and how exciting it is and just see, you know, which ones are interested.",
        "I think it gives them an opportunity to ask the questions they wouldn't normally be able to ask and to also realize that people that they see in these other careers are real people - I hope Brandon feels that way - and that that's something they can become, it's not out of reach.",
        "And what is the pathway to getting there?",
        "And Brandon didn't tell you that he's working on an electric car.",
        "Well, you know, Brandon, we last - as they say on TV, the last time we checked in with West Philadelphia High School, you guys were working on, I think it was a 60-mile-per-gallon and maybe even, you know, 100-mile-per-gallon car.",
        "Where do you - what are you guys up to with that project?",
        "Well, the Automotive Express was a competition that we worked on.",
        "We were semi-finalists in the competition.",
        "We didn't win the competition, but we were the only high school that made it to the semi-final round.",
        "And the winner of that prize, we partnered with them, and now what we're working on at our school is a car that gets 240 miles per gallon equivalency.",
        "When they had it in the X Prize, it was a gas car, and it only got about 110 miles per gallon equivalency.",
        "So that's our new project that we're working on at our school.",
        "And we just came from a conference in California to present our business plan to judges from all different parts of the country to see if our plan was foolproof, and we were winners in that competition, too.",
        "We were in the eco-friendly part of the competition out in California - San Jose, California.",
        "Is this a total electric car you're talking about?"

        "Thank you.",
        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "Yeah, well, the reason they gave it to us is because when they made it in the X Prize, they spent a lot of money.",
        "So they really liked us, and so they gave us their chassis, and they left it up to us so that we can make the car with, you know, easier parts, you know, less affordable parts.",
        "So that's what we're helping them to do.",
        "We're finding less - more affordable parts to build the car with, and, you know, that's what we're doing at our shop now.",
        "Because I remember before, you were using a Ford Focus body, if I remember correctly.",
        "And now, so you're using their body and your ideas on how to make it go farther on less power?",
        "Oh, we still have those two cars.",
        "You're talking about the Ford Focus.",
        "We took the Ford Focus and, you know, we turned it into a hybrid vehicle, and then we have the Factory Five(ph) car that we've been working on, which was a kit car that you build from their parts, and then we changed that into a hybrid car when it's supposed to be an all-gas car.",
        "So when do you think you're going to get this new car working?",
        "When can - when is it...?",
        "We're thinking by the end of the school year.",
        "It might be somewhere in the summer that we'll have our first prototype built.",
        "And, you know, after that, it'll be easier for us to build, and, you know, to build upon, so that, you know, we can start marketing it out there."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "Yeah, they've got some good ideas, you know.",
        "Yes, they do.",

        "I was going to say we've also been hearing from entrepreneurs, and it's been fascinating for I think both the students, as well as the rest of the mentors, because they're teaching them the business side and the innovation side and taking ideas and what it takes to become an entrepreneur.",

        "I don't know if you've heard of this.",
        "Yes.",
        "I am telling you, the excitement of seeing 200 kids from around the United States, there were two teams from China, with their inventions and to have the mentors there with them, it was so incredibly exciting.",
        "And for the young people, they just came out of there on fire, ready to set the world on fire.",
        "So I think this is great.",
        "It is good, and we're going to talk more about that a little bit later.",
        "We have some more students coming in who are inventors.",
        "But it's great to see kids doing that kind of stuff and not just, you know, hanging out on the couch.",
        "It sure is, and if I can put a plug in for Smithtown High School West, their InvenTeam actually came up with a portable solar tracker."
