        "Did we learn anything interesting about FBI tactics from this episode?",
        "Well, I think what we've learned is that the FBI, like other security services, bides its time.",
        "I should think the FBI has probably learned more about current Russian intelligence techniques than the Russians have learned about American secrets because they've been watching and listening and observing for a good long time - 10 years, I think.",
        "So I would thing that they feel pretty well placed to know how the Russians are currently conducting their operations.",

        "Now, the head of the Pan-African parliament charged today that they found fraudulent voter lists among other irregularities.",
        "You're going to hear more about this election as the results come in, and here's why: when Zimbabwe won its independence from Great Britain in 1980 and Mugabe first came to power, there was great hope for the country.",
        "But Mugabe, under the banner of populism and black sovereignty, ran the country's economy into the ground.",
        "Inflation's at a unimaginable rate of 100,000 percent.",

        "It's a pleasure to be with you, Andrea.",
        "So, how did Robert Mugabe change and why?",
        "Well, to some extent he hasn't change.",
        "He has been a populist, he has run and ruled on a rhetoric of black liberation, and that has, you know, continued up through the day before the election.",
        "His last rally was very much rallying against the West, which he blames for a lot of the internal problems in Zimbabwe.",
        "But you would say, you know, beyond that what has changed over these years is that the liberation leader that many respected and applauded really became very much over the 28-year period a dictator that closed off the political space that did not allow newspapers to operate freely, clamp down on journalists of all kinds and had brutal crackdowns on oppositions, most notably over the last year and a half preceding the election.",
        "And what were the decisions he made about the economy that have so devastated the country?",
        "Well, the economy, I think, you have to look to two causes - one internal and one external.",
        "Internally there was this push to push forward land reform and changes in land ownership.",
        "Now, remember, Rhodesia, which was the name of the country before it became Zimbabwe, before independence, was white ruled.",
        "So a key part of Mugabe's rule was to equalize, to get rid of the white rule essentially.",
        "And there was a real dominance of whites in land ownership, especially in the farming, the core agricultural sector of the Zimbabwean economy.",
        "Now, the problem is that much of the redistribution went to Mugabe cronies and did not really push forward a way to manage the agricultural sector in ways that were sustainable.",
        "Now, the external piece of that is also important.",
        "The sanctions in place now for almost 10 years on Zimbabwe have also had an impact on the economy.",
        "So, whether it's the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund or bilateral donors - the U.S.",
        "and U.K.",
        "in particular - there have been sanctions that have had economic implications there on Zimbabwe.",

        "Tell me about them.",
        "Clearly.",
        "I mean, so, the most enlightened and the most upheld is South Africa, which ended the racist white rule of the apartheid regime back in 1994.",
