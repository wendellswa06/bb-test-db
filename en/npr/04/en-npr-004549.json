        "Then, the grand jury stumbled on a bombshell.",
        "District Attorney Seth Williams says a church employee testified that there were many other people the panel should know about.",
        "The grand jury found that a policy of zero tolerance was not actually in effect.",

        "Thirty-seven priests, according to the grand jury's report released last month.",
        "After that, the archdiocese hired Gina Maisto Smith, a former prosecutor, to look closely at those priests.",
        "The church put 21 of them on administrative leave while Smith investigates further.",
        "Smith says she's seen no evidence that church officials intentionally protected sexual predators.",
        "I can say with clarity that I saw the archdiocese doing what it could do within the systems that it had and making the best decisions they could under the circumstances."

        "So, if the archdiocese was following all the right procedures, how did these priests fall through the cracks?",

        "Even critics say that most dioceses are trying to do their best at protecting victims and still giving due process to priests who may have been wrongly accused.",

        "The slums haven't had that attention.",
        "So sanitation is bad for a lot of the city, even beyond where the tent camps are.",
        "And so there's a huge education campaign going on to prevent people from - at least to prepare people and hopefully, so that it won't come here - or if it does, it won't spread.",

        "They were building a cholera clinic up there out of tents.",
        "And they said, no, we don't want it - because it's likely to bring cholera here, which is - well, not exactly medically correct."
