        "Northern Iowa, like a lot of schools that don't play alleged big-time college football, we receive about $5.3 million in funding to supplement our athletics budget from the university.",
        "And so, when state funds are cut to the institution, those cuts are going to trickle into the athletic program.",
        "And given the fact that athletics is further from the core mission of the institution, of course, than the academic programs, those cuts are going to hit us even harder than they would the academic programs.",
        "Rather than cut team budgets across the board, Dannen decided to eliminate a single sport, and he says he cut a men's team because of Title IX.",
        "That's the federal requirement that schools equalize opportunities for male and female athletes.",
        "If we have 57 percent of a female student body, we need to have at least 52 percent of opportunities for female students in the department.",
        "And given the fact that we're not at 52 percent, we're actually at 39 percent right now, it eliminated female sports from the consideration of would they be dropped.",
        "Dannen says he chose baseball because the travel is so expensive.",
        "Northern Iowa's first 21 games this season are on the road.",
        "And when he told the players about his decision?",
        "They reacted with disappointment.",
        "They were angry.",
        "They were bitter.",
        "I think every emotion they should have had because something that was completely outside their control was taken away from them, and as I told them, the very basic tenant of education is to create opportunity, and I'm making a decision that goes against that tenant.",
        "It's eliminating opportunity.",
        "This had to take a toll on you personally, making this sort of decision.",
        "I mean, what's it been like for you?",
        "You know, I talked to a lot of my peers who have had to drop sports, and they said, you know, it's the worst thing that you will ever do professionally, and it will linger with you for the rest of your life.",
        "And so far, both of those things are true.",
        "But at the same time, you know, in my own mind, I reconcile it with the fact that I have an obligation not just to the baseball program, but we have 360 other athletes in 17 sports in our department, and I have an obligation to make sure their programs have the ability to thrive, as well.",
        "Troy Dannen is the athletic director at the University of Northern Iowa.",

        "It was a difficult thing.",
        "You have quite a legacy of alum and players, certainly, and friends of the program through the years, when you've got one coach that's been here that long.",
        "You know, somebody had to go, obviously, I guess from their decisions, and I don't ever want to point the finger at any other sport because I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.",
        "As a coach, what was it like to tell your players that the team was cut?",
        "How did they take it?",
        "Well, the players were certainly confused.",
        "The kids don't realize how the economy can affect them, how things work exactly in administration, why our sport, why another sport.",
        "They had a lot of these type of questions, which we're continually answering and dealing with all the way through the process.",
        "Well, what happens to the players now?",
        "Well, it's kind of a feeding frenzy, certainly, on your top players, from other programs.",
        "They're immediately eligible to transfer and play right away, where normally they'd have to sit out a year.",
        "The good ones, certainly, the top ones, they're being picked over pretty hastily, like some vultures, you know, so that's a little difficult to see your last four or five years' work just disappearing.",
        "So, you know, my objective now is to make sure these kids are taken care of, and I feel that's my role as a coach."
