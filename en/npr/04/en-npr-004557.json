        "So he had covered literally every base that you would want covered if you were going to be a president.",
        "So the resume was sterling.",
        "The question was, you know, was he the kind of personality that people wanted in 1988 to follow Ronald Reagan?",
        "I think, in retrospect, he probably benefited from running against somebody who turned out to not be the most charismatic Democrat who could have been nominated that year, Michael Dukakis.",
        "And, in the end, it was enough to win.",
        "And when he took over, I think he moved fairly swiftly and smoothly into the presidency itself, which isn't always the case, as we've seen with new presidents.",

        "So there's one aspect of his campaign that I do want to ask you about, which is the infamous Willie Horton ad, which only ran once, but which is something that is something that is discussed.",

        "Our family was young at the time.",
        "I had small children.",
        "And what he would do was invite everybody in the press corps out to Kennebunkport for a whole day, you know, feed everybody, and then he would take the kids out on his cigarette boat and give them rides around the harbor.",
        "And this was the president of the United States driving 4-, 5-, 6-year-old kids around for hours on end.",
        "And it was just - you know, he loved the place, and he loved the boat, and he loved the scene.",
        "But he also loved the kids, and he was a - as you said at the outset, he was a nice person.",
