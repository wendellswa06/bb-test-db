        "If you're looking at a large antitank rocket that a soldier would carry on his or her shoulder, that's now a pretty large explosion, and it's happening right next to your head.",
        "Scharre says small studies have found that people who fire these weapons repeatedly can experience short-term problems with memory and thinking.",
        "If you're exposed to these weapons throughout the course of your military career, this might have some subtle and insidious long-term effect that doesn't materialize until later.",
        "Might.",
        "No one knows, and a definitive answer is years off.",
        "Even so, the report says military officials should make changes now.",
        "It recommends much wider use of devices known as blast gauges.",
        "They're about the size of a wristwatch and are usually worn on a service member's helmet and upper body.",
        "Scharre says the gauges offer a way to quantify exposure to blast waves.",
        "Every service member who is in a position where he or she might be exposed to blast waves should be wearing these devices.",
        "And we need to be recording that data, putting it in their record and then collecting that data in a database for medical studies.",
        "The report also recommends reducing the number of times a person can fire certain weapons in a single day and over several days, and it suggests efforts to develop helmets that protect against blast waves.",
        "The report's findings are no surprise to Kyle Sims, a former Army medic who helped deploy the first blast gauges in Afghanistan.",
        "Sims says he realized something disturbing while studying brain damage in football players.",
        "Holy cow.",
        "It's not that one time that the guy got knocked unconscious.",
        "It's the 500 times the guy got hit prior to that that he didn't get laid out on a field.",
        "So repeatedly firing a heavy weapon might be as risky as being knocked out by a roadside bomb.",
        "Sims is most concerned about service members involved in training others to fire these weapons.",
        "He says one retired officer told him about a day when he'd been exposed to more than 100 blasts from antitank weapons.",
        "You know, he essentially picked up where he left off at the end of his 2016 campaign.",
        "You know, the soundtrack is the same, and I'm not speaking metaphorically here.",
        "I'm speaking literally.",
        "The music, the songs, the walk up song, the walk off song, everything in between - all the same, and so are the arguments.",
        "Hillary Clinton and her email server still got a whole lot of attention last night; in fact, more attention than his potential Democratic opponents in 2020.",
        "So he closed out the 2016 campaign talking about the system being rigged, saying the election could be stolen from him.",
        "Now, he's the president of the United States, and he's saying that the other party is trying to erase people's votes.",

        "A typical reelection message would be to talk about what the president has accomplished and to talk about what he'd like to accomplish in the future.",
        "But that's not where his passion was.",
        "His passion was in talking about various grievances, talking about Hillary Clinton and the lock-her-up chants.",
        "And when he talked about the economy and trade and taxes, he really stuck to the script.",
        "This accusation about Democrats wanting to erase people's votes, that's really interesting.",
        "What is he talking about there?",
        "He is talking about the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller's report and Democrats in Congress still continuing to investigate him and, you know, as he says, wanting a do-over with the investigation.",
        "This has very strong echoes of what he was saying in 2016 about people potentially stealing the election or rigging the election.",
        "But he continues with this.",
        "In a way, he is taking his upset and concern and worry about the investigations and making it about his supporters, putting - taking it and and placing it on them as well.",

        "This is something that he talked about in the State of the Union address and has been talking about in the many rallies he's held since then.",
        "But his supporters are now talking about it, too, and in very personal terms.",
        "And we should say that even though the president says that this election is going to be a choice between socialism and freedom, none of the Democratic candidates, even Bernie Sanders who calls himself a democratic socialist, want sort of traditional socialism.",

        "Yeah.",
