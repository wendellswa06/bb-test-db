        "Well, to that end, coincidentally, you and I spoke almost exactly a year ago when you were on your way to a clean energy ministerial.",
        "And what you told me then was that the president can't change the process and that - you said that unless he changes the entire process of rule-making.",
        "And you said - and I quote - \"\"I believe what President Obama has put in place will keep us on our trajectory to meeting our Paris commitments.\"\" So if that's the case, then why is this decision as significant as you say it is?",
        "Well, first of all, Michel, let me just clarify that, I think what I said a year ago.",
        "You said it then.",
        "In terms of things like rules and standards, those have a process that cannot just be changed by a word being uttered.",
        "It requires an entire legal process that's quite extensive with public engagement, et cetera.",
        "So I think I'll say two things.",
        "One is, clearly if the federal government is not working in concert with the cities and states, we will still, I think - directionally we may go where we will end up for sure, but it's a bumpy road.",
        "And so things will be delayed.",
        "Certainly some of the transition from coal to gas - it will not change fundamentally in my view, but it can go more slowly over these years.",
        "Let me pause for a moment to say - just to remind everybody, I'm Paul Raeburn.",
        "This is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "So if you think you know the name of the politician last stoned - the last U.S.",
        "politician to be stoned in Latin America, give us a phone call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email is talk@npr.org.",
        "We have to begin with this Mark Sanford story.",
        "You can't make this stuff up, and it's just remarkable because here it is for the last couple of days.",
        "I mean, he's been missing for six days.",
        "His wife didn't know where he was.",
        "He was also missing on Father's Day, he has four young children, and this is a potential, widely speculated, potential Republican presidential candidate in 2012.",
        "Anyway, he's missing for six days, and his staff says well, we don't know where he is, and then they, well - finally - he's hiking on the Appalachian Trail, somewhere or there, and we don't know where he is, but that's where he is.",
        "And as it turned out this morning, he arrived at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport to say that he had been in Argentina for the past six days, unwinding after a very contentious state legislative session.",
        "Remember, he rejected…",
        "He turned down $700 million.",
        "From President Obama's stimulus package, and the State Supreme Court ordered him to accept it.",
        "He's had a lot of fights with Democrats and Republicans in the state legislature, and after he accepted it, Sanford decided to disappear.",
        "And a lot of people in Columbia were saying well, what happens if there's a prison riot?",
        "Exactly, anything.",
        "Who's in charge, and the lieutenant governor, Andre Bauer, who is also a Republican, said look, you know, the governor's entitled to do whatever he wants, but at least let me know, let us know, what's the chain of command here.",
        "And so Republicans, as well as Democrats, were very critical of the governor's disappearance."

        "He didn't inhale.",

        "Right.",
        "He was the vice president in 1958.",
        "He was in Caracas, Venezuela, and protestors surrounded his motorcade, started kicking the car, throwing stones at him.",

        "Well, of course, you know, he resigned the presidency in 1974, and we've been listening to his tape-recordings since 1980, and there was a new bunch released this week by the Nixon Library that you can hear via the National Archives.",
        "Well, you can sort of puzzle out."

        "Of course, this was not long, or right after the Supreme Court's famous Roe decision legalizing abortion, and Richard Nixon is heard on tape saying well, I'm not sure if abortion's a good thing because it might lead to permissiveness, but I can understand when it's used, especially if it's involving a child from a black and a white, you know, a child…",

        "But again, as we said last week, it hurts the Republican efforts to come up with a challenger to Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader who is up for re-election in 2010.",
        "And several years ago, Ensign ran against Reid and lost by only 428 votes.",
        "So once upon a time, John Ensign was a very popular politician in Nevada.",
