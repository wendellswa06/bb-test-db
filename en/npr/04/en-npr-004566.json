        "And because of the positions of these two people involved - the other couple involved in this case, that they were members of his staff, either campaign or senatorial staff, apparently some ethical violations may be involved?",
        "The Senate Ethics Committee has not decided whether to investigate yet, but obviously that's their - of course, if there's an extortion there, then there may be even more investigations going on -like from the police, shall we say.",

        "Now it's obviously no comity with a T, a lot D, comedy, and what happened yesterday, this New York State Senate is split 31-31, and so both the Democrats and Republicans showed up yesterday at a session, and the Democrats actually snuck in earlier than expected, and what they did was they turned off the - they were in charge of the audio and video equipment.",
        "They turned off the microphones and the video whenever the Republicans were talking, and basically both the 31 Republicans and 31 Democrats were talking at each other and yelling at each other, and it was like - it was a food fight.",
        "This is, of course, a special session called by the governor, David Paterson, to pass critical legislation that has to be passed before the end of the month or special authorities for places like New York City run out, and they're - it's nice to know that sixth grade goes on forever.",
        "I mean, we laugh, and we roll our eyes on this, but as you say, this is serious legislation that is not getting passed, and it's not helping David Paterson's chances of getting re-elected next year - or at least elected, because he became governor when another governor got involved in some problems, like Eliot Spitzer and prostitution."

        "But it is interesting to kind of seek out a question not even from a reporter but from, you know, someone in Iran, which is what Mr. Pitney was doing, passing along questions he had gotten through his own Web postings, which isn't to say that there aren't, you know, there aren't plenty of ways that the president could entertain such questions and could arrange to do so.",
        "But it was unusual having it come up within a briefing room where a presidential press conference is taking place.",
        "Ken?",
        "Don, clearly the president seemed to welcome or expect the question from the Huffington Post questioner, but he seemed a little testy, I thought, with some questions about Iran from the guy from Fox News who asked him, what took you so long; from the CBS news reporter who said that - did you become tough because…",
