        "So reporters, Don, being testy, and President Obama being testy right back.",
        "Yes, and what you miss just from the audio of that is the big smile that the president flashed before he kind of tossed out what I interpreted sitting there as a dig at - not just at John McCain and those Republicans who have criticized him, but also at the reporter who asked it - just a bit.",
        "And there was another exchange, I think on a health-care question, somebody asked him about his Spock-like logic, and he asked if that was a crack about his ears.",
        "Yes, that was Jake Tapper of ABC, and Tapper also, when he was called on, he said before I get to my question, I want to know if you would like to answer the question from David Jackson of USA Today that you dodged earlier.",
        "And the president said well, if you want me to do that, then that's your question, and there was this little back and forth.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "No, no, no - then I have a two-part question.",
        "All right, let's see if we can get some listeners in on this conversation.",
        "Arthur's on the line, Arthur calling us from Hollywood, California.",
        "One is an observation, and it's wonderful to see the president answer questions at a press conference and do so intelligently, something we haven't see in eight years.",
        "In any event, he reads off a list and picks the reporters off a list.",
        "Do those reporters know that they're going to be selected?",
        "That's number one, and number two, wouldn't it be better if the reporters who want to ask questions, I guess they don't want to have the people standing up and shouting the way it's been traditionally done, but why not have like a grab bag and put their names in a hat, and let them pull out so it doesn't look as scripted as it seems to look, even though it may not be.",

        "Well, I can tell you, too, that everybody goes into this wanting to ask questions, and everybody goes into these with a long list of questions.",
        "And you kind of keep your questions closely held, too.",
        "So you're not, you know, discussing or sharing your questions -especially if you think you've got good ones- with your colleagues.",
        "But to his first question: Do we know if we will get called on?",
        "It depends who you are.",
        "I mean, if you are with the wire services, if you're AP or Reuters or if you're with the TV networks who have given up, you know, TV time, pre-empted their regular programming to carry this press conference live, then those people all know going in that they will be called on.",
        "But the rest of us, we don't know.",
        "I mean, there have been times when I have been given a heads up before a press conference that I am on the list of people who the president intends to call on.",
        "But he hasn't gotten to me.",
        "You know, you don't know if he's going to take 10 or 20 question in a press conference.",
        "Then there have been times when, you know, you go into it blind, and I'll tell you I went into yesterday's press conference not knowing if I was on any list or not, but your name could come up any time.",
        "They don't ask you to submit the questions?",
        "They do not.",
        "They do not ask you to submit the questions.",
        "And you know, I used to hear that a lot when I was covering the Bush administration, as well.",
        "There was the sense that you would earn your place to get your question asked if they approved of your question in advance.",
        "And I'm not saying no one has ever done that, but I can tell you I never did that, and that is not a common practice at all.",
        "We all go in with a list of questions.",
        "And what happens is you sit there, and as a question similar to yours or exactly like one of yours is asked, you kind of cross it out your list, and you go through the press conference, and you're constantly revising your list as you go along.",
        "But there have been times when I've stood up to ask a question, and it's not until, you know, 30 seconds prior that you have finally decided yourself which one you're going to ask.",
        "(Unintelligible).",
        "Arthur, we're going to give somebody else a chance, okay?"

        "Wow.",
        "So because she is no longer, you know, a journalist working for the wires, and she is now someone who, you know, engages in opinion in her columns, she's no longer in that mix of people who get called on regularly - though she does on occasion."
