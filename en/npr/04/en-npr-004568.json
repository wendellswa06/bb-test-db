        "It is a shock.",
        "You know, Neal, it's been sort of this story that's gradually come out bit by bit.",
        "The governor, certainly, when the legislature ends every year, he does take a vacation.",
        "He goes to Sullivan's Island there on the coast of South Carolina on a fishing trip or a hunting trip, and it's never a big deal.",
        "But this year, when he suddenly went MIA and his staff didn't seem to know where he was or didn't seem willing to tell, the media all over the nation got very interested about what was going on, and particularly when we started hearing comments from his wife, Jenny Sanford, who was at the family's beach house with their four children, her saying she didn't know where he was and she wasn't particularly concerned.",
        "We had a feeling this is not just your typical summertime fishing trip.",
        "So we started digging around, looking at possibilities that he may not be hiking the Appalachian Trail, which is what his staff finally told the media.",
        "And we're…",
        "…late one night."

        "But here it is, back to back, another Republican rising star.",
        "The point is, is that, as we saw with Eliot Spitzer in New York and Jim McGreevey in New Jersey, who resigned their governorships because of a sexual affair or whatever that was going on, both Republicans and Democrats -and Gina will tell you this better than anybody, that they don't like - they don't like - both parties don't like Mark Sanford.",

        "It's the phase of health reform when grand visions of better care and universal coverage can get lost in a mire of lobbying, tough compromises and unresolvable deadlocks, as they have many times in the past.",
        "And the second point is, again, in that quote that you started out with, I note the coupling of this to the first budget proposal.",
        "That budget proposal, rather than doubling our energy innovation investments as we led 20 countries to committing to in Paris, rather it puts us to having dividing by two rather than multiplying by two.",
        "That trajectory will put us well behind both China and the European countries.",
        "This can have a significant dent in our innovation agenda, preparing us to profit, frankly, economically as well as environmentally from the low-carbon trend.",
        "Could you address a point that the president made repeatedly in his remarks?",
        "I mean, his argument is that he was elected to be the leader of and to advance the interests of Pittsburgh, not Paris, as he put it.",
        "Does he have a point that if advancing U.S.",

        "Coal mining jobs have been going down for decades as new technology comes in.",
        "So the issue is, these transformations happen.",
        "We have to manage them.",

        "And in fact, if you go back to what the Obama administration did, we acknowledged that, look; we're heading to a lower-carbon future.",
        "So we need two things.",
        "One is we need programs, retraining programs, et cetera, to help these communities adjust.",
        "And secondly, we need to invest in the innovation which would have, with success, the result of allowing coal use in a low-carbon world.",
        "So that's the issue.",
        "We have to look forward.",
        "We can't look back.",
        "We're not going back, and let's make the investments that lift the national economy but also with attention to the communities and regions that may have some particular challenges.",
