        "And she was a former director of business development at Cambridge Analytica.",
        "She's called to testify in the British Parliament about the company's role in the Brexit campaign, the Leave EU campaign, which the company denied being involved in despite clear evidence that it was.",

        "What do you make of Brittany Kaiser?",
        "She's a complicated person, and she has lived so many lives.",
        "She was connected with Julian Assange, was ultimately investigated by the Mueller investigation.",
        "And she's just turned 30.",
        "So here was somebody who could help people understand what was happening with our data and explain what had happened in these wreckage sites of the 2016 Trump campaign, what had happened with Brexit.",
        "And shortly after we met her, she was in Parliament giving key testimony that really changed the narrative in the U.K.",
        "on how some of the groups like Leave EU participated in the referendum of Brexit.",
        "And this overall story is much bigger than Cambridge Analytica, Carole Cadwalladr, The Guardian journalist who carries us through the film as well, says.",
        "This is about whether we can have a free and fair election ever again.",
        "At one point in the film, Brittany Kaiser is questioned about her responsibility in all of this by Paul Hilder, who is a political technologist.",
        "And he asked her whether Cambridge Analytica - whether the model subverts democracy, and she pushes back.",

        "Is there an argument to be made, though, that maybe this is just the world that we live in now?",
        "Technology is just going to get more powerful and smarter, and we can try to regulate it, we can try to mitigate some of this, but really, you know, if progressives, for example, don't like the way that the election turned out, then they need to figure out how to get better at using these same tools to advance their ideas.",

        "Now, the memo itself says that the FBI tried to get warrants to spy on Carter Page, who was an American citizen who advised the Trump campaign on foreign policy and that it based that bid on a dossier prepared by a British spy and paid for by Democrats.",
        "Now, the memo leaves out a lot of facts about that dossier, but the most important thing is that the memo itself makes clear that the FBI had reasons to look at Carter Page all the way back to 2013 and other reasons to be looking at ties between Russian agents and the Trump campaign involving other people quite apart from the dossier.",
        "So the accusations of anti-Trump bias as the motive for the investigation at its very beginning are undercut by parts of the memo itself.",
        "So more bluster than bite?",

        "So this is a situation where, if you undercut Rod Rosenstein, if he quits, or if he is fired, that gives President Trump the opportunity to replace him with somebody who would have the authority to fire Mueller.",
        "So it's potentially a bank shot.",
        "Is what the White House calls transparency an indication of what's really a grave and serious rift between the president and intelligence agencies, which are, after all, responsible for protecting the United States?",
