        "But was yesterday's slide an indication that the president's lack of good relations with the Democrats have a real cost?",
        "Possibly.",
        "But, you know, you have to see that drop, dizzying as it was, in the context of the even more dizzying increases we've seen in the Dow and other indexes in recent months.",
        "And now we see yields suddenly rising on Treasury bonds and the prospect of higher interest rates this year.",
        "So the bottom line - it just seems like some kind of adjustment might well have been overdue.",
        "Ron Elving, senior politics editor and correspondent, thanks so much for being with us.",
        "Thank you, Scott.",

        "It's a significant setback.",
        "It certainly has deprived them of the place that was once their capital.",
        "But I think the challenge is that there's still 6,000 to 10,000 ISIS fighters that control about 4,000 square miles of the border between Iraq and Syria.",
        "And I think more significantly, while we've been hammering ISIS in Iraq and Syria, it's actually spread.",
        "There's about eight ISIS branches in some 18 countries throughout the world right now.",
        "Is that the nature of a - do we call it a movement, a group?",
        "- an organization like ISIS, that in a way the more amorphous they are - if they're not trying to hold on to territory - the more they can threaten to strike over a larger area."

        "Its cachet has been damaged.",
        "But at the same time, we know from ISIS propaganda - which up until the summer was calling on followers, would-be foreign fighters to come help build a state - now their propaganda has pivoted on, help us exact revenge and retaliate for the destruction and loss of our state.",

        "What is the reach of ISIS now?",
        "This, I think, is one of the challenges we face, is that ISIS hasn't stood by idly in the past three years since the coalition came together and resolved to expel it from Iraq and defeat it in Syria.",
        "Instead, it adopted a strategy to ensure its longevity.",
        "And that, basically, entailed the cultivation of branches throughout North Africa, the Sahel, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia as well.",

        "Can you start, Mara, by giving us just a sense of what bills are around, how many there are, and you know, what are the similarities and the important differences.",
        "Well, there are five committees in Congress who are working on health care, and I think where we are is a really pivotal moment in the health-care drama.",
        "I mean, you've had President Obama setting the stage for months.",
        "He's done a very good job of building up a head of steam behind health care reform, kind of convincing people that now is the time to do it, now or never.",
        "We have to do it because the costs are out of control.",
        "It's not just a moral imperative, it's a fiscal imperative, and that's been easy to get consensus on."

        "That's an independent, non-partisan group.",
        "Yeah, it's independent, non-partisan, and it's famous for giving congressional leaders headaches because it said this week, well, the Senate Finance Committee's bill is going to cost $1.6 trillion.",
        "Max Baucus, as the chairman of the committee, had hoped his bill would cost $1 trillion or less.",
        "Now the higher the cost, the harder it's going to be to pay for it because you have to find more cuts, more taxes to raise.",
        "You know, you have to - and those things are extremely painful.",
        "So the Senate Finance Committee went back to the drawing board.",
        "They're considering deeper cuts, they're considering a kind of automatic trigger.",

        "Now, McCain wanted to eliminate them completely.",
        "What the Senate Finance Committee is talking about is capping them, not eliminating them completely, but in other words, if your health-care plan that you get from your employer is worth over $17,000, then you'll have to pay taxes on the amount above that.",

        "Yes, the president would have to walk back from a campaign pledge, but even more serious politically, he promised explicitly, over and over again, as early as, as recently as April 15, not to raise taxes on people who made less than $250,000 by a single dime.",
        "Now if you tax employer-provided health benefits, you are raising taxes on the middle class, and that's what Democrats, I think, will have to swallow if they're going to get a plan through.",
        "Republicans are going to have to swallow things they don't like, such as this employer mandate, a pay-or-play requirement on businesses that either you cover your employers or you pay into some kind of fund.",
        "So that's, in other words...",
        "Yeah, let's go back to the CBO report for a minute because that was such a bombshell this week with the huge cost figures.",
        "Did the CBO also attempt to estimate any savings that might arise from reform?",
        "Well yes, but they only estimate savings if they think they can score them.",
        "In other words, one of the big areas that the White House thinks you can get savings from is by making - taking best practices, in other words going to places that have high quality but lower-cost health care, and there are places, in Pennsylvania and the Rocky Mountains and the Mayo Clinic, and trying to replicate them all over the country.",
        "There are places elsewhere in the country, McAllen, Texas, is the famous example, where they pay a lot of money for health care, and they get poorer quality, poorer outcomes.",
        "So this is called comparative effectiveness or enforcing best practices.",
        "The problem is that the CBO can't score that.",
        "In other words, there's nothing tangible there.",
        "Nobody quite knows how to enforce innovation, and you know, maybe after 10 years they could figures it out, but the CBO only looks at a 10-year window, and they don't find those kinds of reforms or innovations scorable.",
        "In other words, they can't put a number on them.",

        "So Max Baucus is trying to produce a bill that could actually get moderate Republican votes and Democratic votes to pass it with a 60-plus majority.",

        "In other words, if you have to pay higher taxes, but you still don't have universal coverage, that could cause a backlash against the bill.",
