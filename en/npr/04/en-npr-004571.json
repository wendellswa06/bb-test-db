        "We'll talk with one of the architects of the new Massachusetts health-care plan, we'll address some tough questions surrounding the cost of medical care and the quality of that care.",
        "More money does not always produce better care.",
        "In some ways, we seem to be spending vast amounts of money on things that don't make anybody feel better, and we will zero in on Grand Junction, Colorado.",
        "Mara mentioned McAllen, Texas, which has become notorious for spending a lot of money on health care.",
        "Grand Junction seems to be one of the places where they can deliver good care at low cost.",
        "How do they do it?",

        "Well, this has been an effort of collaboration.",
        "It started away back in the 1970s, after the HMO Act of 1973, and local doctors with some foresight and altruism put together a local, non-profit health-insurance company to try to keep costs down, premiums down so more people could buy insurance.",
        "And so tell me a little bit about how that worked and what the mechanism is.",
        "A particular question of mine is whether you do this because you have a group of particularly selfless and dedicated doctors who are willing to work for less than they might otherwise make, or whether this is a system that, you know, might be easily replicable even in places where you don't have a bunch of close colleagues getting together.",
        "Yeah, well, I do think it can be replicated.",
        "You know, you go back, and the holy grail to providing universal care and to health-care reform really is cost control.",
        "I mean, you can have, you know, suddenly tomorrow have a public plan, but unless you solve the cost problem, it's not going to make it over the years.",
        "The inflation rates just won't make it.",
        "So whatever type of paying system you have or payer system you have, you've got manage the cost and contain that cost.",
        "And the way that's happened here in Grand Junction is, again, through collaboration, through this non-profit insurance company and physicians, physicians willing to look at each other and to do peer review; physicians willing to look at the cost of hospitalization, looking at how much specialists cost and the comparison from one specialist to the next; and you know, providing incentives for the use of generic drugs.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Dr.",
        "Rohack, let me go to you for a moment if we may.",
        "Dr. Pramenko was talking about a group of physicians and colleagues in Grand Junction who got together to try to control costs, and the obvious question is, is cost control going to be done on the backs of physicians?",
        "However we reform health care, is the result going to be that physicians make less money?",
        "Does it have to be that way?"

        "Well, Paul, the American Medical Association is absolutely committed to all Americans having affordable, high-quality health coverage, and one way we can do that is to reduce the unnecessary costs in the health care system.",
        "The unnecessary costs are partially administrative burden, but also variation in care, and we recognize that, and so the AMA actually brings together national specialty societies to create what are the best practices to be able to provide care for different medical conditions.",
        "But we know in our current environment that unless there's liability protections against not ordering that additional test, physicians may still be pressured to order that additional CAT scan or MRI unless we can come up with these practice guidelines and not have to worry about being sued in a courtroom because you didn't order it, even though it wasn't needed.",
        "So some studies I know have shown that the medical liability question which you're raising would save some money but perhaps not a lot of money in the health care system.",
        "I'm sure there are other studies that disagree.",
        "But are you suggesting that that could be a major piece of how we're able to save money and pay for health care reform?",
        "Well, certainly we believe that defensive medicine is a real cost and a significant cost because it contributes to the variation in care.",
        "You can take a look across the United States between environments like Grand Junction, that doesn't have a high liability problem because of tort reforms passed by the Colorado Medical Society many years ago.",
        "But in other areas, many tests are ordered because of a fear of a lawsuit.",
        "So we believe that this has to be dealt with by using science, and the science is such that comparative effectiveness can allow us to compare different devices and drugs to say what's really best for the patient and then using technology to be able to adopt it quicker, so when the patient sits down with the physician, you basically have the best practice for that patient at the time the care needs to be delivered, and that way we can start to eliminate the unnecessary cost so we can provide affordable health insurance coverage for all Americans.",
        "Professor Gruber, you have had to address some of these questions or think about them with the health reform in Massachusetts.",
        "Tell us a little bit about how long you've been at it there and what the results are turning out to be so far.",
        "Well, Massachusetts has been at health reform for a long time.",
        "Governor Dukakis made a major health reform that was a basis for his run at the presidency a number of years ago, but this last round really began with Governor Romney in around 2004, 2005 and a recognition that we could get to universal coverage in an affordable way in our state, and it culminated in a law in April, 2006 that passed our legislature virtually unanimously that provides health insurance, universal health insurance coverage for our state, and the results have been impressive.",
        "We've covered over 400,000 people with health insurance.",
        "Our uninsurance rate is down to about 2.7 percent, by far the lowest in the nation.",
        "We've done so within budget.",
        "We've come in within our budget projections, and we've done so in a way which is built on a system that works.",
        "Employer-provided insurance has actually risen, not fallen as many had feared, and the reform is popular, about 75 percent public approval of the reform itself.",
        "So, so far it's going pretty well.",
        "Now, you apparently managed to achieve the bipartisan consensus that people are working so hard for in Washington.",
        "You also made health insurance mandatory in Massachusetts.",
        "Has that worked?",
        "Has that -there's a lot of controversy about that in Washington now.",

        "I think the experience has been very positive on that on a couple of ways.",
        "One is I think it's been - I think it's widely recognized that's what you need to do to get to universal coverage, and we've gotten fairly close.",
        "The second is that administratively it's gone well.",
        "This was a pretty new experiment.",
        "People got a new tax form they had to fill out, the Form 1099-HC, proving they had health insurance.",
        "Ninety-eight percent of taxpayers got that right the very first year, and it's remained - as I say, it's remained popular.",
        "So, so far I think the mandate's working pretty well.",
        "Well, you're sounding awfully optimistic, so let me try to throw some cold water on that for the sake of discussion.",

        "I mean, this bill - the best estimate is this year we'll spend about $800 million as a state to cover over 400,000 people.",
        "If you project that to the nation, that would be consistent with a cost of about $100 billion for the nation as a whole, which is basically the kind of range they're talking about at the federal level.",
        "One person who was very important here in Massachusetts once said that working at the national is like working in Massachusetts.",

        "I mean, I believe the problem is lack of competition, and more importantly, I don't believe that we should be leaving health care with employment.",
        "I have health care from my employer, and you know what?",

        "Thanks very much for the call, John.",
        "Oh, I think the listener makes an excellent point, which is the fundamental cause of the high and rising costs in health care in America is that most of us get it through our employer.",
        "Not only do we not know what it costs, but we're buying it with tax-subsidized dollars.",
        "If your employer pays you in wages, you pay taxes on that.",
        "If your employer gives you generous health insurance, you don't pay taxes on that.",
        "As a result, our employment-based system is not portable, and it's led to excessively generous insurance, and I think that an important part of reform that's being discussed seriously in the Senate Finance Committee would be to actually have employers report on people's pay stubs what their insurance costs and actually tax them on any excess of that cost above, say, the national average.",
        "Adam, does that address your question?",
        "Actually, to a certain degree, but I think there should be a totally - I mean, why are we taking money, you know, from the benefit and then we pay it back to others?",
        "Why can't we just not tax health care and just make people buy their own health care that in some way that, you know, I mean - actually I came up with an idea, but I don't know how do I submit something like that, because I think it should just be a personal responsibility to provide for health care.",
        "Why is government doing all this for you when health care should be something like taxes, that's something you must by?",
        "All right, at least we got that message out to our listeners.",
        "Thanks for calling, Adam.",

        "One of the things that people don't talk about is the medical industrial complex that exists here in the United States and across the country, as well as international, and why not a windfall-profits tax on the pharmaceutical and medical-device companies that do profit from Americans and people from around the world getting sick?",
        "Another thing that we don't talk about is taxing hospitals.",
        "Everybody wants to beat up the physicians, but the vast majority of hospitals here in the United States are not for profit and do get a substantial tax credit from the federal government.",
        "Especially here in Naperville, Illinois, Chicagoland area, it's kind of a running joke that the hospital systems here are real-estate development companies who just happen to provide health care as a side business, because what they do with all their profits, they just reinvest into new facilities, outpatient facilities, when there may not actually be the need for those additional facilities."
