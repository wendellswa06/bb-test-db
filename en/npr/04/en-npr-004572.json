        "Dr.",
        "Rohack, any of this compute to you?",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, clearly both people that talked about the problems of a fixed dollar amount that the federal government pays for health care, both to physicians, as well as to hospitals, means that the private sector winds up subsidizing even more.",
        "We know that choice and competition are two very strong principals of America that the American Medical Association believes that has to be part of fundamental reform.",
        "Having the ability to privately contract for health care between a doctor and a patient, very important.",
        "And the other recognition is that our current system, because the federal government through price controls doesn't make it able to have the patient really know what the cost of care is.",
        "We do need to have a change in how people get information on what the cost of care is and really what is best for them.",
        "And we believe that information technology can be one tool to help the doctor and the patient know what it costs, what the benefit is, and so that they can make that personal choice what's best for them.",
        "Dr.",
        "Pramenko, I'm very interested in what you did in Grand Junction and also your perspectives based on that experience.",
        "There's a lot of discussion now about a public plan, a public insurance plan that would be funded by the government.",
        "Would that fit in to the kinds of things you're doing in Grand Junction?",
        "Do you think it's a good idea?",
        "Well, you know, if private for-profit insurance companies went away tomorrow, I probably wouldn't lose any sleep over it.",
        "What I'm concerned is, is that we're playing too much attention right now to the debate regarding a public plan versus a private plan, because I really think that really misses where the debate needs to be and that's on the cost and controlling the cost.",
        "Because whether you have private or public payers, that's what's going to allow you to function as a medical system down the road.",
        "I do think we have to be careful with this competition point.",
        "You know, if you have four gas stations on the corner, you're going to drive the price of the gas down.",
        "If you have four hospitals on the corner, the cost of medicine and the cost of overall care will go up.",
        "It doesn't quite fit the model that we use for widgets or gasoline.",
        "And so in Grand Junction, yeah, we've looked at that, and we hope that the plan we have and the program we have does not get hurt by any reform that takes place.",
        "But if we go back and we focus on cost, and we really focus on trying to control those costs with changing behavior of patients and physicians, I think we'll focus a bit better on where to go after a solution to the problem.",
        "Now, are the savings coming from physicians from hospitals from all the places where money is spent on healthcare?",
        "Yes, it is.",
        "It's a culture that's different than in other areas and shared in other areas of the country as well.",
        "You mentioned Mayo and in Pennsylvania under the Geisinger System.",
        "But it's a culture that's a bit different.",
        "You know, there's a level of collaboration here between a non-profit local insurance company that really cares more about investing in the community than any shareholder.",
        "And those are - that's a real critical element there, because if you want physicians to change their behavior and look at quality and cost, you have to have a level of trust and collaboration."

        "Now, do you think a physician's going to have trust and collaborate with a pair that's maybe a thousand miles away that's sending rules down the pike?",
        "Or do you think they're going to listen to their colleagues - that have helped set up this system, that put quality and cost controls in place - do you think you're going to get a little bit more agreement on that?",
        "I think so too.",
        "I'm Paul Raeburn and this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "Dr. Rohack, to just have you respond to Dr. Pramenko, do you think doctors and insurance companies elsewhere in the country would be able to work out a similar arrangement?",
        "Well, the hugest barrier that we have right now for physicians to come together are anti-trust laws, so that if physicians in communities start to come together to focus on quality and then start talking about value - and part of value is price - the federal government anti-trust lawyers start to come down and become problematic for us to evolve into a system.",
        "I think that what Dr. Pramenko has highlighted, though - we have to align incentives.",
        "And the incentives that has to be aligned are between those who received the care, that is our patients; those who are providing the care, that is physicians and hospitals; and those that are paying for care, which can be a pooling of insurers or a pooling of taxes through a government system.",
        "When the incentives are not aligned, that's when health care becomes problematic.",
        "So the AMA we're - we believe that, anti-trust reform to allow physicians to come together is very important.",
        "And those who have the data, who have the information that physicians need about their practice needs to be able to provide that feedback back to physicians in a collegial way, not in a current way that many insurers provide it back with telling the doctors, you're a good doctor or you're a bad doctor and we're not going to tell you exactly which patients don't have their mammograms done or colonoscopies, we're just going to tell you that you're bad.",
        "And that's not a way to evolve our health care system.",
        "Well, can I comment on the FTC issue?",
        "Sure.",
        "That's--",
        "That's the monopoly issue you're talking about.",
        "Right.",
        "And out here in Grand Junction, the FTC did look at us about 10 years ago or plus 10 years ago and there was a lawsuit that was brought.",
        "And, you know, they looked at the complaint and saw what we were doing, mixing in and giving such great access to the Medicaid folks, which we do have a special arrangement, whereas things get pooled so some doctors get paid a bit more to see Medicaid patients to increase access and other doctors have to actually make a little bit less.",
        "Again, a level of collaboration that you hardly see anywhere else in the country."

        "Well, the FTC looked at that and they said, no, we're not going to, you know, bring a lawsuit against this community that's obviously doing some very altruistic things and trying to make the system better.",
        "And so, we actually won that round with the FTC.",
        "Is there - does Congress need to do something or the FTC need to do something to change that, though, so others won't have that same threat?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are some changes that need to be made now.",
        "And - but there has to be also good leadership so that, you know, that system doesn't get abused.",

        "There's not a big, wide range of what I'm capable of making.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Specialists that I work with will definitely say yes to that question.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "That seems to me to be a bit of a problem because we can't really ask people to make less money than they were able to make.",
        "We can ask them, but we - certainly, not all of them will agree.",
        "There's no - it's a recruitment problem.",
        "Now, we're fortunate that we live in a beautiful part of the country here.",
        "And so there's other reasons why doctors come and practice here.",
        "And fortunately for us that's been part of the success story is because, you know, we live in a place where other doctors want to come and live, too.",
        "But there's no question that some of our specialties are suffering because doctors can make more elsewhere."

        "Now, Dr. Rohack, you - somewhat resembling what Dr. Pramenko's situation is in Grand Junction, you have a sort of arrangement with your local health insurance companies, do you not?",
        "Yes.",
        "At Scott and White Healthcare, we've been around for 110 years with initially a physician group, multi-specialty, then later added a hospital, and 25 years ago a community-based health plan, a nonprofit, again, working together to try and make the community better.",
        "But we also interact with national payers, and as a result of that we kind of see the differences in attitude and interactions, as well as the administrative burdens that the different entities put on the actual physician's practice.",
        "And that has helped control costs there?",
        "Have you had similar success controlling costs?"

        "Well, when you take a look at what Scott and White has on national Medicare data, certainly we are one of the most conservative and effective places in the country.",
        "And part of that is because we have a very strong belief in primary care.",
        "The way you explain it, to one degree, the smaller they are, the more mobile they are and the more long-lasting they can be.",
        "All our patients that enter Scott and White get a personal physician in primary care that helps to coordinate that care.",
        "And I think that is a very important lesson as we deal with health system reform that a patient-centered medical home can help deal with some of this care coordination transition problems that help to drive up unnecessary costs.",
        "One of the things the AMA is devoted to this year is to try and help so that as patients leave the hospital, the physician who's going to care for them at the other end knows what medications they're taking.",
        "So medication reconciliation is an important way to try and prevent patients from having unnecessary drug interactions that winds up them back in the hospital, thus driving up health care costs.",
        "And I think that's where the incentives need to be aligned.",
        "We want to keep patients healthy.",
        "We want to keep them out of the hospital if they don't need it.",
        "And the way to do that is good communication and information sharing between the specialty physicians and those who specialize in primary care.",
        "That's a hallmark of what's called a medical home, that coordination.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And right now, the medical home - when a physician like Dr. Pramenko spends a lot of time on the phone trying to coordinate that patient care, that's not paid for.",
        "And so when you look at some of the frustration that many primary care colleagues have it's because they're spending an hour and a half a day dealing with administrative burdens and, again, not getting it paid for.",
        "So we believe as part of comprehensive health reform, we have to get that change so that patients and physicians, as they're interacting with each other, have appropriate communication, payment for that, as well as not having any sort of Medicare payment formula that right now penalizes doctors when you're providing more care for the patient that's needed it, by keeping them out of a hospital.",
        "We need to change our system so that we align all the incentives - the Medicare incentives, the outpatient incentives, the communication incentives - so that patients can get the best care possible and physicians have the time to spend with patients, which is what we both want."
