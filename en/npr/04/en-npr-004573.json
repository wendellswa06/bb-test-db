        "Professor Gruber, we talked about some surprises in the Massachusetts experience.",
        "One of those had to do with the number of people getting insurance through their employers.",
        "Can you tell us what you expected and what has happened?",
        "Yeah.",
        "This is really a striking finding.",
        "I think a big concern with the reform system, which involves a lot of new government money is that it would lead people to leave their employers and get insurance on the public programs instead.",
        "But in fact, the opposite's happened here.",
        "Employer response in insurance is actually up 150,000 in the state.",
        "And the best explanation is really the effect, once again, of the individual mandate.",
        "If you watched every Red Sox game during the summer of 2007, there was an ad between the first and second inning, saying you had to have health insurance in Massachusetts by the end of the year.",
        "I think a lot of people went to their employers and said, hey, I've got to have health insurance, I hear you're the place to get it.",
        "And the employers gave it to them.",
        "So it's really been a striking development, I think - bodes well for the notion that we've pressed here in Massachusetts of building on the existing system rather than tearing it down and starting over.",
        "Does the Massachusetts experience say anything about the virtues of a public health insurance plan of the type that's being discussed in Washington?",
        "No.",
        "It doesn't really.",
        "I think there has been a lot of confusion about this.",
        "While I think it's important to separate two roles the government can play - one role is as a financer, basically making health insurance affordable for people.",
        "The earlier caller talked about why don't we just mandate people have health insurance?",
        "Well, we can't just do that.",
        "Health insurance is too expensive for low income people.",
        "A typical family policy would be 50 percent of the income of someone at the poverty line - or twice the poverty line.",
        "You just can't do that.",
        "So the first role is the financial health insurance.",
        "That's what we've done here in Massachusetts.",
        "We paid subsidies for individuals to get their health insurance but through private health insurance companies.",
        "The state is not providing insurance.",
        "The public option is a separate issue.",
        "That's not about the government as financer, that's about the government as insurer - literally saying, we, instead of Aetna, are going to provide your insurance."

        "So instead of you getting a government subsidy or insurance through Aetna, we're going to say you're going to get your insurance through Gov-Care or whatever our new plan is.",
        "That is a separate issue and raises separate questions.",
        "But it's important to recognize that a public option by itself doesn't cost money.",
        "What costs money is the government as a financer.",
        "We have a caller from Boston.",

        "And I would like to say, first of all - because the more I listen to Jonathan Gruber, the more incensed I am.",
        "He's painting such a rosy picture.",
        "It's surreal.",
        "You've had problems, I take it.",

        "Yeah.",
        "My experience is that, okay - and I have the memo from the office here.",
        "My husband and I have to buy our health insurance through the office.",
        "And I just actually fired my long letter to Kerry, Kennedy, Bernie Sanders, the White House and so on, explaining that a year ago in May, our premium, for my husband and myself with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, was 811.",
        "And the renewal rate was 1,117.",
        "So it was, you know, over 37 something percent increase.",
        "So...",
        "800 to 1,100 more or less?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, we dropped that.",
        "We went on to a lower one.",
        "And, of course, this year again, that lower one to - that allowed us to keep 812 per month premium with higher co-pay and $1,000 deductible.",
        "Well, this year we just got the memo that one is also going up about 31.5 percent...",
        "Okay.",
        "Let me stop you, Annele, if I may, because I want to make sure we get Professor Gruber a chance to respond.",
        "Sure.",
        "But let met just say one thing.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That the plan we had two years ago - because this is really significant.",
        "I can do math.",
        "Okay?",
        "The plan we had until June 31, 2008, which was, as I repeat, 811 per month, should we renew now, a year later, it is $1,492.98.",
        "That's an 84 percent increase.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "Let's - Professor Gruber, what about that?",
        "That doesn't - she's right.",
        "That paints a very different picture from what you're painting.",
        "Well, I think there's two points of response to that.",
        "The first is that, you know, individuals can have different experiences.",
        "All we can look at is what's happened overall.",
        "And overall, health care costs in Massachusetts have risen about at the national average, about six to seven percent a year since we've passed this reform.",
        "So sorry to hear about the listeners' experience, that's rather unusual relative to what we're seeing overall on average.",
        "The other response is that what we've done here in Massachusetts, which nowhere else has, is to make sure that listeners like the one that called, if they have incomes - say, family income is at $60,000 or less, we're going to heavily subsidize those premiums."

      "language": "en",
      "utterances": [
        "So while it's true that premiums are going up in Massachusetts, just like everywhere else, by about six to seven percent a year, the difference in Massachusetts versus living in any other state, is if that listener's and the family with income less than $60,000 a year, the government couldn't give them a lot of help.",
        "That said, I think, you know, the listener's question raised a general point.",
        "The Massachusetts reform is not about cost control.",
        "That was not our goal.",
        "Our goal is to cover our citizens, make sure the citizens didn't have to go to bed a night worry about waking up being bankrupted by their medical expenditures.",
        "Cost control is a separate issue that has been addressed by - you know, by the other speakers and is a major new battle we have to face at the national level.",
        "Tell me just briefly, while I have you, the - you're in the board of Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector.",
        "What is that thing?",
        "It's an odd name.",
        "So basically, the Connector is the new authority that runs our health reform.",
        "So - but the reason it's called the Connector is because our health reform really has three fundamental pieces.",
        "The first is that we provided this heavily subsidized insurance for those with incomes below $60,000, as I mentioned.",
        "The second is the individual mandate which says that you do have to buy health insurance in return for the fact we're subsidizing it.",
        "The third is we've reformed the way our health insurance market works, and that's where the connector piece comes in, which is we've set up a new organized market place for buying health insurance - you can see it by going to www.mahealthconnector.org.",
        "And it's basically an amazing new Web site where you can go and choose from variety of health insurance products in organized shopping framework that didn't really exist before.",
        "So that's what the connector piece is.",
        "At the national level, it's often referred to as an exchange.",
        "But it's basically the notion that we are going to get rid of our very dysfunctional and hard to navigate insurance market for individuals with small businesses and loose to a more reasonable Web-based portal.",
        "Dr.",
        "Rohack, the - a lot of these plans of all sorts seem to involve more government involvement whether it's the connector in Massachusetts, it's kind of government involvement, whether it's a public plan in Washington, more regulation, et cetera.",
        "I don't think the AMA and maybe your personal experience with the government has been all that good, and I'm talking about Medicare.",
        "Well, clearly Medicare, when it was started many years ago, was not supposed to interfere with the practice of medicine, and of course, that has changed.",
        "And I think one of the highlights of the Medicare program is that it's still a silo.",
        "Part A pays for the hospital.",
        "Part B pays for the doctors.",
        "Part D pays for drugs.",
        "And so, in the part B, there is a formula that's been around now for almost 20 - I mean, sorry, almost 10 years or longer that basically has whatever procedures, whatever tests are done, whatever volume of services are done in one particular calendar year, the next year the physician payment is cut to maintain budget mutuality.",
        "And as a result of that, January 1st, physicians faced a 21 percent cut in Medicare payment to care for patients."

        "So what happens with the government system, because of its monopoly powers and its huge size, if they want to control a budget, they basically start to slash away at reimbursement.",
        "And unfortunately, the patient winds up being at risk of trying to find someone who is going to care for them.",
        "We believe that that's - that needs to be changed right now, that fundamental health system reform.",
        "People are now talking very much about changing this formula that's flawed.",
        "And we believe very importantly that, especially those in rural and underserved areas where physicians are at age 68, 69, 70 thinking about, well, do I still want to stay in practice if you're faced with a 21 percent decrease in the income coming in knowing that you yourself are having to spend higher premiums in insurance coverage for your workers...",
        "Then it becomes a real problem to get all that and keep your office open.",
        "So we're - we believe in the discussion that's - that will occur that pluralism(ph) is important.",
        "We need to have a private market so that we have innovation and choice.",
        "And then the role of the government is to provide the safety net for those that can't afford.",
        "And again, we believe, as Jonathan mentioned, having subsidies from the federal side to allow the individual to purchase insurance for themselves and their family and then allow the private market to be the one to innovate to allow the changes needed so we have an American system of health care for every one that's affordable and has high quality.",
        "The AMA and the government can now find a way to get together on this, do you think?",
        "Well, we were excited when President Obama came to speak to our house of delegates on Monday.",
        "He signaled that physicians are going to be central to making health reform.",
        "We, as physicians, we got into this profession because we want to serve our patients.",
        "And so we want to make sure the patients' voice are taken care of.",
        "We want a system so that patients will have the ability to choose their physician, decide what care they need along with their physician based on science, and then having a payment mechanism that's fair so that the patient doesn't have to decide, do I buy my medicines or do I pay for my electricity.",
        "Dr.",
        "Pramenko, we're talking a lot about costs and keeping cost down and getting rid of unneeded treatments and so forth.",
        "Do you think that the arrangement you worked out in Grand Junction has also done the flip side of that, which is to provide better treatment for people who weren't getting enough of it?",
        "Oh, yeah.",
        "You know, there's two sides of the coin.",
        "There's people that are aren't getting enough care and there's people that are getting too much care",
