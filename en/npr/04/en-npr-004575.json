        "Yes, exactly.",
        "And then you were arrested, and you guys were held for 14 months.",
        "Can you tell us what that was like?",
        "The conditions in scorpion prison - or as they call it - the official name is the maximum security prison - was really horrible.",
        "Sleeping on the cement floor, the temperature of the room was always, like, less than 17.",
        "The cell was full of insects and cockroaches and mosquitoes.",
        "When you say 17 degrees, you meant 17 degrees Celsius, whereas we do Fahrenheit.",
        "But that's like around 60 degrees Fahrenheit - that seems really cold.",
        "I issued a directive to our police superintendent that ICE can no longer get access to any databases that CPD has.",
        "So that's, I think, a big start.",
        "The other thing is, I've underscored to the police department that they cannot, in any way, facilitate any of the ICE raids, and they understand that.",
        "I do know that your predecessor, Rahm Emanuel, had taken similar positions, though.",
        "Are you going beyond whatever he was having the police do?",
        "Well, I'm just reemphasizing that this cannot be something that we do.",
        "We're not going to facilitate street closures, blocking of traffic, anything like that.",
        "Oh.",
        "Well, let's think about that for a moment.",
        "If we imagine an ICE raid and it being a rather large-scale effort, they might send immigration agents into an apartment building, hypothetically, to pick some people up.",
        "And they might ask the Chicago police for backup to clear the streets, to be ready in case anything goes wrong.",
        "You're telling me the Chicago police just aren't going to do that.",

        "They are the ones in their family that speak English.",
        "And it is scaring them to think about the fact that they may be the victim of an ICE raid or that - their parents or somebody else in their family.",

        "And that's one of the things that we're trying to work against.",

        "But do you find fear among people who are in the United States legally?",
        "When you're walking down a street and you are a brown-skinned person or you're a person that lives in an immigrant community, there's no differentiating on - solely on the basis of what you look like.",
        "They don't walk down the street saying, hi, I'm an immigrant; I'm here legally or not.",
        "And so there is a general concern as to how ICE is - make a differentiation.",

        "She was with her young daughter.",
        "She wanted to take her daughter home to her parents in the event that she was going to be arrested.",
        "And once the ICE agents determined that she was actually subject to DACA and here legally, then they found her parents at home, who were undocumented, had been here for decades and now they've been deported.",
        "So those kinds of stories spread like wildfire, and the general fear of what might be coming is something, unfortunately, that permeates many of our neighborhoods.",
        "If there are people with deportation orders against them, should they be deported?",
        "If a judge has made a final determination and somebody isn't here legally, then that's what our system provides, and they're going to have to deal with those consequences.",
        "Now, there's obviously also appeal rights, but we expect people that are here going through an immigration process to get their due process.",
        "What I would like to see is a focus on individuals who are creating harm in our communities.",
        "There are people here engaged in violent crimes.",
        "There are people here who engaged in other kinds of things that are disruptive to the community.",
        "Well, that's an interesting point because the president has framed this latest threatened set of raids - we don't know if any raids will happen, but he's threatened them - framed them as a pressure tactic to get the Democrats in Congress to move.",
        "Do you want the Democrats in Congress to work with the president here?",
        "I want there to be a bipartisan effort to solve this problem that has eluded many presidents.",
        "And I don't think it's realistic, given the complexities of the issues.",
        "If the president isn't lobbying members of his party to come to the table with a comprehensive solution, it's not going to work.",
        "If that happened, then I have some confidence that we could move forward in a realistic way.",
        "But fearmongering, scare tactics and artificial deadlines are not going to get it done.",
        "You outlined a moment ago what sounds to me like a position similar to the one that President Obama took when he was in office - that authorities should focus on serious criminals, people who have done something wrong other than cross the border illegally.",
        "If ICE were to come to you or come to your police department with a narrower list of people and say, this is a list of serious criminals; we want to round them up - would you collaborate then?"

        "He's the president of the United States, and so I think it automatically becomes serious when you have the president-elect of the United States, I should say, talking about nuclear weapons and our nuclear strategy.",
        "And I think that like we have seen in other areas, you know, Twitter is not necessarily the greatest platform in which to articulate a nuanced and in-depth strategy on much of anything.",

        "Well, now, I would think that that would be something that Donald Trump would not really want to get behind.",
        "Probably not.",
        "The problem is is that most people who run for president will talk about that, but when they get into office, their incentives change.",
        "And I think one thing that we can probably look forward to is the fact that because Donald Trump is coming in as a less popular president-elect than probably we've seen in quite a long period of time - maybe Nixon would be the closest analog to this - there's going to be a lot more incentives for Congress and for the states to assert more of their own jurisdiction.",

        "But I think conservatives can be pretty cheered by some of the other picks in some of the other Cabinet positions, such as Governor Rick Perry at energy and Scott Pruitt at the EPA are definitely going to be pursuing the type of devolution of authority back to the states that I think that conservatives have been asking for really probably for 20-30 years and haven't seen much of.",
