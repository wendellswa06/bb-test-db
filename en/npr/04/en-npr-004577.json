        "And I'm curious what other countries might be looking at when they look at President Trump, and, they are sort of thinking about, what is the way to best engage with him?",
        "We've seen leaders on the world stage like President Macron of France, which might've been a testy relationship but actually went very well.",
        "That just goes to show you the personal side of it - the personal relationship side of it.",
        "He - I've noticed with President Trump, with him prior to meeting a foreign leader, he may have a certain idea of what they're about and he may have an opinion of them prior to meeting with him.",
        "And it - oftentimes, it changes after he spent some time with them.",
        "And so I think the more he can interact and meet with foreign leaders on a personal level, I think it's better for the country.",

        "Yeah, Tom Hulce was great as Mozart and Amadeus and all, but going scene for scene with F.",

        "And then a couple of weeks ago, you were in court.",
        "Defendants in Egypt are held in a cage, so you were standing in your cage in court, and you found out that you were going to be released on bail.",

        "I was surprised.",
        "When you stay in prison, you start giving up expectations.",

        "So you're saying it's not illegal, but it is risky?",
        "It is risky, but many journalists are willing to take all the risks too because they appreciate and they understand the importance of the people right to know."

        "His numbers have slumped over the last year.",
        "His Democrats are in danger of losing the Senate.",
        "So he wants to push against this idea that nothing can get done this year.",
        "He wants to communicate the notion that he's fully engaged, energized and that this is going to be, as the White House says, a year of action.",
        "I also think one of the most important things he can do tonight is to shape the conversation.",
        "Presidents have a unique opportunity to do that in the State of the Union and he's going to try.",
        "Now, arguably, he's done that with the income inequality issue.",
        "Even Republicans agree on the problem, if not the solutions.",
        "How do you think the president will handle that tonight?",
        "Well, I think, as you heard Jay Carney say, he is going to focus on the growth and opportunity and of the income inequality puzzle, not on the redistribution side.",
        "In other words, he's already taxed the rich, the wealthy.",
        "He's not going to do that again.",
        "He's going to focus on expanding the pie, not just on slicing up a shrinking pie more equitably and, as he puts it, he's going to focus on ladders of opportunity into the middle class.",
        "And that actually is an area where he might find some agreement with Republicans.",
        "Let's talk about some of the things that the president wants to do that Republicans don't, frankly.",

        "Well, that's where the pen and the phone come in and the new focus on unilateral action.",
        "As Jay Carney just said, if he can't get a minimum wage through Congress, he's going to chip away at the problem by himself by, like he did today, raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10.",
        "The federal government is, after all, the country's biggest employer.",
        "But all of these issues, raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, universal pre-K, they are very popular and as a matter of fact, almost all the issues that the president is going to stress tonight poll over 50 percent, including keeping and fixing rather than repealing the healthcare law, as unpopular as that law might be.",
        "So these are issues that Democrats can unify around, run on in the midterm elections, independent voters like these issues, even if Republicans in Congress don't want to pass them.",
        "And then, there's the issue that people are talking about, immigration, something that may have a chance of passing this year in some form.",

        "Well, we are in a new chapter on the immigration reform debate.",
        "After writing off the chances of anything happening, all of the sudden, optimism is busting out all over Washington.",
        "People feel now that 2014 could actually be the year that the House would pass something.",
        "The Senate already has.",
        "And Republicans are thinking maybe they need to get something done this year, before the presidential primary season starts in 2015.",
        "I think tonight you're going to hear the president tread very carefully on this issue.",
        "He might push off against Congress on the minimum wage or other issues, but on immigration, he doesn't want to antagonize Republicans.",
        "He wants to keep the possibility of bipartisan progress on this issue open so that means he won't be firing up the partisan rhetoric on immigration.",
        "He wants to try as much as he can to help John Boehner in any way he can and that may mean, as you saw him do during the budget negotiations, staying out of it as much as possible and just working behind the scenes.",
        "His goal is to get the House Republicans to pass a bill this year or a bunch of bills, and then see how they can deal with the Senate version.",
