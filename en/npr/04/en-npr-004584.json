        "I know that would be inflationary, but isn't that preferable to default?",
        "Well, that's a simple answer to that: Because they're not allowed to.",
        "There are only two ways that the government can finance its spending, and that's by tax revenue or by borrowing.",
        "Only the Fed can inject money into the economy.",
        "Would the Fed buy the government debt in effect to prevent interest rates from rising and as a consequence allow inflation to get out of control?",

        "So that is hard to explain.",
        "But presumably, and I would expect that complacency will evaporate really quickly, if we go down to the wire with the debt ceiling and absolutely if there's no credible budget compromise."
