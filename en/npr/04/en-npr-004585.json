        "What do you mean by wily?",
        "Well, as you had mentioned, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which was passed in March, we're going to see 32 million new patients accessing the health care delivery system which previously weren't accessing this system.",
        "And currently, we don't have the capacity to provide high-quality, patient-centered care for this new expanded population.",
        "And we should point out that this recommendation is just one of those issued by the panel, but it's drawn the most attention.",
        "And we are talking about nurses, the so-called advanced practice nurses, in other words those with a master's degree.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So as you had mentioned, one of the main recommendations, which was one of the eight recommendations that we made on the committee, was allowing nurses to practice to the full extent of their education and training.",
        "Unfortunately, there are many barriers that nurses -particularly advanced practice nurses, which are nurses that have a graduate education, meaning that they have a master's degree or they have a doctorate degree.",
        "And they have the training to be able to fulfill a lot of their primary care responsibilities.",
        "The problem is is that there's a lot of variation in terms of the scope of practices across states here in the United States that don't permit nurses that are trained to provide primary care to actually provide that type of care.",
        "Unless they're supervised by a doctor.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And are there enough of these nurses, first of all, to make a big difference?",
        "Well, we do.",
        "We currently have about a little over 150,000 nurse practitioners.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "And so the, you know, this is a relatively large workforce that is capable and well-educated to provide high-quality, patient-centered care.",
        "And the argument against it, as I'm sure you've heard, is doctors will say, even if they have more training it's not the right training.",
        "Doctors need to make these decisions.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, one of the things that we looked at as we were making our deliberations - and the Institute of Medicine actually takes a lot of pride in this process - is that we don't make any recommendation that is not based on science or based on evidence.",
        "So we looked at a number of research studies that compared the quality and the outcomes of care provided by nurse practitioners and those provided by primary care physicians.",
        "And what - there's overwhelming evidence that there is very great outcomes with the type of care that nurse practitioners provide.",
        "And what kind - we mentioned writing prescriptions and ordering tests, what are the kinds of, well, things that doctors now do would nurse with these - advanced practice nurses be allowed to do if your proposal was enacted?",
        "So advanced practice nurses and nurse practitioners in particular are trained to make diagnoses, to write prescriptions, to make certain referrals or order tests.",
        "They're trained to be able to assess the need of individuals to be admitted in hospitals, et cetera.",
        "And depending on where you practice, those scopes of practice might be more limited than in other places.",
        "So...",
        "The scopes of practice are limited by state law, correct?",
        "Correct.",
        "Okay.",
        "So you are arguing that states need to change their laws to allow this.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So we have very specific recommendations to governments, to Congress in specific, to state legislatures, to allow - to look at the scope of practice laws and either allow changes to their laws or provide additional incentives for states to adopt more favorable laws that would allow an expanded scope of practice for nurse practitioners that is in accord with their education and training, of course.",
        "And we mentioned, of course, there is a shortage of primary care physicians.",
        "It's been well documented.",
        "Isn't there also a nursing shortage?"

        "Yes, there is.",
        "So we also have a nursing shortage as well, which is another issue of great concern that we need to be looking at.",
        "And this is, as I understand it, due to a shortage of nurses qualified to teach other nurses, nurse educators, because the nurses who are qualified to do that can also make a lot of money doing other things too.",
        "Exactly.",
        "That's precisely one of the major contributors to the nursing shortage, the fact that we have little faculty that are available to accept the number of potential nursing students, because there is a great deal of interest from the community in terms of nursing as a profession.",
        "So every year, we turn thousands of nurses, of potential nurses, away from our educational system.",
        "So if that's the bottleneck, how would that be addressed?",
        "So we actually - so this is one of the areas that we looked into.",
        "We don't have specific recommendations about the nursing shortage per se, but we do focus a good number of our recommendations around nursing education in general.",
        "And one of the major points that we're making in our recommendations is that we need to improve the education of our nurses.",
        "By allowing nurses to progress in their education to higher levels, then in essence we're building a greater cadre of well-educated nurses that could be faculty members in nursing schools.",
        "And one other question also: If nurses are going to be making independent medical judgments beyond - without being supervised necessarily by a doctor, aren't they going to have to also take up more malpractice insurance because they're liable for their mistakes?",
        "And mistakes, of course, will happen.",
        "Okay.",
        "Well, an advanced practice nurse is a member of the nursing discipline.",
        "And as a discipline, nursing license credentials and accredits its own educational programs.",
        "And physician's assistants are - fall under the discipline of medicine, and as such, are regulated, licensed and supervised by medicine.",
        "Well, this is - we didn't look at malpractice insurance in particular.",
        "What we are proposing is that nurses practice to their -according to their education and training, and that they of course practice in a team of health care providers, which also includes physicians.",
        "So advanced practice nurses could - the evidence shows that they're able to provide a lot of the same services and high-quality, patient-centered services to the general public.",
        "However, they have - they can't work alone, of course.",
        "They need to work and partner with physicians and other health care providers and acknowledge when it's important to refer to a partnering health care provider.",
        "We're talking with Rosa Gonzales-Guarda, a nurse herself and also a assistant professor and the - one of the authors or one - part of the panel that drew up this report on expanding the role of nurses.",
        "And we use the expression scope of practice, it's what nurses and doctors are allowed to do in various kinds of situations.",

        "Two points I'd like to make.",
        "In Oregon, nurse practitioners have had independent practice authority since 1979.",
        "And we have a very long history in this state of positive outcomes from patients, increasing demand from Oregon consumers for the care provided by nurse practitioners.",
        "So we're very proud of it, and we think that is evidence that the Institute of Medicine is on the right track.",
        "The second point I'd like to make is that the future health care demands of this country - our state and this country are going to require that all of us practice as broadly as we can.",
        "So it isn't a matter of there are insufficient nurses or physicians, and so we need to turn to someone else.",
        "There's simply going to be greater demands that any one discipline can meet.",
        "And so all of us need to be a part of the solution.",
        "We...",
        "I was just wondering, in Oregon - obviously, you say this has obviously been in place for some time there.",
        "Was there pushback from doctors, and how did that work out?",
        "Well, initially, of course there was, but that really didn't last very long.",
        "And we do enjoy a very strong relationship with our physician colleagues in this state.",
        "And I think it has benefited our consumers.",
        "And what about that insurance question that I was asking, Rosa Gonzalez-Guarda about?",
        "Do nurses making independent medical decisions have to take out malpractice insurance?",
        "Certainly, they do.",
        "The rates for nurse practitioners in Oregon and countrywide are not at the level that physicians pay.",
        "But as you become more independent in your practice, you certainly do face the risk of liability.",
        "And so I think our nurse practitioners - and nurses, as well - recognize that insuring your practice, like insuring your car, is just a fact of our professional life.",
