        "Despite a new report, many doctors do not agree that nurses should order tests or write prescriptions on their own.",
        "Even nurses with an advanced degree, they argue, are not trained as doctors and shouldn't act like one.",
        "We'll talk with the president of the American College of Physicians about those arguments in just a moment.",
        "Our guests right now are Rosa Gonzalez-Guarda, who served on the panel on the Institute of Medicine Committee that issued last month's report, \"\"The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health.",
        "Also with us is JoAnn Trybulski, associate dean of the Master's nursing program and doctor of nursing programs at the University of Miami, an advanced practice registered nurse herself.",

        "And let's go to Sarah(ph).",
        "Sarah with us from San Francisco.",
        "Nursing has always had what we consider a collaborative working relationship with our physician colleagues, and it's a relationship that we always seek to maintain and foster.",
        "So, in other words, there are two different disciplines.",
        "But if nurses are seeking to do medical things, like issue prescriptions, shouldn't they -and maybe the doctor would make this argument - shouldn't they be studying medicine?",
        "Well, actually, we prefer to think that they are studying nursing at an advanced practice level, which has many of the same functions that medicine may have at a given level, but it is still coming from the discipline of nursing with a nursing focus and carried out by nursing - nurse practitioners, practitioners who are nurses.",
        "Well, perhaps I should bring Dr. Fred Ralston into the conversation.",
        "He joins us from his office at Fayette Medical Associates in Fayetteville...",

        "And is that your - is there some problem with nurses writing prescriptions and ordering tests?",
        "Well, let me give you a little bit of my background, because I think perspective is always important.",
        "The American College of Physicians is the internal medicine specialty society, the second-largest physician group in the country with 130,000 members.",
        "And in my day job, I'm in an eight-doctor, primary care practice in Fayetteville, Tennessee.",
        "And we work with a nurse practitioner that we're very happy to have in our practice.",
        "And in some earlier time in my activities with the American College of Physicians, I chaired a committee that produced a paper on nurse practitioners in primary care.",
        "And we were the first medical organization to reach out to the nursing community, and we've had continuing dialogue since that time.",
        "So I'd like to give a little bit of a response to the IOM report, and then answer questions, if that's okay.",
        "Well, all right.",
        "After that preamble, go ahead.",
        "Okay.",
        "The - many of the recommendations in the IOM report are consistent with what we feel.",
        "There's some areas of concern only in part with the focus of the specific recommendations, but in particular a concern that others who don't read the full report or understand all the background may imply that physicians and nurses are virtually interchangeable.",
        "And we certainly don't feel like that's the case, and I think most people in the nursing community wouldn't either.",
        "That's not what I'm hearing from the nurses we have on the panel.",
        "But go ahead.",
        "Well, I mean, we really feel that there are different types of training with different levels of knowledge, skills and abilities that are not equivalent, but complementary, and we really see that as a good thing.",
        "And one of the concerns that we had about the IOM report and its interpretation was the focus on independent practice.",
        "We really would prefer to turn that around toward the future of medicine, which we see as more of a team-based effort, and we really see existing models like the VA and a variety of groups such as Kaiser and Geisinger that use both physicians, nurse practitioners and other health care professionals to full advantage.",
        "So we really feel like we would be better served by focusing on the particular clinical activities that the training makes appropriate, and then look to what's been happening in the world in places like VA where they've already been doing that with some success."

        "As I understand, the report does address the idea of team practice, and they were just talking about that just a moment ago.",
        "But nevertheless, in terms of independence, are you saying that advanced training nurses, nurses with Master's degrees are - should be disqualified from writing prescriptions or ordering tests?",
        "Well, actually, the writing the prescriptions and ordering tests within the proper medical setting is one of the things that we find all right.",
        "We just feel like as long as the training is appropriate and as long as there's some kind of quality feedback.",
        "That's the thing that we really like about physicians and advanced practice nurses in the Patient-Centered Medical Home.",
        "There's an opportunity in that setting to test new ideas and different ideas, but we really don't have to start from scratch because there are advanced practice nurses performing those functions within an established health care systems.",
        "And if I were a state legislator and I was looking at practice activities, I would certainly want to look at those activities that have shown to work over time, and I would be more comfortable with either a doctor or an advanced practice nurse writing prescriptions or doing other activities where's there's a continuous quality monitoring process.",
        "That's why we're so excited about the future of medicine in the Patient-Centered Medical Home.",
        "JoAnn Trybulski, is that what this report urges, as far as you can see?",
        "I totally think that that's what the report urges.",
        "I mean, what - the scope-of-practice question just means that state to state, there is great variability in what nurse practitioners are allowed to do.",
        "And in many states, they do assume their full scope as my physician colleague eloquently stated.",
        "And I would echo that, you know, nurse practitioners work best, as physicians do, as part of a health care team.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's see if we can get some more comments.",
        "Here's an email, this is from Monica in Nampa, Idaho: I have nothing against nurses.",
        "However, the discussion about expanding the role of nurse, hiring more nurses, etc., completely avoids one of the reasons.",
        "We don't seem to have one of the reasons.",
        "We don't seem to have enough doctors, and that is the artificially low quota set on the amount of medical school students that could begin training in a given year.",
        "That keeps the supply of new doctors low, thus contributing to demand.",
        "Why not raise these quotas, get more doctors into the field?",
        "And Dr. Ralston, what do you think?",
        "Well, we've been having discussions with this for a number of years.",
        "There's almost no way to deal with shortages without talking about the particular issues facing primary care in this country.",
        "The - if you look at general internal medicine, family medicine and pediatrics, fewer medical school graduates are going into that because of some ways that we finance health care.",
        "And we certainly have a number of proposals to help improve that, and the Patient-Centered Medical Home is one of them.",
        "So simply increasing the number of medical school graduates, if they're all going to go into dermatology, radiology, orthopedic surgery, isn't going to change access to primary care.",
        "And so we feel that there are going to need to be more nurses and more doctors, but we also want to make sure that those nurses and doctors have an appropriate place to go and have the incentive.",
        "I mean, we're seeing in our area many well-trained nurse practitioners that primary care people would love to have in their practices.",
        "They're going to those other specialties that the doctors are choosing, also.",

        "And one of the recommendations that we do have is to implement a nurse residency program, so that nurses that are graduating, whether they're graduating from a baccalaureate degree, they have the opportunity to engage in a residency program where they're able to apply a lot of the theory that they learned in the classroom in a real-life setting, with a little bit more support than they would regularly have in, you know, without a residency program."
