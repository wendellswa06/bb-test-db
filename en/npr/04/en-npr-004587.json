        "Yeah.",

        "Right.",
        "...physician's assistants, physicians or nurse practitioners, and then know when to ask for help.",
        "And that's not just nurses asking doctors for help.",
        "It may be doctors asking people in a different specialty, and I think your caller has pointed out one of the key elements of what we need to do in the future.",

        "I just want to get back to nursing since we're talking about nurses.",
        "This question is for Rosa and JoAnn.",
        "The Nursing Code of Ethics is pretty clear in distinguishing between collaboration between disciplines, not just cooperating.",
        "And in order to preserve nursing's unique contribution to health care, will a model for future health care systems utilizing nursing in a broader scope be a collaborative model or simply back to the medical model with nursing merely cooperating?",
        "I mean, does better-trained nurses mean training in the medical model and getting away from our nursing roots?",
        "And I'll take my call off the air.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thanks very much.",
        "Rosa, JoAnn, who wants to start with that?",
        "I think I'll start.",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "It doesn't mean that nurses will be trained more in the medical model.",
        "We have an excellent way of preparing our nurse practitioners, currently, that grounds them in the nursing discipline and teaches them and models collaboration with all types of health care providers.",
        "I think it's important to recognize that nurse practitioners are not educated in the classroom and merely turned loose.",
        "But over the course of their education, they have gradually-graded clinical experiences with increasingly expecting them to make independent decisions."

        "And we did find evidence that there was a lack, currently, in terms of our ability to train interdisciplinary health care providers.",
        "We didn't see a lot of evidence of course work or opportunities for nurses to be in a classroom and in clinical experiences with medical students, physical therapy students, psychology students et cetera.",

        "I know here in Arkansas, we have registered nurses, diploma nurses that are registered nurses all the way up to bachelor's-degree-educated nurses, and I was also interested in hearing about - I've heard that in order to get an advanced practice licensure, I believe, it's around 2015 that a Ph.D. in nursing will be required.",
        "I was wondering if the panel could comment on that.",
        "JoAnn Trybulski, that seems to be up your alley.",
        "Yes, it does.",
        "Actually, there has been this statement out that by 2015 nurse practitioners should be prepared with their DNP, or doctor of nursing practice degree.",
        "It was felt that as nurse practitioners were educated that their increasing educational experiences were far in excess of the credits that's normally required to receive a master's degree.",
        "And then - therefore, it was proposed that they be educated with this new practice-focused doctorate degree that would focus on nursing practice.",
        "I think it's important to understand about the DNP degree that it's not just for nurse practitioners, that it really is a degree for nursing that focuses on nursing practice, on health care system delivery and creating innovation for health care reform and health care delivery.",
        "So it is a very interesting degree.",
        "I believe there is a lot of discussion going on within the nursing community about when that degree will be required for what type of our nursing practitioners.",
        "And it's a very exciting movement because the DNPs currently complete a capstone project, and they're required to vision or create an innovation for nursing practice or health care.",
        "So it's a very exciting opportunity for nursing...",
        "Katie, is that something...",

        "But, yeah, it definitely seems like it's taking the profession a step forward, and that's really what needs to be done to advance ourselves and our profession because it is truly a profession.",
        "And I think that it will, you know, benefit not only our profession but society as a whole because, you know, it's needed.",
        "And it's the future of health care."

        "And Katie's point: It's a long way from Little Rock to Memphis.",
        "The shortage of nurse educators, JoAnn Trybulski, is that going to be a bottleneck as you're trying to get more of these advanced degrees?",
        "Well, we're trying to be very creative in how we deliver and offer these degrees.",
        "For instance, our DNP program at the University of Miami is offered over one long weekend a month.",
        "That will allow students to travel to us from great distances, and we've been very successful with that model.",
        "We're also talking about how to change how we offer our master's degree programs to a similar executive model that would allow people to travel to the university to receive their education.",

        "I've been practicing for 20 years and have great relationships with both patients I've cared for and the physicians with whom I work, and specialists to whom I refer.",
        "Though there's always pushback from physicians that feel threatened by us, I've experienced little of that, fortunately.",
        "Particularly in geriatrics, there's a huge need for practitioners with geriatric experience as it's different than caring for younger forks.",
        "My hope is that nurse practitioners and physicians will go into geriatrics in the future.",
