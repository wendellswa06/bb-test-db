        "Yes, he grew up in Hannibal, and we think that he actually explored what they called McDowell Cave, but now it's called Mark Twain Cave -but he incorporated that into his stories.",
        "Because Scott, what different kinds of caves?",
        "You know, most of us think a cave is a cave, but it's not just a cave, is it?",
        "Yeah, it pretty much runs the gamut, you know, and we have caves that are developed by solution, and that's primarily what the caves are in Missouri, but you also have caves that are formed by tectonic processes, such as earth cracks.",
        "And then you have out West a lot of lava tube caves, which are not formed by flowing water but by flowing molten rock.",

        "What Bill, what is the largest cave in the state?",

        "Of those, about 82 are actually cave-adapted, cave-limited creatures, that is what we call troglobytes or troglobiants.",
        "And like you see in the oceans, I noticed in some of the for example on some of the fish, they've lost their sight ability, right?"
