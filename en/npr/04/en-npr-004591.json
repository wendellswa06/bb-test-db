        "Well, there's lots of books.",
        "Books like guidebooks, if you go to someplace, you get a guidebook, and there's a cave guidebook, like a field guide to a cave.",
        "Right, all you have to do is Google the Internet, and you'll find lots of beautiful books on caves.",
        "One of the most spectacular caves in the world, of course, is Lechuguilla Cave, in New Mexico, just astounding.",
        "Do you have is there one specifically for Missouri, what you see in Missouri caves?",
        "There's a nice coffee-table book on caves of the Ozarks written by some Missourians back about 10 or 15 years ago.",
        "Do they mention specific caves, you'll see these things in them?",
        "No, they do not.",
        "Why not?",
        "Not usually, because many of those caves are protected only by secrecy or obscurity.",
        "If their locations were revealed to the public, some people not people in this room of course would go there and destroy them.",
        "They would rip off all the speleothems, the cave formations, sell them on the black market, look for archeological artifacts, sell them on the black market.",
        "These are problems we actually have.",
        "So you'll find that some cavers are quite guarded about revealing cave location information, only to the owners, perhaps, and to trusted colleagues."

        "Okay, good point.",
        "We're talking with Scott House, Robert Criss and William Elliot.",

        "Sure, I think we actually don't do as well as good a job as we should in protecting caves and the lands above them.",
        "There's a more general problem of just not adapting realistic geological and hierologic constraints in the way we develop land in general.",
        "In St. Louis County, we develop in flood plains.",
        "I've seen many places in our own county where we level the topography above sinkholes and put plants houses right on top of them.",
        "So there are many places in St. Louis County, we incorporate storm-water drainage directly under the cave systems.",
        "Caves are viewed as a great way to move storm water away because they're natural pipes.",
        "This causes flash floods in caves.",
        "This causes great sedimentation in caves.",
        "This causes temperature fluctuation in caves and a whole lot of other physical changes to the caves.",
        "It also is a rapid means for conveying surface pollutants into the sub-surface environment.",
        "All these changes are devastating to this sub-surface ecosystem that Elliott knows about, just because these organisms are so adapted to a stable environment.",
        "And you also, when we talked about this before the break, is that these caves are vulnerable to vandalism and other people running around in there, right?",
        "Just, I remember years ago, I did a TV show called \"\"Newton's Apple.\"\" We went to a cave in Puerto Rico, and it was very well-kept, and there were thousands of stalactites hanging off the ceiling, and it was only about three feet, the cave, and my head broke one of them.",
        "He said, you just killed 10,000 years.",
        "Right.",
        "And that was I was very upset about that because that took that long for that little stalactite to develop.",
        "Yeah, a lot of times when we talk about managing caves, we really talk about managing people.",
        "About what's going on.",
        "I can't believe that there's that kind of vandalism that you talked about."

        "Trying to control the behavior of the criminal mind when you're not there to watch them is rather difficult.",
        "So some new technology is being looked at, electronic security systems for some of the really high-priority caves.",
        "Yeah, and we have a video on our Web site, and we'll talk about this a little bit later, of how you're trying to close up some of the caves.",
