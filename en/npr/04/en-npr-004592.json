        "Yes, they are amazingly acrobatic.",
        "I mean, they can twist we have found what we call bear beds deep into caves where, for the bear to get there, they had to crawl for thousands of feet and climb 15, 20 feet up a wall, and then they made their winter hibernation spot.",
        "Well, you have never gotten your head in the hole and looked up and have a bear looking back at you, have you?",
        "No, that behavior is pretty well gone from Missouri bears.",
        "Pretty much vanished, and we still see their beds, and that's interesting, bear beds, where they used to hibernate, and sometimes I'll curl up in one just to demonstrate to my classes that bears used to use those.",
        "But we don't have bears currently using caves in Missouri.",
        "They seem to have forgotten them.",
        "One thing that you have in Missouri, and I've seen them all over the country and the world, are bats, right?",
        "There are a lot of bats in caves.",
        "We have many species of bats in Missouri.",
        "About 12 species are usually resident in about half of those used caves at some time or another during the year.",
        "Well, back East, we've been following something called white-nose syndrome, which is killing hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of bats, millions.",
        "Has it been making its way across the country here?",
        "It is moving gradually south and west.",
        "It's gotten into eastern Tennessee this winter.",
        "Your conservation department here, where I work, we are working on a white-nose action plan where we fully expect white-nose syndrome to make its way into Missouri within a year, maybe two or three years.",

        "A lot of cavers are already, in good faith, doing that to prevent accidental spread of the spores, but we know that it also travels with the bats and maybe even on the wind.",
        "And so it may eventually get here, and we'll have a number of strategies in Missouri for trying to reduce the impact.",

        "In the history of St. Louis, I know a lot of companies used caves along the river for things like the Lemp Brewery.",
        "They used them to you know, they stored beer down there to keep it cool, and they actually, I know they hosted parties at an underground theater by their mansion.",
        "And I was just wondering, I know that a lot of people go, you know, spelunking and exploring of caves.",
        "Do people still use them for, I guess, it's what I could call practical purposes, keeping it stored down there.",
        "Scott House?",
        "Yes, one of the I mean, you see a lot of things stored in caves, and of course, with refrigeration and electricity in the Ozarks, that isn't happening as much anymore, but there are still a lot of records of them being used as root cellars, beer caves.",
        "There are still very-large-entrance caves in Missouri that are being used for the storage of agricultural implements, tractors and hay and such.",
        "So caves are still used for a lot of different there's a winery in Missouri that's in a cave.",
        "I was in I saw a cave in Hawaii that was still - had remnants of being a fallout shelter and storing the old stuff in there from the '50s, remember?",
        "Yeah, and that's that was a bad idea.",

        "Is that what they used to think, that it was the curse of the mummies, was histoplasmosis?",
        "Because what they imagined what these caves were cut off from outside air circulation, and that's not true whatsoever, so...",
        "No, they're not immune from the outside, and that's one of the things that we three try to teach is that caves are part of the real world.",
        "They're not some mysterious dimension, divorced from the world, especially in a state like Missouri.",
        "Caves are all around.",
        "They're part of the landscape, and they're intimately tied to everything that's going on.",
        "So if you want to stop the spread of the white-nose syndrome, then you may have to limit people spreading it with their feet, maybe tramping through caves from one to the other.",
        "Yes, there is still the possibility that that occurs.",
        "We think it probably is spread more from bat to bat, especially during the fall swarming, where bats meet up at certain cave entrances, circulate around.",
        "It's sort of like a promenade except on the wing, and they meet the opposite sex and mate and so on, and sometimes you'll have four species of bats co-mingling.",
        "And there are other times at which bats, during hibernation, if they cluster, may accidentally transfer the fungus to each other.",
        "So it's a real problem.",
        "There are researchers working on this problem, and we will also try to control the problem if it reaches here by giving the bats plenty of quiet time.",
        "It has been discovered in Pennsylvania recently that disturbing hibernating bats that have white nose syndrome is very disastrous.",
