        "Yeah.",

        "An easy cave.",
        "Unidentified Woman #1: Yeah.",
        "Without being covered in unctuous clay or any amount of (unintelligible).",
        "And an inch above your head as the ceiling.",
        "Yeah, Scott's got one for us, I think.",
        "My first recommendation would be try out federal agencies and state agencies.",
        "And the Missouri State Park system has several very fine caves that you can tour and get a very educational tour of.",
        "Included in that would Fisher Cave in Meramec State Park, Onondaga Cave in Onondaga Cave State Park, Ozark Caverns of Lake of the Ozarks State Park.",
        "That would be your first stop.",
        "Now, if you wanted a wild cave, my best recommendation would be to get with a caving group, an organized group.",
        "There are several different chapters in the National Speleological Society here in St. Louis.",
        "And they don't do public tours, but if you're really interested in caving, that's an avenue to take."

        "But I would stay with the state parks' caves that are developed for people, because you're doing less damage to the cave when you go into a cave that is developed for the public.",
        "They have walkways that confine you, and you get a good tour.",
        "We're talking about cave this hour on SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR, here at the St. Louis Science Center in St. Louis.",
        "Also, they may be more - less toxic.",
        "I mean, aren't there diseases -histoplasmosis, something like that?",
        "You could really get sick in some of these caves.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Also, it's common in chicken coups and bird aviaries.",
        "But it does not seem to be much of a problem in Missouri, thank goodness.",
        "We do have bat guano here, of course, in gray bat caves, but I have not heard of any outbreaks of histo among Missouri cavers.",
        "Scott, have you heard any?",
        "One from about 40 years ago, yeah.",
        "I don't know.",
        "It's endemic in bird and bat guano.",
        "It's a fungus that - the spores float around in the air you breath, and...",
        "Yeah.",
        "I know somebody who got it, but not in this - not in caves in Missouri.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it can put you in the hospital, all right.",
        "And it's bad stuff.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting, because if you go to your doctor, sometimes they think, well, you have to be in some tropical climate to get this thing.",
        "And they won't treat it, you know.",
        "It's more semi-tropical and tropical in Texas, Mexico.",
        "And cavers in the south are generally very resistant to it because they grew up with it.",
        "But you never develop perfect immunity."

        "Unidentified Female #2 (Audience Member): Hi.",
        "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the cool adaptations that the critters have and if there's one - you know, what's the coolest you've seen, and if there's any, sort of, genetic adaptations that they have that humans might try to use for something else.",
        "Yeah, well, besides losing their eyes in pigment, they have a lot of positive adaptations.",
        "Let's talk about cave fish.",
        "They may have - a lot of the cave animals have elongated appendages.",
        "They have very efficient locomotion.",
        "They can eat almost anything.",
        "They have a longer lifespan, smaller clutch size.",
        "They lay fewer eggs, but the eggs tend to be larger.",
        "With some of the cave fishes that had been studied, say, in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky, they have greater spatial memory.",
        "They can remember where they've been for a long time.",
        "So there's lots of adaptations in the invertebrates like cave crayfish and so on - and beetles, even - that may have extremely long appendages - antennae, legs - to efficiently move over long distances and also to feel the environment.",
        "Some of the cave fishes have - their whole body is covered with vibration detectors, and they can - you can watch them in an aquarium.",
        "They used to keep one at Mammoth Cave.",
        "I don't know if - anymore.",
        "No. They don't.",
        "But you could watch it approach the wall of the aquarium and then stop and turn.",
        "It knew where that was just from the pressure waves.",
        "So should people be fearful of what they're going to find, if they're going to find...",
        "No.",
        "There's really very few things in caves that are that harmful.",
        "People imagine snakes.",
        "They're usually only at the entrance zone because, snakes being cold-blooded, really don't like the cool environment in caves and they're not well adapted for that.",
        "Occasionally, we'll see a black rat snake in Missouri, grabbing bats at the cave entrance, getting a meal.",
        "But, generally, there's not much of anything dangerous.",
        "We have seen raccoons, far end of the dark zone of caves, even as far as two miles, have been in a cave..."

        "Within a week of my article having been published in the New York Times, the White House and their allies and the right-wing echo chamber launched this campaign of character assassination and disinformation.",

        "Otherwise they were they were, as somebody said, going to roll the earth-movers over me.",
        "And the - one of the pieces of confusion that I think many people had is whether - well, we heard you worked for the CIA, but doing exactly what - well, we didn't know.",
        "And then a lot of people said, well, you know, she just was - worked in the offices at the CIA.",
        "Or that I was not covert.",
        "That is part of the whole scheme to - by denigrating me and by making it seem as though, oh, you're just really, you're just making a mountain out of a molehill, it's just so silly what you - then, of course, anything to discredit Joe's report, that this - if this had proven true about the sale of yellowcake uranium to Iraq, it would have been significant.",
        "But the fact was, when I was -when my covert identity was betrayed, I was in fact covert.",
        "But you don't need to take my word for it.",
        "You can take the former DCI, General Michael Hayden, who testified such before Congress.",
        "So there's no question.",
        "And while Ambassador Wilson was talking about one specific piece of evidence, the - which the president - President Bush cited in the State of the Union message, you were investigating the existence or lack of existence of the Iraqi nuclear weapons program."
