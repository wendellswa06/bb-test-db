        "inspectors were tossed out of the country.",
        "We certainly did not have an embassy there, so coming by real intelligence was very difficult.",
        "So in this run-up to the war, what we were doing was racing and trying our damndest to figure out what the hell is going on.",
        "And this, of course, in the context of also back in 1991, during the first war, it turned out that Iraq had a robust nuclear weapons program, which we didn't know about.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And there's a scene in the movie about just that.",
        "And what - are you willing to take that one percent chance as, you know, in a great scene played by an actor who does Scooter Libby.",

        "I was curious because I did follow the story a couple of years ago.",
        "And I wondered if anybody else has received any kind of punishment for their role in this, because I was in the military for a number of years.",
        "And I'm just horrified by, you know, the lack of ethics here.",
        "And I just wondered if anything else has happened.",
        "We should mention, Scooter Libby, the former chief of staff to the vice president, was convicted.",
        "His sentence was later commuted.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Right.",
        "He was not pardoned, but he did not do any jail time.",
        "Well, he was - he was convicted on four counts of perjury, lying to federal officials, and most importantly, obstruction of justice.",
        "And the whole conviction on the obstruction of justice, as the prosecutor made very clear, was based on his inability to find out who headed up this conspiracy, because Scooter was going to take the rap and did take the rap for everybody else.",
        "His sentence was later commuted but he was not pardoned.",
        "Right.",
        "But I'm just wondering, you know, I'm pretty sure he didn't do this all alone.",
        "No.",
        "There were two other leakers, one was Rich Armitage, who was deputy secretary of state, and the other one was Karl Rove.",
        "Karl Rove has gone on to essentially institutionalize and incorporate fear and smear as a campaign tactic and strategy.",
        "Right, I know.",

        "It's a question that we wanted to ask you at some point, Mrs. Plame, or either of you.",
        "When - when one reflects on what your mission was, which was to try to coordinate information that was coming in on the overt and covert operations by people who would like to get a hold of nuclear materials, do you think that mission was injured, damaged or in any way was disadvantaged by the campaign that was made against your family?",
        "(Singing) (Foreign language spoken)",
        "Well, the fact that my identity was betrayed meant I could no longer continue in the position for which I'd been highly trained.",
        "And I was working indeed, I was working on these issues of nuclear proliferation.",
        "And that's why what happened was so insidious, because, you know, it's not just me and my career, that's one thing, but it deeply affects the network of assets with whom I had worked with, it places them in jeopardy, not to mention the ripple effect of, you know, future sources of critical information on this very - of the most vital quality.",
        "And they may say, wait a minute, if this happened - they couldn't even protect one of their own, why should I put my family in jeopardy and cooperate with U.S.",
        "intelligence?",
        "There is a - you are still prohibited by law from disclosing a lot of things that you were working on, almost everything you were working on.",

        "So I will not ask you to confirm or deny that, in fact, what it looks like is you were looking into the A.Q.",
        "Khan network, which was the Pakistani scientist who provided materials and information to North Korea, to Iran and to Libya as well - not, interestingly, to Iraq, at least so far as I know - you might know better.",
        "Well, A.Q.",
        "Khan was certainly sort of a one-man entrepreneurial salesman in all the nuclear widgets.",
        "And it was because of the people that I was working with in the counter-proliferation division, they brought down that - most of that network in December 2003, and Libya essentially threw up their hands and said uncle, and they gave up their nuclear ambitions.",
        "Well, perhaps in the next telling of this story we'll find out how the - when we discover how to disarm ourselves of nuclear weapons, perhaps we can tell more about what this - the implications of this story are."
