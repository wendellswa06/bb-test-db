        "Let's define that for the audience and talk about how effective and perhaps controversial it is.",
        "Well, ABC stands for an approach to prevention, which is abstain, be faithful to an HIV uninfected partner, and correct and consistent condom use; and you need all three components.",

        "They're reducing the number of their partners.",
        "People who were sexually active are becoming abstinent.",

        "You know, we wouldn't take credit for what's happened in Kenya or Uganda either.",
        "These were the Ugandans and Kenyans, and this process began before the president announced his emergency plan.",
        "It's because of the efforts to instill the behavior change ABC.",
        "I would point out, I was just in Zimbabwe, and in fact, the United States is contributing significantly to their struggle with over $20 million a year, not at level of the focus countries where, for example, in South Africa, we're at $220 million a year, but pretty significant amount nonetheless.",
        "But again, Ed, we're not taking credit for the change.",
        "All I'm saying is that the data is crystal clear that it's ABC together in what's called a generalized epidemic that will be effective."
