        "It didn't actually start out that way when we started writing the book, but we heard about how many people were seeing our gorilla experiment in all kinds of different contexts and it being used to make all kinds of different points.",
        "We gradually came to the understanding ourselves, that the fact that people think they're going to see the gorilla, but they really don't, or they think they're going to see changes to people they're talking to, but they really don't remember them, is examples of a class of intuitions we have about our own minds that are sort of predictably wrong."

        "One of the stories they describe in the book is a rape victim who was studying her rapist's face for the precise purpose of describing it to the police later and turned out to give utterly convincing testimony that convicted a man who didn't do it.",
        "However, the world we live in today, is a lot different from the one that our minds evolved in.",
        "For one thing, things move much faster than they used to.",
        "When our visual systems evolved, and when our capacities for attention evolved, we didn't move at 60 miles per hour down highways - so we didn't really need to be able to notice a lot of unexpected things coming at us at high speeds.",
        "That's not true anymore.",
        "Likewise, our facilities - our faculties for making decisions, we're able to sort of rely on anecdotes and stories when that was the only information that was available to us.",
        "Now we have statistical studies and databases and all kinds of other information that we're not quite as good at making sense of and using as a guide to our decisions.",

        "For many sorts of situations, yeah.",
        "If you're making a complex decision about what stock to invest in or what car to buy, you're often going to be better off weighing all of the factors that matter, looking at Consumer Reports, for example, and looking at statistics - than in trusting your uncle Louie's recommendation.",
        "That said, intuition's great for judgments that really don't lend themselves to that sort of analytic approach.",
        "So, for example, what kind of ice cream you like the most or who you find the most attractive.",
        "For those, no amount of deliberate analysis is really going to help much.",
