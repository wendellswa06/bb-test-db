        "And it's interesting that it's not merely the untrained observers that you tested on these, this attention.",
        "And this is only one of the tricks of intuition that you're talking about in the book - but the airline pilot experiment, where these were pilots being studied as they looked at the heads-up display as that was being introduced to commercial airliners some years ago.",
        "And they were doing simulated landings on airfields and looking through the glass as opposed to glancing down at their instruments, and then every once in a while, the testers would put another airplane on the ground, right in their way, and they didn't see it.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "There was a nice study by Richard Hanes(ph), and it's been followed up over the years by people like Chris Wickens(ph) -doing exactly that.",
        "You're in a flight simulator.",
        "These are commercial pilots, so pilots with often more than 1,000 hours of commercial flight experience, and in order to become a commercial pilot, they have to have had a lot of experience to begin with.",
        "And in this sort of a flight simulator, if something unexpected happens, people often don't notice it.",
        "And you might think that this is a really rare event, and fortunately it actually is a pretty rare event, but this sort of example of an accident, an airline problem known as a runway incursion - a plane is on a runway where it doesn't belong - is actually the most common kind of dangerous situation in airplanes.",
        "Mid-air collisions are extraordinarily rare.",
        "Collisions on the ground are extremely rare, but not as rare.",
        "They're the most common.",
        "And sadly, one in the Canary Islands was the worst aviation accident ever, when two 747s collided.",
        "Here's an email we have from Joe(ph): My brother, to this day, swears up and down, he remembers me having chicken pox when I was a baby.",

        "The only problem, this happened about a year before he was born.",
        "But beside my mother repeatedly telling him that he wasn't even alive for this, he still thinks he remembers it.",
        "That's an excellent example of what cognitive psychologists call a source memory problem.",
        "So here the case is that you have a memory of the chicken box and the oatmeal bath - which sounds tasty - and you don't record correctly where this memory came from."

        "You think it came from your own experience, and you witnessed it with your own eyes, when in fact you heard it from someone else.",
        "And what we talk about a little bit in the book is this notion of the illusion of memory - that we think when we retrieve a vivid memory like that, and I'm sure that the listeners, you know, feels like it's very vivid and has a lot of detail to it and so on - but we sort of intuitively think when we retrieve something like that that it has to be accurate.",
        "Where could all those details have come from, except for a true and accurate recording that was made at the time, sort of like if we pointed a video camera at that event and recorded it.",
        "It turns our memory doesn't work that way.",
        "We can take details from lots of sources, information from lots of sources, and construct a memory out of them.",
        "And once we've retrieved it a few times and told the story, and here's one more time, he just told it to you, it's going to get stronger and stronger as a memory.",

        "And one of the things that I was hoping maybe your guest could comment on, is the way we're wired, our brain likes to fill in the blanks.",
        "So, even though we may not have witnessed something in an event, we - when we're recalling it, or depending on how we're questioned about it - we have a tendency to fill in, you know, things that maybe were just really suggestible.",
        "And one of the reasons why eyewitness testimony can be so hard to, say, you know, is it 100 percent accurate.",
        "Well...",
        "Right.",
        "This is a famous case, now-famous case, I suppose, of Jennifer Thompson in North Carolina who was a rape victim.",
        "Her case is unusual for a number of reasons, one of them that she had the presence of mind during the attack to think about what happens if I escape, and the police need to catch this guy?",
        "I'm going to try to memorize his face and all the details of it as well as I can so that I can give them that information and they can track him down.",
        "And she did exactly that, and they did a little bit of investigation and brought in a suspect, and she picked him in a lineup and so on.",
        "It went all the way to trial.",
        "She very confidently testified on the witness stand that he was her attacker, and he was sent to prison.",
        "Only about 10 years later did DNA evidence conclusively exonerate him and show that it was someone else."
