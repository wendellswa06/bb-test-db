        "Is there something that could be overdeveloped or underdeveloped in the brain?",

        "We only rarely find out that our memories are actually false.",

        "Having a brother-in-law who's a psychiatrist who didn't trust repressed memories and having a lot of friends going through the repressed memories being brought up in the '90s, I decided to see what it was like with my own mind.",
        "I decided to plant memories deliberately, just to see if they felt real.",
        "And it was bizarre.",
        "After just a few days they felt just like I had been there, even though I knew I was doing it to myself.",
        "This was the situation where children were recalling pretty much sexual abuse when they were at various daycare centers, and they were telling psychiatrists about this, and afterwards there was a lot of concern about what they felt might have been prompting, and the children might not have experienced this, were just telling the psychiatrist what they thought the psychiatrist wanted to hear.",
        "But your experiment in planting, what kinds of memories did you plant in your own mind?",
        "It would be just something simple like an event with friends, sitting by a pool or something like that.",
        "And a couple of days later, even though you knew you'd planted it, it started to feel real.",
        "Exactly, yes.",
        "It was a very deliberate experiment, and it's really scary because, yeah, I hadn't trusted what a lot of friends were coming up with their repressed memories anyway.",
        "They just didn't feel right."

        "Sure.",
        "I haven't heard of people actually being able to successfully do it to themselves, but there's actually an extensive body of research.",
        "Probably the best-known person doing that is Beth Loftis(ph), and in her work she'll suggest something that might not have actually happened, and if you do it over and over again and ask people to kind of recall it as if it had happened, they gradually start to incorporate it into their own memories.",
        "And there have been a number of great examples.",
        "The most recent one that I like a lot is giving people the suggestion that they went on a hot air balloon ride as a kid.",
        "And they make it even more vivid by doctoring a photograph, in which they insert the subject in the study as a child in a hot air balloon ride and ask them to recall it.",
        "And over time people start to incorporate it and actually have more vivid memories.",
        "They recall details that weren't part of the photograph because they make them consistent with what would have happened.",

        "Oh, this is Chris, actually.",
        "I was going to say one thing our minds do seem to strive for is consistency.",
        "So one way that memories often change is to sort of make the whole story more consistent and sometimes also to make ourselves more at the center of the action: It happened to me instead of happening to somebody else.",

        "And at first it used to infuriate me, but now that we're having this discussion, I wonder if there are types of people, like physiologically, who are more susceptible to taking on other people's memories.",
        "Got any suggestions for that?",
        "Well, there are a number of studies that look at suggestibility.",
        "I don't particularly know differences in personality that would lead some people to be suggestible than others.",
        "There's some evidence that young children can be particularly susceptible, which is partly why I think a lot of the repressed memory debate happened in the '90s, that many of those cases where children who were given leading questions and leading suggestions and very quickly incorporated those into whatever they were reporting; whether or not they incorporated them into their memories is hard to say.",
        "But at least what they were telling people happened - they took on the suggestions that they were being given.",
        "But everybody is subject to this to some degree.",
        "That's what the instructions of the polls seem to be.",
        "That's the whole thing.",
        "Well, I would say that this actually a general process that happens to everybody, and we don't realize that it's happening.",
        "So we tend to think that memory works like a video camera, that we record everything in perfect detail and that our memory when we're recalling something is the same as playing it back from a tape.",
        "So what we're seeing is accurate and vivid.",
        "So it must be real.",
        "And that's an illusion.",
        "It's not actually that detailed.",
        "We're reconstructing our memories based on what makes sense, what's consistent, what's coherent, what sorts of things we kind of would like to remember in that context.",
        "And our memories aren't a vivid record in absolute precision.",
        "So just because we recall something vividly doesn't necessarily mean that it's any more accurate than something that we recall in a more sparse way."

        "So I wouldn't be surprised if sleep and dreams were related somehow to that.",
        "I would like to say one other thing, which is something you said very early in the call, was that you used to get infuriated when you heard these kinds of things, and now you don't.",
        "That's kind of one of the messages we have in our book, is that when you're upset at the way someone else is behaving or when you notice something like this in your own behavior, it's best to first think that maybe it's some normal process of how the human mind works rather than deliberate lying and so on.",
        "If people had thought that when Hillary Clinton said that she was under sniper fire in Bosnia rather than thinking oh, that must mean she's a liar, her campaign might have gone differently a couple of years ago.",
