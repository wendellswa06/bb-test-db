        "Okay.",
        "Thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Let's see if we can go next to Cleveland, and this is Andrew on the line.",
        "Hi, Neal.",
        "Thanks for taking the call.",
        "I heard a very interesting bit of popular culture use of altering perception.",
        "It was an interview with James Cameron about his filmmaking process around about the time \"\"Avatar\"\" came out.",
        "And he said that he does a lot of his editing himself.",
        "So after finishing an editing sequence, in order to see the film as the average moviegoer will see it, he will sit down for - and watch the entire film, start to finish, in what he called a flop screen in which he takes the film that would have been left to right and flips the entire image of the film so he's watching it right to left.",
        "And what that does is it allows him to see the action sequences and the whole film basically with virgin eyes because he hasn't been watching it that - he's seeing like the mirror image of it and it tricks his brain into watching all those sequences come together for the first time.",
        "That's the way, of course, they got Gary Cooper as Babe Ruth to bat from the other side of the plate, as a left-hander.",
        "So anyway, that's an old story.",
        "But this is the continuity problem and, indeed, one of the things you guys write about is the fact that most of us don't notice the continuity problems.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "So we feel like we do notice movies - movie mistakes, so I often would tell people who come into the lab when we're doing studies of motion picture perception and they would tell me, oh, I always notice errors in movies.",
        "And I can guarantee you that they don't because then they'd sit down and watch one of the videos that I or my colleagues and I made and not notice any of the changes.",
        "The key is that we think we notice all the changes because we're only aware of the ones we've noticed.",
        "And we, of course, haven't noticed the ones that we missed.",
        "It's only when somebody calls attention to them that you can go in and spot them.",
        "But most of the time, we don't notice errors in movies.",
        "And, in fact, even the people who are on set and responsible for catching these sorts of mistakes, the script continuity or script supervisor...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...what difference between them and the rest of us, for the most part, is that their intuitions are better.",
        "They know that they don't notice everything, so they focus attention on the things that actually matter in the scene, the things that people are likely to notice, and they take copious notes and use videos of the scenes to try and match things up.",
        "But..."

        "Exactly.",

        "It's not going to be a precise record of what happened.",
        "You can't rely on it in the same way that you think you can.",
        "And my memory was clearly fallible.",
        "It was Gary Cooper who played Lou Gehrig in \"\"Pride of the Yankees,\"\" not Babe Ruth.",
        "Anyway, both left-handed hitters.",
        "Andrew, thanks very much for the call.",
        "We're talking with Dan Simons and Christopher Chabris about their book, \"\"The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions Deceive Us.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And one of our intuitions is, indeed, that we do try - our minds do try to make sense of things so that if A - if B follows A, then clearly A had something to do with B.",
        "You call that the narrative fallacy.",
        "I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear...",
        "Yeah.",
        "We also call it the illusion of cause, the idea being that we see things as causally related, one thing causing the other when we see them go together.",
        "And one of the ways things go together commonly is in sequence.",
        "One thing happens before another.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And storytellers exploit this quite nicely by stringing together a series of facts and leading the reader to automatically infer that they're happening in some causal sequence, that they happen for a reason and filling in the blanks, in fact, between them to make up a coherent story.",
        "Those things are very powerful and they stick in our memory much better than let's say statistics or other kinds of information that people use to persuade, which don't really work nearly as well as stories, especially stories with emotional content."

        "Yeah, that's right.",
        "And in some ways it's an effective way to communicate.",
        "We communicate by remembering and telling stories.",
        "That's what the visual system and what our memory systems are designed to do, is make sense of what's happening around us, make it all meaningful, extract what's important around us and to make it coherent.",
        "And stories have that effect, particularly if they have a causal relationship.",
        "If they have one factor causing another, that's something that we can - kind of allows us to consolidate two facts into one.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And it makes it a really powerful way of telling stories.",
        "If instead of telling stories you just listed all the facts, it wouldn't be terribly interesting.",

        "I've got a question about - I do sports betting from time to time.",
        "And I've noticed that in the past that if I have an emotional attachment to the team, regardless of how much I feel, the - you know, the opposing team is going to win, I will still bet for the team that I like.",
        "And I was wondering if the emotional attachment - is that normal for it to outweigh the rational thought?",
        "Hmm.",

        "I think it's - as far as I know, it's entirely normal, and that's one of the problems in making good decisions, is separating out emotional tendencies and other sort of impulses, intuitive feelings we obvious - we automatically have about the situation or the gamble we're about to take from logical analysis.",
        "And this is one thing when you're betting, you know, in a football pool or something like that.",
        "It's quite another thing when you're making million or billion dollar investments as a money manager, a hedge fund manager and so on.",
        "Then you really want to try to separate those things out and not rely on intuition as much and rely more on logical analysis and whatever solid information you can get.",
        "And professionals ought to be able to do that.",
        "And Professor, you examined a couple of different games, Dan Simons, chess and indeed poker.",
        "There's a poker aphorism: think long, think wrong.",
        "You suggest maybe people ought to take as much time as they can get.",
        "Well, certainly for things like chess and poker, that makes a lot of sense.",
        "So a grandmaster chess player, somebody who's a true expert chess player, will be able to come up with very good decisions very quickly.",
        "But that's partly because through the amount of practice they've had, they've made - those intuitive judgments have become, or those deliberative judgments have become automatic so that what looks like a gut instinct to you or me is actually the result of automating a lot of deliberate careful thinking and recognizing patterns that have occurred over and over and over again that they had thought about over and over again.",
        "But I would trust a grandmaster's intuition about what to play in a chess position much more than my own.",
