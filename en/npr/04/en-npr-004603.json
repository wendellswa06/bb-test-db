        "He plays the villain with the ridiculous haircut and has many of the best lines and scenes.",
        "And Josh Brolin really has to be the sort of human anchor of the picture.",

        "And that, you know, the fact actually that the line of attack that's being used against her is this activist label I think suggests that it's really just sort of an all purpose term of abuse.",
        "Does the term judicial activism have a concrete meaning?",
        "Give us a bit of its history.",
        "The term itself, I think, comes into use about 60 years ago, but the basic idea has been around for a lot longer.",
        "And the basic idea is a judge who's an activist is making decisions not based on the law but based on what that judge thinks is good policy.",
        "So, when the Supreme Court in the early 20th Century was striking down progressive laws, President Theodore Roosevelt criticized judges for legislating from the benches, when the Supreme Court was fighting back against Franklin Roosevelt's new deal in the 1930s, he said the same sort of things.",
        "In fact, you know, you could go back to Abraham Lincoln who thought the Supreme Court was pro-slavery and criticized those judges for making policy.",
        "What about the Warren Court?",
        "I mean, many people think about that period from the early 1950s until the late '60s when Earl Warren was the chief justice as being the time of the most dramatic expanse of judicial power when it came to civil rights.",
        "Well, I think the reason that the word activism is used so much nowadays is because most people's understanding of the Supreme Court is really still shaped by the Warren Court."

        "Well to the extent that the term activism has any useful meaning, I think we would say it's, how often does a judge vote to strike down a state or a federal law?",
