        "Thank you and I'm glad to hear that.",
        "I do think, in all modesty, that's one of my better stories and it certainly was a heartfelt story from my standpoint.",
        "I wrote it years after the events and in confirmation class that inspired it, but they remained pretty vivid with me and yeah, I put a lot of myself into that story and the New Yorker took it.",
        "It's slightly cut, actually, in the New Yorker because I had much more about the parents quarreling in it.",
        "The New Yorker didn't like too much quarreling.",
        "I don't know what version you read but the version in the book \"\"Pigeon Feathers\"\" is the one that I'd like you to read.",
        "Excellent.",
        "Excellent.",
        "Thanks for the call, David.",
        "We have a question from the audience here in the Newseum.",
        "Hi, Mr. Updike.",
        "This is somewhat along the lines of both religion and witchcraft.",
        "Back in the '50s, you wrote another story, perhaps a favorite, called \"\"The Christian Roommates\"\" about some of your real roommates at Harvard.",
        "And one of them had a nervous breakdown in the story and we know that madness and witchcraft have long been associated and I just wanted to let you know that he grew up and became my high school English teacher.",
        "He converted to Judaism but he's now teaching at a Catholic college.",
        "So I would hope that you would write a follow up on his story, too.",
        "It is Reghenaford.",
        "OK.",
        "I'm glad he recognized himself without pain and survived it.",
        "I had a fairly colorful set of roommates and housemates when I was in college, and I did write, as you say, about a lot of variety.",
        "And meeting religious questions is something you do in your late teens or college years, I think, often and certainly Reg took his introduction to (unintelligible) quite hard.",
        "And we all have.",
        "He's not an easy man to meet, you can say.",
        "That is also a unique story in my work.",
        "And that, although, I attended Harvard for four years and it was a very formative experience for me and not an unpleasant experience.",
        "I've only written one story and that's the one, \"\"The Christian Roommates.",
        "Thanks for the question.",
        "Let's see if we can get, this is Michael.",
        "Michael is on the line with us from Moke Hill in California.",
        "Good afternoon.",
        "Mr. Updike, my basic question is are you a happy person or a happy man?",
        "The reason I asked is so many times you read about famous authors like yourself who are quality crafters of stories, but you'd find out in their autobiography, these are really miserable people and their writings didn't show that.",
        "They really put on remarkable stories that intertwined the male-female relationship.",
        "And the other part of my question is this criticism, I find it as kind of a double-standard where men write about women, and they are criticized for it.",
        "Whereas women write about men and they are not criticized for it.",
        "I wondered if you'd like to touch on that.",
        "Yeah, beginning with the second one.",
        "Yeah, I think it's a double standard, all right.",
        "But something political happens when a man tries to act or be or imitate a woman that doesn't happen when a woman crosses over and tries to do a man's point of view.",
        "The British women who I think aren't as afraid of being manly seemed the better.",
        "Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark both write about male characters and always very convincingly to me.",
        "I have no trouble with it and as I say, I think a novelist, fiction writer on any sort, has to attempt to cross across the gender line above all.",
        "As to my happiness, I think of myself as quite a fortunate and happy person.",
        "I was a happy child, my mother tells me.",
        "And I'm glad to be able to be a writer, it's what I wanted to be, some kind of an artist as a child and I have become that.",
        "I've actually done better than he thought possible.",
        "I love life.",
        "I love being alive.",
        "I love being an American.",
        "So all these things are I think would make me a happy person.",
        "I'm not happy about the fact that I'm going - that I'm aging and getting older and losing my fastball.",
        "And going on the dye before too - too very long.",
        "So - but, if you love life I think you have to reconcile yourself to the - to the darker side of being a mortal creature."

        "We are big but provincial and always have been provincial.",
        "We were isolated here more or less, oceans on either side of us and much of the charm of American literature is it's provincial quirky, cranky qualities.",
        "It's not like European literature.",
        "European literature in general if you can make a generalization is about society.",
        "People reacting, interacting in the society, we tend to write about loners or couples like Huckleberry Finn and Jim are going down on a - in the Mississippi, write about people looking, trying to find a white whale that infuriates them and is dangerous and - so yes.",
        "The kind of quest that is an American quest is not quite the European one.",
        "I rather doubt that having more translated and would enable us to participate in the dialog that he mentioned, I don't know quite what goes on in that dialog.",
        "I think that people who care can certainly read enough translation.",
        "They also can learn the language in which the book is written if they - I do not end.",

        "Well, this was theoretically.",
        "Yes.",
        "And if somebody put this in the context of the comment that there are no American writers worthy of the Nobel Prize writer's day and so, some of us might be able to think of somebody in this room who might be worthy of such an honor but yourself excepted.",
        "Might you think of others - Americans who might want to be considered for a visit to Scandinavia?",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And it seemed like all the books that came out in the 60s and all that were trying to bust the envelope.",
        "And my question is for you is, at this stage in your game, are the envelopes to push open anymore?",

        "Rabbit Run\"\" was an attempt to slightly push the envelope of sexual explicitness to sexual realism really because I - although sex had been described in this and that work of arts, choice, others, Andy Miller, to innovate it with the normal flow of middle class experience, it really describe what happens, this strange dream like a thing we do seemed to me to be worthy enterprise and one that hadn't quite been carried out before.",

        "But since the start of the Democratic Convention in August and ever since, we've been asking any number or politicians, writers, thinkers about this particular moment in the history of this country as we face an election now six days away and I wanted to think, ask you briefly to step back from, you know, partisan politics and just to comment if you would on what you think is at stake at this - in This American Moment if you will.",
        "I think it's an interesting election, and I will keep my partisan feelings out of it although they may peek through and that we have no present incumbent running and so we have in a way a clean slate and we're more conscious than usual I think, of the choices as far as approach, style, doctrine go.",
        "It certainly looks like an election that a lot of people are going to vote in and that's a good thing in the democracy.",
        "America notoriously has been one of the poorest voting turnouts of any industrialized country, and I think it'll be a good turnout for this year.",

        "It hasn't been so many years ago, that would have been unheard of and now it is not only heard of, but it's happening.",

        "But what we've seen from the generals this week is generals coming out, many of them retired, who--you know, it's striking, Madeleine--are accusing Rumsfeld of arrogance, imperiousness, not listening, not putting enough soldiers in place to get the job done, impacting the current nature of the Army because of lower reenlistment recruitment rates.",
        "But nonetheless, what you hear from the White House is they're sticking by their man, Donald Rumsfeld.",

        "What you have is a situation where, you know, Scooter Libby--I guess it was late last week--his defense team was--you know, the release of information came from the special prosecutor that Libby had said that the president, President Bush, through Vice President Cheney, had authorized him to discuss the National Intelligence Estimate with a reporter for the New York Times as part of an effort to let Americans know that there was justification for going to war in Iraq and not--as the former ambassador Joe Wilson had said--that there was no evidence that Iraq was seeking to obtain uranium from Niger in Africa.",
        "And then subsequent to that, there's been now a correction issued by the special prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, that the Libby defense team leapt upon to the point of releasing it to reporters before they sent it to the court, which angered the judge in the case, Reggie Walton.",
        "But that report said that the special prosecutor had erred by saying that a key judgment--that Libby had be cleared to convey a key judgment to the reporter.",
        "To the contrary, they said it wasn't a key judgment.",
        "It was just something--additional information in passing that there were questions about Saddam Hussein truly going after, aggressively, uranium from Niger.",
