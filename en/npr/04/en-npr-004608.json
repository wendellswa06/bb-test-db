        "In fact, about 30 percent of those who could sign up don't, and that, says economist Sarah Holden, is why employers are switching to automatic enrollment.",
        "Automatic enrollment changes the participation decision from opting in to opting out.",
        "And so it's a really great thing because it makes the decision--if someone does nothing, they end up saving for retirement rather than not saving.",

        "Many said they couldn't afford to save right now; others said they were saving in other ways; still others said the enrollment process and the selection of investment options was simply too complex and confusing.",
        "Again, Sarah Holden.",

        "And how those portfolios are managed is also changing.",
        "Historically, fund managers have invested 401(k) money very conservatively, in money market accounts or balanced fund accounts.",
        "Now, says Lori Lucas, a majority of large firms are offering so-called `life-cycle funds,' which are pegged to a retirement date and morph over time."
