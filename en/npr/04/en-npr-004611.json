        "But the real - the much more common story for women gaming is when they go online and experience it privately.",
        "There is a really interesting blog called Fat, Ugly or Slutty, which women gamers have put together themselves to - where every time they receive a threatening message or a come on, they record it either in audio, or they screen-shot the message, and they put it all on this blog to catalog the kinds of regular kind of micro aggressions that accumulate for women gamers that lead some to stop gaming altogether.",
        "And was this the Kickstarter project?",
        "O'LEARY: Well, that's a separate incident, and this is the one that got the most attention.",
        "So a woman - a feminist media critic, Anita Sarkeesian, she launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise $6,000 for a series of videos that would explore how women are portrayed in video games.",
        "Immediately, though, she received a torrent of hate-filled messages on her Facebook page, on her YouTube page, and it got pretty aggressive.",
        "And what was so unusual about Anita was she took the step of documenting this harassment, recording it and putting it back online, which did two things.",
        "One, her supporters ended up raising - donating more than $150,000 beyond what she asked for to support her when she faced this harassment, but then another wave of really aggressive, you know, violent personal threats, her accounts attempted to be hacked.",
        "And one man in Ontario took the step of making an online video game where you could punch Anita's image on the screen.",
        "And if you punched it multiple times, bruises and cuts would appear on her image.",
        "And that's a pretty shocking thing for people to see, that that's the level of kind of hatred and response that's out there."
