        "Are there any tools that are being built into these games so that women can report abuse or anyone who feels that they're being abused online?",
        "And what happens if somebody is reported?",
        "But, you know, it's - everyone who is talking about solutions really believes that solutions are going to come two places: one, the community of gamers who need to stand up against harassing or intolerant behavior, and two, the companies whose job is more provide the tools so the vast communities can police themselves than it is for them to police it on their own.",

        "They feel like they hit this report button, and it's just there to make them feel better and not really to do anything.",
        "But I talk to a man named Stephen Toulouse, who was the former head of enforcement at Microsoft for Xbox LIVE, which is the biggest online gaming community, and he said that that report button really does a make difference.",
        "And so first of all, gamers should understand the tools they have to control their experience.",

        "But right now, you're seeing yet another call from people in the industry who are looking for gaming companies to do more.",
        "They want to see a couple of different changes, and one of those would include automatically muting offenders.",
        "So let's say out of the, you know, one player gets muted on voice chat more than 10 percent above the norm, these advocates would like to see the gaming companies start that player off muted.",
        "That they don't actually get a megaphone to broadcast their hate speech and that only people who are friends with them can hear what they have to say.",
        "So that's one idea.",
        "There are few others, but they basically are trying - the advocates behind additional change want to see more limits on messaging and that people have to earn the right to send messages or use the chat features, and then to see more kind of peer pressure to almost give groups of gamers scores that will reflect, you know, how comfortable and kind of safe and supportive their group of players is.",
