        "The Irish market began to decline, really, middle of last year, and prices have fallen by at least 10 percent - if not 15 percent, particularly in Dublin and surrounding areas.",
        "And again, it was caused because prices got too far ahead of themselves, there was a speculative bubble, and the market slowed.",
        "And there's been an awful lot of construction in Ireland.",

        "They certainly have fallen by about 10 percent already.",
        "Most people expect them to fall another 10 percent at least over the next 12 months.",
        "I wouldn't be totally surprised if it wasn't closer to 20 percent.",

        "What can you tell us about how the attacks were carried out?",
        "Well, it seems that soon after the first class of graduates from this Pentagon training program for Syrian insurgents returned back into Syria, they came under attack by a group of Nusra Front fighters who first on Thursday captured their leader and several other fighters.",
        "And then on Friday, they attacked them with what were said to be about 50 fighters using heavy and medium-grade weapons.",
        "Does this call into question how well these fighters were trained?",
