        "Laura Washington is a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times and political analyst for ABC7 in Chicago.",
        "She says Emanuel either doesn't know Chicago or he's supremely cynical.",
        "It's very hard to believe that someone as smart and as accomplished and as experienced as he is is just waking up to the fact that we have a thin blue line in this city, that he's just waking up to the fact that we have police brutality, that he's just waking up to the fact that we have a lot of problems with police misconduct.",
        "But that's what he wants you to believe.",
        "Still, Washington and many others in Chicago doubt Emanuel will ever resign.",
        "She says the movement to oust him isn't well organized nor speaking with one voice.",
        "The effort to pass a recall bill isn't expected to go far, and Emanuel still has most of the city's big money movers and shakers in his corner with three and a half years left in his term in office.",
        "For his part, Emanuel says he's ignoring the political machinations around it.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "This is a time for real solutions to a real challenge.",
        "My focus is on the challenges ahead of the city of Chicago, building a stronger future.",
        "I'll leave other people to do what they want to do.",
        "Oh, Nuha.",
        "This is Nuha?",
        "OK.",
        "Hi.",
        "This is Nuha.",
        "Over the past week, Emanuel has kept a low public profile but has been meeting with police officers and districts on the south and west sides and with ministers, community leaders and some younger activists in an effort to smooth community, police, City Hall relations.",

        "The Los Angeles Film Festival is in full swing in Culver City, Calif.",
        "For more than 20 years, the festival has highlighted independent films.",
        "And it's known for fostering diversity in the film industry.",
        "Nearly half the movies at this year's festival are directed by women or by people of color.",
        "To hear more, we called Los Angeles film critic Carla Renata, and I asked her to tell me about Stephanie Allain, the first woman of color to direct the festival.",
        "Stephanie Allain is an amazing woman of color.",
        "She was a studio executive.",
        "She's worked for such studios as Columbia, where she was a senior vice president of production there, Fox, Warner Bros., the list goes on.",
        "But Stephanie brings to the festival the fact that she is very passionate about bringing all types of groups of people together.",
        "As a matter of fact, at the festival this year, the film is opening with a Latino film.",
        "It opened with a film called \"\"Lowriders,\"\" starring Eva Longoria from - everybody knows her from \"\"Desperate Housewives\"\" and..."

        "Tell us a little bit more about the film you mentioned, \"\"Lowriders,\"\" which opened the festival with a very mainstream, well-known star, Eva Longoria.",
        "What's the story there?",
        "The story is about the East LA culture, which deals with lowriders, and the fact that lowriders is not just a car.",
        "It's a culture, it's family, it's tradition.",
        "And \"\"Lowriders\"\" deals with a particular family, their relationships.",
        "It's just a wonderful, wonderful film.",
        "I've got to ask, you know, as you make your way around the festival and talk to people, how the conversation about diversity is playing out because this is one that's played out in mainstream Hollywood, of course, when we all followed the controversy at the Oscars, the hashtag #oscarssowhite.",
        "So how is that conversation playing out at the LA festival this week?",
        "It's interesting you brought that up.",
        "Last night, I attended a panel moderated by Stephanie Allain, the festival's director, with Nate Parker, the director, writer, star of \"\"Birth Of A Nation,\"\" which is due to come out on October 7.",
        "And someone brought that subject up to him.",
        "And people are really kind of talking about the diversity thing right now, this week in particular because \"\"Roots\"\" was on television this week.",
        "We've got WGN's \"\"Underground\"\" on TV.",
        "There's, like, five or six slavery movies coming out in this year alone, and people are just like, really?",
        "Enough.",
        "Help me understand what you're saying.",
        "Are you saying that people would like to see people of color represented on screen, but it doesn't always have to be about slavery?",
        "It can just be about people living their life today as it's unfolding?",
        "Yes and no. And I can only speak for myself.",
        "I can't speak for the masses.",
        "I personally would like to see people represented the way they are in real life.",
        "Like, I think Shonda Rhimes does an excellent job of that - \"\"How To Get Away With Murder,\"\" and \"\"Scandal,\"\" and \"\"Grey's Anatomy.\"\" It's a diverse cast.",
        "You see women of color in positions where they're not playing a prostitute, where they're not playing some downtrodden ghetto mother or whatever.",
        "They're playing real people, people that middle-class black people in America can relate to.",
        "So yes, we're having a conversation at the festival about, let's include all people of color - Latinos, Asians, black people, disabled people, LGBT, everybody.",
        "Let's include everybody.",
        "This is a melting pot that is comprised of a variety of different types of people from all over the world.",
        "It doesn't have to just be one narrative of one type of people."

        "Of course.",
        "So did Antonin Scalia invoke his faith publicly?",
        "How did he talk about it?",
        "He talked often about his faith.",
        "But, you know, he said - he was very insistent on this - he said there's no such thing as a Catholic justice.",
        "He insisted that his legal reasoning was based on one thing, the Constitution.",
        "Now I think it's an understatement to say that he had the strength of his convictions.",
        "He was very opinionated, and those who worked closely with him or for him say that his faith probably contributed to the certainty of his convictions.",
        "You know, faith can do that to someone.",
        "So if he was doctrinaire, it wasn't necessarily a reflection of his Roman Catholic thinking.",
        "He had a very complex legal mind.",
        "Well, let's give some examples.",
        "How about, say, an issue like abortion, which the Catholic Church vehemently opposes?",
        "Right.",
        "And he vehemently opposed it as a Catholic.",
        "And he said that the 1973 Supreme Court decision - famously Roe versus Wade, which legalized abortion across the country - was wrongly decided.",
        "But he didn't say that on moral or theological grounds.",
        "He said it on the basis of the Constitution.",
        "He said because abortion is not mentioned in the Constitution, the court has no business telling states they have to allow it.",
        "On the other hand, he said that also meant that the federal government could not tell states that they couldn't allow abortion.",
        "So he said it was a matter to be left up to the states.",
        "So a more nuanced view than perhaps many people might realize that he had on it.",
        "Yes, right."

        "efforts to recruit and train more fighters on the ground in Syria?",
        "Nothing good, although I have to say that the program seems to have been fundamentally flawed from the start in the sense that most of its target audience was just not interested in joining a program which required them to fight only ISIS and not also the president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad.",
        "So if this group was key to the American strategy to fight the Islamic State, what does that mean?",
        "Where is that fight at in this moment?",
        "This effort was clearly not going well in the first place.",
        "They only had 54 total fighters trained.",

        "And he said, you know, these people accepted a mission that they really should have known was impossible because the Americans are not properly supporting them.",
