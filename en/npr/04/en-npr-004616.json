        "The progression that is envisioned by the statute is that someone who's mentally ill and found not guilty by reason of insanity would be put into a mental institution, and then can gradually be reincorporated into the community.",
        "When he worked in the government, though, Zeno spent years fighting Hinckley's attempts at freedom.",
        "He's raised questions about Hinckley's relationships with women he met at the hospital, and whether Hinckley is telling his doctors the truth about what's going on in his head.",
        "That's the crucial thing - is, what's he thinking about these women, what might his motivations be, and is he being honest?",
