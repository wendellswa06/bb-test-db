        "And if he had disclosed that fact to anyone, including his friends, and it had gotten back to his work, he would have been fired.",
        "So I would like to remember both Tom for, hopefully, the spiritual closeness he may have with others in his same situation now because he was so lonely at the time not being able to tell anyone about his situation because of the political climate surrounding AIDS at the time.",
