        "Even if Sara writes for herself first, she says that in a way she also represents a nation.",
        "Her roots are in Cape Verde, a cluster of small volcanic islands about 430 miles west of the African mainland.",
        "It's a poor country that's mostly desert, so those who can leave head to Senegal, Boston, Paris and Lisbon.",
        "That's where Sara was born, and that's where her folks left her with a Portuguese family while they looked for jobs abroad.",
        "As a brown girl growing up in a major European city, Sara made sense of it all with her songs.",
        "I just picked up my guitar.",
        "I'm a very simple guitar player.",
        "I don't even know what's the name of the notes that are played.",
        "And then I would write my songs as lullabies.",
        "I would write little poems for myself to lift me up.",
        "She used those lullabies to win a local TV music contest.",
        "She did the same in the national competition, and launched a music career before she was out of her teens.",
        "Today, Sara sings mostly in crioulo.",
        "It's a language born hundreds of years ago in Cape Verde, when slave-trading Portuguese and the Africans they brought from all over the continent had to communicate with one another.",
        "Crioulo blends languages of the colonizer and the colonized.",
        "Sara's latest album, Balance, gets its title from a word that Lusophone Africans use to describe something that's really on-point, like great food or a good piece of music.",
        "She said the title also means balance, as her music constantly juggles languages and worldwide influences.",
        "Sara is also balancing identities as an African, as a European, and as a young musician who's coming into her own.",
        "I just want to do what I do the best way possible, but I want to do it in a very serene way because I think I owe that to myself and because I see all brothers and sisters in Portugal, my real blood brothers and sisters always scared, always in pressure.",
        "So I feel that my music can be sort of a, like I said, lullabies for them, can make them, you know, like hush, be quiet.",
        "(Soundbite of song from album, Balance)",
        "(Singing) (Foreign language spoken)",
        "Sara says being an immigrant has always been a part of Cape Verdian-ness(ph).",
        "And as she and other Cape Verdian artists integrate into far-flung societies, she feels it's important for them to sing in crioulo because it helps them hold on to their national pride.",
        "It's so strong, you know.",
        "The language, wherever they are, they always speak crioulo.",
        "And there's all these different kinds of crioulo.",
        "And with it comes a whole way to look at life, a whole way to enjoy life, comes a sense of humor.",
        "So I think that's really the core of the identity of the Cape Verdian."

        "The music that Cape Verdians do is very accessible, is very easy-going music.",

        "I was growing up when Whitney Houston was, you know, being a big hit.",
        "I just would go to the record stores and buy whatever was cheap, albums like Jackson Five and Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder and Donnie Hathaway, things like that, because they were cheaper because they were older.",
        "Black American artists impress Sara because she believes they absorbed everything around them and created new music styles that perfectly captured their African and American identities.",
        "She hopes to do the same thing with her art for Africans in Portugal.",
        "She also wants those songs to reach across the Atlantic and touch black folks in the U.S.",
        "It would be her way of saying thank you."

        "I think the biggest one would probably be Tommy Lee Jones from the film \"\"In the Valley of Elah.\"\" I don't think there is a lot of people talking about that film or that performance before the nominations were announced but surprise, surprise, there he is perhaps at Josh Brolin's expense.",

        "It isn't one of them, it isn't.",
        "One of those movies is \"\"Persepolis,\"\" though, which was part of this whole, sort of, foreign language controversy as well with another film that was not nominated and was one of the most popular foreign films of the year, so I guess it has to take its consolation that animation nomination.",
        "But yes, \"\"The Simpsons Movie\"\" was cruelly overlooked."
