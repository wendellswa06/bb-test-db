        "So \"\"Into The Wild\"\" got some nomination's but not the one he was looking for.",
        "No, it didn't get nominated.",
        "Sean Penn didn't get a nomination for best director.",
        "Emile Hirsh, the star of the film, didn't get a nomination and he gave, I thought, a really impressive performance.",
        "The one that it get at that I thought was very well-deserved was Hal Holbrook who gives really one of the finest, I think, supporting performances of the year as this older man who sort of counsels Emile Hirsh's character in a later portion of the film.",
        "And really, I think everyone who sees that movie you really remember that part of the film and Hal Holbrook's performance.",

        "One of my favorite movies this year that I didn't see any nominations for was \"\"Zodiac.\"\" I thought it had a great ensemble cast, it was really an enjoyable movie and good writing, and so I was kind of surprise not to see that one of the list anywhere.",
        "I'm going to agree, I'm going to second that.",
        "Actually, that's definitely one of the ones that was on my list of the best movies of 2007, and I was disappointed to see it didn't get a nomination.",
        "I think a lot of critics who's on a lot of critics list and if you look at the polls that ranked all the critics list together and aggregate them and figure out what's the most popular or critically acclaimed movie of the year, it was well into the top five of several different ones and yet totally overlooked and snubbed.",
        "Was that a matter of timing, it came out pretty early in the year?",
        "People often pointed that as a reason.",
        "Yeah, it came out in March, I believe.",
        "And often they say that if you're not released, sort of, in that post-Labor Day window that your chances are slim to none, and in this case they may have been right.",

        "Yes, she certainly was considered one of the favorites, she's been nominated for other awards including an Independent Spirit Award, and when the list came out that she was not on the list I think the surprise there that sort of maybe replaced her with Laura Linney for the film \"\"The Savages,\"\" which was another surprise amongst the list of surprises this year.",
        "And Cate Blanchett who got a double dip.",
        "She did, she did, indeed.",
        "Yes, supporting actress and supporting - excuse me, best actress and best supporting actress as well in the same year for a film that not too many people saw, actually, \"\"Elizabeth: The Golden Age,\"\" anyway.",
        "Let's get Austin(ph) on the line, Austin with us from Norfolk, Virginia - excuse me.",

        "Well, he didn't get a best picture nomination either in this case the film wasn't amongst those as well.",
        "I think, Sondheim, he got a nomination.",
        "I mean, he puts out steadily artistic and creatively found work and just, I think, was definitely snubbed."

        "I know a famous example of that is \"\"The Motorcycle Diaries\"\" which came from several different countries and it was sort of because it had so many different affiliations it didn't have one particular affiliation and you need that to be considered for that foreign language Oscar.",
