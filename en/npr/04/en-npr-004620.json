        "Hi there.",
        "I - my original question was about \"\"The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford\"\" and I though I would do a little research.",
        "I notice they get two nominations for Casey Affleck in a supporting role and cinematography, but the starring role is Brad Pitt and he didn't get a thing.",
        "He didn't get a thing, but would you really say that he was the star of the film?",
        "I almost think that Casey Affleck is really more the best - he would be the lead actor in that film, in my opinion.",
        "I think he has more screen time and he certainly is more of the focus of the film.",
        "We see Brad Pitt's character, Jesse James, through his eyes.",
        "The reason I would rate Brad Pitt in this is because I hate Brad Pitt but I love the movie and I thought that he was great in the role, so I really think that he brought something that he hasn't brought to roles since his starring role in \"\"Babel\"\"...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...for example.",
        "Playing against type.",
        "So, anyway, thanks for the call, James.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "There's another example, yes.",
        "Well, he - that film was sort of overlooked in a lot of categories, I think.",
        "I think that's one probably people are going to catch up with on DVD and take a look at now and - that often happens, I mean, we see these movies now and there's this judgments of them now and then in hindsight we go back and look at them and say why wasn't that nominated?",
        "Why didn't that win?",
        "I mean, again there's an enormous list of movies that aren't considered, you know, the greatest films of all time, that never even got nominated for a best picture Oscar, let alone one.",
        "I mean, \"\"Singing in the Rain\"\" was never nominated for best picture.",
        "Impossible to believe.",
        "It is hard to believe, isn't it?",
        "Meanwhile, while we've got you there at Sundance, the last couple of minutes, what have you seen this year at the festival that's going to look good maybe next year?",
        "Well, one that's coming out relatively soon, I will say that people should look forward, is the new film from Michel Gondry, it's called \"\"Be Kind Rewind.\"\" It stars Jack Black and Mos Def.",
        "And if anyone has seen other Michel Gondry films like the \"\"Science of Sleep\"\" and \"\"Eternal Sunshine\"\" I don't think they'll be disappointed.",
        "It's a very Gondryian(ph) movie, if I can make up an adjective right on the spot.",
        "It has its usual, sort of, his flair and his unique visual style and sense of humor and all of that is in there.",
        "It's a very funny, very warm film, and if you ever wanted to see Jack Black cast in a role of Robocop, \"\"Be Kind Rewind\"\" is the movie to see.",
        "As Robocop?",
        "Yes, because the characters in the film accidentally erased all the videotapes in the video store that they work in and so they try to recreate the movie so that no one notices and they cast themselves the roles, so you see Jack Black as Robocop, Jack Black and Mos Def in \"\"Ghost Busters\"\" and the list goes on and on, and so it's very funny.",
        "So I definitely recommend that one very highly.",
        "Matt Singer, thanks for the recommendation and thanks very much for being with us today.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "Matt Singer is the host of the Independent Film Channel's news program and he joins us today from the Sundance Film Festival to talk about the nominees, including some of those who are snubbed and weren't nominated for this year's Academy Award nominations."
