        "Folks, let's start with the Supreme Court, and they are reviewing a recruiting law.",
        "They have decided to consider whether colleges and universities may bar military recruiters from their campuses without fear of law--losing federal funds.",
        "This comes from a review of a lower court's ruling in favor of 25 law schools that restricted recruiters in protest of the Pentagon's policy to exclude openly gay people from military service.",
        "We've also seen some colleges suggest because of, particularly, the students' stances at the--with the war that they would want these recruiters barred as well.",
        "John, your thought?",
        "Well, I am very much against any kind of discrimination against gay people.",
        "It's a kind of--it's a medieval kind of bigotry.",
        "But there's a certain smell here that I don't like.",
        "I wonder how the same people who are so up in arms against the military recruiting because of its gay policies would have a problem, say, with a hip-hopper who has made `faggot' references in his songs--to come into campus.",
        "Or say Amiri Baraka who has got some anti-Semitic verses in his poetry or how you might interpret some of his recent poetry.",
        "Somehow I don't think they'd mind those people putting their feet on campus.",
        "But it seems that there's this certain anti-military bias.",
        "I understand how we might not like what's going on in Iraq, but really it seems to me that this is a kind of a post-Vietnam, oh-the-Army-is-a-terrible-thing issue rather than a consistent application of a coherent political position.",
        "That being said, there are and have been some college campuses that have barred a number of rappers based on their lyrics, misogynistic and the like.",
        "George Curry?",
        "Not as many as would bar these recruiters.",
        "Well, certainly not sending it to the Supreme Court.",
        "George?",
        "I don't--it's not the same thing as just having someone express their point of view as speakers, vs. coming on your campus in some cases, open up your career department and welcome them, making them part of career fairs and these kinds of things.",
        "And basically, you're going beyond just merely free speech.",
        "This is a vexing issue because, basically, what the law schools are saying, we want to discriminate against the military because they are discriminating.",
        "And about 25 law schools that want to do that and, of course, they're citing an earlier case where the Boy Scouts were allowed to do that.",
        "And it's not a simple case and it's certainly--I think it's going to come down on the question of whether or not this is a First Amendment issue.",
        "Well, the reality here is that, indeed, there are many anti-war people on campuses.",
        "I teach on a college campus myself, but there are many folks who are very supportive of the military.",
        "and they're--and I think that there's--the motivation on the side of the military is that, as we know, recruiting is down.",
        "The war is turning a lot of people off, so they are looking for new venues.",
        "In the past, they focused primarily on minorities, and we know that's why minorities are disproportionately represented in the military.",
        "But now they're looking for new ground, so there's a lot of pressure coming from the military.",
        "I think the thing that concerns me more than anything else is the tone and the message that recruiters bring to these campuses.",
        "Not just to campuses, but also the inner cities in terms of the rosy promises that young people are--they're made to young people about seeing the world and, you know, wearing a uniform.",
        "And you don't and--obviously, they're recruiters, so they're PR people that are not telling them the whole story, the true story about the expectations that people are going to face in the military.",
        "Yet, hasn't that always been..."

        "I think that, you know, the message has gotten out to lower-income folks, minority people in particular who are going into the military, not necessarily for the right reasons--they're going in because they're desperate for financial opportunities.",
        "They're running out of those folks, and they have to go to the hi--to other places.",
        "What is interesting to me is that these are law schools.",

        "I would have thought that this would have been more of an undergraduate issue.",
        "But the fact that this is--these are 25 law schools is a particularly interesting twist.",
        "Well, if they can't go to campus, you can assume that there'll be other ways that they'll get to the same people, especially in this Internet age.",
        "So that's another aspect of the issue.",
        "Now I agree that we spend far too much time watching TV, and I really note when they show these Hollywood stars and BET has us look inside their homes and closets that you can always see TV screens and great music systems.",
