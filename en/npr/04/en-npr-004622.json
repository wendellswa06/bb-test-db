        "There are 10 more contests, obviously Indiana, where Obama was speaking, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Guam, but it's very likely that these two candidates will split them in half, and this race won't be any less clear or decisive when the primary season is over on June 3.",
        "All right.",
        "Another interesting point that was brought up this week, this from a conference that was sponsored by American Enterprise Institute, and it actually took a look at philanthropy as relates to schools.",
        "And it's suggesting that the new benefactors, those that are giving today, are less likely to hand out mega donations, large donations, and let the system take over instead.",
        "They are insisting that schools improve test scores, in many cases overhaul basic functions.",
        "And there has been some concern that these benefactors may also start to shape curriculum and move into other areas that perhaps, perhaps I underline, should be left to the schools.",
        "Laura, how much does the idea of the mighty dollar come into play here?",
        "The dollar always talks.",
        "This is a longtri--term trend in terms of the school reform movement in general.",
        "Obviously, No Child Left Behind--there's been a lot of calling and pressure for more accountability, more responsibility, and I don't see anything wrong with that on its face.",
        "I do have a concern, though, about the influence that philanthropy can have.",
        "I've seen it here in Chicago.",
        "The major foundations here have a lot of influence over government.",
        "They're funding a lot of gover--programs that norm--that used to be supported by government in terms of rehabilitation of public housing, in terms of school reform, in terms of many other issues.",
        "And the dollars talk.",
        "The point that has been made, though, is that the--I guess, the amount of money overall that's going from major philanthropy into education is like $1.5 billion annually, and that's small fry as compared with the $400-some billion that comes from government.",
        "George Curry, they're also suggesting that these benefactors are also guiding and rethinking how superintendents and school boards are trained.",
        "Ofttimes these school boards and superintendents are elected by voters within states.",
        "How much does this cross a line?",
        "Well, I mean, conservative foundations have been extremely interested in higher education and been giving them money.",
        "Certainly slanted in that direction.",
        "I think this can be a good thing if properly used.",
        "I was speaking to the council on--urban board of education--board--boards out in San Diego recently.",
        "And what--I found out there were a lot of creative things going on in public education with the help of foundations.",
        "For example, in Chattanooga, they matched their best performing teachers with their worst performing schools and they give the teachers a $5,000 bonus.",
        "If the schools advance a certain level, they give them $2,000.",
        "If they want to buy a home in the city, they give them a partial down payment.",
        "There are creative ways that we can improve our public school system, and I think that's where the emphasis ought to be and I think they can play an important role.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's turn our attention and look at Denny's.",
        "Some Arab-Americans are suing the franchise.",
        "Seven men of Middle Eastern descent have sued Denny's Restaurant franchise and one of the managers there for $28 million saying that they were kicked out because of their ancestry and that they were compared to Osama bin Laden.",
        "All of the men were US citizens.",
        "All of them.",
        "Seven of the men, I suggest--as I suggested before, of Egyptian, Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian descent.",
        "They included a doctor, a real estate agent, an insurance broker and a restaurant owner.",
        "John McWhorter, this certainly, if nothing else, tells where we are today.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We're at an intermediate point, and the lunkhead manager who did this should be tarred in public and, thankfully, he is being so.",
        "And there seems to be a certain bizarre pattern of this with Denny's over the past 10 years.",
        "I find it hard to believe that Denny's is actually recruiting racists into its ranks or asking their applicants whether or whether or not they're racist.",
        "But these things are going to keep happening, and people who do this sort of thing ought to be revealed as what they are.",
        "But then, on the other hand, as far as the rest of us, whether we be Arab or whether we be black or Latino, I hope that we'll take the advice of James Weldon Johnson: Keep our heads high and realize that racism can't destroy our self-image."

        "How much do you believe that this should be looked at as an individual incident as opposed to, as John has already suggested, just continuing problems for the Denny's franchise?",
        "Well, when I heard about the story I thought, `Here we go again.",

        "But you've got to wonder about some of the cases in this litigious society that get brought against public places where folks, you know, maybe got mistreated, but maybe they're i--they're is--isn't necessarily a discriminatory issue.",

        "Are we allowed to say that?",
        "Go ahead.",
        "We are.",
        "We are, but all--that also says that racism is alive and well.",
        "And I think that, you know, when you're talking about basic public accommodations and when people are still going into restaurants, going into bars, going into clubs--I know, George, you've written about this in terms of the clubs in New Orleans--and being mistreated because of their race, that tells you how much further we still have to go.",

        "But that's a company, if you go back and look at their record since then, they have made some tremendous improvements.",
        "So I don't think it's fair just to say this is Denny's across the board.",
        "I think this is definitely an incident.",

        "All right, turning our attention now to a study that looked at black television viewing and the habits of blacks.",
        "And the Scarborough research suggests that African-Americans and Hispanics watch more television than the general population, and blacks, in particular, watch 70 percent more soap operas and 22 percent more science-fiction programing.",
        "I don't know if that means anything.",
        "But the idea--that, coupled with what was recently brought out at the RTNDA, and that is executives of television that get together, suggesting that blacks still do not have positions that allow them to green light and formulate what is on television, yet we disproportionately watch it.",
        "A, let's take a look at what many see as problematic, and that's the disproportionate amount of time African-Americans spend in front of television, John McWhorter.",
        "And then on the other side, if we're going to spend that much time, shouldn't we have some say in what's on?",
        "Well, there is a certain problem with how much television African-Americans watch given that it has been shown in the occasional study to impact scholarly performance.",
        "But on the other hand, if what we're saying, in complaining that there aren't enough black people behind the scenes, is--and I think this is the implication--that this impacts what is seen in terms of the diversity among black people on the screen, I think that making that charge in 2005 is like getting up and making a speech saying we need to put fluoride in the water.",
        "You have to admit when a battle has been won.",
        "If you think that nowadays black people on TV are disproportionately criminals or maids or hip-hoppers or whatever you think it is, then basically you're someone who, for one reason or another, doesn't watch much TV.",
        "It's no longer 19...",
        "You don't think that to be the case?",
        "Not remotely.",
        "If you look at all of the black shows that are on television, or if you just look at the commercials, it's at the point where it's not true that the middle-class black experience, that the working-class black experience, that the professionals, as well as people who are poor, etc., is not on the screen.",
        "If somebody came and looked at black TV now from 1955, they would be baffled as to what there is to complain about.",
        "Now talk about behind the scenes, yes, there is still work to be done.",
        "Although, remember, that in terms of the black representation of the population, we're looking for us to be, say, one in eight, not half.",
