        "But--especially among the middle class.",
        "But if you look behind the camera, the producers, the decision makers--Richard Parsons is the head of Time Warner, but he's not making decisions about what goes on CNN every day.",
        "It's the key producers.",
        "And if you look at the ranks there, we have a long way to go.",
        "I should note that I--I meant to say that it was NATPE, the National Association of Television Program Executives--at their recent national conference--that all of this was discussed.",
        "And it is interesting to note how even the prism here is seen differently.",
        "I don't think, John, many would argue that the image of African-Americans, particularly the middle-class image, is far better than it was 20, 25 years ago.",
        "But I would still contend that, for the most part, outside of the one or two `black shows,' quote, that are on, most of the images and most of the images in terms of mainstream programming that you see African-Americans in are either a subrole or a hoodlum, frankly.",
        "Still today.",

        "For example, there are a lot more than one or two black shows now, and they regularly depict a middle-class world.",

        "He's the CEO of Save the Elephants, and he worked with Esmond Bradley Martin for years.",
        "He told me about Martin's method of surveying ivory markets.",
        "He stuck with his tried-and-tested techniques of simply visiting these markets, counting the pieces with great patience, seeing how many pieces were on sale and what the value of those pieces - and the fact that he did these surveys over and over again meant that you could establish trends in the market.",
        "So on the one hand, it sounds as though his work was very analytical and research data-driven.",
        "And on the other hand, there was almost this kind of undercover espionage aspect to it where he was going to these markets and seeing what rhino horn and elephant tusk were selling for.",
        "You know, it's tempting to think of all investigators as undercover.",
        "If you'd met Esmond, you'd realize that there could never be anything undercover about Esmond.",
        "(Laughter)."

        "And the proponents of trade assume that you can have a clean trade.",

        "Esmond's been instrumental in not only this ivory ban but the previous ivory ban, where in 1989, the nations of the world voted to close down all international trade in ivory.",
        "And his surveys established not only that the price was rising from 2008 onwards, but it also established the peak at just over $2,000 a kilo for raw, wholesale ivory and charted its decline following the Chinese action on the issue.",
