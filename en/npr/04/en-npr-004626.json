        "It's being met with a little skepticism here, I might say.",

        "He addressed the people of Iran, the people of Iraq, the people of Afghanistan, and Syria, urging their leaders to take appropriate policies.",

        "It's one thing when the president of the United States makes remarks like those he addressed, as you mention to Iran or Syria, in a speech from the White House briefing room or a hotel ballroom, or someplace like that.",
        "Does it get distinctly uncomfortable when he's looking across the room at the representatives of those nations?",

        "And what's the protocol?",
