        "Sure, it's demanded by the IAEA resolutions before and the Security Council resolutions gave legal authority and legal force to those IAEA resolutions.",
        "Iranians have always suggested that these resolutions are politically contorted and therefore it is the United States that is misusing United Nations and United Nations' procedures to multilateralize its course of policy toward Iran, using the nuclear issue as an excuse.",

        "World leaders have gathered to listen to speeches.",
        "Earlier today, President Bush was talking, and we'll hear more about that later.",

        "Thanks for having me on.",
        "Sure.",
        "I just wanted to say that there's a growing number of us - even those who don't really support President Bush - who would ask what solvency does the General Assembly really have when we live in a world where things like regional coalitions seem to make the most difference.",
        "I would ask what relevance does Angola have in a situation with Hugo Chavez, and vice versa.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Paul Kennedy?",
        "Yes, a good question.",
        "The sovereignty of the United Nations is only that which is given to it by the 192 member states.",
        "We deicide to give it certain powers in certain circumstances.",
        "In other circumstances, we withhold them.",
        "We - the nation states or governments haven't been able to give authorization too much to assist to poor people in Darfur.",
        "While on the other hand, we have authorized a regional peacekeeping security organization called NATO to operate in the Balkans and in Afghanistan.",
        "The charter of United Nations on which all of these decisions rests, or is referred to, is deliberately vague and extraordinarily flexible - which frustrates many people because they look at the charter and say: Well, it can mean anything or nothing.",
        "And it's a bit like, you know, the red queen in Alice in Wonderland.",
        "What does this mean, said Alice?",
        "And the queen says: It means what I say it means.",
        "It means the United Nations and what it can do means what the big powers in the Security Council say it can do.",
        "And we always think of the analogy of the General Assembly being much like the House of Representatives and the Security Council a bit like the Senate.",
        "The analogy is far from perfect though."

        "When the president of the United States, just to pick an example, gets up and - I'd like to address this to the people of Iran - are the people of Iran going to be hearing that?",
        "Yes, I suspect they are.",
        "Despite Iran's reputation as a draconian totalitarian state, it does have some degree of media that does discuss these issues and the president's message is likely to be broadcasted through other various international forums.",
        "I mean, in the age of globalization of media it's hard to keep such message under wraps.",
        "So Iranian people are likely to hear this message.",
        "Now the question is how they would respond.",
        "And as earlier, Michele Kelemen told us and as Paul Kennedy reminded us, a lot of the work of actual diplomacy that goes on at these meetings is not in the speeches themselves but on the margins of the speeches and meetings.",
        "For example, like the one that President Bush held today with Jacques Chirac of France.",
        "And that is an opportunity where real work can get done, no?",
        "It sure is.",
        "However, in this particular case I think what the president and Secretary Rice are doing, at least at this point, is trying to shore up the international coalition against Iran that appears to have fractured and the international solidarity that seems to have evaporated.",
        "When President Chirac of France suggests that sanctions should not be contemplated at this point, that is a serious rebuke to American strategy.",
        "Yet he also said we can't resume talks with Iran until such time as they do cease the enrichment of uranium, as demanded in the Security Council resolution.",
        "Trying to have it both ways.",
        "To some degree, the speakers at the General Assembly Debate are speaking yes to the audience in front of them, yes to the people of Iran and the rest of the world, but also to whatever audience they may have at home.",
        "President Bush seemed to be doing that to a degree today.",
        "Would you expect that President Ahmadinejad will do the same tonight?",
        "Yes.",
        "President Ahmadinejad's speech - actually all the speeches that he gives - he always looks to have multiple audiences.",
        "There is the audience, of course, of the Europeans and the Americans that are watching what he says.",
        "There is his attempt to appeal to a larger third world audience, and his stopover in Havana in a Non-Aligned community meeting was an indication of that.",
        "And finally, he of course appeals to his own constituents in Iran.",
        "And you saw that, of course, in his last time when he addressed the United Nations - where he was attempting to not just talk about Iran's national rights, which is an appeal to the Iranian people, but it was also talking about nuclear apartheid and how capitalist powers are determined to prevent third-world countries - developing countries - from acquiring technologies that is necessary for their economic development."

        "And many of them think that that is an issue, which will be dealt with by, you know, meetings of oil ministers, meetings of OPEC and it will not be on the agenda of these two days of general assembly talks - which will be essentially political.",
        "So oil - a political, highly political subject I think it - but it calls for conservation; calls for a new discovery; new drilling; whatever, you know, position you might want to take, however controversial it might be - that's not likely to come up.",

        "Conferences in the rights of women, for example - even where they're located can sometimes be very influential.",
        "Yes it's true.",

        "All of the U.N.",
        "global conferences of the 1990s - the one on human rights in Vienna; the one on the environment in Rio; the one on women; the one on habitat - all of those are caused or instigated by a General Assembly resolution asking for the secretariat to set up a special organization so that there is a world conference.",
        "And at these conferences, important things have been done, targets have been established.",
        "Perhaps a more effective international human rights, setting up the high commission on human rights in 1993, '94, at Vienna.",
        "There are various reporting back five years later what have we achieved.",
        "So although we see the General Assembly today and tomorrow more as a talking shop, some of its functional follow on programs and global conferences have real impact."
