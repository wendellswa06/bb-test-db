        "And that has to come as a great disappointment to him personally.",
        "Yes, I would think so.",
        "One of the things that has concerned Kofi -to his credit - all through his career, even before he was secretary-general, is what happens to societies where the government or the state is simply too weak, it collapses.",
        "There is mass impoverishments, civil wars, slaughters.",
        "And he has pushed forward for years, the notion that the world community has the responsibility to protect.",
