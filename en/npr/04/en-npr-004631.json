        "And in fact, RUSADA said in a statement - and I'm quoting here - \"\"it does not have and cannot have the authority to admit or deny such facts.\"\" And the whole thing is under investigation in Russia.",
        "How does The New York Times respond to that?",
        "Well as you mentioned, sticking by its story, the reporter says all the quotes were accurate.",
        "So then what is the impact of Russia essentially going back to where it was before yesterday's Times article, rejecting any notion that the doping was widespread or state-sponsored or, as the McLaren report says, an institutional conspiracy?",
        "Yeah, well, basically a glimmer of good will appears to be lost.",
        "You know, there was a feeling by those in the anti-doping community that even though Russians were still disputing the state-sponsored element of the doping allegations - and there's a lot of evidence to show it was state-sponsored - they were making an admission in the Times article, and that could help put them in a better light and help them get back into the fold of international sport.",
