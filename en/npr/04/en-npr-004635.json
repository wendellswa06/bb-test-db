        "As we've already heard this hour, President Trump's missile strike against Syria is the first time the U.S.",
        "took direct military action against the Assad regime since civil war began there in 2011.",

        "He came to the U.S.",

        "And when the war began, he began lobbying for support for what he calls the pro-democratic movement inside Syria.",
        "He famously helped sneak Senator John McCain into Syria in 2013 to meet with rebel leaders.",
        "We wanted to know more about how people with close ties to Syria are reacting to the attack, and Mouaz Moustafa was kind enough to come to our studios in Washington, D.C., to share his thoughts.",
        "Mouaz, thanks so much for joining us.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "So what was your reaction?",
        "I mean, and I - also I'm interested in the reaction of people in your circle, which includes, you know, Americans like yourself who have deep ties to Syria, expatriates all over the world.",
        "And you also still have connections inside Syria.",
        "So what was your reaction?",
        "Well, my reaction - and I can say that this speaks to the reaction of my friends inside the country and others - is that honestly, they are thankful.",
        "They are thankful for this president for taking action in response to the chemical weapons attack done by the Assad regime against children.",
        "And I think that we are all urgently calling for - now to move to end the killing once and for all in Syria.",
        "I'm presuming that you were an Obama supporter, given the fact that you worked for Democrats on Capitol Hill.",
        "Is there a part of you that's disappointed that his successor took this action and he didn't?",
        "I'm incredibly disappointed in President Obama and his administration.",
        "We spent countless hours at the National Security Council.",
        "And we had been begging - this is a time before ISIS or al-Qaida existed in Syria - begging for greater leadership, for stronger action in Syria that can help bring a political solution to the conflict.",
        "And I can tell you that this president learned in three months a lesson that his predecessor did not learn in six years.",
        "How do you know that?",
        "I mean, how do you know that this is any more than a one-off reaction to some very horrifying imagery?",
        "Sure.",
        "Look, I don't know exactly what the strategy for this president is.",
        "But what I do know - that the Assad regime only understands that he cannot kill people if he understands that there is a credible threat of force.",
        "For six years, the dictator of Damascus has understood that there is no accountability, that he can act with impunity, using chemical weapons multiple times.",
        "And now that punitive action was taken for the use of it, I think that is the right approach with this dictator.",
        "So you're obviously against this regime.",
        "But Assad obviously still has some support inside the country.",
        "Your network has some connection with supporters of Assad.",

        "It was horrible.",
        "This was, again, even from loyalists that were reporting.",
