        "We have local civilian councils of people that are running schools and hospitals and education and health care and all these different things.",
        "These are the ones that should be supported in terms of administration and in terms of those that will take the fight to Iran, Hezbollah, ISIS and Assad.",
        "I'm not saying this is an easy answer or anything's going to be easy once Assad leaves.",
        "But I can tell you that in the hearts of men, women and children and of defectors from the army and many others in Syria, their dream of a democratic, pluralistic country still lives.",
        "And we should not choose between Iran or ISIS.",
        "We should choose the democratic people of Syria.",
        "Before we let you go, can I ask you - what is your state of mind at this moment?",
        "You know, if you asked me a week ago or something, I would tell you how incredibly depressed I am, as many other Syrians were, and then seeing another chemical weapons attack, seeing this violence going unabated, the slaughter in Syria continuing while the world watches or maybe makes some statements.",
        "I've learned not to get my hopes up when it comes to Syria.",
        "But for the first time ever there's a glimmer of hope that maybe the international community will wake up, that maybe with this punitive strike it can sort of revitalize the United States and its allies to take Russia to the negotiating table and to lay out a settlement strategy, to bring an end to this war.",
