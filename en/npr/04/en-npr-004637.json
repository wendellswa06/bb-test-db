        "We know the United States has been very active in Yemen in fighting al-Qaida and using drone strikes.",
        "I mean, I would imagine it's fair to say they haven't been completely successful because we're seeing what happened in Paris.",
        "I mean, what is the relationship right now between the United States and Yemen?",
        "The United States and Yemen have a close partnership and a close working relationship certainly at the top level.",
        "But again, as you noted, this has not necessarily been the most successful approach.",
        "I think what's tragic, looking at Yemen, is that for the last several years, our counterterrorism and intelligence officials have noted that AQAP represents the next greatest threat to the United States.",
        "And yet, we have simply been unable to dedicate sufficient attention and resources to really look at what would it take to mitigate that threat?",
        "So what we've done is focus specifically on drone strikes and targeted assassinations, trying to take out leadership, often killing noncombatants in the process as well as training elite counterterrorism forces.",
        "But again, there is no broad-based security infrastructure in place to support this.",
        "So there's really a gap here about the way we're looking at addressing this problem.",
        "Which is amazing to hear you say because President Obama used his strategy in Yemen as a success story, as a model, he said, for the U.S.",
        "going after ISIS in Iraq.",
        "Thailand's prime minister was deposed in a military coup 15 months ago, but Thai voters seemed to have remembered him.",
        "A party that openly supports Thaksin Shinawatra won the most seats in a parliamentary election.",

        "Soldatov met me in a coffee shop a couple of blocks behind the Bolshoi Ballet.",
        "He says Russian security services approach him regularly, usually to try to thwart his reporting, sometimes to try to recruit him as a source.",
        "Say you're approached by someone who wants to talk to you, to sign some sort of deal, invite you for some quiet and private conversation.",
        "Immediately, I go public.",
        "Meaning Soldatov starts tweeting.",
        "He gets reporter friends to post about the encounter.",
        "The public pressure forces security officials to back off for a while.",
        "But Mark Galeotti, an NYU professor and expert on Russian intelligence whose work often brings him to Moscow, says one of the triumphs of the Putin regime is that everyone thinks they're being spied on all the time.",
        "The FSB can't listen to every phone conversation.",
        "But everyone assumes that they are.",
        "The FSB can't read every email, but everyone writes emails as if they thought they were.",
        "Everyone has a little Putin in their head.",
        "Everyone is basically running a little sensor just in case."

        "That worries one former State Department official, Tom Countryman.",
        "The very slow pace at which the White House seems to be paying attention to filling those vacancies is an indication I fear that the White House is content to have empty agencies across the government that cannot interfere with the edicts that are issued by the White House."

        "Is Yemen becoming the next Afghanistan?",
        "I think the tragic piece here is that we've learned these very painful lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan and have done a 180, which is people looked at the investment of life, of money, of effort in these two places, seen that it was perhaps unsuccessful, maybe to put it mildly.",
        "And then the reaction is, well, we don't want to do that again in Yemen.",

        "There has to be a middle ground where we are neither putting, you know, hundreds of thousands of troops on the ground, nor are we sort of, you know, taking this hands-off approach and trying to just use targeted assassinations from the sky to eradicate a movement that is really firmly embedded, in many ways, in Yemeni society.",
