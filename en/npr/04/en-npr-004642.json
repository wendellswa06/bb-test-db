        "TIM O'NEILL: Well, the improvement is immense.",
        "However, I have to caution you by saying the improvement is immense because what it replaces was just terrible.",
        "In what way?",
        "O'NEILL: It didn't work.",
        "It was an unfortunate attempt to create a single camouflage measure that worked equally well worldwide.",

        "It's supposed to fit anywhere in the world, but in fact, it's just several shades of very neutral gray.",
        "It's also very light - very bright in the terms of the energy that reflects off of it, much more so than much natural backgrounds.",
        "The other problem is that within the pattern, there's very low contrast, which means that within a very short distance, you no longer see a camouflage pattern at all.",
        "You just see a - kind of a grayish blotch.",
        "And so what makes this new one more effective?",
        "O'NEILL: Well, the choice of colors is much better.",
        "I think it still has some problems in contrast, but just the change to a more realistic color palette is a huge leap forward.",
        "The problem is it is designed to be a universal camouflage pattern, and there is no such thing.",
        "There is no pattern that works well in the woods and in the desert and in the swamps and in the snow.",
        "And you can't design one with current technology.",
