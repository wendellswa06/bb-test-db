        "China is a freer, better, richer place than it was when it was awarded the games.",
        "But actually, at closer examination, what seemed to come through is that firstly it's more to do with things like opening up the economy as a whole, and to do with odd things like the spread of mobile telephony, the impact of that on freedom.",
        "By contrast, most of the actual impacts of the games themselves have tended to be in the opposite direction.",
