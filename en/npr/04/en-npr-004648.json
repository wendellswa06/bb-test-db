        "Everyone was stunned into silence.",

        "The judge very quickly intervened and said, we'll have an adjournment.",
        "Pistorius' brother and sister immediately dashed across the room to console him as they have so often, but even then, there were these gut-wrenching moans drifting across the room as we all sat there.",
        "A few minutes later, you know, after Pistorius had left, he actually came back, looked a lot more composed, but his defense counsel said it's just not right to try and carry on with him in this state and so the judge said, yes, let's call it a day about half an hour early and come back tomorrow.",
        "And we should point out that this is not being heard by a jury, right?",
        "It is being heard by that judge.",
        "That's right.",
        "Juries were abolished in South Africa in the 1960s so this is judge-only.",

        "I mean, how did that register in the courtroom?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think it would take a heart of stone to not feel something for him and I noticed many of the journalists afterwards tweeted, look, you know, we might all have different views on him and his sincerity and his story, but, you know, this was not an act.",
        "But, you know, the debate has always been what is he feeling sorry for, Reeva Steenkamp or just feeling sorry for himself?",
        "And during one of the adjournments, I spoke to a police investigator on the case who remains utterly convinced that Pistorius committed murder, said he thought there were holes in Pistorius' testimony today.",
        "I suspect there's a lot more to be heard in this trial.",
        "David, Oscar Pistorius has told authorities all along that he thought it was an intruder who had broken into his bathroom.",
        "Did any new details of that story emerge today from his testimony?",
        "It was a broadly similar account from what he's submitted before in written statements, but there were some differences that I suspect the prosecution will pick him up on.",
        "That clip you heard there, the final words of his testimony today, which came out in that dreadful sort of half sob, half shout, she wasn't breathing.",
        "Well, just over a year ago, at his bail application, when Pistorius described that moment, he actually said she was slumped, but she was still alive.",
        "So that may require some clarification.",
        "At one point, Oscar Pistorius' lawyer had him take off his prosthetic legs in court.",
        "What was the point of that?"

        "She was placed in an industrial school.",
        "But at the age of 14, I believe, from what we understand, her mother tried to take her out and there was some sort of a row with the nuns.",
        "And their answer to keep her away from her mother was to simply send her to the Magdalene Laundry at Sunday's Well in Cork.",
        "And this was in 1947.",
        "She spent the next 10 years there doing sewing for them, anything from embroidery to smock dresses, items for the clergy, altering surplices, that sort of thing.",
        "And obviously, there was profit being made on these items, but she was never paid for that.",
        "So she's there from about the time she's 14 to her mid-20s and she can't leave?",
        "Correct.",
        "They actually did let her out in 1957 with a work referral.",
        "But having been raised completely by the nuns, she exited with absolutely no world skills.",
        "So within a year and a half, she found herself pregnant with me and then was sent to one of the mother and baby homes run by another religious order and remained there with me until my adoption to the United States was organized.",
        "She left and eventually ended up in Wales.",
        "So your group has worked for years to get the Irish state to recognize the injustice, the harshness, the abuse that went on in these institutions.",
        "What was your reaction to Prime Minister Enda Kenny's speech?",
        "Obviously, it was very emotional for me.",
        "I kind of got teary just listening to your clip of it again.",

        "At the same time the agency adopted a new policy that will give governors a say in whether national forests remain wild.",

        "At the time they saw development sweeping the nation, and they were concerned that there wouldn't be any place left wild or not enough places left wild.",
        "So they found these spots in national forests, and it was, in fact, a third of the the national forests, or 2 percent of all the land nationwide--and they said, `There won't be any more roads built on them.",
        "So then you had these places that you can't build roads in.",
        "If you can't build roads, it's really hard to drill for oil or log trees or do a lot of other things on this land.",
        "And the Clinton administration thought that we needed some places where--for habitat for wild animals and, also, as a refuge for people.",
        "So there's more to today's action than simply undoing the work of the Clinton administration.",
        "How does the new policy work?",
        "Well, they replaced it with another policy that gives governors a chance to petition the federal government for what lands they want to see roads in and what lands they don't want to see roads in, so it shifts some leeway back to the governors.",
        "And then if the governors don't want to weigh in, then the Forest Service will just decide what would happen with these lands.",
        "Well, does it mean that logging or mining could then be allowed in all these areas in the future?",
        "Well, it's really not clear.",

        "Well, in fact, there has been--in the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, there's been some road-building and some logging, but there hasn't been much.",
        "There are proposals for more road-building and logging, however, that could go ahead, now that this new rule has come into play.",
        "Obviously environmentalist groups must be against this new policy.",
        "Yes.",
        "They say that this new policy risks starting a lot more logging and oil drilling and mining and all the things that they don't want to see happening in these national forests.",
        "On the other hand, the people who would do the mining and the logging, I assume, are pleased with this."
