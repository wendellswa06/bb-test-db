        "Thank you for having me.",
        "So let's start with the conclusion and work backward.",
        "The trending hashtag #KamalaHarrisDestroyed - look, it's a reference to the confrontation between Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard when she criticized California Senator Kamala Harris' record as a prosecutor.",
        "So it was a moment, but there were people who thought it odd that it got so much traction and wondered whether bots or conservative activists were kind of pushing it out.",
        "So do we know?",
        "Well, I think that's sort of the big question here.",
        "And I think the answer is that it seems as though it is a combination.",
        "It looks like that specific hashtag was started by conservative activists, but then Fox found it and spread it and helped it to get farther than it might have otherwise.",
        "So that seems to be what happened.",
        "But, you know, I think it reveals broader questions that we just really still do not know how social media manipulation works.",
        "And we can't figure out what to trust and what not to trust.",
        "You say that Twitter and other platforms have improved their practices post-2016.",
        "They're still not perfect in your reporting.",
        "Do the social media companies take this seriously?",
        "They take it seriously to the extent that it would be a bad look if they didn't look like they were trying at all.",
        "But obviously, social media companies make money when we are there and we are engaged.",
        "And we know that what keeps people engaged is controversy.",
        "You know, you hear a lot of talk about social media bias.",
        "But not a restaurant?",
        "It was very meaningful to her.",
        "I know, you know, it's been a very difficult period of her life to talk about, and she still has great difficulty with it even with me.",
        "But I think she recognizes the importance of that weight coming off her shoulders.",
        "I think it's freed her up considerably to talk about her past.",
        "That's going to be the case for a lot of women.",
        "There's been a lot of stigma over the years against the girls who were in the Magdalene Laundries.",
        "And now, along with his apology, the Irish prime minister has said that there will be a compensation package given to these women.",
        "Is this enough, do you think?",
        "No.",
        "At the moment, we're kind of frightened because it's not looking like what we had envisioned.",

        "Well, what do you envision?",
        "What would be better?",
        "Well, we looked at a multiprong approach and tried to base it on things like length of time there, what abuse they might have suffered, what were the lifelong repercussions of that, and using a scale to determine what each woman was entitled to, so sort of an individual approach rather than a one-size-fits-all scheme.",
        "And how many women are alive today, do you think, who've passed through the Magdalene Laundries?",
        "We're looking at anywhere from 800 to 1,200 women.",
        "Now, we may end up with a few more that come out of the woodwork or that might not have been correctly recorded, but at most, perhaps 2,000 women.",
        "So I would just like to ask you, Mari Steed, how old your mom is today and what her life is like now?",
        "Well, she's approaching 80 years old.",
        "And, you know, I guess in comparison to other women that I've met who really, really suffered, she came out of it fairly decently.",
        "She married, but she was too frightened to have more children.",
        "And this is a theme that we found very common with mothers of loss, this notion of secondary infertility that they're just too afraid that that child might be snatched either by the religious or by God, you know, through death.",
        "And then her inability to come to terms with the family that she had lost.",
        "She has a brother who wanted very much to reunite with her and I found him.",
        "But at first, she denied him.",
        "She sort of felt like, I was the one that got sent off to the industrial school while he was raised in family.",
        "So those were painful aspects of her life and things that she still has grave difficulty coming to terms with.",
        "Mari Steed is the daughter of a survivor of the Magdalene Laundry in Ireland, and she's the committee director of Justice for the Magdalenes, an advocacy group.",

        "The law calls for women to receive birth control at no cost, and many women are already getting that benefit.",
        "It took effect for most insurance plans last August.",
        "But the fight continues with religious employers, who say providing the benefit violates their beliefs.",

        "What are they?",
        "Well, this is part of a so far, not completely successful effort to find a way to ensure that women don't face financial barriers to getting contraception while at the same time, ensuring religious employers freedom of religion.",
        "Here's how Health and Human Services official Chiquita Brooks-LaSure put it, this afternoon.",
        "No nonprofit religious institution will be forced to pay for or provide contraceptive coverage.",
        "But at the same time, she said, of those covered by religious universities or hospitals...",
        "Women who work, or go to school, at these institutions will have free contraceptive coverage and will no longer have to pay hundreds of dollars a year that could be going towards rent or groceries.",
        "So Julie, help us understand this.",
        "If religious institutions won't have to pay for this contraceptive coverage and women won't, either - I mean, who will?",
        "Well, that's been the big question all along since the administration first floated this concept last year.",
        "The idea is that since paying for birth control is less expensive, in the aggregate, than paying for pregnancy and childbirth, the health insurance company would be happy to pay for it; and that's what the rules require."

        "That means they cover their own health bills and hire a company just to process the claims.",
        "But those claims-processing companies wouldn't save money by paying for contraception because they're not really acting as insurers.",
        "So in that case, who would pay for the contraception?",
        "Well, what the administration is proposing is that those third-party companies go out and find an insurance company to partner with.",
        "And both the insurance company and the third-party claims payer would get paid through a reduction in fees the insurance company will start paying next year.",
        "to participate in these new health market places called health exchanges.",
        "It's kind of - no, it's very complicated, but the hope is that it could produce a workable compromise to what's been a very thorny issue for the administration.",
        "So what's been the reaction to this?",
        "Well, the loudest complaints had been coming from the Catholic Church.",
        "They've, obviously, got the biggest dog in this fight with thousands of schools, universities, hospitals and charities waiting to see how this would all play out.",

        "The vast majority of them, if not all of them, say that it's something that is definitely worth talking about.",
        "And I would say 75 percent of the 13 that I talked to said that it's broken, it's explicitly broken.",
