        "And that's a pretty high mortality rate in about 200 women.",
        "So that's pretty high so far.",
        "And personally, I've lost friends that were 32, 36 and 40 from breast cancer.",

        "So is it the case in Dallas that banks didn't go nuts, if you will, with these no-down-payment loans and all kinds of mortgages that were risky?",
        "I think they were very careful about that here.",
