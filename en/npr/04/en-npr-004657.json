        "It is not.",
        "And we've, I guess, maybe looked at a couple of maps to make sure, but, no. David King, our drummer, came up with the name, just as something that was sort of evocative of sort of the palette that he had in mind for the group.",

        "Ev, you are the keyboard player for the group and you're described, in the press material at least, as the sound architect who provides the glue.",
        "There isn't a producer listed on the CD, so do you fill that function as well?",
        "I would be hesitant to say that, though in probably the strictest old school sense of the word producer, you could say so.",
        "I make sure every note is exactly right during all the editing of the songs and all that kind of stuff.",
        "But that's just as much an engineer, I think, in the role of this band.",
        "I think the band's gestalt is actually the producer more than anything else.",
        "And so you don't get paid extra then?",
        "I wish I did."
