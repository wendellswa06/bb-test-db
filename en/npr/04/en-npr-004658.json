        "He was almost a terrorist mercenary.",
        "He went from supporting nationalist cause to more like a Khalid Sheikh Muhammad kind of character, with a massive ego, and he ultimately proved fairly craven in fact.",
        "His ego fueled a need for attention, and director Olivier Assayas says today's terrorists also need the media but to get past the snapshots and the soundbites.",
        "He says a filmmaker needs the time to tell their story and perhaps more importantly the passage of time.",
        "The message is if we can do this about the past, someone will be able to do it about our own, you know, boogeymen and terrorists in the not so distant future.",
        "Carlos\"\" is premiering in three parts on the Sundance Channel this week.",

        "This is usually left up to the states.",

        "We're focusing in on these two airlines because they were long trips, because are science indicates that if there is a risk, these are the kinds of trips that could pose a risk of transmission.",
        "Well, I think they are going to do this many times over, and this just one particular sector they decided to go in to.",
