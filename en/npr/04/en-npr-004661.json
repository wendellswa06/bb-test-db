        "If you were to advise Hillary Clinton's campaign...",
        "(Laughter).",
        "I'm not suggesting that is any - that is likely to happen at any point in any time in the near future, but what's the single most important piece of advice you would give to that campaign?",
        "You've got to learn to dominate the news cycle.",
        "Donald Trump got up every morning and said something on Twitter that captured the news cycle's imagination.",
