        "That that which is sort of subdued by man has much less potency, and that's sort of which sort of resists the pressures of society, you know, that there's a certain vibrancy and strength with that.",
        "Schlein is dressed in Wellington boots, pretty much the only sensible footwear after several feet of snow have melted in a sudden blast of spring weather.",

        "This and a wood-burning stove are the only protections against the sub-zero temperatures that are the norm here in winter.",
        "On the wall of the tent is a picture of Thoreau, the omnipresence of this cranky 19th century philosopher and naturalist makes you kind of wonder.",

        "Obviously.",
        "If you go to a cafe and have a sandwich and a Coke, and it costs nearly the entirety of a monthly wage of a high-ranking technocratic state official then you will pay for them.",
        "But then you wonder, who are the other people in the cafe who are also eating then?",
        "How can they manage it?",

        "They will do what they need to defend themselves.",
        "But at the level below that, the people who are not fully part of the political battle, they naturally feel that they their interests would be better defended by the current government.",
        "But they're also critical of what the current government has achieved economically because they feel the effects and yet remain uncertain as to what their fates would be, should Juan Guaido or the opposition take power.",
        "Because obviously, they also have the fear that there will be a clear-out of the state, a total revolution of the sort which famously occurred, obviously, in Iraq after 2003.",
        "And they worry, as well, that they will also be utterly marginalized and with no possibilities of gainful employment in the future.",

        "And what happened?",
        "Well, the very senior high command has not moved, which is obviously of concern to the opposition because it was basically fundamental to their plan that there would be a weakening of the military foundations of the government and a new president would be in place.",
        "Has anything happened that might make Nicolas Maduro think that giving up power would be better than keeping it?",
        "Well, at the moment, no. At the moment, he has seen what has happened over the last month or so.",
        "The military, the bulk of the military hasn't moved.",
        "The attempted entry of humanitarian aid on the 23rd of February was a violent and unpleasant spectacle to watch but was not successful.",
        "And Juan Guaido is now back in the country, but things seem to be more or less under his control.",
        "So at the moment, you would say, what motivation would he have to leave power?",
        "But I don't think it's as simple as that.",
