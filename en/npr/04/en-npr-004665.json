        "With an eclipse, our moon passes into the Earth's shadow, which is something it doesn't do every single orbit.",
        "Usually, it's above the shadow, below the shadow, and we see a full moon.",
        "When that full moon, instead, passes through the Earth's shadow, it doesn't go completely dark.",
        "Instead, light from the sun gets bent around the Earth.",
        "It gets refracted around by our own atmosphere.",
        "And that atmosphere tends to scatter out a lot of the blue light leaving the red light to give us this blood red moon for the same reasons that our sunset is red.",
        "Wow.",
        "It sounds incredible, and it will be visible if - assuming the skies are clear, visible all across the United States.",

        "Ah, and - but this is an earthquake zone, as I understand it.",
        "It is, but magnitude nine earthquakes are very rare.",
        "And unlike California and the Pacific west, northwest coast, they have a long history.",
        "So there's 400 years of earthquake records.",
        "Offshore the Tohoku area, where this earthquake struck, there's nothing like this in the record.",
        "So do we have any idea what's going on?",
        "Well, on the one hand, measurements by GPS receivers over the last decade have shown that the entire area that ruptured, the fault was locked, and stress was loading in a contiguous fashion.",
        "So from that vantage point, one can say, always in retrospect, this area was building up stress for a future earthquake, and that earthquake could be as large as the area that was locked."

        "And what was the effect - the earthquake itself wasn't what was causing all the damage.",
        "It was the tsunami, right?",
        "That's right.",
        "Any earthquake where the - in this case the Pacific plate is shoving itself underneath the island of Honshu, Japan, and that causes the sea floor to move up and down, where - both rapidly and then permanently -and that excites the tsunami wave.",
        "Okay, so explain a little more about that.",
        "What is a tsunami wave as opposed another kind of wave?",
        "Well, the only kind of waves we have on the ocean are either driven by wind or by tsunamis.",
        "Those - that's the only show.",
        "And tsunami waves are special in the sense that they arise because huge portions of the sea floor are lifted and dropped, and these waves travel feeling the bottom.",
        "They travel at about the same speeds that aircraft fly, and when they're over the deep part of the ocean, they're very, very broad and very shallow.",
        "They're maybe hundreds of kilometers or hundreds of miles wide and a few feet high.",
        "But then, since they're always feeling the bottom, the sea bottom, when the sea bottom starts to shallow toward the coast, they get very, very steep and very short amplitude.",
        "And so that's when the destruction occurs.",
        "I've tried to - I've tried to understand, and I'm still not sure I do, why these things travel so fast.",
        "I mean, you just don't think of water traveling at 500 miles per hour.",
        "Well, its speed has to do with the depth of the ocean basin, and in fact, the very first measurement of the average depth of the ocean basin came from just knowing the arrival - the time of an earthquake versus the time of the arrival of the tsunami across the Pacific.",
        "And that gave a dead-on answer for the average, oh, one-mile-deep depth of the ocean basin.",
        "Oh, war…",
        "Once the rain lets up, Becky Ebolt(ph), the other teacher, moves class back outside."

        "Can you help me understand that thinking?",
        "Yeah, I think once you're about 85, you start thinking that.",
        "I think that a lot of that comes from what was once considered something that was fixed and, you know, really immutable, that is to say human life expectancy and maximum lifespan.",

        "Yeah, but how is aging not considered immutable?",
        "I mean, people age.",
