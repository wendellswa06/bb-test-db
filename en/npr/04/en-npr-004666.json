        "And so, a guy who normally eats, let's say 2,500 calories, will eat 1,750 calories, and that's a big, big drop, believe me, because I usually eat 2,500 calories.",
        "So what that does you know, the prevailing theory is that somehow this constant form of voluntarily stress through voluntary restriction triggers the body into kind of ancient starvation pathways in which it stops putting your caloric energy into reproduction and growth and instead channels it into bodily maintenance and repair, which is exactly what your body needs as it gets older and starts to wear down.",
        "What's a typical meal for a member of the Caloric Restriction Society?",
        "Brief.",

        "So they will eat things like sardines, which are very high in Omega-3 fatty acids and protein.",
        "They will eat a lot of soups, which are high in nutrients but low in calories.",
        "They will eat a lot of vegetables, fruits and vegetables, but not almost nothing that's fried, which really discouraged me from doing it.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And we know, you know, I mean, it's fairly easy to concoct a, you know, a high-nutrient meal now.",
        "Okay.",
        "So in \"\"The Reluctant Fundamentalist,\"\" Changez, who's the main character, gets slightly upset by something that her father says, and I'm going to read that passage.",
        "So there were - there's a system of buoys that are supposed to note the possibility of an impending tsunami.",
        "Did those work, in this occasion, as expected?",
        "And what did they tell us about - I mean, it seems that the destruction that was, at least warned about in Hawaii, failed to materialize."

        "I don't - these are called the - the so-called DART buoys, which are basically buoys that are tethered by a long chain to the sea floor, and they are offshore.",
        "I don't know if they worked, but I suspect they did.",
        "Japan is very, very well-wired into earthquake preparedness and earthquake warning systems, and they both - they have both warning for the arrival of tsunamis and for the arrival of the shaking.",
        "And my guess is they had notification of the shaking before it hit, as well, I mean, seconds before, minutes before, but before.",
        "So why do some earthquakes, even the ones in the water, fail to cause tsunamis where others do cause tsunamis?",
        "Or do we know that?",
        "It's a really tough call.",
        "It appears that earthquakes that are deeper deform the sea floor less.",
        "Earthquakes that cause huge undersea landslides also trigger tsunamis, but they tend to more localized than these.",
        "In general, the biggest the subduction earthquake, the more likely it is to produce a tsunami, but we do have lots of exceptions...",
        "Can you explain again how subduction works, just to remind us?",
        "Well, the Pacific Plate, which is stretching from Japan all the way to California, is being driven toward the northwest, driven toward Japan and Alaska, at about four inches a year.",
        "And it's jamming itself underneath the island of Honshu, the mainland of Japan.",
        "And what happens is, in some places, that fault is very slippery, and it just goes down every day, goes down the hatch, and we never have any big earthquakes at all.",
        "And in others, the fault is quite stuck, very rough in character.",
        "And then one has these long waits before great earthquakes occur, when finally the stress overcomes the friction in the fault zone, and you - it suddenly leaps forward, 50 feet in this case.",
        "So it's a good reason not to get stuck."

        "Hi there.",

        "And Nila, I talked to my colleague, Christopher Joyce, just before we went on the air.",
        "And he seemed to indicate that the waves were not that high, coming in to the California coast.",

        "I hope so, anyway.",
        "So if you're going to go and study these tsunamis - I mean, let's say - what's your first thing you want to do if you were in Japan and you wanted to study this?",
        "What are you going to look at?",
        "Well, among - there are many interesting things about this earthquake.",
        "Why is it that in this historical record, we only see, let's say, sevens and seven and a halves throughout this area?",
        "They are so small compared to this earthquake, they're about one-thousandth the size, that they don't just don't release appreciable stress.",
        "It looks like this site has been building up stress for 1,000 years.",
        "Why so?",
        "Why is it that we don't see this more commonly?",
        "Another question that arises is that this earthquake did have a foreshock sequence, magnitude 7.2 earthquake that occurred probably in or near the epicentral area, to produce an unusually high rate of aftershocks.",
        "We definitely know that these foreshock sequences are not seen before most great earthquakes, including the nines that we have in Sumatra in 2004 and last year in Chile.",
        "Nevertheless, is there anything that we are going to learn from that foreshock sequence that would give it away as a harbinger of something great to come?"

        "Right.",
        "And I just wanted to clarify something we were talking about earlier.",
        "When we talk about this wave moving at 500 miles per hour, it's not the water itself that's moving along at 500 miles an hour but in fact the height of the wave that's moving along.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "There's kind of a circular and cross-section, or vortical motion of the particles.",
        "But you're right.",
        "You're not going to be jetted along on the water surface at 500 miles an hour.",
        "And as you can see from the imagery, one of the problems of a tsunami is not just its height.",
        "It's its density.",
        "It entrains all this debris.",
        "So it's really not water when it hits shore.",
        "It's like a moving mass of very, very dense material that's entrained in it.",
        "And that's one of the reasons why it's so destructive.",
        "Let's take another call now and go to Michael(ph) in Cleveland, Ohio.",
        "Michael, you're on the air.",
        "Hi, thank you.",
        "I was just wondering if the recent volcanic activity in Hawaii is linked to the earthquake in any way.",
        "Well, I certainly hope not.",
        "I would be flabbergasted if that were the case.",
        "Generally speaking, we don't see how earthquakes and volcanoes could communicate over such vast distances.",
        "And by the same token, I would be very surprised if this earthquake in Japan triggered some activity on the west coast of the United States or in Alaska or South America.",
        "As far as most of us feel, those distances are too great.",
        "So what would you want, ideally, to prove this?",
        "You are.",
        "On the other hand, this earthquake could trigger some very, very large aftershocks in and around Japan, and Tokyo lies just to the south of this rupture zone.",
        "So there are some very real follow-on processes that could happen, but we don't think something, particularly of a volcanic nature in the mid-Pacific, could be related to this.",
        "But this is kind of, I guess, alarming in a way.",
        "If you look at something where you say, well, this is something - I mean, this quake is significantly larger than the ones we've seen up until now and more than we were expecting, does that mean you have to sort of rethink what you knew about the size of a quake someplace?"

        "And so one of the best examples is the Pacific Northwest, where in our short history, there really aren't any large earthquakes at all, but two geologists discovered that there was a magnitude nine in 1700.",
        "You know, here again, we were fooled into not realizing the potential high magnitude of this earthquake.",
