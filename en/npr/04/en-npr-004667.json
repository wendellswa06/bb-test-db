        "- just said they're not going to leave before Hurricane Florence.",
        "Do you have a sense of how many people did evacuate?",
        "A lot, but that's a really hard number to track because, you know, you don't know who went where, and everybody doesn't report where they're going.",
        "We can look at shelter numbers.",
        "Officials say more than 20,000 people are staying in emergency shelters mostly in North Carolina but also some in South Carolina and Virginia.",

        "Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, repeated many times that he doesn't not want them to get into the wrong hands, and by that he means Hezbollah, Hamas or any Islamic group, particularly al-Qaida, that might use them against Israel.",

        "Now obviously the question is, you know, some people have suggested maybe he's using some kind of riot gas or some new - it's unclear what he's actually - what is actually being used, and clearly America doesn't want to get involved.",
        "So if it's just a few people by an accidental exposure or - it's unclear what - where the red line really is, and that's the desperate problem.",
        "And just next door in towns yesterday, over 100 people were being killed by regular weapons.",
        "And it's a mess.",
