        "Thank you so much.",

        "Coming up, we'll hear more about the search for chemical weapons and how difficult the allegations of their use are to prove.",

        "This is TALK OF THE NATION, I'm Jennifer Ludden.",
        "The White House today reiterated that it has not concluded that Syria's President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons inside the country.",
        "A spokesperson for President Obama says the administration is concerned about reports from Britain, France and now Israel that those weapons were used multiple times.",

        "supports a U.N.",
        "investigation to find out.",
        "That is a challenge in itself.",
        "Joining us now in Studio 42 is Amy Smithson; she's a senior fellow at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies and the author of \"\"Germ Gambits: The Bioweapons Dilemma, Iraq and Beyond.\"\" Welcome to you.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "So the Israelis, the British, the French, how are they getting the information, and what makes them think, as far as we know, that Syrians are using chemical weapons?",
        "Well, an Israeli military spokesman said that they had done a lot of their analysis by looking at photographs and making a determination by what they could see from the photographs.",
        "Having said that, there are a lot of things that will kill animals and also cause people to foam at the mouth, and that may not necessarily indicate a classic chemical warfare agent.",
        "The French and the British have apparently gathered soil samples and have witness testimony, and they're characterizing that as credible but not definitive."

        "They didn't specify who had taken the photos but just that they were making their analysis in part from photographs.",
        "And I think that's again a very sketchy thing to do.",
        "This is best determined in terms of what exactly was used by using soil samples and a variety of other samples.",
        "Well, there's a U.N.",
        "investigative team, and if they get a chance to get on the ground, they'll be trying to get a variety of samples, including samples from any munitions or devices that might have been involved in these attacks, from clothing or respirator canisters, environmental samples from the soil, food and water, biomedical samples from humans or animals, and also crop or vegetation samples.",
        "Chemical residues tend to stick around in the environment for quite some time.",
        "Now, what about - have there been, you know, people who've crossed over and been treated at different hospitals, maybe across the border, who have had doctors examine them and said what they think is happening?",
        "In what the British and the French have said and what the Israelis have said to date, they haven't really specified who.",
        "They've just talked about witness testimony.",
        "And in these circumstances, it kind of gives an entirely new spin on the phrase fog of war, because if you're a citizen and you're not very, you know, knowledgeable about chemicals, anything that blurs your vision, that causes you to cough, to be nauseous and to shake and collapse is going to perhaps in these circumstances sound like a chemical warfare agent.",
        "But as a matter of fact, it can be any number of toxic industrial chemicals that might have caused such symptoms.",
        "Wow.",
        "Is there a team trying to gain access to find out more?"

        "Yes, what some of your listeners may be surprised to know is that the Syrian government requested, by letter, that the United Nations secretary general send in an investigation team, which is something he's had the authority to do for a couple of decades.",
        "And a team has been assembled, and it is pre-deployed in part to the island of Cyprus, and this is what has been happening, especially during the 1980s, on a number of other occasions, to try to find out the facts of what happened.",
        "OK, so the Assad regime has called for this?",
        "The Assad regime called for this particular investigation.",
        "There have been accusations by Syrian opponents that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons in the past, but that they would request this investigation may strike some as counterintuitive.",
        "But there have been other governments recently that have requested this investigation, the governments of Japan and South Korea, and I believe Luxemburg.",
        "In their countries or in Syria, we're talking?",
        "In Syria.",
        "In Syria.",
        "So - but has this - why do we think the Assad regime requested the investigation, and what do they want to show?",
        "Because they've also accused the rebels, have they not, of using chemical weapons?",
        "Yes, one can turn this coin on several different sides.",
        "One can see perhaps that it would serve the Syrian government's interests if the team were to come in and not be able to point the finger at them, because for quite some time, especially since last summer's admissions that they would use chemical weapons if there were foreign intervention, and some people took that admission by the foreign minister as an admission that they possessed this stockpile that many governments widely believed they do in fact possess.",
        "So they might think they can perhaps get away with it.",
        "But in that case, I would encourage them to read the fine print of the treaty, because here's where they could run into trouble and where many people trying to make this red line very bright in terms of whether or not chemical weapons were used.",
        "Chemical weapons are defined in Article 2 of the treaty that bans chemical weapons as a munition or a device or a piece of equipment especially designed to distribute chemical warfare agents.",
        "But they're also defined as any toxic chemical, and that spreads this much larger than the classic warfare agents that everyone knows of, the nerve agents Sarin and VX and mustard gas, things that are specifically in a category that is prohibited except for - for defensive purposes.",
        "But it spreads - that definition spreads it much, much broader, and so if indeed some toxic chemical is involved, that's still a no-no."

        "But who is on this team that is poised to potentially go into Syria?",
        "Well, the leader of this team is actually a Swedish scientist that I've had the pleasure of interviewing for \"\"Germ Gambits.\"\" His name is Ake Sellstrom, and he used to be the head of the Swedish Chemical and Biological Defense Research Institute.",
        "But he's also a veteran inspector from the United Nations Special Commission, which was established in the aftermath of the 1991 war to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles.",
        "Was he among the group that for years kind of we saw the cat and mouse game with people going into Iraq and then trying to find weapons that I guess in the end never exist - were there?",
        "But we watched that drama for years.",
        "They were there after the 1991 war.",
        "In fact the United Nations Special Commission oversaw the destruction of Iraq's chemical weapons stockpile, and \"\"Germ Gambits\"\" tells the story of how they did what nobody thought was possible, which is to find a covert biological weapons program.",
        "So they were pretty much stripped of weapons of mass destruction.",
        "Their nuclear program was arrested by UNSCOM as well, uncovered and arrested and stopped in the early 1990s, as opposed to in the 2000s timeframe.",
        "But Ake has been in any number of tight pinches as an inspector.",
        "He has had to deal with very complicated technical issues, and he's also been in situations where senior Iraqi leaders were putting a great deal of political pressure on him.",
        "So do we expect them to gain access and...",
        "Right now there's a little bit of back and forth happening between the secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, who has gone beyond, in the opinion of some, what the Syrian government requested, which is an investigation of what happened at Aleppo.",
        "He has talked about also sending this team to Damascus and to Homs, where other chemical incidents have been reported by the press.",
        "OK, so we have locations under dispute here.",
        "What happens if he gets there?",
        "What would he - give us a scenario.",

        "And a lot of time you can literally reverse engineer from the fragments, just as what was happening in Boston when they were putting together this pressure cooker.",

        "That does seem incredibly difficult.",
        "I mean you were talking much after the fact, and you're going to find little fragments, assuming they would just be left where they had exploded, I guess?",
        "This is a situation that is going to be terribly challenging.",
