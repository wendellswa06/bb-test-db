        "But what they're going to be doing - this team is likely to rely on the logistics of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.",
        "They do have field sampling, but that requires taking a heck of a lot of equipment into the field, which may be dangerous under these circumstances with hostilities still underway.",
        "So chances are they're going to grab samples and send them off to that organization's stable of certified laboratories for analysis that will be very, very accurate.",
        "I guess, you know, if this is a lot of ifs here, I guess, there's high-stakes negotiations going on.",
        "But if they were to find evidence that chemical weapons had been used, what happens next?",

        "...let's keep in mind that this is a technical investigation that's taking place in a rather politicized atmosphere.",
        "And at the end of the day, this is kind of like the - a police investigation being reported to a jury.",
        "And in that investigative report, you might see things, and I'm going to give you a paraphrase of a couple of the reports that came out of the investigations in 1988 when the secretary-general sent in a similar team to investigate allegations of use of chemical weapons during that war, and that had happened on a number of other occasions as well.",
        "And in one case, what they were saying was that chemical weapons was - were used against Iranian positions, and they knew this from soil samples and from the fragments of weapons that they found.",
        "And in a second report in 1988, they said that they had found similar weapon fragments that have been used in attacks in 1984, 1986 and 1987, quote, \"\"indicating their repeated utilization by Iraqi forces.\"\" Now, that's where the investigators have gone about as far as one can in naming a culprit.",
        "In this case, they were very, very certain.",
        "But in this - but in Syria, they may not be able to figure out who did what.",
        "Let me just remind people: You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "That does raise the question: If you - even if you have this evidence - you've talked about paint chips and so forth - how do you then prove who - which side used them?",
        "If there's not a device that was involved in this, that opens all sorts of possibilities, and we can't ignore that there are other parties in this conflict that may have motivations to be able to point the finger at the Syrian government.",
        "Now, this is not an attractive thing to think of, but was someone else deliberately releasing either a warfare agent or a toxic industrial chemical in order to try to get outside intervention, more outside assistance, and that would be the Syrian opposition that one might think could consider that.",
        "I don't want to, but it's a possibility you can't rule out.",
        "And another possibility is that this is something that just happened as the result of the exchange of, you know, bombs and artillery.",
        "These facilities that hold toxic industrial chemicals are located in and around many of these cities.",
        "And if something that's explosive goes off near one of these facilities, it could rupture a tank and cause a leak.",
        "In which case, it wasn't intentional, but the results were still the same.",
        "But you have each side with an interest in putting the blame on the other, and then doesn't - even geography play into that.",
        "I mean maybe the Assad regime wants the inspectors to look in one place but not necessarily in another place.",
        "Who decides if they get access, where they go?",
        "Well, I think this is going to be a relatively delicate dance that is taking place diplomatically trying to negotiate access.",
        "We know that they were asked to go to Aleppo whether or not Ban Ki-moon is successful in getting them access to Homs and Damascus as well remains to be seen.",
        "That would be ideal, but ideal may not be what happens in these circumstances.",
        "At the end of the day, I think we should all be very grateful that the secretary-general is willing to send in the team, that there are inspectors that are willing to put their lives on the line to try to find out the facts and to shed light on what's happening in Syria with regard to chemicals.",
        "Hopefully, this will underscore that this is an act that no one wants to deliberately engage in, and it will cause further precaution on the part of the Syrian forces in safeguarding that vast arsenal that they have and not using it."
