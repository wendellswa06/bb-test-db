        "And so, the guy who wrote this up was a very legitimate researcher.",
        "He happened to say: this parallels the reduction of about 20 years of chronological time in these patients.",
        "And that is really where the entire industry took off because you had really at the same time - this is really important, a whole generation of doctors who wanted to get out of traditional medicine, dealing with insurance companies, HMOs, and get into an all-cash business.",
        "Anti-aging medicine, I think more than if you just go look at it purely as an industry, I would say that's really what it's about.",
        "It's a way that physicians who are tired of the old system sort of were able to reinvent themselves and repackage themselves.",
        "What do you estimate the industry is worth now?",
        "Well, they say $50 billion, but you know, they cluster that with a whole bunch of other things.",
        "I mean, if you go to one of their Association of American Anti-Aging Medicine, or A4M, which holds their annual conference instructively at The Venetian Hotel in Los Angeles, you go out on the floor, and it's, you know, incredibly entertaining because there's everything from devices that are supposed to correct your relationship to gravity as if we needed it corrected.",
        "You see, you know, something that was popular in the early 20th century, which is glandular extracts, grinding up various glands of various animals, putting them in a capsule and telling people, you know, if you have pancreatic problems, here's extract of sheep pancreas, take this.",
        "Aside from the obvious ethical questions all of this opens up, how does society let's talk about American society deal with such a huge number of senior citizens?",
        "I mean, it's estimated that by the middle of this century, there will be something like 88 million senior citizens in this country.",
        "I mean, how then do you deal with things like Social Security, Medicare, and beyond just taking care of this population?",
        "Well, this is the explosive part of it.",
        "Given these statistics, you can really make the case and I think there's something to it that aging will really turn child against parent, worker against worker, man against woman, and I'll give you three examples.",
        "Child against parent, obviously the resentment about, you know, the burden of Social Security, but also, you know, the burden on the individual child to take care of the parent.",
        "Worker against worker, we know that the percentage of in the working ages between 18 and 64 will decline from 63 percent to about 57 percent, while we'll add eight and a half million workers over the age of 65.",
        "So you'll have competition from older workers.",
        "So there'll be some friction there.",
        "And the other, I think the most troubling one, is the gender wars, which is, you know, men by age 85, about 60 percent of men will be married, okay, and that's usually because they can get married again because of the obvious gender problems we have in modern society.",
        "Fifteen percent of women over age 85 will be married.",
        "So that is huge, and so you will be having and another part of it, I think somebody will write an interesting movie about it, is that you'll have older guys very successfully competing with younger guys for fairly young women."

        "The gains will be quite modest in the foreseeable future.",
        "You know, the most optimistic is that we'll add a year every year between now and 2030 if a reasonable portion of some of the anti-aging interventions in mainstream medicine work.",

        "Novelist Mohsin Hamid's foodies are part of the fabric of Pakistan rarely glimpsed by the West, which is why today we continue our series on Pakistan with a literary tour of the country.",
        "Mohsin Hamid and novelist Kamila Shamsie grew up in two very different cities in that country - one ancient and elegant, the other a roiling coastal mega city.",
        "And in their most recent novels, both authors challenged Western perspectives of Pakistan, and they joined us from our bureau in London.",
        "Good morning, and thank you for joining us.",

        "So they will take a vocal role in not seeing that happen.",
        "Well, what's A-Rod's best argument, do you think, as he tries to fight the suspension?",
        "In my view, A-Rod's best argument is to say: There is nowhere in the CBA, the Collective Bargaining Agreement, or in the joint drug-testing program that authorizes a 211-game suspension.",
        "So he is going to argue, in essence, where are you getting this from.",
        "And that's a strong argument because he may not be able to get the suspension overruled, but he probably has a good shot at getting it reduced.",
        "Would you imagine he would also go after the evidence itself, whatever baseball has from this clinic in Florida?",
        "Yeah, Rodriguez is going to go hard after this evidence.",
        "He's going to say, look, you are basing much of the evidence against me on the testimony of someone who, a few months ago, you sued - Tony Bosch, the director of Biogenesis, the clinic in Miami - and in the lawsuit you portrayed him kind of like a drug dealer.",
        "And now you're saying he's a credible source of information, now he's believable, and you're going to use what he's saying against me.",
        "Now, baseball has implied that they have other evidence beyond what Tony Bosch has said, but he will now be a key point in Rodriguez's defense.",
        "But does it work against A-Rod then that the other 12 players agreed to their own suspensions for 50 games?",
        "In other words, they apparently accepted the evidence against them."
