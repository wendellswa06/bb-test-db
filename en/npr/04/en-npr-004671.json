        "Yeah, it's a very good point because if Tony Bosch and the other evidence that baseball has is not credible, why would 12 out of these 13 players - and 13th being Rodriguez - agree to these penalties?",

        "Second, you have to cross the bridge between the bureaucratics of Africa and the bureaucratics of the Middle East because Middle Eastern countries are heavily involved in two of those crises, Sudan and Somalia.",
        "So we need a new peace structure to deal with it, and we need to work very much with these African countries and the surrounding countries to deal with those.",
        "So you need a high level, intensive, well-staffed, well-directed peace process, and we haven't put that together in any of these three crises so far.",
        "Let's talk for a moment about the economics of Africa.",
        "Some critics have said that there is fear that, given what President-elect Obama has said in the past about trade, that his approach might hinder economic growth in Africa.",
