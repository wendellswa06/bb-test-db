        "But when you all switch from one book to the other, I mean, do you go back to the other one?",
        "Or does this mean that your chances of actually finishing a certain - a given book go down?",
        "No, I generally finish what I start.",
        "It just takes longer to finish because I'm reading several books at the same time.",
        "And sometimes, do you ever put - I kind of put other books in between sometimes if I'm afraid to finish a book, because I'm so involved in it, and I am loving it so much I don't want it to end.",
        "We've all have that feeling with books that are particularly special to us.",
        "I've recently reread Carson McCullers' \"\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.\"\" And I really got kind of anxious because I knew it had to end, and I didn't want it to end.",

        "For one thing, we don't have those long stretches of not only leisure time, but time without interruption, interruption from other kinds of things: The phone ringing or kids coming home from school or maybe the boss hollering over our shoulder.",

        "So we've lost those quiet spaces and our leisure moments, in many cases.",
        "So I do worry that maybe some of this rushing around restlessly from book to book is more a symptom of our times rather than a good thing.",
        "But it's a habit that I can't break at this point, is that I've been doing it since I was, you know, old enough to read.",

        "And so I can refer to other books during class, but also I might say: Oh, I've read this somewhere else, and I don't remember what it is.",
