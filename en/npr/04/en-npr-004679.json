        "Now, a U.S.",
        "Navy ship got a distress call from a different ship; this large vessel.",
        "And that distress call said they were about to be boarded by pirates carrying rocket-propelled grenades.",
        "The Navy ship sent out a helicopter which hovered above the suspected pirates.",
        "Then the Navy followed them back to an Iranian fishing boat, which the supposed pirates were using as a mother ship.",
        "Now, aboard that fishing boat they found 13 Iranians who said they were held by pirates for at least two months.",
        "The Navy crew gave them food and water and clothing, and sent them on their way and took what they say are 15 Somali pirates aboard the USS John Stennis, an aircraft carrier.",
        "And through it all, not a shot was fired.",
        "And these U.S.",
        "Navy ships, these were the same - from the same carrier battle group that had just left the Persian Gulf, and Iran threatened them if they returned?",
        "That's right, Robert.",
        "The two American ships involved here, the cruiser Mobile Bay and the destroyer USS Kidd, were from that same carrier group.",
        "And the carrier, John Stennis now holding the alleged pirates, is the same ship the Iranian government warned not to come back to the Persian Gulf.",
        "And a lot of this tough talk, of course, revolves around the prospect of more sanctions aimed at the Iranian government over their nuclear program.",
        "And the thing is this saber rattling really isn't all that new.",
        "Four years ago, Iranian naval vessels threatened to shoot U.S.",
        "ships in the Persian Gulf and then withdrew.",
        "But back to today's rescue of the Iranians who'd been held by the pirates.",
        "In the movies, this would lead to a sudden warming of relations with Tehran and everything would be happy.",
        "Not today, huh?",
        "Oh, no warm relations yet and actually no word at all from the Iranian government about what happened here.",
        "The Navy does say the Iranian fishing boat captain, however, was very thankful.",
        "And that some of the clothing the Iranians got, there's some talk that includes U.S.",
        "Navy t-shirts.",
        "But no firm word on whether than happened or not.",

        "They face charges of smuggling guns and other property.",
        "As NPR's Joel Rose reports, the arrests come at a time when the NYPD is already facing a range of corruption allegations.",
        "The investigation that led to today's arrests started with a conversation about ticket-fixing in 2009.",
        "From there, law-enforcement officials say it grew into a full-fledged smuggling investigation.",
        "U.S.",
        "Attorney Preet Bharara announced the charges at a news conference today in Manhattan.",
        "The complaint describes how a group of crime fighters took to moonlighting as criminals, and how a number of men once charged with enforcing the law are now charged with breaking it.",
        "Bharara says the defendants conspired to transport what they thought were stolen goods, including cigarettes and slot machines, across state lines.",
        "These goods were not in fact stolen.",
        "They were supplied by an undercover officer working under the direction and supervision of the FBI, in close coordination with the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau.",
        "I suspect that some people may be deterred from voting now because of the insecure environment."

        "But I realized, the more they lost, they fewer fans actually wanted to go to Shea Stadium, and I realized I had less competition that way.",
        "So I was kind of torn between rooting for the Mets and rooting for my own personal gain.",
        "But…",

        "Oh, my.",

        "And for $1.30, you'd get a seat in the upper stands.",
