        "Think about it: The umpires have to enter and exit the field before the game.",
        "And at the end of the game, the home plate umpire will probably have a few extra baseballs in the pouches on his hip.",
        "And if you know where those umpires exit the field and if you can actually get past security, or if you're lucky enough to have a ticket down in the front row there, you can very well get that umpire to hand you a ball on his way out.",
        "But it's not a game-used ball.",
        "You know, it's true.",
        "It would be a game-rubbed ball with mud.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "From the Delaware River, yes, indeed.",
        "You know, and there's just so many different ways to connect to the game.",
        "Some people like to keep score and some people play fantasy baseball.",
        "And for me and so many other people, we just - we love to take home a part of it.",
        "And that's really the allure of the whole thing.",
        "Do you keep track of who hit every ball you've got?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Well, things changed over the first couple of decades of the 20th century.",
        "And thank God for that because I might not be talking to you otherwise.",
        "I try to.",
        "Sometimes, you know, if I am there before the game and players - if I'm way out in the outfield, 400 feet from home plate and players are wearing their warm-up jerseys over their uniform numbers I - if I can't identify a guy based on his batting stance, then I won't know who hit it.",
        "But I do keep very detailed statistics and just information on my computer and on my blog about this.",
        "So, yeah, it's very well-documented."

        "And what is the art of catching a homerun ball?",
        "You just have to be in the right place at the right time?",
        "Well, that's certainly part of it.",
        "There's a lot of luck involved.",
        "But as Branch Rickey said, luck is the residue of design.",
        "Positioning is obviously a huge part of it.",
        "And one thing that helps -and, again, this can apply to foul balls as well as homeruns - you can really try to think like a manager or a scout, and think about all the different factors.",
        "For example, I always pay close attention to the pitching match up.",
        "Are there lefties pitching?",
        "Are there righties pitching?",
        "Because managers prefer to stack their line-ups with batters who hit from the opposite side of the plate from which the pitcher throws.",
        "So if there are two lefties going, for example, there'll be a lot of right-handed batters in the line up.",
        "All the switch hitters will be batting righty.",
        "So if you're going for a homerun, well, most batters pull homeruns, righties would be hitting homeruns to left field.",
        "But foul balls generally - they're a result of the batter swinging late and underneath the ball, so they'd go to the opposite side, like the first base side of the stadium.",
        "So you can really pick your spots according to the pitching match-ups and other factors as well.",

        "And my buddy and I ran over.",
        "He's the one who actually picked it up.",
        "But the big surprising thing after we were so excited about getting this foul ball is that the ushers came and made us give the ball back.",
        "No.",
