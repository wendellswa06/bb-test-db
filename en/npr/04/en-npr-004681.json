        "You show up at batting practice, you get a ball tossed to you.",

        "And then the big money.",
        "That's the actual game homerun ball.",
        "And there are places, as she mentioned, Royal Stadium in Kansas City, that's - there's this big grassy area in dead centerfield, the so-called batter's eye, which is supposed to be kept blank, so the batter can see the ball coming out of the pitcher's hand.",
        "Nevertheless, a lot of homerun balls land there and you see people scrambling over the wall and running out under the grass to see if they can get it.",
        "Yup.",

        "And, you know, people will say, that, oh, if you're 12 years old, you shouldn't bring your glove, but come on, all these baseballs that I caught, I would not have - I definitely would not have caught the Barry Bonds homerun without a glove.",
        "Definitely would not have caught the last Mets homerun at Shea without a glove because it was so crowded.",
        "And a lot of times, the glove just gives you a few extra inches of reach.",
        "With the Bonds homerun, I was leaning as far as I possibly could over a railing and caught the ball in the very tip of the glove.",

        "In the years since, that same kid has gotten at least two balls each game I have been to from various players and coaches at the end of each inning.",
        "Worse still, his younger brother is now getting into the act - bitter, bitter, bitter.",
        "Do you remember who hit the first ball you got Zach Sample(ph)?",
        "It's certainly bears watching and, more than just watching, engagement by us as a nation to try to get them to be much more transparent in what they're doing, which they are not, and to encourage them to construct a military that's only appropriate to their internal needs and not to pursue some aggressive path.",

        "It was by a pitcher on the Mets, and I don't remember who unfortunately.",
        "The first foul ball I ever got - kind of a funny story: 1922, Shea Stadium, it was hit Darren Fletcher, a lefty and I was over on the third base side.",
        "The ball landed a few rows behind me.",
        "I sort of turned and bent down and looked over my seat behind me, and amazingly I saw the ball trickling right down the steps towards me.",
        "So I lunged and grabbed it.",
        "And then having seen fans celebrate their foul ball snags on TV, I decided to jump up and hold up the ball triumphantly.",
        "But unfortunately, I had forgotten that I ducked underneath an orange metal railing.",
        "And just whacked the back of my head while standing up.",
        "So throbbing pain but jubilation at the same time.",
        "Held onto that baseball.",

        "So let's ask what seems like a simple question - are those fears about inflation justified?",
        "We asked NPR economic correspondent John Ydstie to help us figure this out.",

        "That's the biggest increase in almost a decade.",
        "And that's good news for workers, says economist Gus Faucher of PNC Financial Group.",
        "But, he says, it also could be sowing the seeds of inflation.",
        "Businesses are reporting that it's difficult for them to find the workers that they need so they respond by raising pay.",
        "That's obviously good news for workers, but it does raise concerns about inflationary pressures building.",
        "And, Faucher says, the big tax cut and spending package from Washington added even more fuel for economic growth.",
        "He says that's likely to push unemployment even lower and force businesses to pay even more for workers."
