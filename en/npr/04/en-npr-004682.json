        "With higher pay, businesses try to recoup that by raising the prices for the goods and services they sell.",
        "And so that leads to stronger overall inflation, which is prices throughout the economy.",
        "And that's how inflation normally ramps up.",
        "But economist Megan Greene is skeptical that classic model of wage and price inflation is working in today's economy, and she thinks the tax windfall that companies have coming could actually be used in a way that puts some downward pressure on inflation.",
        "I think there's an avenue for the windfall from the tax bill that most analysts aren't considering, and that's that companies decide that they're going to try to protect their market share by cutting prices as they're trying to compete with huge conglomerates like Amazon.",
        "That windfall could allow companies to raise wages while keeping prices for goods and services they sell in check.",
        "And Greene, who's the chief economist at Manulife, says there are other powerful disinflationary forces in the economy, including globalization.",

        "M.",
        "GREENE: As the baby boomers are retiring, we're replacing them with much younger, cheaper workers.",
        "And so there isn't a lot of upper pressure on wages or inflation.",
        "The government's most recent reports on consumer and producer prices, issued just last week, did show inflation rising.",
        "But Greene points out that the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is still running below the level the central bank thinks is best for the economy.",
        "She says inflation will likely move higher for technical reasons in the second quarter of this year, but she predicts the increase won't last.",
        "Gus Faucher acknowledges that inflation remains below the Fed's goal, but he sees the recent uptick as a warning sign.",
        "And if we continue to see inflation accelerate then the Fed may need to raise rates more aggressively.",
        "But though fear of rising inflation and rising interest rates was blamed for the stock market sell-off, investors seemed to be saying never mind.",
        "Despite the worse-than-expected inflation reports and a rise in interest rates, stock markets have gained back more than half the ground they lost during the correction.",

        "Read as if they're still quite concerned, it's not a huge change over what it said last time, but it is something of a change.",
        "Why, after a quarter point cut, if one can ever explain why markets do things, why would the stock market plunge?",
        "Well, I think that the main thing they were looking for was more action somewhere else.",
        "They were looking for some creative policymaking a little bit away from the federal funds rate itself; that's the overnight interbank lending rate.",
        "There's another interest rate that the Federal Reserve controls as well.",
        "They make loans to banks, and that lending rate, called the discount rate, is something that the markets thought they were going to cut by more than the quarter point that they cut back.",
        "So it's - it not only is dismayed on what was said, but more about what was not said in the statement.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "I mean, I think that there - they didn't cut the discount rate by more than 25 basis points or a quarter of a point, they also didn't say that there was significant risk of further economic slowing.",
        "They just sort of left out the part about the fact that risks, as they say, were balanced which is what they said last time, and they said uncertainties become worst.",
        "We really just don't know what the future holds.",
        "Now, whenever the Fed reduces interest rates, it's trying to make money move faster through the economy, get more money out there, and then there's a fear that it might increase inflation.",

        "Historically, what does that say - the federal fund's rate at 4.25 percent?",
        "It's something close to what I would call neutral.",
        "It may be slightly high even for the current environment for neutral, but I don't think so.",
        "So it just sort of says, you know, if everything were going along the way the way that we though it should, 4.25 percent would be just about right for us to hit our objectives and our goals.",
        "But if I understand you, that means that if the economy continues to either slow down or were we to move in to an actual recession, there's lots more room to go down dropping interest rates.",
