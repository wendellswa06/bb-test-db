        "Yeah.",
        "So explain what podcasting is and tell folks why I'm so excited about this.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, podcasting, in the most laymen's term possible, is the ability for you to subscribe to audio or video content that interests you.",
        "In other words, you may subscribe to a magazine or you may subscribe to a newspaper because you like that content.",
        "Well, in the digital world we call that podcasting.",
        "So now you can receive to your computer audio files or video files that then can be played on your computer or seamlessly transferred to your MP3 player device or to a CD that you carry with you.",
        "The whole idea is being able to subscribe to content, that when it changes and is being updated with new segments or new content, you want it when it happens and then you want to be able to play it and listen to it when you want to.",
        "And that's kind of the nutshell of podcasting.",
        "What makes podcasting so good for the folks like us who are in radio?",
        "Because it's just a way - another extension of how you can connect your content to your audience.",
        "You know, Farai, I know that, you know, you guys work hard, as do all the other programs that are on NPR and other radio programs that are out there.",

        "And sometimes your listener isn't available in the car or online or near a radio, to be able to pick up your show when it's airing, when it's live at that time.",
        "So how else can people not miss what Farai is talking about or the topics and the guests that you have on the show?",
        "Podcasting enables that.",
        "So that's why it's become so popular for you to not miss important content that you regard or you value as important content in your life.",
        "Well, speaking of important content in my life, now that we have the whole show podcast - and I should say before that we had the Roundtable podcast, now that we have the whole show podcast, maybe you can lead me to a little demo.",
        "Now we're remote.",
        "You are on East Coast.",
        "I'm on the West Coast, but I have my handy dandy laptop.",
        "I have my iPod.",
        "Show me what to do.",

        "I pulled up my - I have my laptop here with me as well.",
        "Okay.",
        "And what I do, the easiest thing that I do - some people could go to npr.org/podcast.",
        "I think it's easier or more direct, if you will, for NEWS & NOTES podcasting to go straight to npr.org.",
        "On the left-hand side on the page, you'll see NEWS & NOTES as one of the shows, one of the programs.",
        "And then when you click on that, you're on the NEWS & NOTES page, and when you scroll down to the bottom right-hand side, you'll see related podcasts.",
        "Okay.",
        "So once you're on, this is kind of the NPR podcast page for this show, and there are a few ways that you can subscribe.",
        "At this point what you're saying is, I want to subscribe to this particular show's information.",
        "And they give you a couple of buttons on the Web site.",
        "iTunes is one software that you can use to download programs but you can use things like Yahoo.",
        "You can use Podcaster.",
        "But for the sake of argument, let's do, since you have iTunes on your computer, you're going to click on the iTunes graphics.",
        "So go ahead, Farai, and click on the iTunes graphic there."
