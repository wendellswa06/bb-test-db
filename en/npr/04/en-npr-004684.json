        "Besides the stealth factor, Trooper Gonzalez can attest to the fact the Charger is fast.",
        "Recently when tried to stop a speeding motorcyclist, the chase topped out at 145 miles an hour.",
        "The motorcycle thought he was going to be able to lose me.",
        "After 120, kept going, 145.",

        "Well, it is plausible.",
        "We know that when it gets very hot outside or inside, people tend to eat less.",
        "And so the more they are exposing themselves to air conditioning, which leads to cooler temperatures, the less their food intake will be reduced in the hot summer months.",
        "Now, before we move onto the other factors how did you come to the conclusion that the big two, as you call them, were not enough of an explanation?",

        "It seems to be a great way for you to have one device so you're not carrying two.",
        "Many people have smart phones.",
        "The downside to this is, it's not offered on all of the carriers right now, but essentially just another way of trying to make, you know, content more accessible to you, and it's going to be something that we're going to continue to see as it relates to cell phones.",
        "We're already seeing live television coming out for the first time in the U.S.",
        "So it only makes sense that you should be able to also get audio content on your cell phone as well."

        "It's almost as simple as a copy and paste of the file into those folders on your computer.",
        "Another way to kind of keep your podcasting fresh is within some of the software, specifically like in iTunes, you can go into the preferences menu in their advanced section, and in that area you can say under - they have a tab for podcasting - and in there you can say how much do I want to keep.",
        "Do I want all the old shows automatically removed and just replace it with a new one?",

        "You know, like when you buy music, Farai, it's kind of - it has some encryption on there, and you can't just automatically burn it to a CD.",
        "But with the podcast, and with the NPR NEWS & NOTES podcast in particular, you can just take that content and burn it right to a CD.",
