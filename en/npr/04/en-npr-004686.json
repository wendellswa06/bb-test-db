        "And you say that when we talk so much about Iraq and Afghanistan in recent years, talking about strategies in both of those countries, we're talking about operations and tactics and not about strategy.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think so.",
        "I mean, the president gives every evidence of being a pragmatist, somebody who deals in the real world.",
        "That's a good thing.",
        "That's an improvement over what we had when we had an administration that tended to ignore reality.",
        "But the argument I try to make in that short piece is that pragmatism needs to be informed by some larger vision, purpose, strategy, if you will.",
        "And at least - I have not seen that strategy articulated either by the president or by anybody else in his administration up to this point.",
        "The surge, as you describe it, for Afghanistan, cannot come as a surprise.",
        "He campaigned on that and is, thus far, stuck reasonably closely to his timetable to draw down American forces in Iraq.",
        "Yeah.",
        "But if you, you know, if you put those two wars in the context of - if you identify them as theaters in the so-called long war, really, what the president is doing is attempting to shut down one theater - we'll see if he's able to do that - at the same time that he ratchets things up in another theater.",
        "I mean, I understand the argument for doing that, but why exactly is it necessary for the United States to engage in, really, perpetual war?",
        "I mean, I am struck.",
        "Here we are in the summer of Michael Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor and Walter Cronkite.",
        "We have become a people, that for all practical purposes, accepts the reality that we are going to be engaged in war from now until the cows comes home.",
        "And it seems to me that we ought not to accept that without having somebody demonstrate that perpetual war is an imperative and that there is no alternative.",
        "So the overarching principles of - well, to borrow a phrase from many years ago, of why we fight.",
        "Exactly right.",
        "And, I mean, to my mind, really, there have been no - the one thing you could say for the Bush administration is that for all their fantasies, they did articulate a vision for what the long war was supposed to accomplish.",
        "And they imagined that through the use of American hard power we could undertake some grand transformation of the Islamic world, bring about peace, democracy, stability and alike.",
        "It was a foolish vision, but it was a vision.",
        "And I'm simply arguing that the president owes it to us to provide an alternative vision and to explain why the expenditure of lives and treasure in places like Afghanistan contributes to some larger purpose.",
        "And he hasn't given us that statement yet.",
        "The idea that - well, the last time we left Afghanistan to its own devices, a group grew there and was - harbored there that attacked this country.",
        "That, in itself, is not enough reason??"

        "I must say it's not for me.",
        "And I understand, clearly, that mine is a minority voice here.",
        "I mean, the argument is that 9/11 happened because we ignored Afghanistan.",
        "Therefore, to prevent another 9/11, we have to transform - we have to fix Afghanistan.",
        "My argument is, well, that misses, I think, a much more immediate explanation for 9/11.",
        "The reason 9/11 happened is because we didn't defend ourselves adequately.",
        "I mean, the federal state and local agencies who are responsible for aviation security didn't undertake even minimally adequate measures that would keep 19 thugs with box cutters from perpetrating that.",
        "So, one of my principles that I would like to see be at the foundation of our strategy is that we will defend the country by defending the country, rather than imagining that the defense of the country requires this projection of American power in far-off, landlocked, undeveloped countries like Afghanistan - remembering that here in this particular moment in our history, it's not as if we have a lot of sort of spare change and spare soldiers laying around.",
        "In fact, the limits of American power have been clearly, I think, demonstrated by the events of the last three or four years.",
        "And recognizing limits means that we ought to consider alternative courses of action.",
        "And a president who was elected because he promised to change the way Washington works, seems to me, that the change ought to extend to considering the possibility of changing the assumed fundamentals of U.S.",
        "national security policy.",
        "This is known in terms of artist, strategic doctrine.",
        "And we saw some manifestations of it just this week.",
        "Vice President Biden has been on a tour in Eastern Europe and said again, to Ukraine, that the United States supports Ukraine's entry into the NATO alliance and was in Georgia today - the country that fought a brief war with Russian, and Russian allied forces just a year ago - and said that the United States will stand by Georgia.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, that's certainly not changing the way Washington works because that really reflects a perpetuation of a policy of eastward expansion of NATO that we've undertaken since the end of the Cold War.",
        "Now, let me be clear, the eastward expansion of NATO at Russia's expense certainly made sense to a degree.",
        "It certainly succeeded in incorporating, fully into Europe, the countries of so-called Eastern Europe that used to be part of the old Soviet empire.",
        "But we've long since passed the point of diminishing returns in that regard, and it really makes very little sense for us to keep, you know, poking the Russian bear in the eye on these matters -intruding into what the Russians see as their sphere of influence, especially given the fact that the Obama administration sees Russian assistance as increasingly vital in order to sustain the Afghanistan war.",
        "Make - yes.",
        "So there just seems to me, to be lacking some overarching or integrated sense of purpose that is animating the various initiatives of this administration.",
        "As I said in the piece, as an outside observer, which is all I am, it really seems to me that the strategy portfolio is unassigned.",
        "The president's got czars in the White House for about 15 different various and sundry issues - there is no strategy czar.",
        "And there needs to be, and it probably needs to be him.",
        "One of the things that you write in the piece is, in terms of your proposal for these principles, ought to include no more crusades unless the American people buy in.",
        "The - expecting a relative handful of soldiers to carry the load while the rest of the country binges on consumption is, you say, unconscionable."

        "But I guess I'm in the camp that thinks that those words ring hollow when supporting the troops neglects to include a considered examination of whether the wars in which the troops are engaged are genuinely necessary.",
        "And when we pay for those wars, as we have been paying for both the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - not by making sacrifices ourselves, but basically about plunging the country ever deeper in debt on the assumption that some future generation is going to have to figure out how to pay the bills -I think that's wrong.",

        "Andrew Bacevich?",
        "I couldn't agree more.",
        "I mean, in the wake of 9/11, the perpetrators of the so-called global war on terror, argued that 9/11 had completely discredited the law enforcement approach to dealing with the problem of terrorism and basically charged that anybody who argued to the contrary was somehow, you know, weak on national security.",
        "That argument really never had any merit to it.",
        "We failed where we failed in 9/11, and where we have failed since is in effectively taking a law enforcement approach to dealing with the problem of violent radicalism.",
        "And the caller, I think, is exactly right.",
        "There is plenty of evidence suggesting that a big American footprint and the American tendency to rely on firepower, which tends, you know, inevitably, to cause non-combatant casualties that this then simply contributes to a backlash and plays into the hands of the jihadists.",

        "And the craziest one I've heard yet is that it was engineered and perpetrated by 19 Arab hijackers with box cutters.",
        "I'm afraid that's not so much a conspiracy theory - I think, I guess, it is a conspiracy theory, but the conspiracy has been more than proven.",

        "I mean, one of the things that I would want an Obama strategic vision to do would be to discriminate between those commitments that we've made that continue to have value utility, and other commitments that perhaps have now - have outlived their value and utility and therefore should be scrapped.",
        "The rhetoric of American state craft, with its emphasis on global leadership and indispensable nation and world's only super power and alike, obstructs efforts to discriminate in that way and to make wise choices about where American global commitments make sense and where American global commitments can be, perhaps, withdrawn.",
        "And this is not just about an explanation for why the goal in Iraq and Afghanistan, why we are pursuing those conflicts or not, but about what would happen, why we do or do not get involved in Somalia or Iran or North Korea.",
