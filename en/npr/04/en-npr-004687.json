        "Information, and a little something more.",
        "In the early days, not long after Turman started the unit at the FBI 10 years ago, she reached out to a woman whose husband had been killed in a bombing in Iraq.",
        "'Cause I had given her our condolences and I said, you know, I wanted to say how sorry we are, you know, about your husband's murder.",

        "Part of what Turman does to address those needs is hire people from lots of different work backgrounds.",

        "Driving that increase were Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which tore up energy facilities along the Gulf Coast.",

        "That's Jim Glassman, senior economist at JP Morgan Chase in New York.",
