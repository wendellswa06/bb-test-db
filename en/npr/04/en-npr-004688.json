        "And to go from that piece of uranium that's been dug out of the ground to that, say, level of 3.5 percent enrichment, difficult, very difficult, more difficult than what's to come?",
        "It's quite difficult because it's a little bit like compound interest.",
        "When you start with a very low amount, it takes a long number of cycles to get up to something worthwhile like 3.5 percent of 5 percent.",
        "And then as you move up from that, the compounding starts to work a little bit more in your favor and you can move from 3 percent to, say, 20 percent more easily than that first stage and then up to the weapon quality of 80 or 90 percent even more easily.",
        "In this case, Iran will send this 3.5 percent enriched uranium into Turkey and they'll receive, I gather, fuel rods that are enriched to just under 20 percent.",
        "What do we call those, first of all, in terms of how enriched they are?",
        "Well, 20 percent is the threshold for high enriched uranium.",
        "And once you're above the threshold, in principle, in theory, you could make a nuclear weapon out of the material.",
        "As a practical matter, you want 80 or 90 percent or more enrichment.",
        "So what we would be supplying, the West, if this all were to go through, is material that still could not be used for nuclear weapons but which is closer to the weapon quality stuff they may ultimately be seeking."
