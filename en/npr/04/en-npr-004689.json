        "The goal was to alienate, to get out of the country their low-enriched uranium, so that that material couldn't be upgraded further in country.",
        "And that would give us some breathing space.",
        "Somewhat higher enriched uranium would come back, but not all at once and it would go right into the reactor.",
        "It's made out of fuel plates, which have the uranium embedded in aluminum so it's harder to process.",
        "And the thought was this would create more opportunities for negotiations to occur without the sort of sword of Damacles hanging over your head if they had a stockpile of low-enriched uranium they could make into bomb grade if they chose to.",
        "So in theory what you're saying is one might take these rods and one might conceivably enrich them further, but in practice if this deal works out as you've described it, that would not be practical and the big supply of uranium would have left the country.",
        "That is true as the deal was originally planned when there was no other low-enriched uranium in the country.",
        "Now, of course, eight months have passed and theyve produced some more.",
        "The original quantity was more or less, you know, 90 percent of what they had, now it's probably closer to 50 percent of what they have.",
        "Does one use the same equipment - I assume these are centrifuges, to go from naturally occurring uranium to low-enriched uranium, as one would use to go from low-enriched uranium to highly-enriched uranium?",
        "You do use the same equipment.",
        "In other words, you don't change the nature of the device that does the enriching, but you change the configuration of how you line them all up.",
        "If in fact there is a lot more uranium that's been enriched in Iran than what under this deal would be shipped to Turkey, would that uranium be naturally inspected nowadays or not?",
        "Now it's all under inspection, so that part is to the good.",
        "We do fear that there may be clandestine facilities in Iran that we haven't found yet and we are discovering them from time to time.",
        "So that's very, very worrying.",
        "But the other aspect that's worrying is that although the inspectors are present now, Iran could withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and in effect break out.",
        "It would have the three to five percent enriched uranium.",
        "As the years go by it'll have more.",
        "Some of it may be in the 20 percent range.",
        "If they kick the inspectors out and decide they want the bomb, they can move up that ladder quite quickly.",
        "Leonard Spector, thank you very much for talking with us."
