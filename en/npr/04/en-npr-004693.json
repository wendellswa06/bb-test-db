        "There are these new exchanges that will begin in 2014 that will hopefully help create competition, that will help keep premiums lower, if not low.",
        "And there are a lot of other things in this law that are - hopefully will create changes in the way health care is delivered and paid for, that will help stem the growth of health care costs.",
        "But no one is suggesting that this is the magic bullet.",
        "Julie, we also had several versions of this next question, which is this: How does the new law affect people who have insurance through the TriCare program?",
        "And thats the private insurance plan for Defense Department workers and military families.",
        "I actually had to do a little bit of research on this.",
        "And it turns out that people on TriCare will not be affected by this new law, and that's both good and bad.",
        "It's good in that if you have TriCare, you won't have to go out and buy any other insurance.",
        "It is sufficient to cover the requirements of the individual mandate that you have insurance.",
        "It's bad in that if you have an adult child who's 24 or 25, you won't be able to keep them on your TriCare, because TriCare only covers dependents up to age 23.",
        "Interestingly, a lot of people are upset by that.",
        "And there's already been a bill introduced in the House that would allow people on TriCare to keep their dependents on their TriCare plan until theyre 26 also.",

        "What I really want to know is where Im going to stand economically due to this health care bill once I begin practicing.",

        "Well, we haven't talked about this a lot but it has been a large concern for the lawmakers writing this bill, a lack of primary care doctors to take care of all these newly-insured people.",
        "So in fact there are incentives in this new law to enlarge the pool of primary care doctors.",
        "One big one - and this was added very late - Medicaid, the program for the poor, they're going to increase payments for Medicaid doctors, primary care doctors up to what Medicare pays.",

        "There's going to be more primary care residency slots.",

        "Those will be other kinds of longer term changes in really the medical care system, all of which are intended to encourage doctors to become primary care doctors.",
        "Those will take a little bit longer to be phased in.",
        "But yes, there's all kinds of encouragement to expand that pool of primary care doctors.",
        "On the other hand, there's not that much to be done about the fact that medical school is very expensive and specialists are still on balance to be paid more than primary care doctors.",
        "We heard also from Lisa Kantrowitz(ph) of Malvern, Pennsylvania, with a question about how all this is going to be paid for.",
        "She asks, when will the Cadillac plan taxes come into play, and who will it affect?",
        "She also asks, how do you know if you have a plan considered to be Cadillac?",

        "This doesnt take effect until the year 2018.",
        "Your plan has to be worth more than $10,200 for a single person and $27,500 for family coverage, thats both what you and your employer pay if its employer provided insurance.",
        "And those plans can be worth even more if you're a retiree or you're in a high-risk profession, like a police officer or a firefighter.",
        "And dental and vision coverage don't count toward those totals, by the way.",
        "So these are very, very high-end plans.",
        "Julie, we've been wondering, and we certainly heard from listeners too about this, about how the health care law is going to be enforced.",
        "Who figures out if insurance companies are doing what they're supposed to be doing?",
        "What do you know about that?",
        "Well, the main enforcement, and those who will write the rules will come from the Department of Health and Human Services.",
        "They will be assisted by those at the Department of Labor.",
        "But people are correct when they say that the Internal Revenue Service will play a role in this, because you will have to declare on your income taxes whether or not you have health insurance thats this individual mandate.",
        "And if you don't have health insurance, that's how you'll pay the penalty that will be required, with your taxes.",
        "And who figures out, yes, insurance companies are not cherry-picking, they're not dropping people with preexisting conditions?"
