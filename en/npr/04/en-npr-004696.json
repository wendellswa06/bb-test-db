        "Ellis?",
        "Well, Ellis made clear in his sentencing that Manafort's crimes are serious.",
        "He wanted to spell that out clearly.",
        "We're talking about tax fraud, failing to disclose a foreign bank account and bank fraud.",
        "The tax fraud, in particular, Ellis said is basically stealing from every American who pays taxes.",
        "That's a serious crime.",
        "But Ellis also said that, you know, you take all sorts of factors into consideration when coming up with a sentence - general deterrence, you look at the entirety of a defendant's life.",
        "And he said, in Manafort's case, he's a first-time offender.",
        "Otherwise, blameless life.",
        "And you also look at sentences in similar cases, and that appeared to be a big factor in Manafort's sentence.",
        "As you noted, the guidelines' range was 19 to 24 years.",
        "Ellis said that's way out of whack.",
        "He landed on a total of 47 months, but he also imposed financial penalties - nearly $25 million in restitution - and...",
        "That is a lot of ostrich jackets...",
        "...A $50,000 fine.",
        "...I suppose we should say.",
        "Manafort himself must have made a case for a shorter sentence?",
        "He did.",
        "Manafort was actually wheeled into the courtroom yesterday in a wheelchair.",
        "He sat in that wheelchair throughout the entirety of the nearly four-hour proceedings.",
        "He was wearing a baggy green prison uniform.",
        "And he spoke in what's known as allocution.",
        "And he said, you know, the last two years have been the most difficult years that he and his family have ever experienced.",
        "He said that he feels humiliation and shame.",
        "He knows that he's caused deep, deep pain to his family.",
        "And he's spent nine months already in jail.",
        "He said he feels the punishment from these proceedings.",
        "It's impacted his health, his professional and financial life.",
        "He says that he has had time to reflect while in jail.",
        "He wants to turn his notoriety into something positive, and he asked for the court's compassion.",
        "But Judge T.S.",
        "Ellis did say, right before he imposed his sentence, I didn't hear you say you regret what you did."

        "But is 47 months the entirety of the time that Manafort could possibly spend in prison?",

        "He pleaded guilty to two conspiracy charges.",
        "This is a case that was also brought by special counsel Robert Mueller.",

        "is going to make him serve, whatever sentence she gives him, simultaneously or stagger it.",
        "So is he going to get another 10 years in addition to what he got in Virginia?",

        "I have no reason to doubt him.",

        "Well, I think there's a feeling at the White House among many people that the campaign was surveilled at one point or another, whether it was targeting Trump Tower, targeting him specifically.",
