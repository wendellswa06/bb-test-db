        "Here's the twist: Captain Coe is more than 7,000 miles from Iraq.",
        "He's sitting in a trailer in the middle of the desert in Nevada.",
        "The Predator is a 27-foot-long drone or, in military lingo, a UAV, unmanned aerial vehicle.",
        "The pilots fly by remote control with the aid of a satellite, half a dozen computer screens and a joystick.",
        "Another pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Matt Bannon, concedes the arrangement does give rise to some complications, for example, a two-second delay between when he tells the plane to turn and it actually does.",
        "So when I'm flying the Predator and I start a turn--one thousand one, one thousand two--I see the roll come in.",
        "But the upside to flying the Predator from halfway around the world is that the military boosts morale and saves a lot of money by keeping these pilots home with their families in the US rather than shipping them off to war.",
        "Right now the US has about 80 Predators.",
        "Most are in Iraq or Afghanistan but are flown by pilots like Coe and Bannon from Nellis Air Force Base about half an hour outside Las Vegas.",
        "Bannon is director of operations for the 15th Reconnaissance Squadron.",
        "He used to be a top-gun pilot flying fighter jets for the Navy.",
        "He says flying drones is definitely less sexy but also more challenging.",
        "Pilots rely on a small camera that can only look one direction at a time.",
        "Bannon compares it to seeing the world through a soda straw.",
        "Even experienced pilots can get in trouble.",
        "Bannon did this summer in Afghanistan.",
        "Lt.",
        "Col.",
        "BANNON: I thought I was clear, looking forward 15 seconds, initiated a turn and there's a cloud--a thunderstorm right in front of me.",
        "Next thing I know, you know, I went from 24,000 feet to 16,000 feet, totally iced up, barely able to maintain altitude.",
        "But I got the plane home, you know, and I felt more helpless flying a Predator than I have flying fighters, you know, for the past 15 years.",
        "Since the September 11th attacks, about 30 Predators have crashed.",
        "At 4 million a pop, they're not cheap, but in the world of defense hardware that doesn't rank as a devastating loss.",
        "And military commanders say the Predator's overall record is outstanding.",
        "In Iraq, Predators armed with Hellfire missiles have taken out snipers that were threatening US ground troops.",
        "They're also adept at tracking enemy insurgents at night.",
        "Bannon says from his perch in Nevada he can watch targets moving around Baghdad and can lead US and Iraqi ground patrols right to them.",
        "Lt.",
        "Col.",
        "BANNON: We have different methods of pinpointing them.",
        "We have something called an infrared pointer where a person with NVGs, or night vision goggles, can see our infrared point and then they can just follow that spot and find out where the people may or may not be.",
        "The Predator is also used in the wider war on terror.",
        "The most spectacular of the handful of known incidents came in 2002 in Yemen.",
        "A Hellfire missile fired from a Predator, took out six suspected terrorists driving across the Yemeni desert.",
        "This past May a Predator reportedly killed an al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan.",
        "Such incidents have raised legal and ethical questions such as: Is the Predator, in effect, carrying out assassinations?",
        "After the Yemen attack, Europeans expressed alarm.",
        "Sweden's foreign minister called it a summary execution that violates human rights.",
        "And Amnesty International asked.",
        "`Shouldn't the suspects have been arrested rather than shot given that they posed no immediate threat?",
        "Put that question to Lieutenant Colonel John Harris, commander of the 15th Reconnaissance Squadron, and his swift answer is `No.'",
        "I understand the concerns, but this is combat.",
        "It's war.",
        "It's literally going out and after the throat of the folks that are out there leading these efforts against us.",
        "And we're going to do it by whatever means and this just is a means for us to be able to do that."

        "Forty-five minutes up the road from the Nellis base, the Air Force is building a huge new hangar to house them.",
        "I would bet you could probably put at least 16 Predators in here because it's just a gigantic space.",
        "That's Major Matt Belmonte of the UAV battle lab here at Creech Air Force Base.",
        "New Predator pilots do their training at Creech and, in the next year or two, all Predator operations will be moved here.",
        "Local pride in the plane already runs high.",

        "His job involves figuring out how to adapt the Predator and other unmanned planes to future challenges.",
        "His lab, for example, figured out how to beam live video from the Predator's camera down to soldiers with laptops on the ground so they can use the intelligence in real-time fighting.",

        "Snow told reporters this past week that the president will try something different this year.",
        "It's better to spend some time focusing on big issues so that people do get a sense of your engagement with them, and there will be opportunities to pick up other topics in much greater detail later on."

        "Now, under the president's plan, he's going to announce people with more expensive plans that cost more than $15,000 for a family and $15,000 in health insurance, they'll have to start paying some taxes on their health coverage.",
        "At the same time, people who get their insurance on their own outside of the workplace are now going to be able to take a pretty significant deduction on their taxes.",
        "But already we've heard complaints from Democrats, saying this is essentially a tax increase on many middle class families who have some of those more expensive health care plans and are now going to have to pay a tax.",
        "So the president, trying to use this issue that is dear to Democrats, but no guarantee it's going to work.",

        "That was a big issue in last year's State of the Union as well.",
        "Yeah, Debbie, I don't think there's another issue you can find that so clearly shows how far we've come politically from one State of the Union to another.",
        "Last year, an election year, the president talked tough about being able to go after suspected terrorists and doing this wire tapping without getting a warrant from a court.",
        "I think it was a way to try and bait Democrats, get them on the record as being against an anti-terrorism measure.",
        "Now with the election, the Republicans lose, and a big reversal.",
