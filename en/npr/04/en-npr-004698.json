        "Yeah, this is always confusing.",
        "What that is is the Labor Department for well over 100 years classifies unemployed as those people who have spent time looking for work in the last four weeks and could take a job if one was offered to them.",
        "So you might say, oh good, the unemployment rate was 5 percent, then it went down to 4.9 percent, then 4.8 percent, that's a good sign, we like smaller unemployment rates.",
        "But what this can suggest is that more and more people have really just given up.",
        "They see the economy in their region or in their industry so bad that it's not even worth going out and trying to get a job.",
        "So that lowered unemployment rate, we can't be certain at this point, but that could be additional evidence that this economy is really hurting.",

        "Since he's grown up in the hub of commerce, namely Pisa, when he looks at this method, he sees something that nobody else, including his father, had seen: the enormous potential this has to change commerce for everybody, because he says - and this is where he begins to sound like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates - he says: If I package this and present it so that ordinary people, ordinary businesspeople, can understand it, everyone can do their own arithmetic, everyone has the potential to become an international trader.",

        "A historian just gave him that name.",
        "In Leonardo's day, they didn't really have surnames.",
