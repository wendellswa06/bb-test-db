        "In fact, when Leonardo writes his book \"\"Liber Abaci,\"\" at the beginning of the book, and they say in Latin he calls himself Filius Bonacci, the son of Bonacci, which really he meant the family of Bonacci, and so this guy Libre, this historian in the early 19th century, takes that first Filius Bonacci, shortens it to Fibonacci and generates a nice modern-sounding, Italian-sounding surname for Leonardo.",
        "And that stuck with him forever.",
        "It stayed with him (unintelligible) that name and the Fibonacci Sequence has been associated with him forever.",
        "But Leonardo really had nothing to do with the Fibonacci Sequence.",
        "He didn't?",
        "It's named after him, and he had nothing to do with it?",
        "It had been around for hundreds of years.",
        "In his book, \"\"Liber Abaci,\"\" because he's trying to teach this method to everybody, he fills it with hundreds and hundreds of examples.",
        "Most of them are examples about trade and commerce and exchanging goods and divvying out the profits from a trade, currency conversions, hundreds and hundreds of examples like that, which he must have realized would tend to get a bit tedious after a while.",
        "So every now and then he throws in a little cute problem that you can think about in the bathtub, and one of them was about a fictitious rabbit's population.",
        "And he throws this as a throw-away problem.",
        "That's the problem that gives you the Fibonacci Sequence.",
        "Yeah, I mean...",
        "You know, he didn't invent it.",
        "He didn't solve it himself.",
        "He just took it - it had been around for hundreds of years.",
        "And then he goes along his way.",
        "I guarantee if Leonardo came onto the scene today, and you said I really like your Fibonacci Sequence, he would look at you and say: What on Earth are you talking about?",
        "You know, he was trying to change the world.",
        "He really wasn't interested in populations of rabbits.",
        "But you know, history runs in strange ways, and we now associate that sequence with his name.",
        "It is a cool sequence.",

        "I mean, modern - you look back to the origins of accounting, banking, international trade and commerce, insurance, it all came out of Italy in the 13th century, and one of the key ingredients for that to happen was that the ordinary person could do arithmetic quickly and efficiently and accurately and in the process leave an audit trail.",

        "He was a great mathematician, much better mathematician than me if we factor in 800 years of history, great mathematician.",

        "He basically gave it to the world.",
