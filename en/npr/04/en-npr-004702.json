        "The most successful shows on the Internet are only two minutes long, and you know, they sometimes get 300,000 viewers, 400,000 viewers, that sort of thing.",
        "I think if we could get into the millions, even if it's a million, that would be a huge home run for the Internet, but that's not going happen right away.",
        "What does all of this have to do with a writers strike?",
        "Something or nothing?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, the commission had a glorious history in its early years.",
        "It was Dwight Eisenhower who proposed it as a way to try to answer criticism for doing nothing about the civil rights movement.",
        "It was after the Montgomery bus boycott, Rosa Parks sitting on the bus around the town with a Little Rock crisis, and his Secretary of State told him that people all over the world are criticizing us for not giving first-class citizenship to African-Americans.",
        "And so, his attorney general came up with this idea that he would set-up a commission and ask the commission to investigate and hold hearings on the subject and make recommendations so that anytime anybody asks him what he was doing, he'd say, well, I set up this commission, go talk to them.",
        "And the commission, he put what he called \"\"moderate men\"\" on it, and they were all men.",
        "And he thought that they would just be people who would front for him essentially.",
        "But what they did was serious work.",
        "They were university presidents like Father Ted Hesburgh from Notre Dame and John Hannah from Michigan State and lawyers, and they went to the South and when they saw how terrible things were, they started subpoenaing people, which they had the power to do, holding hearings, working with civil rights leaders, to try to put what they called \"\"translating\"\" the struggle in the street into law - some way to get, you know, civil rights laws.",
        "And the commission had that glorious history.",
        "It recommended most of them civil rights laws that we have - Civil Rights of '64, the Voting Rights act of '65, and then after that, on other subjects where is there is age discrimination, or sex discrimination and the like.",
        "But then Ronald Reagan came along and gutted it.",
        "I was going to say that to you as a matter of fact, because you've been very critical of George W.",
        "Bush's record on civil rights, but as you were just about to say I'm assuming it was actually Ronald Reagan who first shifted, and some say dismantled enforcement.",
        "But here's the question, though.",
        "Doesn't the ideology of civil rights enforcement changed depending upon who's in the White House along with the personnel?",
        "It changes - enforcement changes, but the idea of the commission all those years, is that it was independent, bipartisan, members had to be nominated by the president, confirmed by the Senate.",
        "They would be held up to public scrutiny so folks would know who they were.",
        "And that they would not work for a president.",
        "They would independently look at the little people, people who had no place to turn, and try to figure out how to solve their problems, take hot-button issues and work on them.",
        "So, they would watchdog enforcement, as they put it, after the laws were passed and what Ronald Reagan did was to say he didn't like that.",
        "What he wanted was a commission that would still just be a mouthpiece for what he did because he was planning to reverse some of the civil rights enforcement.",
        "And he was partly successful, which is why from that time on the commission has been very problematic.",
        "So what do you want the commission to do now?",
        "If you wanted it go away or would be blown up and start - that's a terrible analogy, to be a replace with something new and different.",
        "Well, here's what I want.",
        "I served on it all those years and from time to time after I became chair in the Clinton administration, we did a few good things including the hearings in Florida after the 2000 election, and taking on George W.",
        "Bush who was just following in Reagan's foot steps.",
        "But what I am saying is, we ought to change the commission back to the way it was in the early years.",
        "Have members appointed by a president.",
        "Now, they don't get any Senate confirmation, you can put anybody on there you want.",
        "And have the Senate confirm them and have them be independent, respected people, and have to be truly bipartisan and people who have courage.",
        "And let them take on the hot-button issues of today.",
        "Such things as the whole controversy about what rights do people have who are LBGT.",
        "What about same sex-marriage and the different polarized views that we have in this country around that issue?",
        "And what about immigration reform?",
        "Another - these issues are as hot button now as the issues of the rights of African-Americans were in the 1950s, 1960s.",
        "And I think that in renewed commission, a commission on human rights I'm calling for, could do something about this and it could monitor what we in the United States do about our commitments to human rights around the world.",
        "We have signed U.N.",
        "covenants and some of them have bad, and some don't, and some we refuse to sign.",
        "So that I think there's a work to be done and they can help Obama and the Congress move on really implementing equal opportunity in our society, taking his presidency as a sort of kickoff point to do more rather than simply resting on our laurels and saying, now we've done everything we need to do.",
        "So I think with great commission on civil rights could help with that.",
        "What about Eric Holder, in the time that we have left.",
        "He's the first black U.S.",
        "attorney general."
