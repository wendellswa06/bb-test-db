        "Arriving in the capital Juba, John Kerry took a moment to recall his last trip to South Sudan on July 9, 2011, the day it became a country.",
        "He remembered talking with a man who was waiting in a long line under the hot sun to cast his vote for independence from the northern neighbor Sudan.",
        "And that person to me said, don't worry -- I was then a senator -- don't worry, Senator, I've waited 50 years for this moment.",
        "I'm not going anywhere until I've voted.",
        "But now three years later South Sudan's president Salva Kiir and his former vice president Riek Machar are engaged in a ruthless struggle for power over the oil-rich country.",
        "Forces fighting for each side have recruited child soldiers, committed mass rapes and tortures and killings to terrorize the ethnic base of their rivals.",
        "If both sides do not take steps in order to reduce or end the violence, they will completely destroy what they are fighting to inherit.",
        "And then Kerry used a phrase he's been testing out a lot on this Africa trip.",
        "He said both sides needed to have discussions...",
        "About a transition government that can bring peace to the country.",
        "And this was Kerry's mission on this day trip.",
        "He pressed both presidents Salva Kiir in person and rebel leader Riek Machar on the phone to get them to agree to discuss a transition government.",
        "In other words, he's trying to get two men fighting for power to discuss steps to a government where neither would likely hold the reins.",
        "And to understand why this is so tricky, I drove to downtown Juba to visit Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth, the former South Sudanese ambassador to the United States.",
        "His living room is streaming with well-wishers.",
        "Gatkuoth was released from prison last week.",
        "He'd been thrown in jail in December by President Kiir for allegedly siding with Riek Machar in a supposed coup.",
        "But despite his four-month imprisonment, Gatkuoth was optimistic that Kiir could still end the war with a phone call.",
        "Sure, why not?",
        "He should call Riek on the phone: My brother, this is very unfortunate; we need to end this war."
