        "So, one on one.",
        "Who do you like in a one on one between those two in a town hall?",
        "To whose benefit is this?",
        "Well, of course, John McCain is hoping it's to his.",
        "He's done pretty well in those kind of - you know, his Straight Talk Expresses.",
        "I think he does well in that form, but I think Barack does well on that, too.",
        "Yes, I am.",
        "They both - I mean, he shows his charisma.",
        "I actually went to an Obama rally to see what the fuss was about, about a year and a half ago, which seems like a lifetime ago, and I got it.",
        "You know, and McCain, I hear, plays well in that setting, too.",
        "So, it will be very interesting.",
        "Yeah, I think, you know, for Obama to do well in a situation like that, he has to basically just be himself.",
        "And, you know, what McCain's going to try and do, to my way of thinking, is he'll try to say, well, look, but you don't have the experience to do the kind of stuff that I've done.",
        "And Obama's response of course will be, well, yeah, but you're not change.",
        "You're the same old stuff.",
        "And in this town-hall setting, it depends on who the people in the crowd are and what kind of reaction you're going to get.",
        "If, you know, if the Republicans can get a lot of their people in there to support McCain, then of course, it'll seem like McCain went to all of the debates.",
        "And we're talking about having an independent commission, you know, stack - you know, bring the people in.",
        "I'm always suspicious of that because, you know, some parties have been very, very good at stacking the deck in their favor depending on where you are.",
        "Are you surprised, either of you, Erin or Bob, that the polls show currently that McCain and Obama are in a virtual dead heat?",
        "No, I'm not surprised.",
        "I - again, you know, this is completely unscripted, unprecedented.",
        "I never know where Obama's going to land, you know, so I'd say for this - it's like right now, everybody's - both - they both got an A in class, and it's theirs to lose.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And there's no question.",
        "McCain has a lot of the support of the old die hards, the old, the GOP.",
        "Even conservative Democrats who would like to support him.",
        "But Obama has the young people, who have come out in tremendous numbers to support him.",
        "So, a dead heat right now, I don't think is a surprise.",
        "What's going to end up being - making the difference, I think, are the debates and are - as we get down the - through the order of the campaign, and you know, we haven't seen, you know the robe of vocation of Obama yet, you know?",

        "Go ahead.",

        "But because their supporters - their packs will put these ads on the air, you know, I mean, we're going to be hearing about Barack, we're seeing Obama an awful lot over the next couple of months, and it won't be because McCain wants it to happen.",

        "Do you share that view or no?",
        "I don't think it was important in 2000, because nobody voted for Cheney.",
        "They voted for Bush and they got Cheney.",
        "I don't...",
        "I think it may - if Hillary has her way, it's going to be an important issue, because she'll be on the ticket.",

        "And you're there, just kind of being the puppet, which is the way most people perceive the administration now.",
        "So, I don't know how import - I think it will be important - I'm not sure how important it's going to be though.",
