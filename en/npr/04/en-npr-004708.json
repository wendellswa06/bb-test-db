        "(Singing) Oh, you send me...",
        "But as he evolved as a pop singer, he brought more and more of his gospel background into his music, as well as his social awareness, which was keen.",
        "But really, \"\"A Change Is Gonna Come\"\" was a real departure for him in the sense that it was undoubtedly the first time that he addressed social problems in a direct and explicit way."

        "And that's a market share that U.S.",
        "companies have taken decades to build in the first place, so this is really worrying for them.",

        "products enter customs into China, Parker told me that, typically, 2 percent of U.S.",

        "Should Trump go through with more tariffs, China's government could easily turn a growing sense of nationalism inside of China into a more targeted anti-Americanism.",
        "And we've definitely seen this before here in China with Japanese goods when China was angry with Japan and with South Korean goods when it had a tiff with that country.",
