        "You know, we can't obviously run away and hide forever, but yes.",
        "We do need to take breaks.",
        "We need to recognize that turning off the television or turning a channel, et cetera, when we feel overwhelmed is actually good for us.",
        "And it probably will enable us to do a more effective job or perspective on whatever we're concerned about.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And what about, you know, getting yourself away from the scene?",
        "If you were listening to the news or watching the news in the same place or in your house, how about getting out and doing something else...",
        "Yes.",
        "...to change the scenery?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean, in the workshops that we have done and the various training courses, either at Tulane or elsewhere, we focus on attending to yourself and what you need for pleasure.",

        "You know, what recharges your batteries and to do those kinds of things.",
        "But again, it's part of the universal human condition.",
        "We are conditioned to be empathic and compassionate.",
        "It enables us to establish and maintain friendships and good relationships among our family members and neighbors, et cetera.",
        "And that's all good.",
        "And it leads to very positive emotions.",
        "But they're also is a cost to that caring.",
        "And if we don't do something about that, then we will turn our backs to far more things than just what initially shocked us or depressed us.",

        "I listen to the news all the time too, which makes it even harder sometimes to want to stay positive.",
        "But one thing I don't hear people talk a lot about is spiritual health.",
        "And the one thing that I do every day is - I pray.",
        "I pray in the morning.",
        "I pray when I go to sleep.",
        "I pray with my children.",
        "We attend church together.",
        "And I think that, you know, when your physical health is not something you can depend on and - you know, people talk about their mental health and their financial health, but you know, if you have your spiritual health to rely on and you think that maybe there's a greater - and you believe that there's a greater plan to everything - I mean, I don't know how I'd get through the day without that.",
        "I completely agree.",
        "And there should be no - the border between mental health and spiritual health should be seamless, if there's any line at all, without a doubt.",

        "She's a journalist, but she's also a journalist professor now.",

        "It's not a notion of wanting to hide and only watch soap operas.",
        "It's the notion of knowing what your limits are and being self-aware.",
        "There have been probably - I don't know - 300, 400 studies associated with the role of positive emotion.",
        "And what's very interesting about that is that positive emotion is associated with building and developing strong ties among family members, friendships, et cetera, but there's a cost to that caring.",
        "And the cost sometimes complicates those particular relationships.",
        "But when we think about professionals like social workers, psychologists, nurses, et cetera, who every day must deal with these issues, I think we can learn a lot from them.",
        "So if your staff has experienced a certain degree of compassion fatigue by covering this oil spill catastrophe, you have experienced at least a little bit of what these men and women experience every day.",
        "And it's not to make anyone feel guilty that they're not doing that, but it's simply that these folks have to, by necessity, in order to save their career and their job, to be able to thrive in this kind of environment.",
        "And not just survive, but actually thrive.",
        "Can't wait to get to work in the morning, that kind of idea.",
        "And much of this is associated with empathic discernment.",
        "It seems a little highfalutin maybe, but it's essentially being discerning about how much empathy you can give as well as being discerning about how much you can take.",
        "We work with patients and clients all the time making fine-tune discernments on whether we should push them, encourage them, slow them down, et cetera.",
