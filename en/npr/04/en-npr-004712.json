        "Now, here I'm not talking about the very highest levels.",
        "The very highest levels of the government, obviously, are engaged in an epic political battle to defend themselves against what they see as a combination of U.S., Latin American and Venezuelan forces intent on toppling them.",
        "They will do what they need to defend themselves.",
        "But at the level below that, the people who are not fully part of the political battle, they naturally feel that they their interests would be better defended by the current government.",
        "But they're also critical of what the current government has achieved economically because they feel the effects and yet remain uncertain as to what their fates would be, should Juan Guaido or the opposition take power.",
        "Because obviously, they also have the fear that there will be a clear-out of the state, a total revolution of the sort which famously occurred, obviously, in Iraq after 2003.",
        "And they worry, as well, that they will also be utterly marginalized and with no possibilities of gainful employment in the future.",
        "I'm glad you brought up that analogy to Iraq in 2003.",

        "Juan Guaido declared himself interim president on the 23rd of January immediately recognized by the United States, a multitude of Latin American countries and European countries.",
        "And the central message of Guaido and the United States - Mike Pence, John Bolton at the time - was, the military, it's up to you now, it's time for you to consider your situation and change sides.",
        "And what happened?",
        "Well, the very senior high command has not moved, which is obviously of concern to the opposition because it was basically fundamental to their plan that there would be a weakening of the military foundations of the government and a new president would be in place.",
        "Has anything happened that might make Nicolas Maduro think that giving up power would be better than keeping it?",
        "Well, at the moment, no. At the moment, he has seen what has happened over the last month or so.",
        "The military, the bulk of the military hasn't moved.",
        "The attempted entry of humanitarian aid on the 23rd of February was a violent and unpleasant spectacle to watch but was not successful.",
        "And Juan Guaido is now back in the country, but things seem to be more or less under his control.",
        "So at the moment, you would say, what motivation would he have to leave power?",

        "The U.S.",
        "sanctions on the purchase of oil from the Venezuelan state-run firm PDVSA is a huge hit on the Venezuelan state's access to hard currency.",
        "And without that hard currency, it can't import food and medicines.",
        "And those imports of food are the basis of those rations handed out to millions of households in Venezuela, which keeps the tides of hunger at bay and stops them migrating.",
        "So what I think we're looking at now, in the next month or so, is whatever the government tries to do - selling oil elsewhere, selling gold, moving assets around - it's going to face a huge economic crunch on top of an already awful economic situation.",
