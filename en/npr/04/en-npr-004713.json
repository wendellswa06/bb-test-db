        "What the insurers will say, and with good reason, is that if they have to sell to everybody, they don't want people to be able to wait until they're sick to buy insurance.",
        "So the idea is that the need to have everybody in the insurance pool, the sick and the healthy, and also the people can't wait until they're sick to get insurance.",
        "Hence, you get this individual mandate - so that everybody will have to have insurance, it will be easier for the insurers to spread that risk so that they can afford to sell to everybody who's sick or not.",
        "That's where you get the idea of this individual mandate.",
        "Now, I should point out the original idea of this, there would also be an employer mandate, that employers would have to help to pay the costs for their workers.",
        "There is a lack of an employer mandate in the Senate Finance Committee Bill.",
        "There is an employer mandate in most of the other bills.",
        "So that little piece is missing.",
        "What happens, though, about people who come and say, you know, can't we do this in little pieces, can't we just have the insurance changes?",
        "As I mentioned, it's hard to have the insurance changes without having some kind of mandate for everybody to be covered.",
        "You can't really have the mandate unless you have some help with poorer people to afford it.",
        "You can't have the subsidies without a way to pay for them, and then you end up with these big, behemoth bills.",
        "But just basically, you're describing a bit of a quid pro quo.",
        "The insurance companies, all right, if we have to cover everybody, if we can't deny people on the basis of - you've already been diagnosed with cancer, I'm sorry you can't buy insurance anymore - then if we're going to accept that risk, we have to get that new pool of customers.",
        "They have to buy insurance.",
        "That's right.",
        "They want to have the healthy as well as the sick so they can spread those costs among everybody.",
        "Right now, the largest group of people without insurance are young people, age 18 to 24.",
        "The census numbers that came out just last week said that 29 percent of people between 18 and 24 don't have insurance.",
        "They'd like to get those people, who are largely healthy, into the pool and paying premiums so they can afford to cover the people who are sick.",
        "This, however, raises questions about forcing people to buy insurance or pay a penalty.",
        "What's the penalty?",
        "Well, the penalty varies.",
        "And the penalty, I should point out, has been taken down since the bill was first introduced.",
        "Right now under the Senate Finance Committee Bill, the penalty would be, let's see, up to $950 a year for individuals, up to $1,900 a year for families.",
        "So it's a pretty big penalty.",
        "That's an excise tax.",
        "In the House, there's also a penalty.",
        "It's up to 2.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, up to the cost of the actual average premium.",
        "So there are penalties in all of the bills if you don't buy these policies.",
        "And this is likely to be one of those things that keeps moving.",
        "This target is going to keep moving as the bill goes through various iterations and goes down to - well then finally - if it ever is - reconciled between the House version and the Senate version before it ends up on President Obama's desk, if it ever does."

        "I can't make enough money being self-employed to afford it.",
        "And that's, Julie, the first thing that a lot of people are going to say.",

        "And then when I went to go to work, when I became self-employed and tried to get insurance just for myself at the National Association of the Self-Employed, I was paying $480 a month, and none of the doctors that I normally would see were allowed or covered, and…",
        "They weren't part of the plan.",
        "So you weren't allowed to see them if you wanted to get health insurance coverage.",

        "Now, of course, affordable is in the eye of the beholder.",
        "The idea is depending on your income, there will be help on a sliding scale, but you could have to pay up to, depending on your income, 12 percent of your income just for premiums.",
        "You know, honestly what I would like to see, and I know this is just a pie-in-the-sky idea, but I would love to see the legislatures go, like, undercover and just go out into the workforce with assumed IDs and try to buy insurance on the open market so they could actually appreciate the struggle that we as citizens have to get decent insurance with affordable rates and not crazy deductibles or co-pays or anything.",
        "If there were some way to orchestrate that, just to allow them to actually see and experience the frustration that I have every day, whenever I'm trying to mess with the insurance companies, I think that would be way cool.",

        "There is, you know, obviously less expensive insurance, but you may have $10 or $15 or $20 thousand deductibles.",
        "So the idea is to have comprehensive insurance that's affordable, but again what people describe, one person's affordable is another person's out of reach.",

        "They require prescription drugs and other services that have to be covered.",

        "Well, they're probably - over time, I think they will be healthier, but you know, those of us who argued we needed to have the uninsured covered argued that the uninsured weren't getting as much health care as they needed.",
        "And you know what?",
        "They weren't.",

        "And so they are now asking the employer to have coverage under an existing policy, partially paid for by the employer.",
