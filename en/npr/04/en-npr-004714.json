        "Many primary care physicians are going into what we call concierge medicine and saying, you know, in addition, if you want to be seen by me, you have to pay an additional amount of money, and that is not covered by the insurance companies.",

        "I try and stay away from drugs.",
        "I try and stay away from X-rays, from doctors because what they're doing is they're just administering policy of insurance companies, and insurance companies to me are at the heart of the cost problem.",
        "I didn't need them before.",
        "They don't need to be between me and my doctor or me and my hospital or me and anything.",
        "If they're not there, I can deal with it.",
        "I can actually understand the cost.",
        "I don't understand a single thing about insurance and what they care to give me, what they want to give me.",
        "It's deceptive.",
        "You know, they're talking about giving me 80 percent.",
        "Eighty percent of what?",
        "Eighty percent of what I've got coming from particular care.",
        "So anyway, the alternative-care issue, the issue about insurance being between me and my medicine, and I don't believe in somebody…",

        "I also think - I'm pretty sure that under these bills that there would be - the way it works is that these plans would have to have actuarial equivalence, is what it's called.",
        "So I'm sure that there would be plans that would still allow people to buy coverage that would have, for instance, you know, a large deductible.",
        "So if this caller wanted to buy a plan with a big deductible and not that much coverage up front, and he wanted to get his alternative care, and then perhaps he'd only have catastrophic coverage if, you know, he was run over by a bus, he could probably do that.",
        "There is an analogy that many people make, saying: what is the difference between requiring people to have health care coverage and requiring everybody who owns a car to have car insurance?",

        "Your lien holder, if you have one, will require you to have insurance on your car, but if your car is paid off, it can be left uninsured - I'm not sure that's right.",
        "Anyway, requiring health insurance would be like a requirement to have insurance to fix your own car.",

        "And so if - when your COBRA runs out, you're afraid you won't be able to get coverage because will have the cancer as a pre-condition?",
        "Exactly.",
        "I mean, I may be able to get coverage, but who knows what it's going to cost.",
        "Julie?",
        "That's correct.",
        "Actually, under a law passed in 1996, when your COBRA expires, they are required to offer you a continuation policy, but under that same law, they're not required to offer it to you in any way that you might be able to afford.",
        "And how would that change under the proposed legislation, again not finished.",
        "Again not finished, but again, that's exactly the type of thing that's being talked about, that things like these pre-existing conditions would not be taken into account.",
        "On the other hand, there are age-rating restrictions that they are talking about so that someone who is in their 50s could be charged considerably more than someone who is in their 20s.",
        "That's a big fight that they're looking at.",
        "In the House bill, someone, you know, in their 50s could only be charged twice as much as someone in their 20s.",
        "In the Senate bill, they could be charged four times as much.",
        "So it's still going to be expensive, but at least, you know, this woman is probably going to - it would be considerably cheaper than what she's probably looking at for when she runs out of her COBRA."
