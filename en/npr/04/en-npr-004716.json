        "It's four years since Hurricane Katrina ripped into the Gulf Coast.",
        "And last week, we asked those of you affected by the storm to tell us how it changed your lives.",

        "Waveland was virtually wiped out.",
        "How it changed our lives?",

        "We're getting away from insurance paperwork, communal FEMA trailers and the unhappy aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.",

        "S.I.(ph) sent us this story: A close friend of mine learned that his child also had the same kind of cancer.",
        "Aware of the story of Ted's son, my friend picked up the phone and called him.",
        "Senator Kennedy did not know my friend but talked to him at length.",

        "Periodically, Ted Kennedy would call my friend to ask how his child was doing.",
        "The family will never forget this kindness.",

        "What about that fateful night in the car back in 1969?",
        "This canonizing of him is ridiculous.",
        "And finally, a little baseball trivia.",
        "I mentioned last week's unassisted triple play, only the second in Major League history to end a ball game.",
        "I also mentioned another rarity when a single hitter belts two grand slams in a single game to which Joe Dulay(ph), a listener in Boston, upped the ante.",
        "In 2003, Bill Miller, our former third basemen, not only hit two grand slams in one game and not only hit them in back-to-back at bats, he hit one righty and one lefty.",
        "Not only a rarity but unique in baseball history.",
        "And not that I want to pilot on, but he also hit a third homer in that game.",
        "Not bad - even for a Red Sox.",
