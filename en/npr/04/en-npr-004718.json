        "But second of all, it was - you know, it was an execution-style killing that was horrific in every way.",
        "And the fact that it got so little attention spoke to the desensitizing of the national conscience on this kind of crime, which is a shame.",
        "And it's - part of it is human nature.",
        "You see enough of these headlines that you read the headline, and you stop there.",
        "And part of it is just wanting to look away.",
        "And that we can't afford to do.",
        "You write, God help us if this is what we've become - numb to home-grown slaughter unless the body count hits double digits.",
        "If you were an on-duty editor - right?",
        "- and had heard about a shooting, how would you decide whether or not to cover it, how much space or airtime to give the story?",
        "You know, if it were up to me, they would all be covered as expansively as the shooting in Annapolis where my brother and four others at the newspaper lost their lives.",
        "And that got a great deal of attention at the time because the shooter had targeted journalists, and I think it made it a more newsworthy story in some editors' minds.",
        "But the truth is that every shooting like this should be covered.",
        "I would have covered it as a major story.",
        "I certainly would have covered it more than whatever Roger Stone was babbling about that morning, you know?",
        "There's also a school of thinking about covering every shooting further desensitizes people.",
        "Well, it might.",
        "What is the option?",
        "You wait for the body count to get in double digits.",
        "Do you wait for there to be a classroom of children involved?",
        "What makes one killing less newsworthy than another?",
        "If it was an ISIS guy who walked into that bank, it would have been the lead story for days and days and days.",
        "This is just another angry, white, male loser who had access to a weapon.",
        "And so it becomes routine.",
        "And the fact that we even think of it as routine is obscene.",
        "But to not cover it would be hiding a level of tragedy that happens almost every week to somebody and somebody's family.",
        "So that would be the most irresponsible thing a journalist could do.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "These are part and parcel of everyday social interaction.",
        "When we're with our friends, when we're with people we're just meeting for the first time, even when we're with our spouses and loved ones, the lies are thick and furious.",
        "And you say a lot of people - these are little white lies.",
        "Nevertheless, you say, they come with a price attached.",
        "The little white lies do matter.",
        "In part, it's because these lies can very easily lead to other lies and bigger lies.",
        "And the other thing is it leads to a kind of lack of authenticity in our everyday life.",
        "We don't really know where we stand.",
        "We don't really ever get a good sense of who we are and what our strengths and weaknesses are as people if people are constantly not telling us the truth.",
        "Even in those little daily interactions - I must say I grew up in New York and was quite accustomed to surly people on the streets who made no bones about telling me their opinion about anything, and then moving to Washington, D.C., where the normal reaction was have a nice day and what a pleasure.",
        "And I found that, well, disingenuous.",
        "And also kind of refreshing, because it is more pleasant to be in a world in which people are nice and telling us the kinds of things that we would like to hear.",
        "But the reality is that ultimately, these lies have a price, and there's something to be said for the New York style of truth."

        "We don't - we're not able to tell if someone has been lying to us or not most of the time.",
        "So we don't have much feedback in terms of whether we are correct in our assumptions about when someone is lying or not to us.",
        "There's also a truth bias that we carry around with us that most of us just generally believe that others are telling us the truth.",
        "So we're not very good in that sense in determining whether somebody is lying to us.",

        "That in fact these white lies do add up and there can be a kind of snowball effect where the white lies, if you're very good at it, and they - work very well in social settings for you, the white lies can lead to bigger and bigger kinds of lies.",
