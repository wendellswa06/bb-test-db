        "He has a good imagination, and he has ADHD.",
        "He said he caught a spider and gave it a ride in a motorboat.",
        "Kids make up a lot of stories, so I don't consider it a true lie, just a flight of fancy.",
        "Is this considered a true lie?",
        "His only motive seems to have been to get attention.",
        "Well, it is a lie if it's not true.",
        "And I mean, I think imagination is wonderful, but we also have to teach our kids the value of telling the truth.",
        "It's very hard to do that because as - I mean, kids start lying when they're, some as young as two years of age.",
        "By three, they begin to lie on a more regular basis.",
        "And for parents, it's very hard to teach their children to be honest.",
        "We talk about - we, I think most of us would say that honesty is the best policy, and that's what we teach our children.",
        "And we talk about American icons like George Washington, and Abraham Lincoln never told a lie, that sort of thing, but at the same time, we actually teach them to lie.",
        "We tell them a friend is coming over and bringing a gift to you.",
        "Make sure you tell them that you like it, even if you don't.",
        "Please tell them that, that you wanted this gift, or…",
        "Well, we're teaching them those social rules that make this - make their existence going to be easier a little later on.",
        "It is going to be easier, but it's also a very mixed message.",
        "We're telling them that on the one hand, always tell the truth, and on the other hand, well not so much.",
        "It's okay to lie in some cases.",
        "We tell them that the telephone rings, and you see it's the boss calling, your boss calling, you say to your kid, oh, tell him that I'm not here.",
        "And it's a very difficult message for kids to understand because on the one hand, it's always tell the truth, on the other, well, it's okay to lie in some cases.",
        "Let's go next to Dee(ph), Dee with us from Augusta, Georgia.",
        "Hi.",
        "I have a friend with whom I wasn't able to make contact for several months, and finally when I called her, she told me that her husband had been very ill and was in rehabilitation out of state.",
        "So I believed it.",
        "I continued to call and try to check on her, but she would never answer the phone.",
        "So I was concerned, but didn't stress over it.",
        "Well, the other night, she called me and said I have to come clean to you.",
        "He actually left me six months ago and…",

        "Well, they can be reestablished, and the marriage ultimately can be strengthened.",
        "But it's a relationship that's on different terms, where you have to have real forgiveness on the part of the person who's been cheated on.",
        "And there is a realization, I think, that the relationship is not going to be the same as it was before this loss of trust occurred.",
        "And I do write about the ways in which you can try and rebuild trust in a relationship, but it's certainly not easy and it doesn't always work.",

        "Numerous attorneys are burned every day in depositions or at trial by the unraveling of their clients' lies.",

        "It's very easy to convince ourselves of one thing or another and to believe it so much that it becomes our reality.",

        "I think you - it's helpful to move in a direction of being honest with other people, even though there can be some very, very painful moments.",
