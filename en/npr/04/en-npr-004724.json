        "What changes?",
        "When something like that happens, what's Carey referring to, Colonel Dinon?",
        "In the beginning, Sir, it was more of a lanes training concept of the trade-like(ph) approach that we had at that time in ‘01, '02, and it's evolved significantly, incorporating lessons learned from the battlefield and the whole concept of theater immersion training.",
        "Granted, the units are at the mobilization station a little bit longer, but they're coming out far better trained for the deployment.",

        "And, Carey, I'd be interested, if you're still on the line, if you agree with this - but a squad will be good because the sergeant that's running the squad is very good.",
        "And that sergeant will stay in the army because he wants to look after the young kids that will go on the next tour with him.",
        "So this is a people business and people get smarter.",
        "They send those lessons back.",
        "We have an institutional memory in the Army, that isn't part of the training schedule.",
        "It isn't part of the system.",
        "It's not dealt with in Pentagon - but it works with our soldiers in the field.",
        "Okay, Carey, thanks for calling.",

        "Yes, sir, they do.",
        "When we have the 30 to 40 percent soldiers that return back for the second tour, they did have that experience two to three years ago.",
        "They go back through the entire 41-11s, as we call it, for the individual training and collective.",
        "They bring a tremendous value of experience with them, but we also infuse the latest from a scenario in theater.",
        "The latest.",
        "How quickly, if a new kind of improvised explosive device or bomb, a new kind is set off in Iraq, how soon before that's incorporated into the experience here in New Jersey?",
        "Sir, out of the forward operating base, there are above - we call them battle update briefings, they occur and we get weekly feedback from theater, I would say within 72 hours.",
        "Within 72 hours, you might have somebody introducing a scenario that involves a bomb of that kind here for training purposes."

        "You can question a policy on the war without having to question the admiration, magnificent commitment, and courage of the men and women in uniform.",

        "And NPR benefits from that, because they have - they get things to put on the air.",
        "But the soldiers benefit more, because we come up with a better policy - if we don't accept what we're doing just because we did it six months ago.",
        "Sometimes when generals, or even retired generals say that, they're thinking of civilian officials at the Department of Defense.",
        "Are you thinking of generals as well?",
        "Not really because having - I did my last six years in the Pentagon, which will indicate to those of you that are familiar with that assignment pattern, that I made somebody really, really mad.",
        "And in six years, I saw both Secretary Rumsfeld and two other secretaries of defense and a couple of chairman of the joint chiefs of staff."
