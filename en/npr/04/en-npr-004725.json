        "And since then, we've had - we've had secretaries of defense and national security advisers really micromanaging the process.",

        "So why that mindset existed two to three years ago, it's really no longer the case today.",
        "The internal embedded observer controllers that are with each of units that are here at Fort Dix, many of them have recent combat experience, and this have been changing and improving continuously.",

        "What we know today - and the benefits have been getting better in terms of medical, dental.",
        "The retirement question is a good one.",
        "Today, it still resides for the Reserve Components at age 60.",
        "There is a lot of discussion in Congress, and we hope it continue as such, where tenure for operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, may offer the opportunity to have that start at below age 60.",

        "They are.",

        "Susan, that's a great question.",
        "Each unit has a family care organization embedded into it.",
        "And each of the units that come through the mobilization station have a rear detachment also that's assigned for that purpose.",
        "So that officer, Senior NCO, stays back with the unit to help manage the family programs while the rest of the unit goes forward.",
        "And that's something that's very ongoing, and we can't underestimate, you know, the complexity of that for the family members because it is different from being assigned to Fort Bragg or Fort Stewart, where the families pretty much are either right on the installation or nearby in the reserve component system.",
        "They're spread throughout the state of the region.",
        "So it's the decentralized effort.",
        "And we go back to where the home stations are located to where those family networks kind of are based out of.",
        "I mean, the difference when we hear from folks from Massapequa Park or Fairfield, Connecticut, is those aren't based towns where the entire communities of people have shipped out.",
        "They're individuals who may have come over with someone else but not with a large number of folks from that - from that community, a special challenge for the space.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it can get worse before it gets better.",
        "You remember there was a book out a couple of years ago called \"The Bedford Boys,\" that on the D-day invasion in Normandy, 19 people from Bedford, Virginia, were killed in the first two hours of the invasion.",
        "Because when you recruit - in the National Guard - you recruit from a single community.",
        "So losses in a unit, and losses tend to come together by unit, can be devastating on small towns.",
        "And I know that one of the units - I'm looking at the Colonel's training schedule here, I'm looking over his shoulder - the 138 Field Artillery, who's here now, was one of the three combat units to go to Vietnam.",
        "They were recruited from Bardstown, Kentucky in a very, very bad night at a fire base tomahawk.",
        "We lost five soldiers from the Kentucky Guard in one night, in one night.",
        "So casualties can fall very hard on Guard units.",
        "How do you approach that issue, Colonel Dinon, in training?",
        "That is, you're obviously training people for what you hope will be a successful experience when they're overseas.",
        "But they're going to experience setbacks, and perhaps the odd catastrophe.",
        "How do you work that into the training regimen?"

        "Another part is its simulated training - I mean, simulated evacuations - and injuries and casualties throughout the training cycle here for everyone, as well as real live data coming in twice a week from the field, from the theater.",
        "So there's several parts to it in terms of the training, but a lot of the casualty hands-on, while it's simulated, it's very real.",
        "And that's all part of, I think, the psychological training, as one can best be prepared going into that theater.",

        "What didn't?",
        "How we modified it?",
