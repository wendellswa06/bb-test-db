        "First question - what is the biggest difference between married sex and dating sex, or married sex and non-married sex?",
        "Dr. Ronn?",
        "I don't know that there is much difference at all in the first 90 days.",
        "It happens after you're married, though.",
        "The major difference is not the attraction, not the importance of the relationship, not even the technicals that have to do with lovemaking.",
        "It is the whole drama, that intangible kind of psychology that happens in our minds that says this is the same sex partner that I am going to be having next week and tomorrow and next year and year after year.",
        "And I think then, some of the excitement level can be a challenge to achieve.",
        "But Dr. Young, do you think that men - husbands, boyfriends - see that differently than women - wives, girlfriends - do?",
        "I think they might.",
        "And I also think that there are some differences potentially in dating sex and married sex in that when we're still dating and having sex, it might be around different agendas.",
        "And we might not know for sure what our partner is wanting in that relationship.",
        "And so we're on our best behavior, including our best sexual behavior, when it comes to dating sex.",
        "So if we're using sex as the lure, for example, as women are typically the gatekeepers of sex and men are typically the ones who make the overtures, we might be using sex in order to get something.",
        "And that sets up a power struggle or a power difference before we're married.",
        "After we're married, if the goal was to have the intimate relationship and keep it for a lifetime, then the truth comes out about what our sexuality is really all about.",
        "So it might not necessarily be different if we're dating honestly and with integrity and with genuine intimacy.",
        "But I find that a lot of people are dating with agendas, and they might not be the same, and sex is a big part of how it gets played out.",
        "So Dr. Young, what you're talking about is honesty.",
        "Absolutely."

        "I think they hope to, they want to and may come close to it.",
        "But I do believe that we kind of present our idealized versions of our self when we're first meeting someone and entering a dating relationship.",
        "And over time, with the marriage, once we feel secure in the relationship, then I guess the key is when we can feel secure and have trust and allow ourselves to be more vulnerable, then we can feel our integrity come out in full force.",
        "When we feel like we have to protect ourselves and there's something that we might lose, it's harder to maintain our integrity because we're hoping to put our best self forward or the self that we believe can't be hurt.",
        "So one thing that I think is often a question for women is do you offer yourself to a man?",

        "You know, don't compromise yourself, all those - and, of course, women are sexual actors, too.",
        "I'm not trying to make it as if women don't ever want to have sex, but there does seem to be this dichotomy.",
        "Maybe you can speak from the women's perspective, you know.",
        "If a woman feels like she's getting a message, you know, pressured to enter from, you know, other forms of intimacy - cuddling or whatever - into sex, with someone whom she's not married to, could there be some problems with figuring things out once they reach that stage of marriage?",
        "I think this is such a key question.",
        "One of the things that continues to amaze me is the endurance of the sexual double standard over time.",
        "It is still here.",
        "We might want to believe it's not here, but it's absolutely here.",
        "And women are viewed differently, especially by each other, if they are engaging in sexual behavior that people might think of as promiscuous or especially free.",
        "And there's an interesting paradox here, because if we hold on to our sexuality as if it's some sort of precious gift - and a lot of us feel that way about our sexuality.",
        "Yes, it's precious, but if we think of it as the thing that we give away or give up or offer to someone and not as an exchange or a sharing that's special and spiritual and even and equal, then we run the risk of treating our own sexuality like it's an object.",
        "And that makes us treat ourselves as an object - a precious object, nevertheless, but still an object.",

        "And so for the people who are holding their sexuality tightly and using it as a lure to get someone to wait for them come forward, we run the risk of having them treat the whole thing like a game and think of us an object to be won, as opposed to an equal to be shared with.",
        "Now, I totally agree that waiting for a while, waiting long enough to really know who you're dealing with, to know what each person's integrity is all about, to having some sense of trust, to having a sense of how responsible this person is, how - what their personality characteristics are, what their values are, and whether this is really a love interest or not and what your values are - all of those are really good reasons to wait.",

        "Yeah, I think it is certainly possible to get over it.",
        "I want to start back at the beginning of what you said.",
        "I believe that it's very true for men, and as Dr. Young has pointed out, it's very much our responsibility to make sure that we don't let sexuality become an object.",
        "But I believe it is another thing, and that is symbol.",
        "Particularly to men, sex is full of all kinds of symbolic meaning for men, like how admired I am, how respected I am, how good I am.",
        "In a lot of ways, the things that men value most, we treat them as if it's a job to do.",
        "And sex is the part of love that is technical and mechanical and performance-oriented, and I think it's hugely appealing to men that way.",
        "And so when they think about the fact that in marriage relationship, here's this thing that I get to demonstrate my love with, and that is the symbol of sexuality and my performance in it, and my audience is going to be the same audience forever.",
        "I think at a certain point, men who quote, unquote, \"\"get over it,\"\" it's because we choose another reward, and that is the reward of, here is another person who knows me and loves me in light of what I am and in spite of what I am, and that I have the familiarity and the richness of another kind of intimacy, even if I take a loss on having a huge and growing audience of fans for my sexual performance.",
