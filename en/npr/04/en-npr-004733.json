        "Well, the government was trying to keep people from being scared away from the polls by banning reporting on violence today.",
        "Did that make it hard to find out about that gun battle in Kabul, where you are?",
        "No, because the - both the foreign journalists and the local journalists collectively decided to defy that ban.",
        "So that wasn't the problem.",
        "The problem probably is more that rumors get started, as well.",
        "So, yes, the government did say that, you know, you were not allowed to report on any violence today during voting hours, but again, both international and local journalists decided to ignore that.",
        "One other thing also, because Afghans, of course, are choosing a president here.",
        "Hamid Karzai is looking for a second term.",
        "He's got a number of challengers.",
        "And as we've heard on this program in recent days, it was quite a lively campaign, especially toward the end.",
        "Now, as you watched people, those who did show up today in Kabul come out to vote, did people seem at all excited about the opportunity, excited about voting for someone or determined to vote against anybody, for that matter?",
        "Yes.",
        "The people that we spoke with today, there was a lot of excitement about this.",
        "And as we understood it, in the lead up to this election, you know, what we've been covering in, you know, in our reporting, is that people were very excited.",
        "And it was a very lively campaign.",
        "But it just didn't seem to have panned out that way so far.",
        "Again, you know, we don't have all the numbers of turnout throughout the country.",
        "We're hearing reports that, in fact, you know, it's pretty good up north, where security is much better.",
        "And as you would expect, in the south, the turnout wasn't quite as good, although some people are saying it was better than they actually expected.",
        "Well, now, that's interesting, and could actually affect the election because you do have a country with different ethnic groups predominating in different areas, and they tended to coalesce behind different candidates.",
        "You could actually have Hamid Karzai harmed by a low turnout, for example, in the south, couldn't you?",
        "You could.",
        "And, I mean, we want to very careful that we don't get too far ahead of tallies and who voted for whom.",
        "But you're absolutely right.",
        "In the north, it's more favorable conditions, actually, for Dr. Abdullah Abdullah.",
        "And he's the main contender against President Karzai.",
        "If there's a low turnout in the south - which is where Karzai really has a strong political base - it's hard to say what - how this will actually end up in the final tally.",
        "When will we get official results?",
        "Well, the first indications are probably going to come out in about two days time, 48 hours after the polls close.",
        "We won't get the first official result, though, until September 3rd.",
        "So it's going to be a little while yet before we get a real clear indication of who is going to win this election and whether or not there's going to be a runoff election.",
        "NPR's Jackie Northam is reporting today from Kabul, where a presidential election was underway.",
        "Jackie, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you, Steve."

        "Well, I would first point to three types of places.",
        "One, you know, if you're a farmer, particularly in a poor country, but also in our country, and you're in an area that doesn't naturally get a lot of rain, those sorts of areas may become hotter and dryer in the future.",
        "Crop yields are already decreasing.",
        "The second thing I'd point to are problems along the coast due to, as we're quite familiar with in a lot of the states in this country, the combination of the rising seas and coastal storms.",
        "This has made living in places like New York or Miami or New Orleans progressively more risky as storms drive the sea into inland places that it's basically never been before.",
        "The third area I point to which effects people particularly in cities anywhere in the United States, which already have an urban heat island effect - well, I'd point to the extra frequency with which we're getting already and are going to get more in the future - heat waves.",
        "In Europe in 2003, about 40,000 people died in the heat wave.",
        "We just can't afford to have that risk increasing over time.",

        "Basically, we need to have a transformation in the way we produce and use energy.",
        "And the good news is we're partially, perhaps painfully slowly, moving along in that transition.",
        "The price of solar energy has plummeted.",

        "And obviously the most number of districts that could be won by either party would get the highest score.",
        "So--but what's happened here is that the debate has, and I think very cleverly so by the opponents of Issue 4 redistricting, has turned on what these maps might look like, and as a result, the opponents have put out a sample redistricting map which they say scores 26, which is the highest anyone has submitted so far, which has districts that look like string beans.",
        "I mean, there was one congressional district that snakes along the western border of Ohio with Indiana that goes all the way from Toledo to Cincinnati.",
        "Now the opponents have put out their own maps, and they show more compactness.",
        "But both of them are not exactly showing compact districts.",
        "And the Ohio proposal differs from California in any other redistricting proposal we've seen in that it--the top criteria, the high priority for the line-drawers is competitiveness.",
        "California focuses on compact districts and, you know, trying to avoid the sprawling, oddly shaped districts that have been drawn in that state.",
        "And a week away from the election, what do the polls suggest how Issue #4, the redistricting proposal, is going to do there or not?",
        "Well, we did a poll October 1st, and it was shown to be losing by 12 points, but there were 36 percent of the respondents who were undecided.",
        "I think that the polling still shows that it's going to go down.",
        "It's going down.",
        "Part of the reason is because it's very complicated.",
        "It's confusing.",
        "You talk about sprawl; it sprawls all over the ballot.",
