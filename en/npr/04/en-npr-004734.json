        "Now as you look at that ballot initiative in Ohio and Proposition 77, the redistricting proposal in California, part of the problems that they present is that the solutions are sometimes almost as strange-looking as the problem.",
        "That's right, and part of that is because it's one of these sort of zero-sum dynamics often, where if you're trying to accomplish one goal, it can cut against another goal.",
        "And that's one of the complex parts of this that I think we're all pretty much agreed that we're in a very difficult situation, a very problematic one where, you know, we've had single-digit incumbent defeats since 1996 and...",

        "Very little turnover.",

        "Hi.",

        "That's the contiguous, compact district argument.",
        "Why isn't it done that way?",
        "Well, that's how Iowa tries to do it.",
        "Iowa has a non-partisan, criteria-driven process, and that's one of their key criteria: Let's not try to break up the jurisdiction lines so that voters who--have sort of a political coherence to it.",
        "So if you and I live in the same county, well, we'll likely have the same representative.",
        "But that doesn't accomplish some of the other goals.",
        "Like in Ohio, if you're really going to try to use single-member districts in a way to try to give more voters choices in competitive elections, you often have to split up counties because counties tend to have a partisan tilt.",
        "People tend to go places and live with other people who are more like them than different from them.",
        "The expression I've heard is that we Americans tend to live in landslide counties.",
        "Landslide counties.",
        "That's--you know, so if you look at the president race, the red-blue maps by county, you see great geographic coherence, you know, that whole swaths of area are blue and others are red, and so if you draw squares combining those counties, you know, you're typically going to get a red district or a blue district.",
        "So, Paul, if you were doing that in Philadelphia, for example, you'd get a whole lot of blue districts.",
        "Democrats would just be elected there.",
        "Well, doesn't that seem more fair?",
        "I don't know.",
        "To me, it seems like a fairly straight cut-and-dry issue.",
        "Like, if you live in an area with a majority of Democrats, then maybe it should be a Democratic district.",
        "But if you have 90 percent Democrats in one district and 60 percent Republicans in a lot of other districts, you're going to end up electing a lot of Republicans and not too many Democrats."

        "Yeah, but it's fair within a certain definition of fairness, and it is the classic definition of what a fair redistricting process should be.",
        "Let's keep compact districts, make them look as squarish as possible.",
        "But then when you see that representation matters a great deal to people--and fairness can be defined in a number of different ways, and one of the ways that is seen as fair is that if a political party and the candidates supporting it win, you know, 55 percent of the statewide vote, they should win a majority of seats.",
        "That won't necessarily happen when you draw nice square districts, and you also might not achieve some other goals, which is trying to provide fair representation of racial minorities, opportunities for other communities of interest to win seats.",
        "And people also argue that if it's a safe Democratic or a safe Republican seat, the real contest is in the party primary.",
        "It tends to drive both parties to the extremes; more liberal Democrats, more conservative Republicans at the loss of the center.",

        "Hi.",
        "You're on the air.",
        "Oh, I was just calling, actually, to ask why aren't districts drawn by shared economic interests and social services?",
        "I understand that can start spreading out across, you know, the state, but I was wondering if that was a more viable alternative.",
        "Yeah, what is a community of interests?",
        "Is it a physical community where you live, or are these things more amorphous, Rob?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, classically, I think people saw our geographic differences being symptomatic of a lot of the other differences that we think should be fairly represented so that, you know, you would have farmers in a particular area, and if they get one representative, you know, that person would be sort of representing farmers.",
        "We certainly do see a lot more mixing of people.",
        "The districts have gotten a lot bigger.",
        "We now have the average House size at about 650,000 people.",
        "So you've got a lot of differences just based on that.",
        "And it's a push-pull situation.",
        "As long as one person's going to try to represent everyone in a particular area, it really means that where you live is more important than what you think and what your interests are, unless some group of sort of elite deciders of our representation as they draw districts try to accommodate your aspirations as a voter.",
        "And that's having other people make decisions that in some ways we would like to see the voters decide.",
        "But have people drawn up maps using ideas of economic or social interests just as a model?",
        "It's a factor.",
        "It's a fascinating process of how district lines are drawn.",
        "What I hope we can see coming out of this is that if these measures do go down, as it looks quite plausible, that the conversation doesn't stop and that we look at what commissions are already doing, and there's a number of models out there, certainly a lot of international models, different voting methods as well.",
        "And to try to see what criteria should govern redistricting--and it probably won't be the same everywhere, but we should have that conversation everywhere and see more models that we can see how they work.",
        "It's been fascinating to read that you get a different map of California depending on whether you start drawing districts from south to north or from north to south.",
        "That would make sense, and/or east to west or west to east.",
        "California, by the way, is one of those states where every coastal district is represented by a Democrat except some of the ones right, you know, down near San Diego, and every interior district representing the states to the east of California is represented by a Republican.",
        "That red-blue divide, you know, has this strong, strong impact on how we vote, so if you start in one direction vs. the other, yes, you're going to have some impact."

        "I'm president of Californians for Electoral Reform.",
        "Aha.",
        "And the point that I wanted to make is that you cannot have a district that is both competitive and representative.",
        "If a district is competitive, meaning it can go either way, the margin of victory is going to be 5 percent or less, meaning at least 47 percent of the people wanted somebody else to represent them.",
        "If a district is representative, meaning the winner gets an overwhelming majority of the vote, at least 60 percent, then it's not going to be competitive.",
        "And so you have this zero-sum game with single-member districts.",
        "You cannot solve the problem of having a district that's both competitive and representative.",
        "So what our organization advocates is proportional representation...",
        "I knew we were going there.",
        "...using multimember districts where you allocate the winners based upon the--in direct proportion to how people vote.",
        "Well, redistricting reform is on the ballot, though it's not being favored by voters in either Ohio or California at the moment.",
        "What about proportional representation?",
        "Well, it is the international norm.",
        "Most modern democracies use proportional voting systems, and I think as one goes deeper into this debate--I think Steve fingered a very clear paradox, which is if you have a competitive district, even if it is representative in that one election of a certain point of view, it variously won't be representative of that the next time.",
        "And certain kinds of representation, we probably want to have pretty consistently represented or else people feel, you know, less connected to their legislatures.",
        "I think proportional systems are often thought to be sort of one thing, and people think it's like--`Oh, that's what--didn't they use that in Italy and that has, like, you know, 400 parties elected and'--you know.",
        "And the reality is, there's a whole family of systems, some of which open the door a lot less to multiparty democracy than others.",
        "The one that we think particularly speaks to this debate--and as we look at a kind of measure that would plausibly be on the ballot and I think be a strong one in the short term would be what Illinois used to use.",
        "They had three-seat constituencies, so they had three representatives in a district, rather than one, and they used a voting method--their particular method was cumulative voting, but it's one of these proportional systems where it took about a third of the vote to win one of the three seats and a majority to win two out of three.",
        "And what you typically saw was one party winning two seats, the other party winning one, third parties being around and able to hold the major parties accountable.",
        "But you did balance more of the goals that people are seeking, which is voter choice and sort of continuity of representation, more representation of some of the interests that our callers have been mentioning."
