        "In 2000, Iowa redistricted, forcing you to move districts.",
        "You had a much tighter race on your hands than you'd had before.",
        "Essentially you had more work.",
        "Tell us what happened.",
        "Well, Iowa has probably the model redistricting plan in the country.",
        "Most redistricting is done to protect incumbents of both parties.",
        "It's sometimes done in the state to disadvantage a party, but more likely than not, it's a incumbent protection circumstance.",
        "Iowa has a non-partisan commission that redistricts as honestly as any state in the country, and it generally, therefore, creates some discombobulation.",
        "But most of all, for the sake of the public, it creates very competitive races.",
        "And discombobulation--you had to move."

        "In those circumstances, obviously an awkward thing to do and difficult to do.",

        "I was fortunate that I moved to the home of the University of Iowa in Iowa City, which is, in my judgment, one of the cultural capitals of the country, and so in a lifestyle sense, to live in a university environment is something that's a great plus.",
        "As you pointed out correctly, Iowa has some of the most competitive, certainly, congressional races anywhere in the country, certainly in terms of proportion.",
        "Yet I think if you go back, Iowa incumbents do very well.",
        "Generally all incumbents do rather well in America today, although in Iowa the races are usually much more competitive than elsewhere.",
        "But as you know, Neal, redistricting is one of these subjects that's about as interesting as someone else's genealogy.",
        "We're hoping it's more interesting than that today at least.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "On the other hand, very few things are more important to the health of our democracy, and, you know, we have the great question whether politicians choose their voters or voters their politicians.",

        "Well, it surely is, and we do have an awkward thing as well, though, that in the House, there are 435 House seats, of which about 380 are considered safe seats and about half of those are Democratic, half Republican.",
        "And so it means that in those seats, one is inclined if one's a Republican to in all likelihood be on the right side of the party and, if one's a Democrat, to be on the left side of the party.",
        "And unlike in a presidential race, where people after primaries kind of scoot to the center, in Congress, your only incentive is to stay right and stay left, because the only challenge will be within the party.",
        "And so institutionally, when you have a Congress composed overwhelmingly--85 percent at least--of safe seats, that means composed of people of the fairly far to the right, fairly far to the left who have no incentive to compromise.",
        "And so you have a kind of an institutional shootout.",

        "They move into a district because of a job.",
        "I mean, it just doesn't make any sense to me to redistrict.",
        "All they're--it's a politician's tool.",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "We have a whole history of action and non-action on whether to redistrict.",
        "In the 1960s, there was some big Supreme Court rulings requiring equal population of districts, and they needed to do those because some states weren't redistricting, and so they were having some districts literally be 10 times the population of other districts, and we can do that with the US Senate right now, but we can't do it with anything else.",
        "And the problem is that you can have, you know, majorities sort of spread around in the wrong districts that the population differences can really create problems.",
        "So that every 10 years, we get new population counts and we redraw districts to have population equality.",
        "And there's some good reasons for that, but that also means that every 10 years, those elected officials are getting a chance to fine-tune districts and pursue certain corrupt opportunities to either protect friends or hurt enemies.",
        "And it has--the cumulative effect of that has actually been a lot less competitive districts, even though the old method of not districting in a lot of states obviously had big problems, too.",
        "Yeah, it violated one man, one vote, basically."

        "Well, yeah, which is defined in a sense of having equal constituents, you know, the equal number of people in the same district.",
        "But it certainly can mean that you have a lot more votes cast in one district than another, which, by the way, we often get anyway during the course of a decade.",
        "Like people in Nevada probably know that the area around Las Vegas is shooting up in population, and I think they had a district that had about 400,000 more people than another district by the end of the 1990s.",

        "(technical difficulties) why not use an impartial computer algorithm to do it and set it and forget it?",
        "Well, that's in a--kind of close to what they're doing in Ohio or the proposal is on the table in Ohio, which is that anyone can come up with a plan that theoretically could win there, and there is a tradition in Ohio, which is one of those states where this issue has been debated for a long time.",
        "There's been some very smart advocates of it, to what they call remove discretion, that this should be a criteria-driven process and actually a criteria-governed process.",
        "It's that transition to governing the process that can be complicated because, yes, it's important to have this conversation about criteria.",
        "I think it really should be as governed as possible by criteria.",
        "But come the time to redistrict, it's plausible that there are certain developments that have happened since you established your criteria that might make those criteria not seem fair to people anymore, and that's why they tend to try to have an element of personal decisionmaking going into these commissions, but the more of that there is, the more controversy flows from them having discretion.",

        "Well, you know, Dennis' effort is actually the model that I think a lot of the reformers are pointing to.",
        "Look, this can win at the polls and they did win a strong, near-landslide win at the polls in 2000, and credit to them for taking this seemingly esoteric issue before a lot of people were talking about it and winning.",
        "But it is interesting to then look at what happened with the commission.",
        "It did remove some of the controversial elements of redistricting.",
        "You didn't have politicians in a self-interested way drawing their own districts.",
        "However, there have been 16 US House races in--under the new plan, and 15 have been won by at least 20 points.",
        "So not very competitive.",
        "No incumbents have lost.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And the number of women in the state Legislature actually went down in 2002 after redistricting.",
        "Now whether that was impactive or not, but at least the people drawing the lines, I think, didn't factor in representation of women as one of their criteria.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "She also adds, `Will taxpayers have to pay their salary?",
        "I'm for an independent board, but not too thrilled about paying for anymore salaries.",
        "But, you know, again if it's an independent, bipartisan board, aren't you then sort of re-creating the problem in miniature?",
        "Well, it seems to be at least one of the possible outcomes, and there were several state legislative commissions in 2001-2002, and one of the things that I think is really important here is that every single state legislative plan that was drawn by legislators didn't--resulted in no turnover.",
        "There was not a single chamber that changed in a district plan that had been created by the people who then ran in those districts.",
        "And there were several that did change, and they either came from redistricting commissions or from judges who drew plans.",
        "That shows the power of drawing district lines.",
        "However, some of those changes in district chambers that flowed from what a judge did or from what a commission did was very controversial and seen by certainly the lowers in the process as very partisan, and they could claim it's not accountable either.",
        "Like these people weren't elected, and then suddenly they're changing the political power structure in this state.",
        "You know, is that fair either?",
        "And they did tend to have some leeway.",
        "They had political data to be used, and if you don't use political data, then you can't try to create competitive districts because you don't know what it is to make them competitive, but if you do use political data, you're open to charges that you're trying to help one party or the other, and that definitely happened in several of these states.",
        "And very quickly, Joe Hallett at the Columbus Dispatch told us earlier that the proposal there is failing, is running behind in opinion polls.",
        "California the same?",
