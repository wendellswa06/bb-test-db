        "I mean, we've seen in the past like sometimes you can decide that what we see in an off-year election like this, it does mean something.",
        "We saw in 1989, for example, David Dinkins is the first black mayor of New York City, Doug Wilder the first black governor of Virginia, first black governor period elected in Virginia, and then three years later we saw Bill Clinton elected.",
        "So sometimes it does lead to things, but for the most part these are very localized--you know, all politics is local, especially this year.",
        "And those of us who live in and around Washington, DC, have seen a ton of advertisements this year about the governor's race in Virginia, which seems to be, well, nasty.",
        "Well, it's nasty.",
        "So is the governor's race in New Jersey.",
        "But what's interesting about the Virginia race is that, again, this is a state that George W.",
        "Bush carried handily both times, 2000, 2004, and yet the latest polls show 55 percent and higher disapproving of the president's performance, and that has to help Democrat Tim Kaine.",
        "He's the lieutenant governor under retiring Governor Mark Warner.",
        "Warner--Virginia's the only state in the country that you have one governorship and you're out.",
        "You can't seek a second term.",
        "But what's interesting about Mark Warner, he's leaving office with 70, 75 percent approval rating in the popularity polls, and if that's the case, one, it's good news for Tim Kaine, and, two, it could project Mark Warner to the president, 'cause he's obviously looking at 2008.",
        "And some people have noticed that President Bush has been in Virginia, just across the Potomac River from where he lives most of the time, a couple of times in the past couple of weeks, and Republican gubernatorial candidate Terry Kilgore has found reason to be elsewhere.",
        "Right.",
        "The president was in Norfolk last week for actually a presidential visit, not a campaign visit, and Kilgore was noticeably absent.",
        "But it's interesting, you know, we talk about who's gonna win the presidential nomination for the Republicans in 2008, and we talk about conservatives.",
        "We talk about the Sam Brownbacks, we talk about the George Allens, but yet when these candidates want Republicans to come in and campaign for them, they don't go for the conservatives.",
        "Terry Kilgore, the former attorney general of Virginia, who'd he have in?",
        "Rudy Giuliani, John McCain.",
        "It's interesting who these Republicans want to campaign for them.",
        "The governorship in New Jersey, again a lot of money in that race, Jon Corzine.",
        "Michael Oppenheimer.",

        "Thanks so much for talking with us, Michael.",
        "Right, Jon Co--well, both candidates are multi-millionaires.",
        "The Republican, Doug Forrester, also has lots and lots of money.",
        "But Corzine spent $60 million plus to win the Senate seat five years ago, and now he's leaving to, you know, want to be the governorship--want to be the governor as well, and he's spending a ton of money as well.",
        "Both candidates are self-financed.",
        "That's why Virginia is seeing so much money, because since the New Jersey candidates are so heavily financed by themselves, the national parties can afford to move into Virginia.",
        "Let me ask you, also, about a couple of mayors races.",
        "New York City, Mayor Bloomberg seems to have that race pretty well locked up, and we're now going to see something a lot of people would have said impossible, two consecutive two-term Republican mayors in the city of New York.",
        "First time in history, and that's what's so remarkable about this.",
        "New York City is 5:1 Democratic.",
        "Michael Bloomberg actually was a Democrat.",
        "He became a Republican solely for running for mayor in 2001, but given the fact that the city has recovered tremendously from the terrible bombings of 9/11, the attacks of 9/11, Bloomberg is getting a lot of the credit and the Democratic nominee, former Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, is not taking advantage.",
        "Basically Ferrer is being outspent 17:1.",
        "His only hope is an act of God, really."

        "A conservative Democrat incumbent is racing against a more liberal Democrat, and the incumbent is losing badly.",

        "It's hard to make the case why he would do that, but he did, and the vo--if you look at the polls in St. Paul, the reason Kelly is gonna probably lose his bid for re-election is because of the endorsement of George Bush in 2004.",
