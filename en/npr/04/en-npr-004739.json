        "It is really hard and dangerous work, 10-hour days swinging a knife in the hot sun.",
        "And when the job market's strong, like it has been for the last few years, these workers have a lot of other options.",
        "They move into - whether it's landscaping jobs, construction jobs, food service jobs.",

        "Tom says the agriculture visas that the country offers - they're too difficult to get, they're expensive and there just aren't enough of them.",
        "Deardorff Farms used to hire more than 600 workers every year.",
        "But Tom says he can't make that happen anymore, so he's had to make changes to his business.",
        "Well, you know, one thing that jumped out, Audie, in the report - it said the odds of experiencing sexual assault were higher in units with a prevalence of sexual harassment or gender discrimination or workplace hostility.",
        "So they know which units are having problems.",
        "They know which leaders are having problems.",
        "So my question is, why aren't they holding these leaders accountable, either counseling them or getting rid of them?",

        "The president was in Europe this week, of course, and came home yesterday to disappointing job numbers.",
        "Are they an economic warning shot, if you please, about trade wars?",
        "It may be, except that the month of May had largely passed before the latest round of trade threats began.",
        "So these numbers appear to have more to do with where the overall economy stands after roughly a decade of expansion.",
        "We're well into the late stage of the cycle.",
        "And some degree of slowdown may be expected.",
        "Still, the weak jobs numbers highlighted the dangers of more trade war at this moment.",
        "Impeachment continues a kind of slow roll.",

        "But at the same time, sizable majorities also believe that abortion rights can coexist with some restrictions, mostly having to do with the timing of abortion and the status of the fetus.",
        "And these voters are frustrating to the activists at both extremes on the issue, the people who would ban all or nearly all abortions on one hand and those who would allow abortion under any circumstances on the other.",

        "Last year, the Pentagon says some 20,000 service members of that - of 13,000 women and 7,500 men experienced some type of sexual assault.",
        "But only one third of those filed a report.",
        "Now, that 20,000 figure, Audie, is 37 percent higher than two years ago.",
        "And most of the assaults, we're told, happen to service members 17 to 24, usually at the hands of a friend or acquaintance.",
        "And the majority of these assaults occur at a military facility or onboard a ship.",
        "How does that break down across individual services?",

        "Well, overall they say they're disheartened.",
        "They're angry.",
        "They have all these training programs going on and more announced today, but it continues to be a problem.",
        "One official said responsibility for eliminating this crime from the military lies with leadership - is what they often say.",
        "Now, the Marines, as we said, have the highest increase in assaults - 23 percent.",
        "And the top Marine officer, General Robert Neller, said in a statement the Marines have to come up with more prevention methods and also must continue, he said, to foster a culture of dignity and respect.",
        "But was there any sense of the reason why the Marines would see such a high increase compared to the other services?",
        "You know, we don't know for sure, but some are pointing to the fact that the Marines have the smallest percentage of women in the force, roughly 9 percent or so.",
        "And that's about half the number of the other services.",
        "And they're also the only service that separates men and women in boot camp.",
        "So I spoke with retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel Kate Germano.",
        "She ran the female-only battalion down at Parris Island Recruit Depot.",
        "She thinks that separating men and women is not a good idea.",
        "And the women recruits, she said, are not required to do the same physical tests as the men.",
        "She said that sends the wrong message.",
        "Let's listen.",
        "It's very easy to do humanize women Marines and make them the other by saying there is a - less value for them because they don't train the same way; they don't earn the title of Marine the same way as the male recruits do.",
        "Now, the Marines are considering having men and women train together at boot camp maybe next year.",
        "They did have one coed training company this year.",
