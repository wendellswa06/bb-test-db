        "When President Bush announced what was to be a $5 billion program, he called it the most advanced technology ever deployed at the border.",
        "Two billion dollars later, after they had installed just a fraction of the stuff, they canceled the whole program because the sensors - the alarms went off if mosquitoes flew over the border.",

        "And I wonder whether zero fatalities from terrorism is a realistic expectation.",
        "What should the goal be?",
        "Well, as I make real clear in the article - at least I hope I do - it is unrealistic to think that we can prevent all terrorist attacks, especially if you define a terrorist attack as, you know, someone who goes into a gun store and buys an assault rifle and then, you know, goes into a shopping mall or a theater and shoots a lot of people and yells out something in Arabic because he read something on the internet.",
        "There is just no way to prevent that except by doing something about an assault weapons.",
        "That's unrealistic.",
