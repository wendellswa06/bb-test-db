        "Well, basically, the sports blog is taking readers behind the stories of what you're going to find in a newspaper.",
        "You got to find different irreverent type of things, things that you would not find in mainstream news.",
        "And then also, you have different blogs such as Deadspin.com, where you actually get some nice takes on, you know, just - let's go on in the world of sports.",
        "And you'll also find some - you get to see players in compromising positions.",
        "You might find athletes - there was actually a link on Deadspin to the Boston Red Sox celebrating the AL East crown at a bar, getting drunk.",

        "Some of them are casual.",
        "Some of them just want to get across their opinions of sports in a casual fashion.",
        "And then, you have other writers that want to be more serious, or it just really depends on what type of genre that they want to write in.",
        "Well, Greg, you are all African-American bloggers and you're reading other blogs out there, of course.",
        "What makes black blogs unique in a blogosphere, or are they?",
        "I think, first, there really aren't many black bloggers out as with just journalism or just in this sphere.",
        "We're just starting to get into it.",
        "But the difference is from what I've read from the various black bloggers I've seen out there, we bring in, you know, a different perspective of how we see things.",
        "We bring in more of an edge that's a little bit more colorful, brings a little bit more, you know, hip-hoppish-type of thing, a little pop culture but more of - sometimes I see it as more of a street thing, which is cool.",
        "It's a different take than, you know, the type of humor that I'm accustomed to than, you know, some other bloggers made, some other bigger bloggers who - some of their humor I can't really get into, can't get into because I can't really relate.",

        "She is a politician with three - with 30 years of experience under her belt, right?",

        "No, definitely not.",
        "Pelosi's got a lot of strengths.",

        "She's raised $16 million just in the first quarter alone here.",
        "And that can't be discounted in a year when Democrats are looking to win back the House.",
        "You know, she's been at the helm of the Democratic party since when Democrats took over the House in 2007.",
        "She shepherded key legislation for President Barack Obama through really a fractious cautious - caucus with no drama whatsoever, which is not something Republican leaders can say for sure.",

        "But they think that she's pretty tough, can get things done.",
        "Another Democrat, though, described her as easily the most effective speaker in a generation but added, I do think it's time to usher in a new era.",
        "And even the earlier Democrat that I talked to said that he thinks that she should step aside in 2020 when President Trump is running for re-election.",

        "Yeah.",

        "You know, one analysis found that one out of every three ads this cycle, Republican ads this cycle, are using Pelosi's image to attack the Democrat that's running.",
        "There's reasons that they do this.",
        "Republicans found that Pelosi's the most unpopular figure in those swing districts.",
        "An NBC national poll earlier in March found that she's the least popular person or institution, that of everyone that they rated, her approval rating's in the 20s, lower than both political parties and even President Trump.",
        "That's why Democrats in swing districts, the places that Democrats need to win to take back the House, are distancing themselves from Pelosi.",
        "One Republican operative I talked to today said he's ecstatic that Pelosi is going to try to run for speaker again if they win.",
        "Is that enough to win midterms?",
        "I mean, that's the big question, right?",
        "Just running against Pelosi is going to open up Republicans to criticism that they don't have a message."
