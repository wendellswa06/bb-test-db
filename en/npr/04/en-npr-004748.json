        "It's true, but, you know, if you use the supermarket the right way, and I did two series on television called \"\"Fast Food My Way.\"\" And that last book \"\"Essential Pepin,\"\" I mean it used to be that you had to start at the beginning and practically kill the chicken, when I was an apprentice and pluck it and so forth.",
        "Now, you know, you use the supermarket, basically, as a prep cook.",
