        "And I still enjoy watching the show just for the chemistry.",
        "And you are a gracious man, and thank you so much for the show.",
        "OK.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thank you, but you know, I met Julia in 1960, you know?",

        "The kind of trinity of cooking, you know, James Beard, Julia Child and Craig Claiborne - just to show you how small the food world was, extremely small at that time.",
        "So I became friends with Julia, and then I have been teaching at Boston University for 30 years, and she lived in Cambridge, of course, so we cook together a great deal.",
        "We met.",
        "We eat together.",

        "Actually, I lecture on it a couple of time.",
        "The movie started in 1949 and finished in 1961 when she published \"\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking,\"\" so it's a great deal of her time in France.",
        "And Julia used to kid me that we started cooking together because she came to France in 1949 and I went into apprenticeship in 1949.",
        "Of course, I was 13 years old.",
        "But the time depicted at the time was very accurate, and I thought it was terrific.",
        "And I think that Meryl Streep was just amazing.",
        "She (unintelligible) Julia in that movie.",
        "I don't know how she did it, but a great movie.",

        "The very best ones were the ones he did with Julia.",
        "Those shows were hilarious.",

        "Usually, when we do the series - and my daughter did a few show with me.",
        "My granddaughter even did a couple of show with me.",
        "And usually, I mean, when you come, you have the recipe with you, or at least you may change them a little bit along the way, but you have the manuscript, so the back kitchen and all that know where we're going.",
        "When we did that series with Julia, we had no recipe.",
        "We discuss about, OK, let's do stew one day or let's do eggs or let's do whatever, but we didn't have actual recipe.",
        "So we started cooking like you cook with friend or with your spouse, you know?",
        "So I'm thinking one thing or another and cooking together."

        "Some counties, including Harris, is already up by tenfold.",
        "This is just the early voting, where people go to special locations and mail in ballots as well.",
        "It is not the actual primary, which will take place on March 4th, although all these votes do count.",
        "Well, let's talk about their various tactics, the two candidates on the Democratic side - Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.",
        "You know, Ron, when they debated last week in Texas at the end of that debate it almost sounded like Hillary Clinton was saying goodbye.",
        "She said, you know, no matter what happens I'll be fine.",

        "I'm sure there must be some of both in this, Madeleine.",
        "I think that on one hand the campaign, at least some of the people in Hillary Clinton's campaign, have felt such enormous frustration with the popularity of Barack Obama, with what they see as the media's preference for Barack Obama, and the media doing everything it can to support him and promote him and knock down their candidate.",
        "So she's frustrated.",
        "Her campaign is frustrated.",
        "And they have calculated they must make a change.",
        "But I think in this one particular incident she risks going too far and offending people who, while they haven't decided yet between the two candidates, do see some appeal in Barack Obama's message and don't find it attractive to see the way she's characterizing it.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It seems a little risky to go after hope.",

        "The bigger question in Texas is going to be how well John McCain does in holding down the vote of Mike Huckabee.",
        "There are still a lot of people -including social conservatives, evangelical Christians and others - who don't feel John McCain is sufficiently committed to their causes yet.",
        "And they're out there voting for Mike Huckabee and making a point that unless John McCain moves their way, they're going to jump ship, either to vote third party in November or to just stay home."
