        "He also experimented on them.",
        "For example, he recruited dozens of prisoners, put them in chairs and told them that in 30 seconds he was going to zap them with an electrical shock.",
        "Then he measured their heart rate to see if that information bothered them.",
        "And he found that the behavior of the psychopaths was different.",
        "Most people show lots of emotional arousal - anticipatory fear, anxiety - while they're waiting for the shock to occur; psychopaths, hardly any.",

        "In another experiment, Hare showed prisoners both highly emotional and totally neutral pictures.",
        "A picture of a rape, say, versus the picture of a table, and again measured their physical response.",
        "He found that for most prisoners, the emotional pictures prompted a very different reaction than the pictures of a table or chair.",
        "But with psychopaths there's no difference.",
        "They treat these horrific pictures as if they were neutral pictures, no difference whatsoever between them.",
        "This work led Hare to the conclusion that psychopaths are essentially emotionally deaf, simply do not have the capacity to feel, in a firsthand way, emotions like empathy, remorse and love.",
        "It's sort of like trying to explain to a colorblind person what the color red is.",
        "Can we teach a colorblind person how to see red, what red is?",
        "You can have all the dictionary definitions you want, but this person will never quite get it.",
        "Now, while Hare was making progress on understanding psychopaths, his work was still regarded as marginal, in part because the field of psychopath research in general was missing something really, really important.",
        "You see, there was simply no good way for researchers involved in this work to figure out who was a psychopath and who wasn't.",
        "The field had no way to measure.",
        "And Hare says this was a huge problem.",
        "The science cannot progress without reliable and accurate measurement of what it is they're trying to study.",
        "Simple as that."
