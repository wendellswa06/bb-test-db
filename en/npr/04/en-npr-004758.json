        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And one of the truisms of politics is that the more you have one party control, the more that that generates factionalism and schisms within the party.",
        "And I think you're starting to see some of that with the Florida GOP because we have some very competitive primaries.",
        "And in the past, the party would probably would have said to the rest of the candidates, if they identified a frontrunner, to sort of suggest that they step aside and wait their turn.",

        "Why couldn't anybody else - a member of Congress, somebody like that; Tom Gallagher, who's running for governor - why didn't somebody else run?"

        "The hottest spot in Florida politics is always the I-4 corridor and the Tampa end, and yes, that is a fascinating race.",
        "There are six Republicans all fairly well known, some extremely well funded, who are going at each other to try to get the GOP nomination for Katherine's seat.",
        "But on the other side, you have two very competitive, older, single women who are very good themselves in politics, who are running for the Democrats.",
        "So you've got a hotbed of competition on both sides of the aisle to replace Katherine Harris in the U.S.",

        "No, that's fairly - just like all of Congressional races, you know, that's fairly isolated, the politics of that.",
        "The governor's race is capturing a lot of attention, because like that 13th district, the governor's race itself has extremely good competition for the nomination on both the Republican and the Democratic side of the aisle.",
        "Two formidable candidates on the Democratic side trying to capture the nomination and two on the Republican side.",
        "So once again, Florida's just competitive.",

        "Of course, Clay Shaw's been in office quite some time.",
