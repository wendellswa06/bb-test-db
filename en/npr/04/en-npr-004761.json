        "The moment Hezbollah took those two Israeli military soldiers as prisoners, Hezbollah immediately offered a prompt ceasefire and an immediate starter for a negotiation process leading to releasing on one hand the two Israeli soldiers - military soldiers captured by Israel - and on the other hand, the more than 9,500 Arab prisoners illegally held captive by the Israelis - all of them civilians.",
        "Many of them are women and minor children.",
        "As you know, many of them also - not all of them - but many of them have blood on their hands.",

        "If you are talking about blood, well, the Israeli hands are immersed in Lebanese blood and in Palestinian blood.",
        "But, you know, each party will try to label the other party that it is the aggressor and it is - but statistics say that Israel has killed by far many more Arabs than the Arabs have done to the Israelis.",

        "I'm just reminding the people of facts.",
        "The facts is every single human life is a sacred life.",
        "But on the other hand, these are not morally equal parties.",
        "You have on one hand the occupier, on the other hand the occupied.",
        "On one hand the oppressor, on one hand the oppressed.",
        "On one hand the underdog, and on one hand the arrogant, regional superpower that tries to impose on its neighbors its policies of occupation, annexation, and building more and more settlements.",

        "Well, of course Syria had many treaties with Lebanon before, and most of them were economic, educational, financial - including a defense treaty.",
        "The events that took place last year brought all those treaties to a freezing point.",
        "And Syria has negotiated - has suggested a complete negotiations of all treaties with Lebanon because of the dramatic changes that took place in Lebanon last year.",

        "Everything within our capacity, and probably even beyond our means.",
        "We have totally opened our borders for the influx of Lebanese refugees.",
        "More than 170,000 Lebanese refugees have crossed the borders into Syria in the past 10 days.",
        "We are providing Lebanon with electricity around the clock without any charge right now because all electricity plants have been bombarded by Israel.",
        "Humanitarian organizations in Syria are working around the clock trying to offer the Lebanese refugees whatever they can do - medical supplies, blood donations - everything within our capacity.",

        "As far as Syria is concerned, we immediately implemented the part that concerns Syria of 1559.",
        "However, having said this, we have a very unfair world in which we live in.",
        "In the past 30 years, the same United Nations Security Counsel has issued a stockpile of resolutions demanding that Israel immediately withdraws from all the Arab-occupied territories: the Palestinian West Bank in Gaza, the Syrian Golan, the Shebaa farms also in Lebanon, and at that time there was a - a huge part of Lebanon was occupied.",
        "Israel never complied, and today Israel suddenly has discovered that the 1559 serves some of its own interests, which is disarming the resistance against Israel, and they think that they want to implement this.",
        "Having said this, it's none of our business.",
        "We are totally outside Lebanon, and we do not think that Syria has anything to do with 1559.",
        "This is on one hand.",
        "On the other hand, what Israel really wants is for all the resistance to its occupation to be totally disarmed.",
        "The Palestinians should be disarmed, the Lebanese should be disarmed.",
        "Why not also the Syrians should be disarmed so that they can continue their policy of more and more occupation, more and more annexation of our lands, bringing more and more settlers from elsewhere - from outside Israel - and building new settlements for them, and a new cycle of occupation, aggression, occupation, annexation?",
        "This is totally unfair.",

        "And from what I understand -and friends that are all throughout the Middle East.",
        "And from what I understand, the main problem is, as you just described, which is - the groundswell of support in the Middle East - for the terrorists really - there's always going to be extremists.",
        "But the problem that we're facing from America and from the world is the groundswell of support throughout the Middle East of the extremist factions.",
        "And from what I understand, the reason for that groundswell of support from very, you know, basic families who are just like families in - you know, very similar to families in American just trying to survive - and the groundswell of support from these people is coming from the occupation that you're talking about, and…",
        "Claire, could you get to the question, please?",

        "Time and again, we have invited - at least Syria - officially, at least more than 10 times in the past three years - has invited Israel to reengage in a peace process leading towards a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East based on the fair principle of land for peace.",
        "Give us back our occupied territories - the Shebaa farms, the Syrian Golan, and the occupied West Bank in Gaza - and get in return comprehensive peace, total normalization of relations and let us live in peace with you.",
        "Let our children live in peace with you.",
        "Israel has totally, categorically and flatly rejected the Syrian proposals for one simple reason: they don't want a peace treaty because they don't want to give us back our occupied territories.",
        "Actually, they want to occupy more of and more of our territories and to build more and more settlements in our territories as if our people do not count at all."

        "And so the diversity of the population is something that is a normal state of affairs in this area.",

        "But they're manner of control is quite inclusive in the sense that they manage to recruit a lot of other minorities and play them against each other sometimes.",
        "But the high posts are in the hands of a very closely-knit Alawite network, and under a very authoritarian regime controlled by security services - several competing security services, which sometimes very brutally suppresses opposition and any political dissent."
