        "As you've already described, the current president of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, is the son of Hafez al-Assad, who ruled the country for many years.",
        "Is it fair to describe him as a dictator at this point?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, he's not an elected president.",
        "He's somebody who inherited his post.",
        "They had to change the constitution because he was under age.",
        "And when he came in, there were a lot of - there was a lot of optimism about him being young and having studied in the West and having been sort of exposed to Western ideas and wanting to reform Syria.",
        "And he has achieved quite a lot of reforms there.",
        "I mean, in the sense that Syria is a much different place now than it was, say, in 1997, '98 when it was more like a East European-style of Stalinist country where you needed a license to have a fax machine or a typewriter.",
        "And there was no freedom speech and only the official media was accepted, and the rest closed.",
        "But, I mean, in this day and age, it's so difficult to exercise that sort of control.",
        "And Bashar al-Assad was trying to open up.",
        "But then his policy of opening up was very short lived.",
        "And barely 12 months later - sort of 15 months later, in fact - he reversed that and put a lot of the people in jail that had taken advantage of the freedom of speech.",
        "And since then, especially in the last six months, he's also put in a lot - there's also been a crackdown on opposition and on intellectuals that are also in jail.",
        "We're talking today about Syria and its role in the conflict and the possible resolution to that conflict in the Middle East.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And let me ask you, Nadim Shehadi - just a few months ago, the focus was not on the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel, it was the eviction of Syria from Lebanon.",
        "It's forces - after almost a 30-year occupation - were forced to withdraw by Lebanese rallies across the country, the election of an anti-Syrian parliament, and allegations that Syria was involved in the murder of Rafiq al-Hariri, the former Lebanese prime minister.",
        "Has that all gone away now that this new conflict has overtaken these events?",
        "Well, this new conflict has certainly detracted attention from two major issues.",
        "One of them is the Iranian nuclear issue, and the other one is the investigation on the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and the setting up of an international court to judge those who were - be found accused of participating in this.",
        "And Syria was, of course, top of the list in terms of being suspected of participation.",
        "And many Syrian opposition - some of them who were officials at the time - have expressed this in the media now that they're outside the country, of course.",
        "Unidentified Woman #1: My husband's job covered us until he was laid off.",

        "And the setting up of an international court would have to rely on the participation of a Lebanese government to - in this international court.",
        "And if the current events make it impossible for a Lebanese government to reform, to regroup itself or causes a political crisis or brings forth a government that is more loyal to Syria - as it is also possible if there is a deal with Syria again at the expense of Lebanon, then Syria will be off the hook for its alleged role, and also for the murder of several journalists and politicians in the last year.",
        "Syria officials say today that they've withdrawn all of their intelligence agents from Lebanon.",
        "We just have a few seconds left.",
        "Do you believe them?",
        "Syria still maintains a lot of influence in Lebanon through Hezbollah and through some Palestinian groups that it also arms, and through certain politicians that are loyal to it - and as well through some intelligence of presence, which is different - they've only dismantled their huge occupying intelligence centers, but they still have - but it's a level playing field.",
        "I don't think there's an intelligence-free zone anywhere in the world.",
        "Nadim Shehadi, thank you very much for being with us.",

        "Here are the headlines from some of the stories we're following here today at NPR News.",
        "President Bush met today with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to discuss the deteriorating security situation in Baghdad.",
        "After the meeting, the president said more American troops and Iraqi security personnel will be deployed in Baghdad in the coming weeks.",
        "And the death toll from a scorching heat wave continues to rise in California, as the state faced its 10th straight day of 100+ degree temperatures.",
        "Local authorities are investigating at least 34 possible heat-related deaths, most in California's Central Valley, where temperatures soared above 110 degrees in recent days.",
        "Details on those stories and, of course, much more later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED."

        "Tomorrow on TALK OF THE NATION, one of the proposed solutions to the Middle East crisis is an international military force for southern Lebanon.",

        "As you listen to the Syrian ambassador speak with us - I know you've read other accounts of their foreign ministry's position and what the president has been saying.",
        "This all sounds reasonable if you accept what they say about their lack of influence with Hezbollah and their lack of control over it.",
        "Well, they're not without influence, obviously, over Hezbollah.",
        "Do they have full control?",
        "I think that's an open question.",
        "Hezbollah has been in the field now for almost a generation, has become very well armed, and it's at least possible that this latest raid that they pulled off with the - seizing the two Israeli soldiers was a self-starter.",
        "I know that there was a meeting in Damascus involving Iranians and Hezbollah just before the raid.",
        "But I don't think we have proof at this point in time whether it was directed to make that raid or whether it looked what was going on with Hamas in Gaza and decided this was a good moment for it to move.",
        "As you look at this relationship with Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah - and particularly Iran and Syria, is Syria the junior partner here?",
        "Yes.",
        "As the junior partner, it's got its own field of action.",
        "But, you know, Neal, one of our stated goals has been - would be desirable to, I think, peel off Syria from Iran or to wean Syria from Iran.",
        "It's a fine goal, but to be realistic, we have to do some work on our own policy if we're going to reach that goal.",
        "We've had no ambassador there for the past 15 months.",
        "The White House has presented a cold shoulder to Syria, and I think the president himself or Secretary Rice said just the other day, Syria knows what it has to do.",
        "Just stop Hezbollah.",
        "Well, things aren't going to work like that.",
        "Nice if they would, perhaps, but the fact remains Iran has been a good friend and good supporter for Syria against Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, recently pledging support if Israel and/or the U.S.",
        "were to attack."

        "So the question is what are we prepared to give Syria to make it worth its while to even think of loosening its ties with Iran?",
        "And what might we be prepared to give?",
        "What would your advice be if you were asked?",
        "I have been frankly puzzled that the request coming from Syria -from Bashar Al-Assad, since his father's death - to resume the negotiations on the, peace negotiations with Israel - have gone unheeded by Washington.",
        "The Sharon government dismissed those overtures, dismissed them saying well, you know, Bashar's too weak to be worth talking to.",
        "That's the same thing he said about Mahmoud Abbas, and it's led some to say well, the Israeli leadership hasn't been that much interested in looking for a negotiating partner.",

        "Water board officials estimate they need more than $800 million in repairs that FEMA has not approved, and the utility is already in debt more than $500 million.",
        "But Bashar told me in Damascus in December ‘03 - I remember the meeting because it was the same day he met with a New York Times Reporter, so I'm not revealing any secrets.",
        "But he had been asking for peace talks to resume with Israel, which would lead - among other things - to full return, their long-standing demand of the Golan occupied back in ‘67, but would deal with the Palestinian issues, the remaining Lebanese issues.",
        "And remember, Syria did support the Arab summit position back - which was the year before that in Beirut, when the summit called for a full return of territories occupied and fair settlement of the refugee situation.",
        "And in return for that, they were offering normal relations with the whole Arab world.",

        "We're not going to have any peace unless we talk and negotiate and give the land back and let the Palestinians have a state - a real state, not an imprisoned state where they can't go out and it can't communicate with other countries in their region.",

        "So that broke up the talks.",
        "So some Israelis are ready, for instance, specifically to return the Golan Heights.",
