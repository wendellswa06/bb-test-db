        "And I kind of resonate - that kind of summed up my teenage years to be honest.",
        "I mean, like I said in the article, I didn't really kind of connect with the fact that he was Jewish.",

        "Hmm.",

        "It's that - just I think, well, you know, I can't hate Jewish people because I find the - so much of my love - the stuff that I've loved - whether it's films or music - has been created by them.",
        "The same with African-Americans as well, and I kind of feel like, you know, Muslims can maybe seek inspiration from that in some ways.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Nevertheless, there have been a couple of incidents of late which people, I guess, maybe reinforce the stereotypes of Muslims as humorless - the English schoolteacher in Sudan who almost got lashed because she allowed her students to name a teddy bear Muhammad.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that's crazy talk, isn't it?",
        "I mean, basically, my kind of thought on that is, you know, just in the same ways - every time I meet a white guy, I don't think that's Ted Bundy or that's Timothy McVeigh.",
        "And if I'm meeting a white American woman, I don't think that's Ann Coulter, so you shouldn't necessarily think that everything that's done in a Muslim's name is necessarily done by Muslims, do you know what I mean?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And I think what's really interesting, because I wrote this article for the Washington Post, and it's the first time I've really written anything in an American media.",
        "So in Britain, I - I'm, you know, I've got quite a good profile and people know my work.",
        "In America, it seems to be that voice, the voice of just somebody who's just an ordinary guy who's interested in rock music, interested in lots of different things but happens to be Muslim, we don't seem to be hearing that and I've had just had some amazing e-mails from American readers all over the country saying, you know, well done and, you know, just to let your know that we're all rooting for a richness and a diversity of opinion in moderate Muslim voices to speak out.",
        "So, it felt - I felt really kind of inspired by that because it suggested that, you know, people want to hear ordinary, sane, moderate Muslims speaking up, but they're not really getting to hear them very often."
