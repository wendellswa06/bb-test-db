        "I mean, to be honest, I mean, I think one of the things about that particular example was that the papers that published it were deliberately trying to be provocative.",
        "But what I think is kind of absurd is, you know, if you have a cartoon that's basically saying, you know, it's making fun and trying to sort of project the idea that Muslims can't take a joke and then the response to a cartoon that says Muslims can't take a joke is to kill a hundred people and set fire to half a dozen embassies, you kind of feel that maybe there's been a bit of an overreaction.",
