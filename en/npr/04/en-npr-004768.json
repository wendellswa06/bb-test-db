        "But, yeah, humor really - I'm not sure how many people would argue that it is a perfect bridge between the races.",
        "And then getting older now, I definitely see it as a way to, yeah, break down our defenses.",
        "As a minority there in Britain, Sarfraz, this is a defense mechanism, too, isn't it?",
        "I don't know.",
        "It may have been in the past, but I don't know if defense mechanisms really work when somebody is trying to batter you, to be perfectly honest.",
        "And I'm not totally sure, but I think it's more about sort of disarming people, you know?",
        "I think what happens is that when people don't know much, they have stereotypes.",
        "And what humor does it makes fun of the stereotype and it disarms people.",
        "So for me, it's not really about defense.",
        "It's actually being an ambassador.",
        "It's almost being a missionary and saying, you know what - you know, like a good example is you know the whole burka debate, for example.",

        "I've been saying the same thing which is my sister, my mother, my sister-in-law are all Pakistani Muslim women.",
        "Not one of them wear anything on their head at all.",
        "Don't tell me that they're not Muslim.",
        "So it's just about trying to challenge some of the stereotype and some of the thoughts that people have, and humor is a good example and a good way of doing that."

        "But how old is the Muslim religion?",
        "Yeah, I mean, I think there's a couple of answers to that.",
        "One is that I think that the people who make the protests get the attention where there's a whole load of people who are actually much, much more mellow, but you don't see them because they're not burning any flags and they're not, you know, suggesting death to anybody.",
        "So the kind of what happens is that basically if one person protests, particularly if there's a politician or a so-called leader, that gets the attention, that becomes a story even if there's a hundred thousand people who basically aren't bothered all that much.",
        "So the challenge for Muslims is basically the quiet, moderate, normal guys who basically say, well, you know what, it's not a very funny cartoon.",
        "I'm not that bothered about it.",
        "They need to speak up and say that because what happens is otherwise, people think the only version of Islam out there are the people who are the hate-filled, angry people.",

        "Most of us aren't.",

        "But it was five or six people in beards burning books, the rest of us were just sitting at home listening to Bruce Springsteen, you know?",
