        "The problem is that an Asian fungus came in accidentally late 1800s and it wiped out four billion trees, eliminating American chestnut from the Eastern forest ecosystem.",
        "And it's pretty much been gone for decades.",
        "Since the 1950s, early '60s.",
        "And being wiped out means that the trees, when they get up to a flowering stage, if they get that high, they're struck by the blight and they die back.",
        "So there are a lot of sprouts out there that come up from the root system which is not attacked by the fungus, but the blight attacks them when they get to early maturity and begin to flower.",
        "And our challenge is to develop a blight-resistant tree.",
        "What we've heard from gardeners is that even though this tree, if you plant it, is going to die decades before it gets to that great maturity, people are planting them.",
        "That's right.",

        "So Bill Frisk is basically structuring his 2008 presidential candidacy on this issue.",
        "And is he going to put out to vote on the Senate floor, the bill that was reported out of the Judiciary Committee or his own version, which is much closer to the House bill.",
        "Well, that's still in debate.",
        "And I have a feeling both will come out.",
        "There are people, they're a lot of lawmakers who say that, that the one that came out of Senate Judiciary led by Arlen Specter's committee is a much more bipartisan and much more, has a much more wide support in Congress, whereas Frisk is mostly the conservative wing of the Republican party.",
        "And this is a critical issue, if it's setup for nothing to happen, if the two bills are so wildly opposite, it's very likely that nothing would get done as they try to reconcile these two bills to get one to present to President Bush."
