        "Well, you know, it's a tough job to walk into, no matter whether you're walking in from OMB or from outside.",
        "Because, you know, you've immediately got to establish, obviously, a relationship of trust with the president, you've got to get staff loyalty, and as you know, in the White House, there are all kinds of little power-centers that develop in a White House.",
        "You know, the first thing a Chief of Staff has to do is watch his back.",
        "He's got to establish chain-of-command, he's got to establish discipline, and he's got to establish focus.",
        "So, you know, he's got to take charge.",
        "Now, it depends on the style that the president wants to engage in with the Chief of Staff.",
        "John Kennedy had this kind of approach of spoke of the wheel, where all of the staff people kind of dealt with him directly.",
        "He really didn't use a Chief of Staff.",
        "On the other hand, people like Jim Baker, myself, others, kind of had a control center that, in which, you know, most of the issues went through that Chief of Staff.",
        "Under President Bush, I get the impression its been more kind of two or three people that have operated as Chief of Staff, not only Card, but Rove is obviously in a very top position, and Karen Hughes was probably in a top position before she left.",
        "So it all depends on how the President wants to use a new Chief of Staff.",
        "Ken said right before you came on that the Chief of Staff should have had his political antenna out on the Harriet Myers situation, Dubai Ports.",
        "Do you think that's right?",
        "Well, that's part of the job of Chief of Staff, is to make sure that, at the very least, the president is aware of what the political implications are.",
        "I mean, I'm a little astounded that nobody kind of looked at that soundbite that came out of that issue.",
        "I mean, there's a 30-second soundbite that basically says the Arabs are taking over our ports, you know, that won't even let you get to the substance of that issue.",
        "And somebody should have said to the president, look, once that soundbite takes hold, we're going to be in deep trouble.",
        "And I do think that part of the responsibility, I don't know, you know, whether that issue when through Andy, whether it went through National Security Council, whoever, you know, looked at that issue, should have immediately said to the president, this is real trouble.",
        "I wonder what did you do when you left the job?",
        "Did you sleep for a week?",
        "You don't leave that job!",
        "Oh, you when you leave, finally, at the end?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "No, it's a little bit like, you know, coming up from the deep.",
        "You go through a decompression period where, you know, you're waiting for the president's call.",
        "I mean, I used to get calls from Bill Clinton sometimes at two or three o'clock in the morning, because he was either watching something on C-Span or something was bothering him and he called and wanted to, you know, complain about what was going on.",
        "And you know, you're waiting for that kind of call.",
        "You're waiting for, you know, an issue to blow up on you.",
        "I mean, one of the great fears as Chief of Staff is that, you know, something is going to happen that, you know, that is going to be your responsibility.",
        "And, I can remember when I first when into the Chief of Staff job, there was somebody who jumped over the White House fence, and there was somebody who then started shooting at the White House, and somebody in the Washington Press finally wrote, there was somebody seen jumping away from the White House, and we think it's the new Chief of Staff.",
        "Leon Panetta, thank you so much for your time today.",
        "We appreciate it.",
        "Nice to be with you.",
        "Leon Panetta, former Chief of Staff to President Clinton, now director of the Panetta Institute in Monterey, California.",
        "We're talking with Ken Rudin, our Political Junkie, and you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.And let's see if we can get a caller on the line.",

        "Yes, Mr. Rudin, do you foresee any further charges being, or any further indictments sought towards Jack Abramoff after today?",
        "Well, he has pleaded guilty to two instances, one, the...",
        "The SunCruz...",
        "The SunCruz issue in Florida, and of course, the corruption scandal that's going on in Washington.",
        "The reason, Neal mentioned this earlier, the reason he got the minimum sentence, the reason why we think he got the minimum sentence, is that he's still talking to the government, still talking to prosecutors.",
        "If what he has to say about what's going on Capital Hill is what many people think is going to happen, then there are a lot of Republicans that they're talking about, Tom De Lay, Congressman Bob Ney, of Ohio, they could be in some serious trouble.",
        "So...",
        "A couple of Democrats too.",
        "They're, well, you know, I mean, not to the same, I mean, Democrats will make the argument that while they gave, you know, Abramoff's clients and tribes gave to the democrats whereas Abramoff gave directly to Republicans.",
        "That's something the two parties are fighting over.",
        "But the sense is that De Lay and Ney are two, at least two members of Congress who face some legal difficulties.",

        "Getting back to the immigration issue, it seems like this issue comes up every so often, like so many issues, it never really gets resolved.",
        "And the fact that it gets portrayed with these polar extremes of, you know, it's a law enforcement issue, or it's a humanitarian issue, or it's a race issue, doesn't do the public any service in getting through this debate.",
        "And, how can we get the debate going in a sincere manner so that we talk about issues such as impacts to services, crowding and congestion.",
        "An open border seems like a beautiful idea, but let's face it, you know, we'll be a third world country if we keep that up too long.",

        "Well, you know, but there's a good point.",
        "The caller makes a very, very good point in the fact that this is exactly the issues that are coming up.",
        "We heard Jeff Sessions talk earlier, I think it was Jeff Sessions earlier in the piece, that if, you know, if we, if the guesswork a program goes forward and we give so-called amnesty to these people, then basically the cost, the jobs that these people will be taking, the money will be far less.",
        "I mean they'll be making much less money than they would now if there was a scarcity of jobs, so cost of living goes down.",
        "African-Americans have clearly said that they resent the fact that many, they're having to compete now.",
        "They finally made it into the mainstream of the American workspace, and now Latinos are coming and fighting them for jobs.",
        "Labor is upset about a lot of the allowing some kind of a blanket amnesty.",
        "So, all the issues you mentioned are there, and then given the fact that we can't forget the fact that in seven months there's going to be an election, and everybody's just, you know, put their heads between their tails and they're afraid to take drastic actions here.",
        "Clay, thanks very much for the call.",
        "Okay.",
        "Thank you.",
        "On Friday, the motion introduced by Senator Russell Feingold, of Wisconsin, to censure President Bush for authorizing warrantless wiretaps.",

        "I mean, Arlen Specter, the Chairman, said yesterday that its very possible that the immigration bill may push it off to next week.",
        "But we talked about this split in the Republican Party, about immigration, and that split is definitely there.",
        "There was a split in the Democratic Party about this Feingold measure to censure.",
        "There is the so-called democratic base, and you see it in the bloggersphere, saying that President Bush should be held accountable, given the war, given the illegal, what they say is illegal wiretapping, there should be some kind of an action, whether its censure or impeachment or what.",
        "Lawmakers, Democratic lawmakers, are much more nervous about this.",
        "They're very much more cautious, they feel that they have President Bush and the Republicans on the run anyway, why add this wrinkle to it?",
        "And they really don't think they're going to, you know, they don't have, they certainly don't have the votes in Congress.",
        "Only Barbara Boxer, of California, and Tom Harkin of Iowa, are the only two Senators who've signed on to the Feingold measure.",
