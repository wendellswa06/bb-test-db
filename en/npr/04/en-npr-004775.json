        "I mean, yes, it's better than the other big economies are doing, but it's not very fast.",
        "And the problem is the Fed is rowing one way, doing everything it can to help the economy grow faster, and the president and Congress are rowing in the other direction, by raising taxes earlier this year and now by letting these across-the-board spending cuts that we in Washington called the sequester by.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So like Janet Yellin, who is going to be the next Fed chairman, if she's confirmed by the Senate, said last week, fiscal policy has been working at cross purposes to monetary policy.",

        "But since they elected a new prime minister last year and he replaced the head of the central bank, they've been pretty much rowing in the same direction.",
        "So that's pulled Japan out of the mud and it seems to have brought an end to a particularly stubborn case of deflation, which is falling prices.",
        "And then there's the question of Europe.",
        "Right.",
        "Now in the 17 countries that share the euro, the currency, the euro, neither fiscal or monetary policy is pulling very hard in the oars at all.",
        "A couple of weaker countries, like Spain, Portugal, Greece and Italy are being forced to cut spending and raise taxes, despite very high unemployment.",
        "Germany and the other stronger countries aren't willing to offset that.",
        "And the European Central Bank- that's their equivalent of the Federal Reserve -has been much less aggressive than either the Fed or the Bank of Japan, in part because it has doubts whether it's tools do much good, and in part because there's a lot of resistance from the Germans.",
        "So Europe is growing extremely slowly and unemployment is over 12 percent there.",
        "I guess the Germans - unlike the Fed in the United States - they don't have a duty to have low employment - or low unemployment, right?",
        "I mean their job is just to avoid inflation."
