        "Cullum's team of Canadian neurologists was intrigued enough by Milena's case that they brought her out to their lab.",
        "We were very interested in her case.",
        "She sounded fascinating, but we didn't really know what to expect with her.",
        "Their thought was that maybe the motion area of the brain was still intact.",
        "This area that's known to be critical for motion, called MT Plus.",
        "Because it turns out that area is actually a sort of satellite area, separate from the rest of the visual cortex.",
        "MT is on the side of the brain, basically behind the ears.",
        "And their thought was maybe - just maybe, that MT Plus area was still getting information, even though the rest of the visual cortex was broken.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That's the basic idea.",
        "So they put her into a brain scanner with a plan to show her -",
