        "Even though the special counsel felt there wasn't enough evidence to charge the president or anyone in his campaign with conspiracy, are you troubled by the interactions documented in this report?",
        "Yes, because if somebody comes to your campaign representing a foreign adversary and says, we have material on your opponent and we're going to help you, your first reaction, it seems to me, ought to be to call the FBI, not arrange a meeting.",

        "The other point I want to make that I think sort of overarches the whole thing is that this report and even Mr. Barr's statements this morning establish for all time that the Russians in fact interfered in our election in 2016; it was a sophisticated plot, and they were trying to assist Donald Trump, at least in the last several months of the election.",

        "Let's talk about the obstruction piece now.",
        "We now know that Mueller looked into at least 10 episodes when trying to decide whether there was obstruction of justice.",
        "Knowing what you know now, do you agree with Barr's determination that no obstruction occurred?",
        "I don't think you can make that determination.",
        "I think to put a - make it a football analogy, I think that the special counsel passed this question over to Congress, and the attorney general intercepted the pass.",
        "He basically made his own judgment, and we know what he thinks because he issued a - what?",
        "- a 19-page memo back before he was even appointed that said, by definition, a president can't obstruct justice.",
        "And so, you know, we know his view.",
