        "Well, the plaintiffs in this case say that Michigan's marriage amendment is, in fact, a lot like DOMA and it ought to meet the same fate.",
        "But a lot of this, too, is about research that both sides have used to defend their positions, which means that this case isn't just about gay marriage.",
        "It is actually about same-sex parenting.",
        "Well, what kind of research are they using to try to bolster their case, each side?",
        "Well, the attorneys for April DeBoer and Jayne Rouse say that they want to use this trial to challenge a lot of this research, a lot of it is by - it's very controversial, very questioned in the academic world.",
        "And it says that children raised by gay parents actually fare worse in a lot of key indicators than children raised in heterosexual households by their married biological parents.",
        "And that is supposed to support the State of Michigan's position that a male-female parenting team is, quote, \"\"optimal,\"\" unquote, for kids.",
        "But DeBoer and Rouse have their own experts to say that most of that is just junk science that was conducted to reach that particular result.",
        "Now, Rick, you mentioned that this all started out as an adoption case.",
        "How has that become a factor in the testimony so far?",
        "Well, a lot of the testimony today, on the first day, dealt with adoption, parenting and same-sex couples.",
        "And, for example, we heard that same-sex couples are more likely to adopt special needs kids, just like Jayne Rouse and April DeBoer did.",
        "They also say that marriage rights would create a bigger pool of adoptive parents, that it would actually shrink the line of kids who waiting to be adopted.",
        "And these parents would be in a better position financially, in terms of family stability, to adopt including hard to adopt kids if Michigan were to actually allow same-sex marriages.",
        "So, Rick, the trial is supposed to take about two weeks, but there's a broader conversation in Michigan, right, about same-sex marriage over all?",
        "Though - well, I mean we've got a lot of conversations about what we're going to do as far as LGBT rights in state law, that there's this question about adoption.",
        "It's really permeating a lot of the conversation here.",
        "The state's position is this research that we've been talking about means that all of this is unsettled.",
        "There's nothing conclusive on same-sex parenting.",
        "And all of this is just too new.",

        "We've seen a move forward in the last decade, when more and more Palestinians were willing to accept the legitimacy of Israel in a vague way.",
        "Sadly, because of the stagnation, we now see both parties going back in time.",
        "And while so many Israelis still want the two-state solution, our government and some members of the right wing are going back and are actually removing their support of the two-state solution.",
        "This same process exactly is happening on the Palestinian side, where people now are more and more talking about the one-state solution.",

        "A surprise because scientists used to think glial cells weren't involved in higher brain functions like thought.",
