        "Peter Sagal, the host of the NPR news quiz program WAIT WAIT...DON'T TELL ME, ran in the Boston Marathon today, and he joins us now.",
        "Peter, how close were you to the explosions?",
        "Robert, I was about a hundred yards beyond the point of the explosion, in what we call the finishing chute.",
        "It's a long area that runners walk through after finishing a marathon.",
        "We had just finished at about - I think it was 2:45, around there, Boston time; heard a huge explosion.",
        "I had been guiding a blind runner today, so both he and I were shocked.",
        "I turned around and saw a big, white plume of smoke that appeared on the other side of the finishing line from us; that is, on the course side.",
        "Then another, second large explosion happened just a moment later, with another plume of smoke.",
        "And did the second explosion come from the same side as the first?",
        "It seemed to.",
        "It seemed to come in the same place, from my perspective.",
        "At that point, the officials in the marathon asked all of us in the chute to keep moving forward away from it.",
        "I've now returned - it's, I guess, 20 minutes, half-hour later - to Boylston Street.",
        "The chute is completely closed.",
        "They're moving people off Boylston Street, and there are no people finishing the race.",
        "They seem to have stopped the race.",
        "There were many people behind us.",
        "Normally, there'd be people flowing through this area by the hundreds, at this point.",
        "There's nobody, except for emergency vehicles and police personnel.",
        "Peter, you sound admirably calm right now.",
        "I assume the situation was chaotic and panicky, when it happened.",
        "Well, it was hard.",
        "I mean, we were done.",
        "We had finished a marathon - we were sort in the middle of that misery when the explosion happened behind us.",
        "We just kept walking the direction we were supposed to walk; perhaps a little quicker than we wanted to, given the fact that we had run a marathon.",
        "I imagine it was the people who were gathered around the finish line, including the people in the grandstands there - back there, who were really in a state of agitation because they must have seen what happened.",
        "Because speaking to you now, and looking down the course at the emergency vehicles, I still don't know what happened; and I have no personal knowledge of any injuries, or anything else like that.",
        "Can you see if there is a building that has been blown out by an explosion, or where the explosion might have originated?",
        "I'm standing a good 3- to 400 yards away.",
        "I can see the place where I believe the explosion was.",
        "But I cannot, from this distance, see any damage to anything.",
        "It's just too far, with too many things in the way.",
        "And ambulances arrived promptly, to...",
        "Yeah.",
        "I personally saw about four or five ambulances pour into the area along with police motorcycles, lots of personnel.",
        "I can see, there must be 30 uniformed police officers just on my side of the finishing line sort of - well, in the middle of the street, presumably securing the scene.",
        "Where I'm standing - about, like I said, a good, long block away - there are officials trying to keep civilians and runners, like myself, just away from the area."

        "So I can't say anything definitive.",
        "But my understanding is that Mr. Mueller basically laid out, here are the elements.",
        "As you read in the introduction, we can't conclude it wasn't obstruction, and we're essentially turning it over to Congress to look at that and, I must say, to the voters; ultimately, I think the voters in 2020 are going to be the people that decide what was right and wrong in this case.",
        "Now, there was an interesting point in the press conference today with Attorney General Bill Barr.",
        "He defended his conclusion that there was no obstruction by pointing out that the president has at times been very cooperative in this investigation - he provided access to documents, he let his senior aides testify freely.",
        "Let me ask you, does that mean in your mind that the president could not have had a corrupt intent?",
        "Well, I think, you know, he was sort of cherry-picking the evidence.",
        "We know, for example, that the president wanted to dismiss Mr. Mueller, wanted to shut down the investigation, wanted Attorney General Sessions to unrecuse himself to take control of the situation.",
        "We know that when he first heard of the investigation, he leaned back in his chair and said, this could be the end of my presidency.",
        "And so I don't - I mean, clearly, there was cooperation.",
        "Although, on one of the very major aspects, the president refused to testify or his lawyers, anyway, refused to testify.",
        "Do you think it was a mistake of Robert Mueller not to have subpoenaed the president to sit down for an interview?",
        "I think, according to the report, my understanding is he realized that if he had done that, it would have added two years to this process.",
        "And what if that happened?",
        "Do you - would you have been also against the idea of subpoenaing the president to make him testify or interview?",
        "I don't want to second-guess Robert Mueller, but I think he probably made the right call because now at least we can get the report out; otherwise, everything would be in limbo through the next election.",
        "I think it's better to have it on the table now.",
        "And I'm hoping that my committee - I'm certainly going to urge the leadership of the intelligence committee to call Robert Mueller before our committee in an open session..."
