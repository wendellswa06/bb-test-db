        "The Palacio de Correos, literally the postal palace, commissioned in 1889 and completed almost 30 years later, was the largest public building in Argentina when it opened in 1928.",
        "It's eight-stories tall, occupies a full city block and contains almost a million square feet of marble hallways, stained-glass ceilings and windows plus the original post office fixtures."
