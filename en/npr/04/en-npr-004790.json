        "It went into receivership a few years ago.",
        "The one business that still exists is the funeral home, Smith and Gaston Funeral Home, which is interesting in terms of what we're discussing, that there are certain areas where I think entrepreneurs still have a clear consumer base of African-American buyers.",

        "But a lot of black entrepreneurs are really fighting today to maintain their competitiveness.",
