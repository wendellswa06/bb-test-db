        "Look, you have a president who literally has been the avoider-in-chief when it comes to Syria.",
        "For the last two years, he - in my judgment, wisely and willfully - has avoided militarizing the American role.",
        "And his explanation is that the United States is just moving off the two longest wars in American history in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the standard for victory was not could we win, but when could we leave.",
        "So what you are seeing right now, I think, is a significant shift in the mind and policy of the president.",
        "It may well be that no decisions have been made, but I think it's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action in response to what is probably the largest single-use deployment of chemical weapons against civilians since Saddam Hussein deployed them against the Kurds in the late '80s.",
        "So, the avoider-in-chief is moving reluctantly, I believe, to a situation where he is going to be forced - I'm not sure he's happy about it - to take military action.",
        "It also sounds like this action will come whether or not the U.N.",
        "gets behind it, because, of course, as we know, Russia is not likely to approve any action, at least from the Security Council.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "The Russians and the Chinese, presumably, will block action in the Security Council, which will leave the president with the unhappy task of assembling at least a political coalition.",
        "And I think he'll get it.",
        "I mean, this is not Iraq 2.0, at least the latter stages of it.",
        "The Europeans, frankly, seem to be more assertive and more aggressive than the president in wanting to do something - the French, in particular.",
        "The British are convinced, I think, that Assad has deployed chemical weapons.",
        "And there will be significant support in the region, as well.",
        "So, with a NATO endorsement, I think you'll see an American action.",
        "Unlike Libya, though, I think, where this unfortunate phrase, leading from behind, was coined, I think in this case, the United States, because of the complexity of the operation, sensitivity of it, is going to have to assert itself up front and essentially carry out whatever strikes the president authorizes.",
        "What would be the goal here?",
        "Does the U.S.",
        "intend to threaten the regime's survival?",
        "Or would it be, in a sense, just hoping to maintain what's been a stalemate for more than two years?",
        "You know, Renee, this is the key question, and it's the reason that Barack Obama has not militarized the American role so far.",
        "The relationship between means and ends here is critical.",
        "What is it that military action by the U.S.",
        "is going to achieve?",
        "I suspect it will not be an effort to fundamentally change the battlefield balance.",
        "In effect, it'll try to be a strike that looks to alter Assad's behavior, not the regime itself.",
        "It'll either be a warning, which lays down, this time, a redline that the president intends to enforce - not one that turns pink - that if, in fact, you deploy chemical weapons again, the response on the part of the United States, NATO, the coalition that is going to support this is going to be more severe.",
        "And that's why the president's response this time has to be significant.",
        "It cannot simply be a couple cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere.",
        "It's got to look real.",
        "It's got to look credible, if, in fact, it's going to serve to deter future use of chemical weapons.",
        "This will not solve the situation in Syria.",
        "The president is not on the verge of becoming the cavalry to rescue the country.",
        "But there's no question that without a response, this president will have zero credibility to operate in this region.",
        "Aaron David Miller is a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington, D.C.",
        "Thanks for joining us.",
        "You're welcome, Renee.",
        "Ben Bernanke steps down this week as chairman of the Federal Reserve.",
        "The new chair, Janet Yellen, will take over on Saturday.",
        "After a two-day meeting, the message today from Fed policymakers was simple: Stay the course.",
        "The Fed released a statement saying it will continue dialing-back its stimulus.",
        "NPR's John Ydstie has more on that decision and Bernanke's legacy."

        "Fed policymakers said they will reduce their monthly stimulus by another $10 billion.",
        "And they justified the move by noting that the economy is growing moderately and the job market is improving.",
        "But they indicated again that they'll keep short-term interest rates near zero, at least until the unemployment rate falls below six and a half percent.",
        "It was Ben Bernanke's final meeting as chairman, and in assessing his legacy, it's useful to divide his tumultuous tenure into three periods, starting with the pre-crisis days of 2006 and 2007.",
        "During that period, the Bernanke Fed took a hands-off approach, says Princeton economist and former Fed vice chairman Alan Blinder.",
        "The Fed basically did nothing in the early Bernanke days, just as it has done nothing in the Greenspan days, to curtail the crazy mortgage lending that was going on all over the country.",
        "And it was slow to reduce interest rates as the housing bubble burst.",
        "But, says Harvard economist Ken Rogoff, in the second act, Bernanke's response was masterful, as the financial system melted down in 2008.",
        "Overwhelmingly, Ben Bernanke's most importance contribution is he steered us through the depths of the financial crisis, when it could have been really awful.",
        "It was bad but we could have experienced the Second Great Depression.",
        "There's no doubt about it.",
        "Rogoff says the creative ways Bernanke saved Wall Street banks, money market funds, and the commercial paper market that provides critical daily funding for U.S.",
        "companies, will be studied by economists for 100 years.",
        "Blinder agrees Bernanke was very skillful during the crisis, with one exception.",
        "He says the Fed chairman should have done more to keep the big Wall Street bank Lehman Brothers from failing.",
        "Bernanke has been countering that criticism since Lehman's collapse, including in this \"\"60 Minutes\"\" interview from back in March of 2009.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED AUDIO)",
        "Bernanke said the Fed could only lend to firms that put up solid collateral and Lehman didn't have enough.",
        "The Bernanke Fed's policies ultimately stabilized the financial system, but getting the basic economy back to normal remains a challenge.",
        "The Fed has tried to help stimulate the economy with its quantitative easing aimed at lowering long-term interest rates.",
        "Rogoff says the jury is still out on how successful that's been."

        "And the Clean Air Act does not give the EPA authority to deal with international air quality.",
        "In short, reducing car emissions here would just be a drop in the bucket.",
        "I think in this particular case, the question is why did we intervene on the side of the EPA, and I think we agree with the EPA that we don't think that it's structured to kind of regulate these particular emissions.",

        "On climate change, from Alaska's perspective, in my opinion, there is no question, but that's something is going on, something demonstrable that we can view.",
        "And even more noteworthy, Senator Ted Stevens, who as recently as two years ago voted against fuel efficiency standards, now has introduced his own bill to raise standards for cars to 40 miles per gallon within a decade.",

        "Chairman, a global climate change is a very serious problem for us becoming more so everyday.",
        "But as far as the United States is concerned, the evidence of global climate change is more apparent in our home state in Alaska, than anywhere else.",
        "Stevens sudden change of heart has heads and lobbyist spinning, in Congress, let alone here in his home state.",
        "But increasingly, resource development groups, businesses and municipalities in Alaska are waiting the economic and social cost of ignoring climate change and moving to a more proactive position, that may make it more difficult for the current governor to do nothing."
