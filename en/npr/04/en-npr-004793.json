        "One, will the mandate that individuals buy insurance pull a lot of young, healthy, uninsured people into the insurance system to offset the cost of the less-healthy people who are going to get insurance out of this law?",
        "Will states actually set up these new markets for health insurance called exchanges?",
        "Will the whole enterprise restrain costs, as its proponents say, or will it actually increase costs, as critics say?",

        "Right.",
        "And one of the reasons it's so complicated is that there are all sorts of cross-cutting changes here.",
        "So there is a penalty - $2,000 a worker - on big firms that don't offer insurance.",
        "That's the stick.",
        "There's also a series of subsidies to smaller employers that do offer insurance.",
        "That's the carrot.",
        "And then, of course, there are these subsidies, basically vouchers that the government's going to give people who can't get insurance through the jobs to buy insurance at one of these exchanges.",
        "Now, about half Americans have insurance on the job already.",
        "And the question is, as you say, will some employers decide that, you know, my employees might be better off if I don't provide insurance?",
        "I won't have to pay for it.",
        "I'll pay the penalty and the government will subsidize the insurance and they buy it.",
        "So - but we just don't know how many people, how many employers are actually going to make that call.",

        "There's definitely a case.",
        "The question is how many people.",
        "There's all these surveys of workers, and some surveys say 20 percent, 30 percent of firms are thinking about dropping coverage.",
