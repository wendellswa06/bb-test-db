        "For a look at possible implications of this health care standoff I'm joined by E.J.",

        "Welcome to both of you.",
        "Mr.",
        "E.J.",
        "DIONNE (Columnist, The Washington Post; Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution): Thank you.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "Thanks for having us.",
        "Reihan, I'm going to start with you.",
        "The White House this week was talking like this was the health care home stretch, the final stretch.",
        "President Obama said he'd do everything in his power to get this done.",
        "Can the Republicans stop him?",
        "I think that the Republicans aren't going to stop him.",
        "But it can be stopped by some reluctant Democrats.",
        "There might be about six of those Democrats who voted against the House health bill the first time around who could be persuaded.",
        "But among that larger group of House Democrats who voted against it there are lots of them who still have serious reservations and lots of them who have real political liabilities that would make it very hard for them to go along with the health reform push right now.",
        "E.J.",
        "is the president sensitive enough to those liabilities that those Democrats face?",
        "I think he's sensitive but I think he's making a right call.",
        "I think passing the health care bill helps the party far, far more than it hurts the party, which is why I think it's going to pass.",
        "It shows they can govern after a messy year in which people began to doubt that.",
        "And some have said Obama is not tough enough, not enough of like L.B.J.",
        "was in pushing through his program.",
        "I think he is helping himself and his party by finally going on the offensive, answering the Republicans and saying clearly, there are some things and some causes I'll fight for and affordable health care is one of them.",
        "In answering the Republicans he did, as we said, reach out and embrace some of the proposals that they had put forth.",
        "However, John Boehner said you can't add a couple of Republican sprinkles on top of a 2700-page bill and call it bipartisan.",
        "Is there anything more he can or should do?",
        "No, I don't think there's a thing he can do to get Republicans right now.",
        "The health care bill already, even before Obama put his sprinkles on, to use Mr. Boehner's metaphor, already had a lot of other Republican ideas.",
        "This bill looks most like a bill put forward by former Senator John Chafee, the late Senator John Chafee, a moderate Republican back in the mid '90s.",
        "This is a market-oriented bill.",
        "You can't get more Republican than this bill is without becoming a Republican.",
        "Reihan, do you agree with that?",
        "Because many Republicans say that he is not doing enough to inject free market principals into this proposal."

        "One of the things we've learned is that the so called doc fix, the sustainable growth rate part of Medicare is actually very, very expensive.",
        "It's very expensive to fix.",
        "And in the past we've offset that and this time around we're not offsetting it.",
        "And that creates lots of big unaccounted for costs that a lot of Republicans and Democrats, I might add, are very concerned about.",
        "And so, I think that there are a lot of Republicans and, again, lots of Democrats who are worried about creating a new health entitlement, when we have a variety of other entitlements that we've had a very hard time restraining.",
