        "a heart disease medicine called torcetrapib.",
        "The decision came after clinical trials made it clear that instead of decreasing deaths, the drug did the opposite.",
        "Torcetrapib is in a new category of drugs that gave hope to people with heart disease.",
        "Statins, like Pfizer's best-selling Lipitor, do a good job lowering LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, but even so, heart disease remains our biggest killer.",
        "This new drug increases the level of HDL, good cholesterol, which is believed to reduce the size of plaques in the heart's arteries and then lower the risk of heart attack.",
        "And there are major financial implications, too.",
        "To begin with, Pfizer had to write off a billion dollars in development as a total loss, and the new drug had been expected to become its next blockbuster.",
        "To make matters worse, patent protection of some of the company's big sellers expires over the next few years.",
        "The failure of new heart treatments has many concerned about improving the treatment of heart disease and about the health of the pharmaceutical industry.",
        "Later this hour, why spam continues to defeat the best effort of junk mail/e-mail blockers.",
        "But first, the recent heart drug failure.",
        "If you have questions about what works and what doesn't or about profits and drug development, join the conversation.",

        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "So less than a week ago, Pfizer's chief executive, Jeffrey Kindler, was saying publicly that this drug could be among the most important new developments for heart disease in decades and that the company was going to be pressing for FDA approval in 2007.",
        "So what happened?",
        "Well, what happened was, there's a data safety monitoring board that looks at how people are doing on this drug, and they discovered - I think it was on Friday - that there were more deaths, as you mentioned, in the group taking the drug.",
        "Now that's not what you want to see.",
        "No.",
        "So the drug is gone."

        "One of the first questions, I guess, we have to ask.",
        "Obviously the drug Vioxx, an anti-arthritic drug, did not work as advertised.",
        "It caused deaths, and the company that manufactured it is now in a series of lawsuits.",
        "That same sort of thing going to happen to Pfizer after this clinical trial?",
        "Probably not.",
        "To be in a trial, you have to sign something saying you understand that you're taking a risk.",
        "The patients are generally very well-informed.",
        "Unless something went very wrong with that process, and it's not likely, they knew that they were taking experimental drugs.",
        "There was every reason to think that this was a good drug.",
        "Clinically - or experimentally, rather - they know it raises HDL.",
        "That should be a good thing.",
        "Mm-hmm, and I guess the question that a lot of people are asking now: Is it this particular drug and the specific way it improves HDL, or is it the whole family of drugs and, you know, the - Pfizer's not the only company developing them - is it the whole family of drugs that seek to boost HDL?",
        "That's an extremely important question.",
        "Pfizer actually has a couple of other drugs that are very similar to this one coming out.",
        "You know, everyone criticizes drug companies for developing what they call me-too drugs, but sometimes it's just one drug in a family that has a problem.",
        "Sometimes it's what they call a class effect - all the drugs.",
        "Pfizer's got to go back now, and researchers will go back now, and look and see what was the cease of death in these people, try and figure out is it this molecule, is it all molecules like it.",
        "It could be that the class is not dead.",
        "It could be that similar drugs do well.",
        "It could be there's a way to mitigate whatever it is that's causing the problems.",
        "We'll have to wait and see on that one.",
        "Now obviously, this is a major disappointment for Pfizer - and we'll talk about, more about that later - but a disappointment as well for people with heart disease.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "As Dr. Nissen, who's sitting next to me, will say a little later, I think, people die while on statins.",
        "Statins aren't - they - fewer people die but some people do.",
        "They're not the be all and end all.",
        "They're not enough.",
        "There are close to a million heart attacks in this country every year.",
        "HDL looks good.",
        "You know, when you look at people who have naturally high levels of HDL, they tend to do better.",
        "So, you know, if they can recreate that, and if they do better, that could be a big help.",
        "Mm-hmm, and we'll get to Dr. Nissen in just a moment, but we need to point out that heart disease is not only the leading killer of men in this country, it's the leading killer of women, too.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, for years that - especially in the ‘50s and ‘60s, it used to be this was a disease of men.",
        "The American Heart Association reluctantly admits to having hosted something back in the ‘60s for women across the country: How To Help Your Husband.",
        "Now it happens to women, too.",
        "It tends to happen a little bit - when they're a little bit older, but it does.",
        "And as you said, it is a - it is the leading cause of death for women, too.",
        "So that's in the last few years, people have really brought that idea along.",
        "There's legislation in Congress to try and promote that.",
        "And I think that's something that - I mean women need to listen to this just as much as men do.",
        "Well, let's turn now to Dr. Nissen - Steve Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, and one of the lead investigators of an earlier torcetrapib clinical trial, and he's with us here in Studio 3.",
        "Nice to have - 3A - nice to have you on the program today."
