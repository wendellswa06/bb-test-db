        "Will the Senate pass the jobs bill that the House has approved and will that ultimately make a difference in lifting up the economy?",
        "I think it's fairly likely that we'll see some jobs bill passed.",
        "And I think it's fairly unlikely that it will have a substantial effect on spending and on employment because when you're looking at a lot of these tax credit proposals, the truth is that most of the money is going to go to folks who are already going to hire regardless.",
        "And I think the president's own proposal was somewhat better on that front than the proposals that we're seeing coming out of Congress.",
        "But I think that overall, you know, the truth is that this is actually a very, very murky terrain.",
        "And if you look at this month's job numbers, you noted that, you know, we might not have seen much effect from the various blizzards, the thing is we could have seen a big effect, we just don't really know.",
        "What we do know is when you're looking at those job numbers it's important to look at other little tell tale signs.",
        "For example, the fact that we continue to see the losses of construction jobs might actually be a good sign that our economy is shifting away from one area that actually isn't going to be isn't going to have a lot of long-term growth potential.",
        "You also see a spike in temporary jobs, which is potentially a sign that there are some employers who are gently dipping a toe in and who might be ready to make permanent hires a few months down the road.",

        "It's so distasteful that even the Republicans have apologized for it.",
        "I mean, it's a really ugly thing and in some ways the worst part of this memo is the kind of insult to the Republican base.",
