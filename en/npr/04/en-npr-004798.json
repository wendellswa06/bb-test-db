        "Is the future of soccer women's soccer?",
        "I think what they mean there, Steve, is that they're maxing out on the men.",
        "I mean, it is the worldwide game and men play it at incredible levels.",
        "So if you want to look at the growth industry of your sport, you would think it would be the women.",
