        "Niacin, perhaps 20 or 25 percent increases.",

        "The 82 people - it was 81, 82 people, 82 people out of a group of 7,500 people.",
        "In the other group there were 51 deaths, so it's not like 82 is from zero.",

        "Well, doing a clinical trial is not easy, and the goal of course is to bring new medicines forward, and in doing that there are a number of ethical standards that have to be applied.",
        "And one of them is to have a group that's outside of the pharmaceutical company and outside of the trial investigators that's watching, and that's called a data safety and monitoring board.",
        "This one was chaired by a very experienced man who's done this for many years and who has - I have a lot of confidence in him.",
