        "They would have said, listen, these patients that are getting the drug are dying at a fewer frequency and therefore it's no longer ethical to continue the trial.",

        "And they, as I understand it, called Pfizer and said we have a problem here, and it was just a few hours later that Pfizer pulled the plug.",

        "I mean they had the entire program shut down worldwide within 24 hours, and they made a public announcement.",

        "That's the right thing to do, and we should really - you know, I've been somebody to criticize the industry on many occasion, but when they do things right, we ought to compliment them.",

        "I used to work for a crop protection products manufacturer, and I know that there's a lot of steps that you have to go through during the discovery phase.",
        "And as the product moves through those steps, if there's any problem that shows up, then, you know, it's weeded up, basically and they drop it before it gets to a major stage or it costs a lot of money.",
        "So why didn't they, you know, catch any problems with this drug, the Pfizer drug, you know, earlier in, you know, in that discovery-development process?",
        "Well, it's very challenging to know when those risks are going to appear.",
        "In fact, a lot of drugs have actually gotten to market and ultimately have found to have risks we didn't anticipate and had to be withdrawn.",
        "It turns out that if something happens with a relatively low frequency, until you expose large numbers of patients, you simply can't get the statistical evidence you need to know that the drug is actually producing harm.",
        "phase one, phase two, and phase three.",
        "In phase one and phase two, we're often talking about a few hundred patients that have gotten the drug.",
        "And so seeing a mortality disadvantage, or even a disadvantage in terms of heart attacks, is just not going to show up until you start to expose large numbers of patients.",
        "This study that was stopped prematurely was involving 15,000 patients.",
        "And remember that out of those 15,000 patients, there were 31 excess deaths, and that was enough to be - to provide the statistical evidence to shut down the program.",

        "But, you know, it's not enough.",
        "You know, they reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by perhaps about a third, and I've said actually several times that if we put statin drugs in the water supply that cardiovascular disease would still be the leading cause of death in most Western countries.",

        "And then secondly, I'd be curious to get any other agents - I have heard that there is a synthetic molecule being developed - the Milano Apo A-1 - that's supposedly may be promising, and was curious to see if Dr. Nissen had any updates or any news on where that stands.",
        "The rest of us think Milanos are cookies."
