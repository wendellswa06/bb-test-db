        "Yeah.",
        "So we're going to turn this over to Dr. Nissen.",
        "Well, it just so happens by chance that this was a study that I conducted and reported in late 2003.",
        "And to make a long story short, we took and made a synthetic HDL particle based upon a protein obtained from some individuals in Italy, near the city of Milan.",
        "And we were very surprised when we gave this intravenously - gave five doses over five weeks - and saw some pretty remarkable regression, meaning reduction in the burden of plaque in their coronaries.",
        "It turns out, however, there are many obstacles to its development.",
        "It's very hard to make.",
        "The little company that developed it was actually purchased by Pfizer.",
        "So this is actually another Pfizer product, and maybe we'll turn some more attention to trying to figure out how to get around the obstacles to development of that drug.",
        "But, you know, we're not going to quit.",
        "The fact that one drug failed doesn't mean that we're going to give up on the idea of raising the good cholesterol.",
        "And one of the reasons why everybody was so excited about torcetrapib was the results of the apo A-1 Milano study, which showed such dramatic and rapid benefits.",
        "But we're going to get back on the horse and we'll find another way to do this.",
        "Tom, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The failure of torcetrapib was not just a health story but a big business story as well.",
        "NPR's Snigdha Prakash covers the pharmaceutical industry, and she's also joined us here in Studio 3A.",
        "Nice to have you on the program, Snigdha.",
        "Thank you, Neal.",
        "So how big a problem is this for Pfizer?",
        "We're hearing that that initial write-off was as big as a billion dollars.",
        "That's right, and there are many ways to quantify how big it is.",
        "And no matter how you slice and dice it, it's very, very big.",
        "One way that analysts of course have been thinking about it was that the role of torcetrapib in Pfizer's business scheme was to replace revenues from Lipitor, the statin that we've been hearing about, which is not just Pfizer's best-selling drug, but the world's best-selling drug, with annual sales I believe this year expected to be $13 billion."

        "Lipitor goes off patent in 2011.",
        "That means that generic versions of Lipitor will flood the market, and the profits from Lipitor will pretty much dry up.",
        "And Pfizer was hoping that torcetrapib would be the successor to Lipitor, and of course now it's not there.",
        "So they've got a huge hole in their sort of drug portfolio and, as I understand it, not an awful lot in the pipeline coming through.",
        "That's right.",
        "There is a big gaping hole.",
        "One analyst I spoke to put it very dramatically.",
        "She said that they are not expecting what they call organic growth, growth from within Pfizer, for 10 years.",
        "That's a long time.",
        "And this is the world's biggest pharmaceutical company.",
        "It's the biggest pharmaceutical company, and though not every pharmaceutical company is exactly like Pfizer, it is fair to say that as Pfizer goes, so does a lot of the industry.",
        "So this is characteristic of other drug companies too?",
        "Right.",

        "They have patents - that means the exclusive right to sell them for, well, in the U.S.",
        "by law 20 years, though in practice it seems really a bit less.",
        "When the drugs go off patent, the profits evaporate and drug makers rely on finding new drugs to replace those drugs.",
        "We happen to be going through a period which is sort of a, you know, a cyclical drought.",
        "And there are a couple of problems here in terms of finding new drugs.",
        "One is that there are really big shoes to fill.",
        "You know, if Lipitor is a $13 billion drug, it's not easy to find another drug that will generate $13 billion in sales.",
        "And the other one is that we've got some really good drugs.",
        "It's not easy to find a drug that's better than Lipitor, as Dr. Nissen has been telling us.",

        "They keep your - they open up and keep open your arteries.",
        "And they're soaked in drugs to help them do this.",
        "Exactly, but there are safety problems.",
        "So suddenly, you know, this is not a foolproof strategy either, to diversify out of drugs into medical devices.",
        "They're cutting costs.",
        "Pfizer just told us last week that they're cutting 20 percent of their sales force.",
        "They are doing a lot of heavy-duty lobbying here in Washington to make sure the government doesn't get into setting prices for Medicare drugs or negotiating with drug makers.",
        "So they have a few things up their sleeves.",

        "Hi.",
        "Hi.",
        "So my question for Dr. Nissen is that a good part of objectivity in reporting any opinion on a drug company is usually reporting your conflicts of interest.",
        "And I was wondering if you could tell us what conflicts of interest you have?",
        "Meaning, what investment do you have in the pharmaceutical company and what portion of your work do they have funding towards?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well of course I'm very sensitive to these issues.",
        "And many years ago I recognized - as I think many people in America have - that there are problems with conflict of interest with physicians who are involved in research.",
        "And so I adopted as a personal approach that I would not accept honorary consulting fees of any kind from anybody in the pharmaceutical or device industry.",
        "Instead, I donate these to a charity - in this case the American College of Cardiology, an organization that's really dedicated to promoting heart health.",
        "And I think that more and more physicians are beginning to realize that the conflict of interest problem is an important one.",
        "And I was hoping in doing that that I would actually encourage others to also adopt the same policy.",
        "Which is to say, we should be involved in research and things that benefit patients, but our personal reimbursement for it doesn't make a lot of sense and it does create a conflict of interest.",
        "And so I said I'm not going to do that.",
        "Thank you.",

        "Is that a course of action you would recommend, Dr. Nissen?",
