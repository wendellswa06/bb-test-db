        "But while other candidates focused on Iowa, McCain retooled and returned to New Hampshire, the state that launched his unlikely White House bid eight years earlier.",
        "Campaigning on a shoestring, he crisscrossed the state, holding more than 100 town hall meetings.",
        "And on primary night, January 8th, his New Hampshire gamble paid off.",
        "Tonight, we sure showed them what a comeback looks like.",
        "(Soundbite of cheering)",
        "McCain went on to win South Carolina, Florida, and the biggest prizes on Super Tuesday.",
        "He'd been helped, in part, by the improving security situation in Iraq.",
        "McCain now gets more credit for supporting the troop surge and less blame for backing the war in the first place.",

        "It's the NFL now.",

        "But give them an antidepressant drug and after a period of time they start to fight harder.",

        "The molecule is called p11.",
        "Mice that lacked p11 acted depressed.",
        "Those with normal amounts didn't.",
        "The effect that we saw in this mouse model is very dramatic.",
        "And Svenningsson says levels of p11 rose when the mice got drugs for depression, but it took quite a while.",

        "Paul Greengard of Rockefeller University is part of the team studying p11.",
        "He also won a share of the Nobel Prize a few years ago for his work on how signals travel through the brain.",
        "Greengard says if p11 has the same effect in humans as it does in mice, that may explain why current antidepressant drugs take so long to work.",
        "And, he says, there is evidence that p11 plays a role in human moods.",
        "Brain tissue from autopsies of people who had been diagnosed with depression contained less p11 than normal brain samples.",
        "Our thinking is that many subclasses of depression might be associated with lower levels of p11, on the one hand, and that raising either the level or the functionality of the p11 would be a novel way to develop antidepressants.",
        "Right now, there aren't any drugs that act directly on p11, but researchers say biotech companies are likely to start looking.",
        "Dr. Thomas Insel directs the National Institute of Mental Health.",
        "He's pretty excited about the new study.",
        "This is quite important because it now focuses us on a whole new area and a whole new part of the cascade for how information gets processed in the brain."

        "The Trump administration says it's enforcing a part of immigration law that dates back to the 19th century - the notion that immigrants cannot be a, quote, \"\"public charge.\"\" But under past administrations, the public charge rule was interpreted to cover only cash assistance.",
