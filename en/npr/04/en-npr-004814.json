        "What we're really saying is that if you hold wines while they're going through a phase of being too young and undrinkable, you're not actually affecting the drinking market at all.",
        "And the great wines at Bordeaux very often need between eight and 12 years before they should be put on anyone's table.",
        "If you hold back stock during that period, you're not affecting the drinkers, but you are very often witnessing a complete change in global demand.",
