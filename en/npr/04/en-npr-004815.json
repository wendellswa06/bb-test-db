        "Northrop Grumman and Boeing have been in a heated competition for the lucrative Air Force contract worth at least $35 billion dollars in the first installment and potentially worth a $100 billion over the long term.",
        "Los Angeles-based Northrop teamed with the European parent firm of Airbus and would assemble the new tankers in Mobile, Alabama.",
        "Boeing would make them in Washington state.",
        "But now, Northrop may withdraw from the bidding war.",
        "Northrop spokesman Randy Belote says the Pentagon has changed its rules to favor Boeing's aircraft.",
        "If the Pentagon is clearly asking for a smaller tanker, as we believe that they are, the question that Northrop Grumman is asking itself is, why should we compete?",
        "The answer is we cannot compete.",
        "This is the third time the military has tried to replace the Eisenhower-era tankers.",
        "A 2004 deal with Boeing collapsed amid an ethics scandal.",
        "And last year, the Pentagon canceled the contract with Northrop Grumman after Boeing challenged it.",
        "Some defense analysts say Northrop is now posturing to pressure the Pentagon for more favorable terms.",
        "Boeing spokesman William Barksdale says it's a tactic used before.",
        "He says Boeing also has some concerns.",
        "For us, it's all how you go at it.",
        "We feel like we want to go through the process behind the scenes, and not play this out publicly, where we're threatening to go ahead and not bid unless we're catered to.",
        "But Northrop supporters in Alabama, like Mobile Mayor Sam Jones, believe Boeing is the firm being catered to because the new rules are so different from the last round.",
        "They muscle their way into defense contracts, and this is really another muscle job, as far as we're concerned.",
        "In Alabama, all we ask for is a level playing field.",
        "And now the playing field has been changed.",
        "And you know, they know we can compete on a level playing field.",
        "That's why the playing field has changed all of a sudden.",
        "The dispute is getting attention on Capitol Hill.",
        "Mr.",

        "Do you believe that competition is important in this aircraft for the Defense Department and the war fighter?",

        "We believe that both of the principal competitors are highly qualified, and we would like to see competition continue in this process.",
        "Arizona Senator John McCain has questioned the new requirement, and powerful Pennsylvania Congressman John Murtha favors splitting the contract so that both firms could build their version of the refueling plane.",
        "But the bipartisan Senate tanker caucus says the Air Force should move ahead with Boeing, even if Northrop Grumman pulls out.",

        "He says the prolonged tanker battle is an example of how politics can introduce risky delays in the nation's defense acquisitions.",
        "The tankers the Air Force uses for aerial refueling on average are already 50 years old.",
        "And yet it's going to probably take 20 or 30 years to replace all the tankers we have.",
        "So the arithmetic is starting to get a little worrisome.",

        "And in fact, it has really put a damper on the extraordinary advances that have been made over decades and decades of antimicrobial agents, antibiotics, antivirals, because sooner or later microbes have the capability of being able to evolve towards protecting themselves from what we, the human species, do to blunt them.",

        "And then a new generation of drugs, methacillin, was developed, and they were very well treated with methacillin.",
        "And then very soon thereafter methacillin-resistant staphylococcus came in.",
        "Over a period of time, when you use antibiotics, you can actually make the resistance phenomenon come sooner rather than later.",
        "How's that happen?",
        "You kill off the weak ones, and the strong ones survive?",
        "Microbes, as they replicate, are continually able to mutate and divert themselves around.",
        "So if you go with an antibiotic that's successfully treating a microbe, there will always be a small fraction of the microbe that under most circumstances wouldn't be a problem, but when you get rid of all the sensitive microbes with the antibiotic, then those other strains that were generally minor the strains start to take over.",
        "The problem is, they are resistant to the antibiotic.",
        "And then they become the predominant microbe in a particular infection.",
