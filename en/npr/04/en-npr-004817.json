        "I'm doing great.",
        "So...",
        "Awesome.",
        "Yesterday, a South African court cleared the way for corruption and racketeering charges to be filed against presidential hopeful Jacob Zuma.",
        "A lower court dismissed the case against the African National Congress leader on a technicality last September.",
        "And claims that there was political interference by President Thabo Mbeki led President Mbeki to step down.",
        "Now, where does this ruling - this new ruling bring us, Emira?",
        "Total chaos, Farai.",
        "Clearly, there's so much going on behind the scenes on this issue.",
        "Zuma's trial was on again, off again.",
        "Now, it's on again.",
        "Will he be put forward on corruption charges, and what will be the political implications?",
        "Clearly, he is head of the largest political party, the African National Congress, the oldest party on the continent.",
        "But the ANC now is going through real pressures.",
        "The split between Mbeki, the ouster of Mbeki, the former president of South Africa, has now led to a split within the African National Congress.",
        "So this issue of Zuma and whether or not he's brought upon charges has led to real changes in the political landscape in South Africa.",
        "And as we move towards elections in the coming months - it could be April when there are presidential elections in South Africa - it, you know, it is going to be interesting times to see.",
        "Will this trial go forward?",
        "Will it be completed, and there'll be a ruling before elections?",
        "And what would the implications of a possible ANC not led by Zuma mean for South African politics now and into the future?",
        "As you know, we've talked about this new political party, COPE.",
        "And you've got the ANC.",
        "You've got COPE.",
        "You have questions over the economic direction of South Africa and whether or not it's inclusive enough, particularly in light of the 2010 World Cup, and whether or not there are going to be - there's going to be tension and protest by people who've been shut out of the economic growth.",
        "Do you see any real discussion that is forward thinking about how are you going to take people who have actually lost ground economically post-Apartheid and lift them up?",
        "That is the critical question.",
        "Many see that the trade union movement was the voice of the people for decades in South Africa.",
        "And yet, with the economic strife that many are facing - remember, there's a global economic crisis, and South Africa is not left out of that situation, and you have real dire straits for people who had such high expectations, particularly after the end of Apartheid, expectations that there will be housing, there will be jobs, you know.",
        "And these expectations have gone unmet for many people throughout South Africa, for the masses and the majority.",
        "So the key question is, as we see this new political party emerging really to the right of the African National Congress, this COPE, the Congress of the People, to what extent will the pressures from the bottom up create new political forces in South Africa, potentially new parties to emerge on the left of the African National Congress?",
        "To what extent do all of these fissures really change the landscape so that you not only have political parties emerging, but a real challenge in terms of what will be the future direction of South Africa?",
        "Can there be an economy that works for people, for the miners, for the, you know, farmers, for those who are the majority, the workers of that country?"

        "So this is a relatively new arena in the human rights agenda on the African continent and really around the world, but it's an agenda that we all must figure out ways to uphold so that we can arrive really at a 21st century world where all can live with dignity.",

        "And I do think that you have some that are able to take the lead and create a sense of hope for others in the continent who also recognize the importance of this issue.",
        "So clearly, there are South African human rights activists, but there are activists in Nigeria and in Uganda, in a number of countries around the continent that are creating a platform to raise these critical issues.",
