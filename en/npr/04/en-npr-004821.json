        "So while this legislation may have the comfort of insulating officials in U.S.",
        "courts - and although I would debate that proposition if it's challenged in court for its constitutionality and otherwise - the fact is that overseas, I think it makes it a far more dangerous situation for American officials, because those courts are going to look at this, those governments are going to look at this, and they're going to say, hey, we can carve out our own methodology and interpretation of Common Article 3 and we're going to make sure that that interpretation nails the Americans.",
        "Let's talk a little bit about the way courts might look at this.",
        "If Congress were to pass this compromise retroactively amending this law, is that going to hold up in the courts?",
        "I think it will hold up in the court for the following reasons: that the Supreme Court plurality indicates that the Supreme Court's objections were not largely constitutional.",
        "They were specifically statutory.",
        "And what Senator McCain and Senators Graham and Warner have been careful to do - and I think this, to some degree, is reflecting some of the concern that Professor Scheffer mentioned about international opinion - is that they are - they wanted to be very careful to say that what we were modifying by this compromise was the interpretation of the War Crimes Act and our domestic understanding of the War Crimes Act, and we were not in any way seeking to undermine our allegiance to the protections of the Geneva Convention or their meaning.",
        "Now, the president, I think, to some degree said that might be a distinction without a difference, but in terms of international sensibilities, it might not be.",
        "And my judgment is, is that this will be a sustainable compromise in court, largely because the members of the Senate and the executive have responded to the Supreme Court's judgment in a way that is within the scope of that judgment.",
        "Professor Scheffer, has Congress done this with other laws?",
        "Is it typical to retroactively amend a law?",
        "There is precedent whereby you diminish or greatly diminish the punishment for prior criminal acts, and that has been upheld by the Supreme Court.",
        "But what I think will be reviewed as rather unorthodox, when you have a treaty obligation such as Common Article 3 and a federal statute such as the War Crimes Act of 1996 that you retroactively simply eliminate whole swaths of culpability for any individuals who may have violated either act or the treaty obligation as implemented through the act for a certain period of time.",
        "So I think that will be considered unorthodox.",
        "And it will be interesting, as this percolates now again up through the courts - because this will certainly be challenged if adopted - is what about the victims' right?",
        "I mean, you have victims for the last 10 years who may have been subjected to some of theses treatments.",
        "And what this law is doing is stripping them of any recourse, any remedy whatsoever through the courts."

        "Does this kind of immunity in any way encourage agents to test the boundaries of what might be acceptable in an interrogation room, if they know they're going to have this immunity?",
        "Absolutely, because with the specificity that's now provided in this legislation, the interrogator knows that he can push right up to the limit of that specific definition.",
        "And he may say to himself, well, this might somehow be construed as a violation of Common Article 3, but I know for sure that I have no criminal liability under this.",

        "You can push right up to the limit and do extreme harm to an individual, extreme harm and abuse, which I would never want to see an American of any stripe, official or otherwise, subjected to overseas.",
        "But this invites such treatment.",

        "For the first time we're taking very general phrases and we're putting the names of particular crimes on them.",
        "We're specifying murder, torture, rape and so forth, as the convention has always done, but then we're adding to it categories of extreme physical pain, physical harm, serious mental harm, all of which has to be filled out by rules and regulations which the president will promulgate and promulgate with notice and in a public way that will hopefully stimulate a very careful oversight by Congress announcing the law in advance, making it clear, setting the boundaries.",
        "It doesn't invite lawless behavior.",
