        "Well, as you're pointing out - and this has been growing for a long time - a number of MPs, particularly senior members of her Conservative Party, want her out.",

        "In exchange for the prime minister giving a date when she would step down, maybe get enough votes to pass her Brexit plan.",
        "Honestly though, that seems unlikely because it's so unpopular, and it's lost by such huge margins.",
        "And the bottom line, I think, is many, many MPs no longer have much faith in her leading her party or the country.",
        "Well, I mean, some people could characterize that as blackmail.",
        "How is the prime minister responding?",
        "Well, she isn't saying anything yet that I've seen, which, I think, is wise on her part.",
        "Her office at 10 Downing Street is saying she's not leaving.",

        "The administration has talked about the timetables that they could use in Iraq, but even the prime minister, al-Maliki, has rejected that notion.",

        "It means that the Iraqi military has to progress to the point where they can make their country safer, where the Iraqi police forces, which have been really disappointing in terms of their own performance, have to do a lot better.",
        "There will come a point, a day of reckoning, but at this moment, I think we have to challenge the Iraqis to do better and so that the American troops can start to come home.",
