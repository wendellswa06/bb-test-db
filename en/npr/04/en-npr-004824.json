        "Jeff, the ruling that basically these Japanese friend-of-the-court brief filers are responding to says that the executive, the president, is free to single out nationals of a particular country; but it also went on to basically say that you could single out Arab Muslims because it was unclear what countries the people who perpetrated the crime were actually from, or they were form multiple countries.",
