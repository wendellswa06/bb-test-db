        "I definitely can say emphatically no, it shouldn't be happening in a prison.",
        "I think that prison should be reserved for people who are guilty of crime, in particular violent crime, and I think that a person's health or lack of it should not be a determinant on whether they're going to be placed inside a prison or not or be locked up.",
        "I think that on two counts - on one side, Robert Daniels has a responsibility.",
        "If he has a tuberculosis strain that is very dangerous, he has the responsibility to wear a mask in public.",
        "And the public health officials have a responsibility of informing him of just how serious this is.",
        "But it also hurts my heart that in this particular situation we live in a situation where we're using great words like involuntary quarantine, which basically says I'm just going to lock you up because you're sick.",
        "And I think that at least if you're going to detain somebody like this for non-crime, give them a Playstation or something.",

        "But I think in this particular case, the tuberculosis case, the local governments may have gone too far in their fear.",
        "And it reminds me of some of the things that were being done in the '80s when we knew much less about HIV than we do now, and people were being rounded up, were being dismissed from jobs, were not being treated by the medical community because the EMTs thought they would become ill if they touched them.",
        "So some of that hysteria may be moving into this line now, and we should learn from what we did in the 1980s.",

        "I should say very quickly that in the case of this particular guy, the story is incomplete, it's unclear why he's being sensorily deprived in this way.",

        "Even some \"\"remainers,\"\" people who want to stay in the EU, feel it would be anti-democratic.",
