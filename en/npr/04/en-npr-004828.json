        "Do you know what changed with his legal status, or in his situation, that he was allowed in yesterday?",
        "Well, I do know that the good people in the State Department and Department of Homeland Security and elsewhere, I think, explored his situation and satisfied themselves that he would be a fine student at Harvard and made it possible for him to come here.",
        "And we're very grateful for their efforts.",
        "To your knowledge, was this a mistake, or were there real concerns, red flags raised that would legitimately have kept him out?",
        "I have no way of knowing.",
        "And were you actively involved in lobbying for him to get in - to be allowed entry into the U.S.?",

        "We've tried to make sure that Ismail is just being allowed to be a Harvard College student.",
        "I think at this point, given all that he's been through, he just wants to experience the campus and the start of college like everybody else does."

        "So this letter that you sent today to the Harvard community, you write in it of students and scholars finding themselves the subject of scrutiny and suspicion - your words - the implication, as I read it, being that Ajjawi is not the first.",
        "How big a problem has this been at Harvard?",
        "Well, I think Harvard is not unique.",
        "I think these days many of the nation's colleges and universities have found that visitors to our campuses from abroad have encountered delays in obtaining visas; have had issues, in some cases, at the border; have had difficulty securing the kind of routine approvals that have made it possible for them to travel to American colleges and universities in the past.",
        "I think it's important to understand that our nation's academic institutions are in many ways magnets for the best and the brightest from around the world.",

        "Well, I received, you know, responses - polite responses to each of my letters.",
        "But I think more importantly are the actions that have been taken.",
        "So I'm encouraged by the fact that Ismail was able to find his way to Harvard.",
        "So you know, I'm grateful to the assistance that we've had from Secretary Pompeo and his colleagues.",
        "But to the broader concern you're raising about how this is maybe putting a damper on international students and scholars wanting to come to Harvard and other institutions of higher learning in the States, did you get a receptive audience to that concern?",
        "Well, I think these are complicated issues, and different people have different perspectives on them.",
        "When I've traveled to D.C.",
        "- I've met now with about 10% of the Congress one-on-one to talk to them about these issues.",

        "Right - and to a specific definition of merit that fails to recognize that people, like my parents, who come to this country do so to seek a better life and are willing to work incredibly hard to create it.",
        "And I feel a deep debt of gratitude to the country for having given them an opportunity to come and make their lives here.",
        "And where else in the world can you go from literally off the boat with nothing - you know, one suitcase in the case of both of my parents - and in one generation, to become the president of Harvard?",
        "I think - you know, that's what makes this country the extraordinary place that it is.",
        "And I hope that we will continue to make these opportunities available to others who want to come here, who want to work hard and seek freedom and opportunity."
