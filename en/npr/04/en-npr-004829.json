        "Every single person who's apprehended at the border is placed into removal proceedings, including the children.",
        "So they move down the deportation train, so to speak, except that the process moves very slowly for the children.",
        "And that's simply because they're out of custody, and the immigration courts have long since prioritized people who are in detention over those who are not in detention.",

        "Congress has never adequately funded the immigration courts.",
        "So today the - you have about 300 immigration judges who are handling 800,000 cases.",
        "So if that child ends up in a state like Arizona or Los Angeles, Calif., that child is probably looking at a two- to four-year window before they are able to present or somebody on their behalf is able to present their claims to an immigration judge and the judge decides whether they get to stay or have to go.",
        "In this current situation, as we sit here in June 2018 where children have been separated within the last two months since this policy was put into effect, is there a bureaucratic reason or a legal reason why - now that an executive order has been put in place to rescind the family separation policy why they couldn't be reunited really quickly with their parents?",
        "Well, in my opinion, they could reunite the current people in detention with their children very quickly.",
        "Now, that might require that they release those individuals with an ankle bracelet and a court date from custody.",
        "But, you know, I will tell you that in my experience, 99 percent - or 96 depending upon which statistic you're looking at - of the people who are placed on an ankle bracelet actually show up at their hearing in the immigration court.",

        "Yeah.",
        "So this idea that some of the administration people put out in the very beginning that this is a short-term custody, what that tells me is that they had no idea about the thicket of laws and logistics that go into place about reuniting a parent with their child after the parent has been deported.",
        "I can tell you from experience dealing with issues related to UACs that that is a very difficult process.",
        "And when I was at ICE, we faced some tough cases where we had inadvertently let's say deported a parent, which happens in the normal course despite our policies that promote family unity.",
