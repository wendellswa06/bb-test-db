        "So Eugene, tell me about the origins of jazz.",
        "We see it as one of the first African-American forms of music, often tied to New Orleans.",
        "Where did the sound really originate?",
        "Well, it originated in the American South and the New Orleans region.",
        "And New Orleans is important for the origin because in the 19th and early 20th centuries you had a mix of not only free and slave people of African descent, you had people from Cuba, people from Haiti, from all over the Caribbean.",
        "You also had an old European population, some of the first opera in this country was formed in New Orleans.",
        "So you had a great mix in the New Orleans area that birthed jazz.",
        "And one reason why jazz is so popular around the world and why it's so vital is our most mixed and our most multicultural art form, and it really mirrors what the diversity of this country has to offer."

        "We forget there was a lot of Italians and Germans and a wide variety of cultures living in New Orleans after the Louisiana Purchase.",

        "So if you had someone who didn't really have language for jazz, how would you try to tell them about it?",
        "It's like any other kind of music.",
        "Don't forget, for the first half of jazz's existence, for about the first 50 years it was primarily dance music.",
        "And also someone once asked Count Basie to define his music and Basie's response was three words, tap your foot.",
        "So I guess what I'm leading up to is, you know, we tend to over-intellectualize jazz.",
        "The fact is that there are all different kinds of jazz, some that are more accessible and approachable than others.",
        "But the most accessible of those are perfectly approachable and understandable to anybody with open ears and a foot that they can tap.",

        "You know, jazz has a rich heritage, now fully 100 years, and since 1917 it's been recorded.",
        "So there's a rich recorded heritage and luckily for the past 20 or so years a lot of that has been made available on CD that previously was out of print or otherwise unavailable for decades.",

        "And you can tell, she's well studied and she's - I think probably has prepared herself by listening to all the great stride pianists before her and, you know, she had quite a long career and - but quite definitely she really stands out as singular in women for that time period.",

        "And, you know, I think this follows true with the jazz tradition of - I really don't believe that jazz music is something of a museum piece, but something that continues to grow and flourish and be invigorated by other forms of music.",
        "You mentioned a lot of international music.",
        "So I guess in general, I mean it makes sense that musicians would seek out different influences, but do you think that the U.S.",
        "music market itself in terms of how most people think of these genres that they listen to is expanding, or do people kind of go in their own tracks, and people who like pop music listen to pop and people who like hip-hop just listen to hip-hop?",
        "Well it's true that people become very stuck into the music that they run across and they've fallen in love with.",
        "I think the problem with jazz is it's not easily available on radio or on television.",

        "I mean, do you think that jazz is still a part of popular music, or is it a kind of a sub-genre?",
        "Well, no question it's part of popular music.",
        "Jazz has always given popular music a boost for the last 50 years.",
        "And you mention hip-hop.",
        "You know, when hip-hop really was in vogue, like in the '90s, I mean one of my favorite groups, A Tribe Called Quest, they made a career out of sampling people like (unintelligible) and Weather Report.",
