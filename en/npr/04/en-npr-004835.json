        "Right.",
        "And the thing is, is if you bailed out homeowners directly - I mean, if the whole problem, the underlying problem is the mortgage market, which it is.",
        "Then if we sort of shore up that market, then wouldn't it ripple through the system in the same way that bad mortgages rippled through the system previously.",
        "So if the mortgage market was fixed, then would all these financial products heal themselves, if you'll pardon the expression, and the banks get relief that way too."
