        "Over the summer, what we saw were, you know, small numbers of soldiers defecting from the army, taking their guns off of the base and saying they wanted to protect protestors, again like they've been saying in these suburbs.",
        "But what we're seeing now are just open clashes between these anti-government rebels and pro-government forces.",
        "And what we're hearing in the last 24 hours is that the defections are increasing.",
        "It had been, also, until very recently, a provincial conflict: mostly in the countryside, mostly in smaller cities.",
        "What does it mean now that there has been fighting in and around Damascus and Aleppo?",
        "What it means is that the regime's narrative - that they have everything under control and that, you know, yes this is largely a concern of folks in the rural areas, this doesn't really concern you people here in Damascus and in Syria's second city, Aleppo - that that narrative is really kind of unraveling.",
        "That the rebels were even able to get that close and, you know, even if they were just manning some checkpoints for a short period of time, that they were able to do that sends a really strong message to the people inside Syria, to the so-called, you know, silent majority that's been kind of sitting on the fence waiting to see where this is going to go.",
        "I think now there's a sense that there is a tip - now, does that mean that the regime is on the verge of falling?",
        "No. Why?",
        "Because the army is still more powerful than this very ragtag rebel group.",
        "And where does this leave diplomacy with the withdrawal of Arab League monitors?",
        "The Arab League says it will take its proposal to the United Nations Security Council.",
        "But as we noticed, Russia and perhaps China, as well, seem to be ready to oppose it.",
        "That Arab League initiative does call for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to, you know, eventually abdicate power.",
        "It's not an open call for, you know, regime change.",
        "It's slightly more diplomatic, let's say, than that.",
        "And so by - but by doing that, you know, Russia has said that that's just too much.",
        "Even though this new resolution does not call for new sanctions, does not call for any kind of international intervention into Syria, they still say that this notion that somebody else, that outsiders would, you know, would decide when a president should step down, that that's too much for them.",
        "And honestly, that's what we're fighting - from late night talk show hosts.",
        "You know, we had a big kerfuffle with Conan O'Brien to others.",
        "It's just an easy joke to make, but we're struggling to get people to understand what the truth is.",
        "And now that we'll have millions of Americans watching Newark and tens of thousands visiting Newark this weekend, we know that it will be a chance for us to show the truth of who we are.",
        "I have to say I had the opportunity to visit Newark several times when I was doing play-by-play for a team that was in the same league as the Newark Bears, just down the street from the Prudential arena.",
        "And so I got to visit the city quite a bit and visit the great restaurants in the Ironbound District.",
        "But as a Jersey guy growing up, I can't tell you how important it is to some people to have the teams that play in that arena be the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils."

        "We make such profound contributions to this country in arts, and entertainment and definitely professional sports.",
        "But, you know, the Giants and the Jets play here but, yet they claim the moniker of being a New York team.",
        "But we claim them because the truth of the matter is so that much of our sports in this region our played in New Jersey and now in Newark.",
        "And we want to flex a little bit and let people know that, the Jersey pride.",
        "And if you can play the Bruce Springsteen in the background...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "And you attended Stanford, which did not make the men's tournament this year, so who are you going to be rooting for?",

        "I think they are, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So it's going to be a tough bracket for one of those teams, but I still like Duke overall and maybe Kansas as well, seeing them in the final game.",

        "So we felt like we had no choice.",
        "And if we wanted to continue to emphasize to the city, to the state, and to the world that public schools are essential, we need it to open up a charter school but run it just like we ran our public school.",
        "You know, that's an interesting point that you raise.",
        "In Amy Waldman's article, she talked about the fact that per capita there are more charter schools in New Orleans now than any place else in the country.",
        "So to your point, though, Steven, which type of school do you think - state-run, city-run, charter, combination - do you think works best to meet the needs of New Orleans students?",
        "Well, having a charter school does give us a little bit more flexibility because now we're able to do some of the things that we were not able to do as a public school, given all of the bureaucracy that we had to run through.",
        "Yeah, like what?",
        "Give us a hint.",
        "Well, like for instance we fought with the state when we wrote our charter because they said we could not have direct instruction.",
        "And direct instruction is a research-based, a reading program that worked well for us when we were a public school.",
        "And because we knew during registration that we just had a number of kids who were out of school for three months, six months, were not in any school at all, we needed it to bring back direct instruction.",
        "So when we met with the state, we fought to have direct instruction as part of our charter.",
        "What appears to be an overlay of the educational issues facing you and the others in New Orleans is the politics of it all.",
        "And as I understand it, your school, you had to have a '60s-style sit-in to get the facility that you wanted even on a temporary basis.",
        "And we did.",
        "And the unfortunate part is that the facility that we are now in - that we had to, as the state says, defy them to be in - was a facility we asked for that when they approved our charter in March.",
        "Had they prepared the work, repaired the building, there would be no need for them to have to push our opening day back four different times."

        "They chose not to give us this school, to put us in a school that they're now saying is structurally unsound.",
