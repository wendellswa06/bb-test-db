        "Of course, this is a very difficult topic, and there have been different views coming from inside Syria.",
        "But as the oppression and the military campaign and the crackdown expands, also the demand for a buffer zone or for a no-fly zone is getting bigger and louder during the protests from the people in the streets.",

        "Well, I would just like to say that while I agree it's great to push economic sanctions, I think that the world community should really limit it to that, because if we look at Afghanistan, you know, we removed, you know, dictators, but you have the Taliban.",
        "And, you know, we went so far as to even put boots on the ground.",
        "Now if we were to do that in Syria, you know, well, Afghanistan is still quite unstable, and they're still fighting.",
        "So I guess it really shows that it's ultimately up to the people to take care of their - you know, take care of their country and their government and really make their steps to decide what they want as a people.",
