        "I do think there's still a role for diplomacy.",
        "Indeed, I think when Steven Cook was raising the idea of intervention and I said at least that's to be thinkable, part of that is to try to make clear that we want a diplomatic solution, and we need to create the incentives to get one.",
        "It does depend tremendously in the first instance on the region.",
        "The Arab League has been more active than anybody could have imagined in terms of taking a stance, sending in monitors, calling now for Assad to step down.",
        "If they can put a lot of pressure on Russia at the Security Council more than I think the standard Western-versus-Russia pressure, that is probably our best hope of a diplomatic solution.",
        "And the - of course, the threat to intervene has to be backed up by the willingness to intervene, no?",
        "It does.",
        "This is important.",
        "It's important, too, though, for the credibility of the West as a whole.",
        "When the West - when the U.N.",
        "authorized intervention in Libya, it authorized intervention under the doctrine of responsibility to protect, which says if a government is failing to protect its people by committing genocide or crimes against humanity or ethnic cleansing, really grave and systematic crimes, then the international community can intervene to protect.",
        "We did that in Libya.",
        "At this point, as you pointed out, there are many thousands of people who've died in Syria.",
        "That's - if that continues, at some point, the credibility of the international community is on the line.",
        "I think, though, we can't intervene unless there is a pretty unified request to begin with from the Syrian people.",
        "They're the people we would be trying to protect.",
        "They have to resolve that debate on their own.",
        "And then, it has to go through the region and finally through the regional organization and then finally to the U.N.",
        "And if the Russians, as we have every reason to expect, unless they change their minds, veto, what then?",
        "That's the hardest question.",
        "In my view, if the - if you had a request from the Arab League backed by the protesters themselves and you had a - perhaps a super majority on the Security Council, meaning nine, 10, 11 out of the 15 vote to support, then I would be willing to countenance action even in the face of a veto as we did in Kosovo.",
        "When it comes down to this kind of humanitarian intervention, I think the rules surrounding the veto are more complicated, and there are precedents as in Kosovo for acting even in the face of a veto.",

        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And, Kelly McEvers, it's fair to say that every next step that we've heard - buffer zones, no-fly zones - is seen by the government as the next step toward removing it from power.",
        "It's regime change.",
        "Yes.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And so that's why there's an interest there.",

        "Yes.",
        "You know, I think the regime feels like it's got its back against the wall in that regard, but it's up to now as - is confident in the fact that Russia will stand behind it.",
        "And so I think that's where it's able to sort of exercise, you know, the - sort of the crackdowns that it has and the power that it has in, you know, attacking civilians, attacking civilian neighborhoods and escalating the violence in the way that it has over the weekend.",
        "You know, this - the Syrian regime is very, very aware of its position in the international community and its position in the world.",
        "This is not Libya.",
        "You know, Syria is in the heart of the Arab world.",
        "It is bordered by Iraq, you know, Turkey, Lebanon, places that have had their own problems in the past.",
        "And the Syrian regime is very acutely aware of the fact that the international community does not want a major quagmire.",
        "And so - and that the international community knows that intervention could bring such a quagmire or no intervention could bring such a quagmire.",
        "So they're using this stalemate.",
        "They're using this sort of indecision as a way to go in and take as much control as possible.",

        "Hannah with us from Raleigh, North Carolina.",
        "Hi.",
        "I just wanted to see the idea of removing Bashar Assad and having Farouk Sharaa take over.",
        "I don't think that's going to serve the Syrian people any good because - I mean, as a Syrian myself, I think Bashar Assad is the weakest link in the whole regime.",
        "To leave anybody from that regime is a mistake.",
        "I think the Syrian people has suffered enough - long enough under all of those people, and this kind of solution, I believe, is only to give Bashar Assad a way out without being harmed and keep the same things, you know, not changed in Syria.",
        "So what is the alternative?",
        "I think thousands of us do actually arm the Syrian people and let them get rid of the regime themselves.",
        "Anne-Marie Slaughter, arm the Syrian people, that would presumably be done by various degrees of covert or overt by Turkey.",
        "Well, by Turkey and possibly other countries in the region.",
        "I do want the Syrian people to be able to determine their own fate.",
        "But again, if we can get a political solution, it would be far, far better.",
        "Violence begets violence.",
        "The more killing there is, the more other groups who are affected want to take revenge.",
        "And as we've been talking about the number of people in Syria, the number of minorities who are already worried, who are also Syrian people - the Druze, the Kurds, the Alawites, the Christians.",
        "If you arm the Syrian people, you really could get not only civil war but a kind of anarchy.",
        "So at this point, I think we want to do everything we can to use the kind of pressure, including a legitimate or a credible threat of intervention to bring the parties to the negotiating table.",
        "Hannah, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Appreciate it."

        "The other part, which hadn't been reported before, was the counterintelligence probe into whether Trump was acting on behalf of Russia after firing Comey, making it a national security issue.",

        "Their story basically said that President Trump had actively worked to conceal details about his meetings with Russian president, with Putin.",
        "And so that idea - or Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
        "Right.",
        "And that there were no in-depth records of any of Trump's in-person meetings with Putin, not even classified records.",
        "And Trump and the White House have pushed back against these stories, but not really with detailed specific denials.",
        "And Trump told Fox News in an interview that he wasn't keeping anything under wraps.",
        "I mean, this is all extraordinary.",
        "I mean, we should say, as you said, the White House is pushing back and President Trump has called all of this a hoax.",
        "But just the suggestion that the intelligence agencies are worried that the president of the United States is working with or for another government and hiding what happens in meetings with another foreign leader, this has to be bringing significant reaction.",
        "It is.",
        "And you have Democrats who control the House are saying they are going to investigate.",
        "The House Foreign Affairs Committee is saying they're going to look into Trump's interactions with Putin.",
        "And Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he tweeted that Democrats had tried to subpoena the interpreter who was at one of the meetings with Trump and Putin during the last Congress but Republicans blocked that.",
        "Now, that may be on the table again, and there'll be some disputes over that.",
        "But either way, these types of questions, these types of articles being written and reported about Trump and Russia are going to spur more probes by the House.",
