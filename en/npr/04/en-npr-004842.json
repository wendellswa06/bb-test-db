        "When I arrived in May, there was still a normal life going on and regular protests happening, mostly during the night and during the day whenever there was people who had been killed or taken captive or captured by the regime forces.",
        "The protests ultimately evolved into urban warfare.",
        "How did that happen?",
        "There was an incident where a Free Syrian Army brigade safe house, if you will, was bombed in a civilian neighborhood.",
        "And civilians and Free Syrian Army soldiers were killed and injured in that particular incident.",
        "And soon after that, there was mortar shelling that began on all of Deir al-Zour.",
        "And that's when basically the formal fight between the Free Syrian Army and the Assad regime forces began, because the Free Syrian Army would go out into the streets during the day instead of only at night.",
        "What was life like when people had evacuated the city, and when it was the Syrian army or security forces versus the armed people, the Free Syrian Army - what was it like every day?",

        "So we were eating tuna and sardine and like these (unintelligible) - boxed cheese, cream cheese kind of stuff and stale bread.",
        "And that's kind of with some tomatoes and cucumbers that we got every few days.",
        "Somebody would sneak them in from the rural areas.",

        "And then they make it to the hospital and then at the hospital they can't save this person.",
        "And then you have to, you know, wrap them up in a cloth and take them to the park and bury them.",
        "So the shelling is one thing but to see somebody pass in front of you is a whole 'nother ballgame.",

        "They reported from Deir al-Zour and the reporter described a de facto alliance in the city between the Free Syrian Army and Al-Qaida.",
        "And an Al-Qaida fighter is quoted as saying, \"\"We have clear instructions from our leadership\"\" - meaning the Al-Qaida a leadership - \"\"that if the Free Syrian Army needs our help, we should give it.",
        "How close is Al-Qaida to the Free Syrian Army in Deir al-Zour?",
        "So, I'm kind of hard pressed to really talk about this because I think it's kind of a dead issue, as far as I'm concerned.",
        "Because I was in Deir al-Zour for five months and I know exactly about - I know the details of the situation that you're referring to.",
        "And I know the gentleman that hosted this particular journalist when he came to Deir al-Zour.",
        "And I think that the context within which those words are given out to the public, you know, this Al-Qaida representative is telling this particular journalist that, you know, we're here to help the Free Syrian Army if our leader tells us to help the Free Syrian Army, those are kind of like Hollywood-style statements that are kind of thrown out there.",
        "That's my take on it because, honestly, the people who are working and who are defending the neighborhoods and sacrificing their, you know, their lives for, you know, the freedom that the Syrian people want, are normal every day folks who have been forced to defend themselves with guns.",
        "And it's not Al-Qaida.",
        "And it's not an Al-Qaida leader who is calling the shots either."
