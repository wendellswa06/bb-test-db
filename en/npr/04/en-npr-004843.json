        "Parliament, as I mentioned earlier, David, could move to take control of this process which, up until now, the government's been driving.",

        "Just remind us, what are teachers demanding, and why has there been no breakthrough at all?",
        "Well, there's not been a lot of a breakthrough because there's a really fundamental issue at stake here, and that's how much money the LA Unified School District even has to spend on the demands its teachers are making.",
        "The two sides can't even agree on that.",
        "So right now, the school district has nearly $2 billion in the bank.",

        "I mean, Kyle, that's an extraordinary accusation, to say that the school district is hoarding money and not spending that money to help students.",
        "What is the administration's reaction to that?",
        "Well, the school superintendent Austin Beutner, who leads the school district, does plan to spend some of that reserve on things like teacher raises and other demands.",
        "But he also says the district just cannot afford to spend much more.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "The notion that we are hoarding reserves, the notion that more money exists somewhere else with which to do more, is not accurate.",
        "We're spending all we have in service of our students.",
        "Now, the teachers union just does not buy this.",
        "The district has been making dire projections about its finances for years, all while building up this nearly $2 billion reserve.",
        "And, you know, between things like declining enrollment and things like rising pension costs, the district is still spending more money than it is taking in, and that has regulators concerned about the district's long-term solvency.",
        "So - long way of saying - that is the root cause of this dispute.",
        "If you can't decide how much money there is to spend, it's really hard to figure out what kinds of demands are reasonable."

        "Now, that's a financial issue because having fewer students in classes means the need to pay more teachers.",
