        "So, again, in trying to be safe, if you follow the policy of not taking donors who spent significant amounts of time in the UK and, by the way, in other countries where mad cow disease broke out, we probably have reduced the overall donor pool by about nine to 10 percent.",
        "So we don't have enough blood.",
        "We bumped out a bunch of people.",
        "I'm not saying there's no risk factor of getting mad cow disease in, but in England it hasn't happened.",
        "In laboratories, you don't see the - it's very tough to give a rat mad cow disease by transfusing blood from a rat that has mad cow disease, so it's next to impossible to do it.",
        "So we're erring on the side of safety, but we continue to put ourselves in jeopardy of shortage.",
