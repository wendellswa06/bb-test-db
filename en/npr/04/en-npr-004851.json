        "But even now, as the money filters in, the federal government asks few questions about whether states are complying with the Indian Child Welfare Act.",
        "In fact, a 2005 government audit found at least 32 states are failing, in one way or another, to abide by it.",
        "I think we've got to do better.",
        "And frankly, to the extent to which we can provide some leadership, I'd like to see us do that.",

        "It involved a hide-and-seek game with U.N.",
        "weapons inspectors over whether Iraq retained chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.",
        "And it involved an international propaganda struggle over economic sanctions, which the United Nations imposed, in part to rid Iraq of its prohibited weapons.",
