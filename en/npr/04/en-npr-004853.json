        "People are understanding what we're talking about.",
        "But then Donald Trump comes to Michigan, and he doesn't like what a union worker says to him.",
        "And Donald Trump says, we're not going to build an auto plant in Michigan; we're going to go someplace where we pay lesser wages, and then they'll be so desperate they won't get paid - they won't care what they get paid per hour.",
        "And then they learned that Donald Trump isn't walking his talk and that he's manufacturing his clothes in China.",
        "And the more they learn about him - and they don't like the fact that he's trying to divide them with their brothers and sisters that they work with on the floor on faith.",
        "They - they become skeptical.",
        "So you've got to be talking to them.",
        "People like me have to talk to them - that they know and they trust.",

        "And he's saying the kind of things that, in their gut, they've been waiting so long for somebody to say.",
        "Don's absolutely right.",
        "I have to agree him.",
        "But they haven't seen her.",
        "And once she gets in there and once Tim Kaine comes and they hear - they hear both of them, they're going to know that this is somebody that's going to fight for working men and women."

        "They wanted to know if there was any scientific data proving that the yearly pelvic exam helped detect disease.",
