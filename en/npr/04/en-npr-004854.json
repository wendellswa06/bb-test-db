        "Well, you were saying earlier that the goal of sanctions like this is to change the behavior of the target - the targeted government - getting the oligarchs to complain to Putin so Putin is going to change his behavior.",
        "You know, what evidence is there that this actually works?",
        "So the question is, will these sanctions change behavior, or are they merely punitive?",
        "So the fact is that this is not the first round of sanctions against Russia.",
        "The United States has been sanctioning Russia since 2014 in various ways since Russia was involved in the invasion of Ukraine.",
        "And that hasn't made Russia more benevolent.",
        "If anything, we could argue - some could argue that they've become more aggressive, that they've become angered by the campaign of sanctions the United States has led against them.",
        "So although the sanctions have hurt in some ways the Russian economy, we haven't seen a lot of indications that it will change behavior.",

        "In the meantime, we'll be talking about tomatoes and salmonella.",
        "Yesterday, the FDA admitted that the number of people sickened by salmonella-tainted tomatoes is bigger than they thought.",
        "At least 228 people in 23 states have gotten sick from eating suspect tomatoes, according to the CDC.",
        "That's the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.",
        "It's been nearly two weeks since the tomato-salmonella link first surfaced, and while consumers are cautioned to stay away from certain types of tomatoes, we still don't know the source of the outbreak.",
        "And there's a chance we may never know.",
        "So what's a consumer to do?",
        "The likelihood of you getting sick is pretty small, but statistics don't matter very much if you're headed to the emergency room because you chose the salsa instead of the guacamole.",

        "Well, I was just going to say, there's even reports, I think, even more recently of the tornadoes, but perhaps it will be interesting, or troubling, to see what you wind up going back to.",
        "Well, my thoughts are certainly with the people in Manhattan, and we're getting back there.",
        "Ah, OK.",
        "Well, Dr. Powell we're going to talk about tomatoes and safety, but first, I have to remind callers that they're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "So, this whole question of food safety, I mean, there's, what?",
        "Two hundred and - how many hundred million people in America today eating how many hundreds of - hundreds of millions of tomatoes and 228 got sick, are we a bunch of a nation of nervous nellies?",
        "Well, as you mentioned in your prelude, statistically the risk may seem low, and certainly there are benefits that consuming a diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables.",
        "If you're one of the 228, you're not very happy about this.",
        "And while there's 228 identified, with salmonella, we generally use the fact for about 38 or 40, so that's how many sick people there are, 220 times 40.",
        "So there's thousands of people sick in this thing.",
        "I see.",
        "Is this the kind of contamination that you hear about where they say, well, careful washing of your food and vegetables, or maybe if - you know, if you need to adding a wash of maybe a light acetic acid situation.",
        "Is that going to take care of the problem?",
        "Or is this more serious?",
        "This is a little more challenging.",
        "Fresh fruits and vegetables are good for us, but as we consume them more, it's become apparent that, today, they're probably the biggest source of food-borne illness in the United States.",
        "And the best estimates of that are, you know, up to 30 percent of the population.",
        "Seventy-six million, 80 million people get sick each year.",
        "Fresh fruits and vegetables are the biggest source, and the reason why is because they're fresh.",
        "We don't cook them.",
        "So anything that comes in to contact has the potential to contaminate.",
        "Now, with - there's some particular ones that keep popping up, and tomatoes is one of them.",
        "And with tomatoes, in past outbreaks, anyway, it's been shown that things like salmonella can actually get on the inside.",
        "So washing is of limited effect.",
        "That's important, but it is of limited effect, and this stuff really needs to be controlled on the farm.",

        "Well, he's got Magic Johnson on his side, you know, so he's got some heavy hitters that represent the African-American community.",
        "He also showed up at First AME Church, so he does have support from a lot of African-Americans.",

        "And so he's going to be joined by leaders like Gordon Brown of Britain, Nikolas Sarkozy of France, Angela Merkel of Germany - all there on the last day.",
        "And the idea is to go from the cheerleading model to one in which he could be the element, sort of the catalyst to finalize a deal that would shake the world on climate change.",
