        "So the mammoth actually had to develop changes to its hemoglobin, and this allowed them to keep their extremities very cold for months on end - really, we believe.",
        "And this would dramatically reduce their heat loss and hence their energy requirements, which would be very advantageous for them surviving, you know, winter in the high Arctic.",
        "So you extracted some DNA from fossilized bones of a mammoth, and you managed to use that to resurrect mammoth hemoglobin, which is unbelievable.",
        "How did you then - you then inserted it into E.",
        "coli.",
        "How did that then become hemoglobin?",
        "What we are able to do is just simply get the sequence from the mammoth.",
        "And we also got the sequences from the living elephants.",
        "And then we used a method called site-directed mutagenesis.",
        "And site-directed mutagenesis is simply an ability to change, let's say, a letter A in a DNA strand into a letter C.",
        "So we took the mammoth changes, and we put them into the living elephant DNA, and we put that into the E.",
        "coli.",
        "And then the E.",
        "coli simply followed the recipe and from that we could, you know, take it out.",
        "And it was red, and it bound oxygen and it released oxygen, and it did everything that it would have done had it been inside that mammoth.",
        "It's incredible.",
        "Now, two years ago, scientists at Penn State managed to sequence a part of the mammoth's genome from a clump of hair.",
        "And they suggested at the time that it would take about $10 million to generate a real, live mammoth.",
        "What's your take on that?",
        "What do you think?",
        "What we did with one molecule, one very important molecule, is much like, you know, bringing a mammoth back as an entire baseball season.",
        "You can imagine how many pitches are thrown.",
        "And what we did was the opening day pitch.",
        "One protein to one mammoth is a very, very large step, and there's so many technological hurdles yet to - I would love to see a mammoth but I'm not sure if I will.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, if you ever get close to making a real woolly mammoth, please give us a call because we will come up and visit you.",

        "When you wanted to hear what the rest of us think about President Obama receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, I noticed you interviewed people in some of the reddest states in the country.",
        "Mr. Matthews goes on to say that in Texas, the president is about as popular as the swine flu, but he adds, given the fact that Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck have generated a dangerous level of animosity directed at the president, I think it's important for Americans to know that the rest of the world does not share their belief.",
        "James Lecher(ph) of Lawrence, Kansas, asked why we question the selection at all.",
        "I don't recall anyone stepping forward to say, you know, I think the physics award should have went to someone else or the literature prize should have gone to another person.",
        "As an American, I'm proud that our president won this award, he said, and for all the critics, well, they can take it up with the Swedish Academy and quit polluting the airwaves with their nonsensical whining.",

        "And through all the dynamics of the atmosphere, it actually is what creates the weather that we feel here on the surface.",
        "That's partly because the jet stream contains a lot of energy in the form of heat.",
        "Also its winds - which can reach 200 miles an hour - help move weather systems from west to east across the country.",
        "And Francis says the jet stream acts as a sort of dividing line.",

        "The single ribbon of fast-moving winds has split into two ribbons: one farther north, one farther south.",
        "Nielsen-Gammon, who is the Texas state climatologist, says back in May and June that split led to flooding in the northern Alps and in Alberta, Canada.",
        "The flood conditions took place in between the two jet streams, where weather patterns tended to move relatively slowly because they weren't being carried along by the upper level winds.",
        "And Nielsen-Gammon says during the summer the double jet stream produced a very strange temperature pattern in areas near the Pacific coast.",
        "Southern California was unusually hot and over in Death Valley it even hit 129 degrees.",
        "But Nielsen-Gammon says up in British Columbia the weather stayed unseasonably cool.",
        "And then you go farther north, then again temperatures are warmer than normal.",
        "So that makes Alaska have relatively warm conditions during the summertime compared to what it normally does.",
        "And finally, way up in the Arctic, temperatures were relatively cold again.",
        "Nielsen-Gammon says the double jet stream also played a big role in the Colorado flooding of a couple of weeks ago.",
        "High up in the atmosphere, the jet stream was carrying moist air from the Pacific to the Rockies.",
        "Then, lower down, it had created an unusual eddy that was pulling in more moist air from the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "Finally, Nielsen-Gammon says, an unusual bulge in the jet stream was causing all of this weather to stall right around Boulder.",
        "So when you get all three of those things coming together underneath a jet stream pattern that isn't moving very rapidly, you get lots of rain for lots of days.",

        "It's not clear whether global warming contributed to the recent extreme weather in Colorado.",
        "But Jennifer Francis of Rutgers says it could have, because the Arctic is warming up quickly.",
        "We realize that this rapid warming of the Arctic - which is about two to three times faster than the pace of warming in the rest of the Northern Hemisphere - must have an effect on the jet stream.",
        "That's because it's the temperature difference between the equator and the Arctic that powers the jet stream in the first place.",
        "So if the temperature difference decreases, the jet stream should become weaker.",
        "Francis says her work suggests the result will be that weather systems move more slowly from west to east.",
        "Instead of moving on, they will linger."
