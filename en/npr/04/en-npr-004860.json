        "But mental health experts across the nation said in interviews that while it's critical to recognize the first signs of mental illness, it's just as important that children and their families have health insurance that guarantees them covered treatment.",
        "That problem was addressed, in part, five years ago when then-President George W.",
        "Bush signed a law requiring larger employers to offer mental health coverage that was on par with medical benefits.",
        "But writing the regulations has proved difficult.",
        "There's been disagreement, for example, over a lifetime cap on the number of therapy visits for people with depression.",
        "In the meantime, those with mental illness have languished, their advocates say, under temporary rules that have barred patients from a full range of mental health services.",
        "That's set to change now.",
        "One of the executive actions the president signed yesterday included a vow to issue final rules for the so-called Mental Health Parity Law in February.",
        "We're hoping that a final rule on parity will make it very clear about the scope of services that are offered.",
        "Chuck Ingoglia, of the National Council for Community Behavioral Healthcare, says the rules will apply to nearly every type of insurance - from state Medicaid programs to employer coverage to individual health plans sold under the Affordable Care Act.",
        "Among the so-called essential benefits will be mental health care.",
        "The whole intent of the parity law was that if you need mental health and addiction services, that it should be available to you.",
        "Those rules won't require congressional approval, but much of the president's plan to improve mental health services - and his other proposals to require universal background checks for gun purchases, and to ban certain assault weapons and high-capacity magazines - will hinge on support from a Republican-led Congress that he has long had a contemptuous relationship with.",
        "Still, the NRA and a number of Republicans have said they support addressing the nation's fractured mental health system, and advocates for the mentally ill say they anticipate far less political resistance.",
        "The total package of mental health proposals in the president's plan total some $155 million - million with an M, not billion - and the modest scale, those advocates say, might just be something everyone can agree on.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Sarah Varney.",
        "She's a reporter with our partner Kaiser Health News, which is a non-profit news service."

        "Bush in 2004.",
        "It's a state that Romney in particular would struggle to win without.",

        "Many in the crowd of 15,000 were already registered, so the president urged them to take the next step.",

        "Mr. Obama's message was - what are you waiting for?",
        "But Clayton worries that some voters seem to be choosing their candidate along racial lines, when people should be trying to put the person in the White House who will look out for the nation's best interest.",

        "Nearby, Kirney Daniel(ph) says she was put off by McCain's lack of eye contact with the camera or his opponent.",
