        "While sex crimes have been a terrible, ugly part of reality in the military - just as they are outside the military - what deeply disturbed lawmakers is data showing people in the military were not reporting these crimes, and that these crimes were barely getting prosecuted.",
        "In fact, the Pentagon estimated that last year alone, there were 26,000 sexual assaults, based on confidential surveys.",
        "And other data show only about 3,000 of those cases were actually reported.",
        "And then, out of all those reports, only about 300 cases actually went to trial.",
        "So the heart of what the Senate has been debating is what can be done to more robustly prosecute these crimes and a key problem that many victims have touched upon is that they feared reporting the attacks because they thought their commanders couldn't be impartial."
