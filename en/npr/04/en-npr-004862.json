        "If these outside lawyers are recommending that we go forward based on their independent investigation, are commanders shutting them down?",
        "Are commanders saying we will not go forward?",
        "No one can find me a case where that happened.",
        "So McCaskill has pushed almost 30 other reforms, reforms that Gillibrand supports, like commanders can no longer overturn jury verdicts or anyone convicted of a sexual assault will get a dishonorable discharge or dismissal, also retaliation against a victim would be a crime under military law."
