        "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to London, and to the Games of the...",
        "If Iain Sinclair had his way, the Olympics would not be in London at the moment.",
        "Sinclair is a Londoner, a writer, and probably one of the city's most miserable residents at the moment.",
        "He's frustrated with the traffic, the security precautions, the costs, and architecture he calls ghastly.",
        "Sinclair is best known as a psychogeographer.",
        "A few years ago, for his book \"\"London Orbital,\"\" he walked the entire length of the M25, the 117-mile highway that loops around the city of London.",
        "This time around, Sinclair has trained his sometimes- unforgiving eye on how the city - and in particular, his east London neighborhood - were transformed in the run-up to the Games.",
        "The book is called \"\"Ghost Milk: Recent Adventures Among the Future Ruins of London, on the Eve of the Olympics.\"\" Olympic organizers promised to revitalize a part of London they called a wasteland, but that wasteland is what Iain Sinclair calls home.",
        "The reality is, there was an awful lot there.",
        "There were thousands of people who lived there.",
        "There were communities of various sorts, allotments, gardens, rowing clubs, cycling clubs, football units - all of which have been cleared away to create this rather beautiful, computer-generated image.",
        "We'll see how that goes.",
        "This is my particular vision of a future ruin.",
        "These are the stadiums, and the venues, for some of the different Olympic events you're talking about.",
        "And you sort of imagine walking through them as we walk through, say - I don't know - the Forum in Rome today, or something like that.",
        "Yes because this was my experience, too, when I went to Athens as part of this book.",
        "I was looking at the much more beautiful stadium they had there, and the landscape, the glittering landscape around it, and seeing it more or less abandoned with the economic collapse in Greece.",
        "Wildlife was growing up through the abandoned stadiums.",
        "There were packs of feral dogs.",
        "There were people selling cheap watches, and all of that.",
        "And I spoke to a young Greek architect and said oh, you're not uncomfortable with this.",
        "This was a great moment, and now look at them.",
        "And he said oh, oh, no. No, no. We are a culture of ruins.",
        "We knew they would be ruins.",
        "And we were very happy about it.",
        "They're just a new kind of ruin.",
        "As you know, of course, living in London, the Olympics - this is a huge moment of pride for the British government, for the - for London city officials, for many people in the city and in the country.",
        "And for you, this is just a moment of disaster.",
        "This is a nightmare.",
        "Um - it's a moment of a kind of disaster; or at least a challenge, a big challenge, for the people who are the nearest to it.",
        "The further you step back from it, the easier it is to look on it as a great event.",
        "When you're close, it actually becomes an invaded city.",
        "We have armed helicopter gunships flying overhead, to shoot down any planes that come within.",
        "And where are they going to crash?",
        "We've got surface-to-air missiles put on top of occupied blocks of flats.",
        "We've got more troops in place now, than have been used in the whole of the Afghan campaign."

        "Well, that's the pitch - to revitalize the area - but it isn't actually the truth.",
