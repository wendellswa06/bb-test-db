        "I told them this wasn't true and yet they used it anyway.",
        "This is evidence that - of how the White House manipulated and twisted intelligence in the run up to the war in Iraq.",
        "The prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald said in the trial, the question of who sent Mr. Wilson on his trip is the number one question on the vice president's mind in July of 2003.",
        "What was the evidence that this was the number one question on Dick Cheney's mind?",
        "Well, if there was any major revelation at the trial, it was just how central Vice President Cheney was in the whole White House pushback in the Wilson controversy.",

        "It's Vice President Cheney who tears out the newspaper clipping of Wilson's op-ed and writes, did his wife send him on a junket, thereby putting the junket nepotism charge in play.",
