        "He concluded that, quote, \"\"being an only child is a disease in itself.\"\" Now, let's face it: That's a pretty stunning indictment of an entire group of people who, through no fault of their own, were raised without siblings.",
        "Journalist Lauren Sandler takes on such pernicious stereotypes in her new book \"\"One and Only.\"\" Sandler has sifted through a huge body of research that debunks many of the worst myths about only children.",
        "Even so, she says persistent cultural assumptions about sad and lonely onlys prevent other conversations about the costs and tradeoffs inherent in choosing to have larger families.",

        "And I was stunned by the judgment, and also stunned that when I started looking into the basis for that judgment, the sensibility behind it, you know, just based on erroneous information.",

        "But, you know, this was a moment when my kid was probably - I'd say Dahlia was about two or three, and she was dancing in the supermarket.",
        "And as people do when they see a cute kid dancing, would smile and chat me up and say: So, do you have another one?",

        "No. I'm not planning to right now.",
        "Oh, you wouldn't do that to your child.",
        "And that's true.",
        "And I think, Lauren, you talk about the fact that there can be, in a sense, two only children in one family.",
        "And it's amazing to see those smiles just harden and the notion of my daughter of I as incredibly happy and, you know, me as a very nurturing, joyful mother just changes on a dime when people hear that I actually might not have another child.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you also start the book by talking about your own mother's decision.",
        "Tell us a little bit about what she has told you about why she decided to have an only child.",
        "Well, my mother was very committed to her work and very committed to a certain degree of personal freedom.",

        "And they thought, you know, we have this great life where we can walk out onto the street and buy a really good cookie and see street theater.",
        "And she could devote herself to work that meant a lot to her, and they could travel.",
        "And it felt like a tradeoff that wasn't quite worth it to them.",
        "And, you know, it was an era in the '70s when feminism was potent and part of the culture, and environmentalism was potent and part of the culture.",
        "And those twin movements really pushed a conversation about how many children we would have, what motherhood should look like, what the planet was reconciling."

        "And because of that, I think that it was actually a little easier to make this choice in the '70s than it even is today, all these years later.",
        "Well, what was interesting about that little section is one got the sense, just a little glimpse of the fact that perhaps your father wasn't entirely sure about the decision, or it was a little harder for him.",
        "That's true, and I actually didn't know that until I spoke to him in a conversation that begins my book.",
        "But I think that the issue is that, you know, the issue in the having-it-all conversation, so to speak, is not an issue of never compromising.",
        "It's an issue of which compromises we will make.",
        "And so for my father, the compromise was to say, OK, I will support this, and I'll be really happy with my family.",
        "And he was, just as I think a lot of parents right now are saying: We are stretched so thin between working more than ever and parenting more than ever and the economy, you know, in the tank here.",
        "And so what are we going to compromise?",
        "Because you can't both have one child who you devote all your resources to, and more children who can offer sibling competition and companionship and time left over for oneself.",
        "So those, you know, they tend to be three different lives there.",
        "And we have to do the best we can by making choices, I think, that make us happy people, to make us happy parents, and therefore good parents.",
        "So when it came time for you to begin having a family, did you know right from the start, I really only want one?",
        "Or did that - is that something that came on you and your husband gradually?",
        "I mean, how did you arrive at that decision?",
        "Well, I think of children as, you know, something that happens one at a time.",
        "I, you know, I think that because I'm an only child myself, it's normal to me, and it didn't feel like such a huge jump to make that choice.",
        "So we started with one, and then we saw where we were at, and where we were at was a very, very happy place.",
        "And that's where we continue to be.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And is that something that could change?",
        "Or, I mean, I don't mean to say, are you going to have another one?",

        "And I really do believe that for the three of us, this is a really great way of living.",
        "That said, you know, I'm 38.",

        "I was stunned by how much material has existed on this topic for decades and decades - I mean, hundreds of studies.",
        "So I combed through that material, but then I also traveled the world interviewing only children and parents of only children and demographers and environmental scientists and various people who could help illuminate the complexities of this conversation because, you know, the data tells us one thing, which is that only children are really no different than anyone else.",
        "You know, we tend to have higher achievement, higher intelligence - I know that sounds like a very only child thing to say, but it does bear out in the numbers.",
        "But we also have a different experience, and that experience is something which you really need to connect with people to understand, because it's totally different for a kid who lives in a rural place where there aren't a lot of other children around or, you know, someone who has happily married parents.",
        "I mean, it's a different dynamic for everyone.",
        "The thing is that if you're an only child, that tends to be a bit of a totalizing narrative.",
        "It tends to be the story that either other people use or you use yourself to explain various things about you.",
        "If you feel lonely, it's because you're an only child, even though everyone is lonely in the world.",
        "And if you're a big success, it's because you're an only child.",
        "Exactly.",
