        "And he's 17 now.",
        "And then when he was 16, we decided to have one more.",
        "So I think of them as two only children, because by the time my stepson moves out, my baby won't even remember ever living with him.",
        "Oh, sure.",
        "I mean, defining what an only child is - today especially - is so difficult when there are so many blended families, and there could be so many different factors that go into people's fertility choices, and the timing of all of that.",
        "It's interesting, in the data, looking at personality traits, if you have lived alone in a house with your parents for seven years as a kid, then you're technically an only child.",
        "But I do think that, often, for people who have step relationships or that sort of distance, they tend to get the best of both worlds in that they have all of that devotion and attention that only children get, and then they also have another family member, which can be a beautiful thing.",
        "And Amanda, I gather you come from a big family?",
        "Is that right?",
        "Yes.",

        "I didn't think of it as being selfish.",
        "I thought of it more as being able to focus on what he needs.",
        "And when he actually reached a point that he was more self-sufficient, around 16, suddenly my husband and I looked at each other and thought: Do we want to be done?",
        "And that's how we decided to have a baby.",
        "All right.",

        "Think about horror films - \"\"The Shining,\"\" \"\"The Exorcist\"\" and \"\"Friday the 13th.\"\" They all hinge on only children.",
        "So, too, do many superhero stories.",
        "The heroes are often only children: Superman, Spiderman, Batman and Iron Man.",

        "Give us a call at 800-989-8255.",

        "Well, I think that there's the concern that only children are lonely children.",
        "And I think that when parents consider having a second child as a gift to their first, that is probably the thing that they are most often concerned about, which I understand.",
        "I think that we have a very visceral response to seeing a child alone in a sandbox.",
        "But it was interesting, speaking to psychologists about the experience of loneliness for only children, a lot of them believe that we have the strongest primary relationship with ourselves, which is incredible armor against loneliness; that for a lot of only children, being alone is the experience of solitude, which is a very rich thing, instead of loneliness, which is a very painful thing.",
        "And so that's something that I think we tend to get wrong.",
        "You know, when studies have been done about how many friends kids tend to have, only children have as many friends as anyone else.",
        "And I know that for a lot of us, you know, for me I spent a lot of time reading.",
        "And that may seem kind of nerdy and sad, but honestly I loved it.",
        "I loved having time to read and then also having time with friends.",
        "So that's one of the issues.",
        "Another one is, of course, spoiling.",
        "But, you know, my feeling about that is only children don't spoil themselves.",
        "Parents spoil kids.",
        "And you can spoil two kids or three kids as much as you can spoil one.",
        "And part of the issue of having the totality of what it means to parent an only child, our conversation is just that you shouldn't do it and not let's have a mindful discussion about how to do it.",
        "And yeah, you have to be careful about some of these things, but I think that we have to be careful about all aspects of parenting.",
        "See, you can tell you don't have a sibling because anybody with a brother or sister would say no, my brother or my sister or the two of them, they're the spoiled ones, I'm not, I didn't get spoiled, they did.",

        "But anyway, you do also point out that, you know, because onlys lack sibling relationships, they actually tend to sort of seek out really strong relationships and make a lot of close friends outside of the family and that in fact they're sort of choosing a different kind of family.",
        "And I've seen that with a lot of people I know who are only children.",
        "They seem to be people who - I mean, I have one very close friend who's an only child who was very attached to my family but has very strong relationships with so many people.",

        "And the whole time through it, I had these amazing friends that were supportive of both me and my mother and my new family, but I really wanted that sibling.",
        "And I think that we need to look at the pressures because it's great when they're under 10, you know, you can take them anywhere.",
        "Resources, money, time, energy can be devoted to this child.",
        "Of course they're going to be smarter with that, you know.",

        "In college what happens?",

        "And there are beautiful things about that, and there are aspects of that that can be a little tough.",

        "What's your take on that, Lauren?",
