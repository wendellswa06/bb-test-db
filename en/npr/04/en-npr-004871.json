        "These are terrible situations.",

        "And I understand people being pulled by that impulse.",
        "It was interesting, in my research I found that it actually tends to be easier on only children because their parents don't play the same games with them as they tend to with two children.",
        "And also it tends to be so much easier on parents that they get through that cycle in an easier, more loving way.",
        "And so I think that we can imagine how things would be, but we also tend to idealize how things would be when we imagine it.",
        "And that is just simply hard to know.",

        "I was not ostracized.",
        "I have tons of friends, well adjusted.",
        "But I - and I wanted to have one child, and I got a two-for-one.",
        "I have twin boys.",
        "So sometimes it is hard to relate, having not grown up with siblings.",
        "You know, is this normal sibling behavior?",
        "Is this how siblings interact?",
        "Is this OK?",
        "My husband has a huge age gap with his siblings, so he's almost like an only child in that way, but I'll ask him.",
        "So I just wanted to point that out.",
        "But the last few comments, you know, would it be better to have a sibling?",

        "Then does it really matter?",
        "So, you know, the grass is always greener, right?",
        "Right.",
        "I never regret - I never regretted my parents' choice to have me as an only child.",
        "They did divorce.",
        "It probably was easy, because it was just me, but I don't see a problem with it.",
        "And I have had adult friends ask, you know, questions about being an only child that just kind of floored me, that, really?",
        "I hadn't even thought about some of the things that people with siblings ask you.",

        "And, you know, Nicole brings up an interesting point, which I think you make in the book, which is - and you said earlier, too - that part of the problem is the only child becomes just a stereotype in itself, and so people make judgments through that prism about your life.",
        "Whereas, you know, when siblings don't get along or, you know, one sibling turns bad and one wins the Nobel Prize, it's not attributed to the fact that they came from, you know, a family with more than one child.",
        "Yet that is always the reason for why a - an only child succeeds or doesn't, and I think that Nicole made that point yet again.",

        "And she would take me to parks and church.",
        "She tried to teach me how to box, and she considered me her little man.",

        "My mother was very clean, and so I didn't grow up with any problems with alcohol.",
        "And I read a book, \"\"Alone,\"\" by Richard E.",

        "There was one story where a friend of yours, who was an only child and said that she had been lonely as an only child, she finally said to you - and you said, but, really, you know, the research shows that's not the case.",

        "I mean, you can present as much data as possible, and yet as someone understands their own lives, they're going to understand their life in that way.",
        "And I think that that's a real theme which has come out amongst all of these callers, that, you know, in very unhappy families, it feels like that was made so much more unhappy by not having something else, or in very happy families, it was made so much more happy by the circumstance that it was."
