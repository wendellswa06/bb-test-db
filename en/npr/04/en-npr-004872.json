        "What happened then?",
        "Well, what happened was - I should back up and say that at the time that I wrote \"\"Not a Genuine Black Man,\"\" the book and the play, I decided that in order for it to be real and to be true and to be what I wanted it to be, I'd have to be completely naked.",
        "And that being the case, I knew that I would have to talk about the darkest moment in my life, which was a very severe period of depression I went through in 1999.",

        "And had a neighbor not heard the music playing - I had a CD playing in the stereo - and had a neighbor not heard it and thought that that was kind of odd and, you know, called the police to come and investigate, I wouldn't be here.",
        "We're going to actually ask you to stay with us over a short break, but just very quickly, what was the first thing you thought when you knew that you were going to live and not die?",
        "I - you know, I was disoriented, really, and I wasn't sure that I was alive.",
        "The first thing I thought was - the first thing, and I write this in the book, and it's funny, but it's the truth.",
