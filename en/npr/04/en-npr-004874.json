        "So this was, in essence, a terrorist investigation.",

        "Boring.",

        "I read about 50 books while I was there.",
        "I had an opportunity to see first-hand how people end up ensnared in the justice system, and learned a lot about how due process and the right to a fair trial really doesn't exist anymore, especially in a federal context.",
        "But then, at the same time, it was really isolating and you can never really get any privacy.",
        "There's always someone around your cell, the people in the day room and it's usually noisy.",
        "And so I started to develop a bit of an (Unintelligible) towards the end of it.",

        "And I'm just wondering what - and I should say that I come from being a content provider, I own a commercial and film and video production company.",
        "So this is an issue that we grapple with routinely when it comes to information that we would think should be publicly available or publicly give out to shoot and capture.",
        "But I just wondered to what extent do you think that protection should go to someone who is in an established, trusted news organization versus some guy who may or may not be capturing something staged.",
        "I mean, if I might interject between the three of us and, of course, people listening, I can see a loophole, could you conceivably have people perpetrating the crime bring someone along to videotape it?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And then cling to what they say are their First Amendment protections because I don't know they intend to provide it to a blog that shows crime scenes or something like that later on?"

        "So, Mr. Wolf, if you could address the first question, I think, Robert posed.",
        "The issue of what entity should be protected and what shouldn't, how you balance that.",
        "Well, in situations where there is already is an established protection, say a doctor, a priest, a lawyer, the judge will utilize a balancing test between the importance of this privilege with the importance of the evidence and finely tailor what they actually obtained to submit to government investigations and what's admitted into evidence.",
        "I'd say that a base point to consider would be to establish a similar balancing test for the journalist's privilege, which we currently don't have in the federal government.",
        "There are states, I forget the exact number of states, that have what are called shield laws.",
        "But the federal government doesn't have that law.",

        "I mean aside from the boredom and the hassle of being in jail, standing on principle.",

        "Yeah, it's a delicate matter, John.",
        "Basically, my feeling when I went into this, and I still hold the same feeling, is that the fight for the tape was worthy having.",
        "But that was the sort of battle that once you lose that battle, there's nothing being revealed on the tape.",
        "The tape has no content to it.",
        "So that was a battle that was worth walking away from once I'd lost it, once I had exhausted my appeals and wasn't legally protected.",

        "And then those people are, in turn, called in.",
        "And it essentially looks like a 1950s McCarthyist witch-hunt.",
        "So as far as standing for the principle, the point that I was able to secure the public release of the tape, there was no point in staying in jail other than for the sake of being a martyr.",

        "But if you were to actually film him in the act of burning down the building and the prosecuting attorney wanted that film for evidence on his trial, I don't see how you could in good conscience withhold that as evidence.",
        "Well, if you didn't film the pyrotechnic burning down the building and you were just filming something else at that period of time and you offered to allow the judge to see that you didn't capture this incident, which is exactly what we did, then it seems to me that it's reasonable to ask the judge to make that determination whether or not there is an evidentiary value or not.",

        "Most citizens, if they have something that could possibly be used as evidence in a criminal trial or evidence to exonerate someone of criminal charges, don't have the option of invoking the First Amendment.",

        "In fact, I'm disinclined to think that the government should be able to coerce people who don't want to testify, who are not involved in the actual crimes to testify.",
        "We have the Fifth Amendment to protect those involved.",
        "But we have no protections to protect those who just don't want to be involved.",
