        "One of the major issues in this campaign has been foreign policy and the mess in the Middle East.",
        "And so it's certainly a fair question to ask all of the candidates - what's your response, you know, what - it's an opportunity for them to show their knowledge base, to show what they would do in a crisis situation like this.",
        "And I'm actually pretty surprised since Giuliani has positioned himself as being the man to protect this country during the war on terror, that he would take a pass on this.",
        "Giuliani is one of the candidates, I think, that you would think could benefit along with John McCain, along with Hillary Clinton, folks who have had - and Joe Biden - people who have had some international experience and who can step forward and say something concrete rather than just a sympathy note.",
        "But, Farai, I would disagree with that because Rudy Giuliani doesn't have international experience.",
        "First off, if you analyzed what happened yesterday, he was the first candidate out of the box with a statement.",

        "Technology, in many ways, has made people at least feel safer in the case of computer programming, finding new ways, like police departments finding new ways to determine where the hotspots are - determine where the crime patterns are, allows them to put more resources into places where the crime is happening.",
        "But of course, that might be some of the areas that are in the process of gentrifying right now.",
        "I think, though, the major culprit that will not go away when it comes to urban crime until something serious is done about it, is guns and the availability of guns, and the level of opportunity that young people and criminals have in terms of access to guns.",
        "I've been really disappointed that this has not been a major campaign issue in the presidential campaign, I'm not surprised because it's an urban issue, and right now, the candidates want to stay away from that.",
        "But I think until you deal with the gun crisis in these cities, this is just going to be a blip on the radar.",
        "Roland, what do you think is behind the crime stats?",
        "I mean, I guess, shouldn't we just be happy?",
        "Maybe not question too much, but if we are going to question, what's behind it.",
        "No.",
        "I think you got to question because you have to find out what actually worked, I mean, what was it.",
        "Remember, early in the year, you had a significant issue going on between the fights between black and Hispanic gangs.",
        "Then, you saw a significant outreach from community leaders to address this issue.",
        "And so, as long as people assume that the problem with homicide is a police issue, then I think you're going to continue the problem.",
        "It really is a three-prong issue.",
        "It is a police issue in terms of how do you combat it.",
        "But then, you also - it's a matter of community leaders getting involved, but also economics, because if you do not have alternatives - meaning jobs - then you're going to continue to see, you know, the sort of drug crisis you see.",
        "We hear all the time in Chicago as well in terms of how do you combat what's going on in terms of the people who are behind the murders.",
        "And so, again, I think the city owning up to the black-Hispanic struggles in terms of these gangs, that was decisive because they had to get a handle of it while the city was spiraling out of control.",
