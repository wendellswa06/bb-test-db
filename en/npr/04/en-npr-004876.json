        "But I think it - your question is a good one in the sense that you have to have a personal reason for getting into a reasonably esoteric subject matter.",

        "I remember taking what I think was my first IQ test in the sixth grade.",
        "And it was - whether or not I would get into a gifted and talented education program out here in Santa Barbara in California.",
        "And I remember details of it.",
        "I remember my mother dropping me off and walking up the path to a little room where there was a psychologist with a large drooping moustache and a big black phone on his desk.",
        "And he asked me a bunch of very strange questions that made me feel uncomfortable, like who was Charles Darwin?",
        "And he even had me playing with children's blocks and things like that and making pictures.",
        "And I think my - I ended up doing quite well in it.",
        "I don't know what my score was, but I got into that gifted and talented program.",
        "But nevertheless, the experience was one of a negative one for me as I think it was for other people.",
        "I think many of us have a fear of negative scrutiny and an anxiety that attaches to these exams.",
        "Do you think that is the place that most people have been tested, if we've been tested at all, is in some sort of admission's process in school?",
        "I think that's exactly right.",
        "And they often happen far earlier than we remember.",
        "They're used by private schools in admissions and at a really early age - 3 and 4.",
        "And this is still happening to get into the more competitive, elite schools.",
        "In the public schools, they're still sorting their kids by use of IQ tests.",
        "You get in the gifted programs through them, put in a middle class, or put in remedial class.",
        "But they're used in many, many other places.",
        "They are used by employers, by the military, in courts of law and in medicine.",
        "Well, you know, when we first started talking about doing this show, one of my first thoughts was, well, who even uses IQ as a standard any more?",
        "But then, I have children applying to private school, and they took this WPPSI test, which you cover in the first chapter of your book, which is, by and large, an IQ test.",
        "What can you - I mean, little kids.",
        "How can you possibly tell something valuable about a child that small from a test?",
        "Well, I'm not sure that you can.",
        "And the WPPSI is the standard test for kids at around the age of 3 and 4, and again, it's used in admissions to private school.",
        "And it does put a lot of pressure, not just on the kids, but on the parents as well.",
        "It produces a lot of anxiety.",
        "And the main problem with the WPPSI and other tests, really - but especially the WPPSI - is that it's not predictive, especially at such a young age.",
        "So really, IQ tests are being used at the time that they shouldn't be, I think.",
        "And that's because IQ tests don't settle, really.",
        "Your scores go all over the place until about the age of 16.",
        "And really, in that context, it's interesting - I interviewed a psychologist in Washington, D.C., where a lot of these tests are being used for these fancy, elite private schools in the area.",
        "And she said to me essentially, no, these tests are used to weed out 90 percent or so of the applicants of these schools.",
        "They simply have too many people applying to them.",
        "And these institutions need a way of saying, right, we're not going to look at nine or ten kids in this way.",
        "And they believe that the IQ test is one standard form - standard metric in which to say, we're doing this fairly, but we're really going to - we're not going to look at that 90 percent."

        "And I think it raises a good point, and that is really we should be worrying more about the false negatives than any false positives.",
        "I suppose we know people in college and elsewhere who scored extremely well in exams, but were lazy or whatever else they were, and didn't do much with their lives.",
        "And, you know, that would be a false positive.",
        "But it's the false negatives that concern me and I think other people the most.",

        "And historically, at times when the Army has let people in who've scored the equivalent of below an 80 on an IQ test, the Army has been rendered less efficient, so the troops don't follow orders as well, they can't figure out complex machinery like tanks or read maps.",
        "So, it's not that I think these tests measure nothing, it's that I think that's there's a real danger in saying that we can bore down into your core and measure this innate singular ability.",

        "I use it as part of a generalized test battery along with personality tests, and I also do reevaluations for a local school for their special education program.",
        "The thing you have to consider - there are two aspects, one is an IQ is just a number that summarizes various components of the test, and by itself, it's not very helpful.",
        "It also is seen as a range.",
        "So that 109, well, really if you look at the test, the test statistics, maybe that 109 really is a range from 100 to a hundred, you know, fifteen or something.",
        "So, almost nobody just will give one figure like that.",
        "And it's the subtests that really make the test so helpful.",

        "But by looking at the subtests and seeing what their profile is, you can see, well, you know, this kid is going to have a pretty tough time with math but, you know, he'd feel really great in something that requires a different kind of verbal ability or so on.",
        "So, I really think that you don't want to, kind of, throw the baby out with a bath water because I found it to be extremely helpful over the years in a number of different settings.",

        "Stephen Murdoch?",
        "Well, I think Steve raised some good issues, and he might be surprised to hear that I agree with him.",

        "And I think it's okay to use IQ tests in that context, but as he points out, a global number doesn't help you much.",
        "There are other tests that I would imagine he uses that are more helpful, like test of achievement and cognitive processing and things like that.",
        "And - so, I'm not - I don't think they should really be using it in that context, but it's more when the children are being sorted that in Steve's context that I'm worried about.",
