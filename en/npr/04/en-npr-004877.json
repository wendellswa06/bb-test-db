        "And what he wanted to do was find out who is innately and genetically worthy for breeding before it was too late.",
        "I mean, if you had to wait until Einstein was 50 or so when he had revolutionized physics, you are too late.",
        "You wanted to find out who Einstein was at age 18 and then promote those race - smart people to have children and then discourage, of course, rather negatively, the people who shouldn't be having children.",
        "And that idea crossed over into America in a lot of interesting ways.",
        "So we had American psychologists and doctors on Ellis Island trying to screen out the feeble-minded in the 1910s, people who they thought were genetically inferior.",
        "And they developed a lot of test questions there.",
        "They were doing it to prepare the Army, U.S.",

        "So that sort of basic eugenic idea that they're boring to the core of us and can narrow us down to one number really has remained certainly in the first half of the 20th century, but in ways even today for those of us who think that IQ tests really measure our innate core.",

        "Mr. Murdoch, I'd like for you, if you would, to discuss the correlation between IQ - the numbers so to speak - with school-age children as it relates to race, and particularly given that a lot of inner city children do not develop the vocabulary necessary early on to do well on these tests.",
        "And if you could just speak more on that, that would be great.",
        "Thank you guys so much for this subject.",
        "And thank you for your work.",

        "Kevin, thanks for the question.",
        "And this is a sort of classic American question.",
        "We are obsessed, of course, with race for obvious historical reasons, and it's one that can make people pretty uncomfortable.",
        "The basic historical thing that's going on with IQ test and race, and essentially, what I mean by that is average white score versus average African-American score.",
        "There has been 15 points spread over the past 90 years, with white scoring on average, 15 points higher than African-Americans.",
        "And what Kevin was alluding to is, of course, a lot of IQ tests are about language, the ability to speak.",
        "They test vocabulary.",
        "Even their mathematic questions often involve words.",
        "And so, people think that you're testing things indirectly like environment and how many words are used at home and in school and in different socio-economic situations.",
        "So really with this 15 points spread, you either believe that IQ tests measure this innate ability and that there are differences genetically between blacks and whites, or you think that there's something environmentally going on.",
        "And the environment, on average, is different from blacks and whites.",

        "I was so relieved.",
        "It fit with my performance level.",
        "I was a good student, but not a genius.",
        "I figured out that my childhood score had been the result of being isolated in the country with my mother who didn't know how to play with me but really knew how to teach me things.",

        "If so, doesn't this call into question the validity of the exam and the concept itself?",
        "It's a good question.",
        "For - throughout the past hundred years, test creators and test companies have claimed that this tests an innate ability that cannot be trained for.",
        "I mean, the classic example of that are the SATs with ETS saying that you couldn't train for it.",

        "And it's not really taking into context.",
        "The flipside of that is I've also been in the situation where a child needs a psychiatric hospitalization, long-term, and because of their IQ being kind of in the low end, then they're not accepted into a psychiatric hospital for children.",
        "So there are some children who fall within that 65 to 75 range that sometimes services are being denied and people who work in the community and let us say also the families and the children are kind of stuck in the middle trying to figure out, okay, how do we get services for this child, how do we get this child to flourish.",
        "And that's really difficult when people are just looking at that one number.",
        "And in New York, George, is there a number requirement or is it just sort of part of the decision-making process?",
        "For OMRDD, Office of Mental Retardation services, the number is 70.",
        "For intensive case management services, in my case for example, I can take anybody with an IQ of 75.",
        "Now, honestly, we don't always look at that when we take a case.",
        "So sometimes I'll take a case and the child ends up having a lower IQ but because I've already accepted them, we don't close the services.",
        "The problem is getting them into new services that might be long-term just because of that one number.",
        "George, thanks for your call.",
