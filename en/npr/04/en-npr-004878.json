        "Thank you for your call.",
        "Do you think, Stephen Murdoch, that in the Internet age, when you can take a test online that more people actually know their score?",
        "It used to sort of be something that was kept from you, or if you'd taken a test, you didn't even know it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I do think if you go online, you Google IQ, it's amazing the number of exams that come up.",

        "They want to give them the 15 bucks or the 30 bucks and, you know, surprisingly enough, you take that test and you end up in the top two percent, and then you send them a check for 30 bucks.",
        "But I was really saddened just to hear those callers right now.",
        "I think it's exactly what we should all be concerned about, are these false negative, these very capable, bright people who are scoring low, at least initially on the IQ test.",
        "And what's good about it is that over the past 25 years or so, psychologists, some of them, have started to move away from this basic model.",
        "And I'm thinking about, of course, Howard Gardner at Harvard.",
        "And - sorry, go ahead.",
        "No, go ahead.",
        "Tell me about this model.",
        "Well, what's interesting about it is it's actually going to a sort of pre-IQ model, where in the 19th century, people thought of intelligence as far more nebulous and a broader idea.",
        "When the IQ guys came along, that became far more narrow.",
        "It was this sort of set of discrete, almost trivia-like questions.",
        "And Howard Gardner and other people as well have sort of wrestled control of that idea and made intelligence far more multifaceted and flexible.",
        "So Howard Gardner in the early '80s came up with his idea of multiple intelligences and said, look, it's not just this sort of linguistic mathematical ability.",
        "There's musical intelligence.",
        "There's physical intelligence.",
        "There are all these other things that educators in particular can understand.",
        "So after doing all these research, did you come down to think that you actually can measure intelligence in some way, that it's a quality that can be quantified?",
        "Well, it's an interesting question.",
        "Look, I think the basic reality - this is what I think.",
        "I think that Albert Einstein in some basic, innate, genetic level probably was a better physicist than your average bartender.",
        "It's not that I think that we're all created equal, and it's just that our experiences make us different.",
        "No, the question is do you have a test where Einstein is 18 and you can sum up his abilities?",
        "We're nowhere near that right now and the problem is the proclamations from psychology that we've got them.",
        "But someday in the future, yeah, I think we'll move closer to it."
