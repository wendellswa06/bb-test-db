        "I still want to have that foot in the independent world, east coast independent world.",
        "And you cast yourself as a writer.",
        "Quite a stretch.",

        "Right.",
        "Yeah, the idea of playing this guy, you know, who's a struggling writer, was just very, very poignant to me and very connected.",
        "There's something, you know - you write for a reason or you direct a group of actors for an artistic reason.",
        "And this particular character, kind of the plight of him - of him not, you know, not realizing that he's writing something that has important consequences is a poignant kind of thing.",
        "Cause we as writers, we don't have a chance for somebody to come in and tell you that, you know, what you're writing is valuable.",
        "Or you know, you just sit there in kind of an abyss of insecurity, and it's a poignant struggle.",
        "And I think everybody - every time a writer sees another writer in art, they're like, whoa, I feel so much about that guy.",
        "Hm.",

        "Why did you decide, though - you've been in cameos, Hitchcockian cameos in all of your previous films - why'd you give yourself such a much bigger part?"

        "Well, actually, that's kind of the perception what you just said, and it's not actually the reality.",
        "The reality is I've done seven movies.",
        "The first one was actually in India and I was kind of the lead in that movie.",
        "And it was an independent movie made for nothing.",
        "And kind of straight, you know, the straight, independent thing where you write, direct and act.",
        "And it's always - all three of those always interest me.",
        "And then in the second movie, Wide Awake, I wasn't in it at all.",
        "And in the third one, which was Sixth Sense, I had a little bit of a part in there, a small part.",
        "And then in Signs, I had a pretty decent supporting part there with Mel, and it was very rewarding to kind of contribute to the movie in an emotional way.",
        "That's my preference.",
        "I don't, you know, the whole cameo thing, like you just said, is the only thing that we have as a kind of - what's the word - clothes that have been worn before.",
        "And so the assumption is oh, that's what you're doing, you're doing the Hitchcock thing.",
        "Right.",
        "But that's not what I'm doing.",
        "And I don't do the Woody Allen thing either.",
        "There's just, you know - occasionally, if the part that I'm writing really speaks to me, I'll play it, you know.",
        "In The Village, there wasn't an appropriate place for me in all those white people, so I chose to bow out of that one.",
        "But you know, case-by-case, if it speaks to me, that kind of thing.",
        "I can't do more than a supporting part because I'm not able to do the directing and the writing with the proper focus.",
        "Let me ask you, though, about the character of the film.",
        "That clip we played at the beginning makes it sound like, you know, another spooky thriller - and to some degree it is - but this film is a departure, at least from the four films of yours that we've seen.",
        "Yes again, you know, it's tricky for me because, you know, I -you know, the things that you asked me are the general belief systems, that I've made four films that are alike.",
        "But in reality, you know, Unbreakable, you know, I'm not sure how that fits into the group of - if you wanted to say that they're all scary movies - because Unbreakable's not really a scary movie.",
        "And for me, The Village is kind of a drama.",
        "That's kind of covered with this lie, this very dark lie that's going on.",
        "And Lady for me is, you know, in the vein of kind of like a thriller/fantasy kind of thing.",
        "Because I guess I need -the genre for me is that I'm usually doing differently, is fantasy.",
        "And Signs, it was kind of sci-fi, and then obviously Unbreakable it was, you know, comic books, and in Sixth Sense it was the horror genre.",
        "And so each of the - again taking a B-genre and then bringing it in to kind of a more modern world is kind of, you know, I like that."

        "And so in Lady, there's a lot - there's definitely a lot of humor in it with Paul, Paul Giamatti, and also….",
