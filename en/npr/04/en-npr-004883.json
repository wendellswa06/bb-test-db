        "And I was fascinated by a statistic that you list in your book, that the numbers of people in nursing homes is actually fairly small.",
        "You admit that there are probably just as many people having the same kinds of problems in their own homes, but nevertheless this is not an inevitable prospect for most Americans.",
        "Well, one - well, not one - but the most important factor that determines whether someone can live at home or has to be in a nursing home is not any named disease but simply physical frailty, that the muscular skeletal system has so deteriorated that people can't get around in their own homes.",
        "And the most interesting thing about that is that it's changeable.",
        "And geriatricians love to do this experiment over and over again of taking people in their mid-eighties and subjecting them to a program of vigorous weight training, and the result is always the same: Within six weeks, an 85-year-old can double his or her strength and make themselves independent.",
        "Vigorous exercise is one of the three lynchpins that you suggest as part of your prescription for aging well.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The other two are equally important, but nothing avails if you haven't kept your musculoskeletal system in some kind of shape so that you can get around and do the things that are interesting and be with the kinds of people that you would like to be spending time with because it's so emotionally and spiritually valuable to you.",
        "And spending time with those people, that's another part of the triad.",
        "There it is.",
        "In the book I tell the story of having one of my many (unintelligible) sessions with the chief of geriatrics at Yale and talking about musculoskeletal performance and how I go to the gym three times a week and pump iron.",
        "He said, yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know that's not the Holy Grail.",
        "The Holy Grail is interrelationships with other people whom you value, being needed in the lives of other people.",
        "The way I like to put it is looking into the eyes of someone else and seeing yourself reflected there as a person of value.",
        "I remember listening to you talk with Robert Siegel the other day on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "The formula was, if it's a choice between going to the gym or playing with your grandchildren, go see the grandkids.",
        "I'm all for that.",
        "And if you don't have grandchildren, my God, there are friends, there are community groups we can belong to.",
        "And the significant factor is being part of something, being part of something that in some sense depends on your being there, being needed, having that sense that one or other people really depend on you for something.",
        "Let's see if we can get some listeners in on this conversation.",

        "And it got me to thinking about my own arthritis in my spine.",
        "And I thought if I can eat well and practice yoga and get the muscular structure correct, can I correct the arthritic changes in my spine?",

        "Well, I don't know if you can correct the boney changes, but I'll tell you what you can correct.",
        "You can correct the muscular changes that are secondary to splinting in one form or another to save your bones.",
        "One of the interesting experiences that I had personally was after I started going to the gym about eight years ago.",
        "Somewhere about year two I began to notice that all those little cricks in my neck and in my back had virtually disappeared.",
        "And there are a lot of reasons for that, but the most important reason is that we can increase our strength very easily just by these resistance exercises.",
        "And it isn't so much increasing the amount of muscle as it is increasing the neurological coordination of all of those fibers so they work better together and they're much less likely to put undue stress on the bones and cause the kinds of difficulties in the spine, for example, or shoulders that elderly people are more likely to have.",
        "Gary, I have to ask you, is there a lot of work for horseshoers in Berkeley?",
        "You know, it's a question everyone asks, and most of the work is in Contra Costa County.",
        "And frankly, there are more horses in Contra Costa than there are people.",

        "It keeps your mind alert.",
        "It's certainly not an easy thing to do.",
        "Public speaking is one of the most fearful things a person can do, but it's energizing.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, it's implicit between the lines of the book, Neal.",
        "I love the notion of moderation, because, as you know, I put about seven or eight profiles of people who have, well, the term is successfully aged.",
        "And one of them is Michael DeBakey, the great cardiac surgeon, who used the term to draw in one's horizons.",
        "To try to look at the things that you get the most emotional reward out of, the things that you've always wanted to do but you've frittered your energies away in different directions, things that you might be best at, for example, and this is essentially moderation.",
        "The Greeks used that wonderful term the golden mean, and we've got to be so careful about that now as far as energizing is concerned.",
        "This is another DeBakey notion, his notion of looking forward to something that will be interesting to you.",

        "How old would we feel if we didn't know how old we are?",
        "Age has this way of slowly creeping up on us, and most people don't realize they're becoming what's called elderly until - well, in my case, a student said, Dr. Nuland, do you use e-mail?",

        "And you get a little older, you get into your fifties and your sixties and you start thinking about all the things I've wanted to do that now I can do, instead of being a lawyer or an engineer or a schoolteacher or whatever, and I can express much more of what's in my personality and seek out new ways of doing that.",
        "You also point out that we should also act our age, and maybe if one of the goals was to play second base for the New York Yankees, you might want to put that goal aside.",
