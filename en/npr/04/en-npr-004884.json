        "And if he gets $100 million, why, he'll have us living 5,000 years, and during that time there'll be more research so it'll be 10,000 years.",
        "And this brings up the whole issue of should we be attempting to extend life beyond the normal species-determined level, or should we be spending most of our time, most of our effort, most of our money on what the geriatricians call compression of morbidity, making the years that we have, up to 120 hopefully, as good and strong and rewarding as possible?",
        "Geriatricians are attempting to extend our length of life within the normal species determination, but to make those years so good that instead of slowly declining and getting sicker and sicker over 10 or 15 years, that decline happens in the last couple of years and the rest of it up until then is vigorous, rewarding and fun.",
