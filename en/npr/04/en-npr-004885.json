        "And growth hormone is in the same category, as far as I'm concerned.",

        "And being introduced to the director of psychology who, when he first got there, I believe it was 15 years ago, invited a number of Parisian artists to come in and teach painting to the people who lived there, most of whom - almost all of whom had never painted before.",
        "Fifteen years, he had a collection of 40,000 paintings because he had convinced the administration to create little studios.",

        "The strength of the synapses, or the connections between cells - the amount of neurotransmitter, the liquid, we'll call it a liquid chemical - that carries the messages from one nerve cell to another, the amount of blood supply is actually determined by how much we use our brains.",

        "We don't get as many second chances as we did when we were 30 or 40 or 50, so it behooves us to do the things that keep heart, muscle, brain in good condition, whether or not we're endowed by our DNA.",
