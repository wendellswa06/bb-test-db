        "I suppose, and, you know, I think that you want to make it more meaningful, but this is still an attempt to be inviting to immigrants.",
        "The move to make the test more meaningful is backed by an argument, not to introduce difficult standards or a high-stress circumstance, but to invite immigrants to become naturalized, to really be part of a reintroduction of the theory of assimilation, which, of course, is really the process that Americans do, uniquely, that has made our immigrant story so successful over all of our history.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "Well, let's get some listeners involved in the conversation.",

        "Malad.",

        "In the House of Representatives or the Senate?",
        "In the House of Representatives.",

        "Great.",
        "My suggestion is that there should only be one question on the test, and there would be no wrong answer, and that question would be why did you want to come here?",
        "Hmm.",
        "And be a rhetorical answer.",
        "My personal belief is that America is a strong enough country to be able to absorb anyone that wants to come here, whether they have a bad intent or a good intent, or if they're fleeing from a country or if they just want another opportunity.",
        "I see a lot of things in the media and difficulty with, people say, illegal aliens, and my first response is how can he be illegal and be a human?",
        "And my second point is that we're the greatest nation on the face of this earth, and I believe we have not only a moral obligation but a legal obligation to support any human being who would like to come to our country, and I'll take my...",

        "Well, no, that's actually a very good question.",
        "I don't object to that.",
        "One practical point and then a more general answer.",
        "The practical point is that this is actually the way it used to be done.",
        "Before the 20th Century, an immigrant would go before an authority of the government, most likely a judge, and talk to them, just have a conversation back and forth, and the judge would decide.",
        "The problem is in this day and age of large numbers of people, and we still want to accommodate and welcome them all here, that really becomes impossible, and a test becomes a practical replacement.",
        "The second thing, I think, is a general recognition that this is one aspect of several things which are important to allow all of immigrants to come here as part of an open immigration policy that encourages them to come here and learn certain things.",
        "Not necessarily give up on our culture or their ethnic background.",
        "But certain things about America that we think are important for citizenship."
