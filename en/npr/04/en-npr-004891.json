        "They said that the right to vote was guaranteed in the Seventh Amendment.",
        "That's an amendment that has anything to do with voting.",
        "So, voting in the United States is a state right not a citizenship right.",
        "Well, anyway, Cheryl, you and I would have been morally wrong together, but we would have answered the question correctly.",

        "Yes, I think that it's wonderful to use the moment when people want to become citizens to educate them about the opportunities in the United States, and to educate them about the history of the United States.",

        "Well, does that suggest do you think then Chris, innate people who are born here should be required to take a test, if people who immigrate here are required to take a test?",
        "I would go the other way and say that nobody should be required to take a test.",
        "Hmm.",
        "What ...",

        "I mean, this is something that that political scientists have studied, just how much information and knowledge is necessary, and there's some evidence that you know what, in some ways you just don't need all that much.",
        "Lani Guinier, should the test be universal or not at all?",
        "Well, again I like the idea of educating all Americans, those who are naturalized and those who are born here, to the history of this country.",

        "So, I think we should use this opportunity, just as I think we should use high school graduation, to teach people about our country and to, but not to test them.",
        "So, for example, why don't we take all new immigrants down to the voting booth and show them how to register to vote.",
        "And show them how in fact one exercises the right to vote rather than just tell them about it.",
        "And do the same thing for high school graduates generally, so that in order to get a diploma, you have to go down and register to vote.",
        "I mean, if we really want to see people participating, we should do it in a way that is consistent with what Mr. Spalding said earlier, and that is that it invites them into the process rather than tests them to determine whether they should even participate.",
