        "Well, it's interesting that your last caller actually stole my thunder, because I think having a common language has been incredibly important to this multi-ethnic, multi-racial nation.",
        "It's one of the reasons I think that we could have a common culture and a common sense of identity is that we can speak with each other.",
        "And having that common language I think is very important.",
        "So, I would have as a prerequisite to becoming a U.S.",
        "citizen, some fluency in language.",
        "And of course you'd have to temper that, as you do under the current law and regulations, by age.",
        "Because obviously it's much more difficult for elderly people to learn a language than it is for young people.",
        "But I think having a common language is very important.",
        "I think understanding that democracy is much, much more than simply voting.",
        "I mean we have seen instances where there has been voting in countries that could hardly be called democratic.",
        "It's really much more fundamentally about the rule of law and getting people to understand that, getting people to have some understanding of our system, how it operates, the balances of power between the three executive branches is important.",
        "Understanding how it is that we change our laws is important.",
        "And I think also fundamentally understanding that as a nation we have always believed that rights in here in individuals rather then in groups is also very important.",
        "Now how do you translate all of that into a test?",
        "Well, I think we, I'm actually not unhappy with the current test and I think a lot of the attempt to rewrite the test and to change the way in which we go about making new citizens is really an effort to water down citizenship, and I think that's unfortunate.",
        "I think that being a United States citizen is a great privilege, and if you are not fortunate enough to be born here, but come here as an immigrant, I think this country is greatly enriched by our immigrants, and I'm for very generous immigration laws, but I do think that you do have to show some desire and commitment to understanding our system, and to wanting to be a participant in that system.",

        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "And you do have to take a quiz here, Simon.",

        "That is an N400.",

        "Yes.",
        "I had a comment with regards to the current quiz that you take.",
        "Using my own experience the first question that the gentleman asked when I sat in his office was what are the colors of the stripes on the flag of U.S.",
        "And right behind the gentleman is indeed the U.S.",
        "flag, so I didn't know whether I should look him straight in the eye when I'm answering this for fear of him thinking I'm cheating and looking over his shoulder to get the answer.",
        "It definitely needs to be changed.",
        "Did it seem trivial to you?",
        "Well, there were six very basic questions that I was asked and the gentleman said if I get the first, when you get six questions correct they stop the quiz there.",
        "So they were pretty trivial questions, yes.",
        "And it seemed like you could go a long time if you didn't get six questions, he'll keep asking questions until you got six right?",
        "I believe that is how he explained it, yes.",
        "So not exactly a high stress test then?",
        "Fortunately the six questions I was asked, no. I think it may have been, had he asked me questions that I didn't know the answer to.",
        "Well, you certainly aced that form question, so.",
        "Congratulations and thank you for playing our game here Simon."

        "Thank you.",

        "What would you do in this situation?",
        "Let's find out what people can bring to the country that would positively impact their communities and the country as a whole.",
        "What do you think of that Linda Chavez?",
        "Well, I guess my fear with that is it would become so subjective that you could, I think, have some problems, particularly with some of the interviewers.",
        "My organization, a number of years ago, went out and actually tried to determine how the test was administered around the country and there was such enormous variation.",
        "It depended on whether or not you got an examiner who was in a good mood that day or not.",
        "It was even, as the test is currently structured, it was so subjective that I thought that was a problem and what your questioner is suggesting I think would make it even more subjective.",

        "She'd just finished studying to be a preschool teacher in Oaxaca when her sister asked her to accompany her to the casting call.",
        "(Speaking Spanish).",
        "I would remind your listeners that literacy tests were struck down as results of the civil rights movement in the 1960s and by the voting rights act of 1965, not because literacy tests themselves were considered wrong or evil or in some way unfair, but because they were so discriminatorily administered.",
        "If you were in Mississippi you would be asked questions that could not be answered or that required an incredible amount of knowledge if you happened to be black, but you could essentially pass the test if you were illiterate and white.",
        "So it wasn't the notion that there's anything wrong with wanting people to have some basic level of literacy in order to vote, it was that this was applied on a racial basis.",
        "And arbitrarily, yeah.",

        "It was supposed to focus on the Constitution and the rights.",
        "Yes.",
        "Most of the test questions do focus on the Constitution and Linda Chavez, thank you very Imod for the call, Linda Chavez I did want to say, a lot of people said, you know, one of the problems with this is that maybe high school students couldn't pass it, people who were born here.",
        "Oh, it's not just high school students.",
        "I venture to say that many college graduates couldn't pass it and that is a terrible tragedy and I think it is something that undermines our freedom that we now teach Government so poorly in school, we teach History so poorly in school and we require so little of people who were actually born here that that too undermines the strength of our democracy.",
        "But I don't think the way to fix is to lower the bar so that those who are newcomers, come into the nation are as ignorant as those who happened to have been fortunate enough to be born here.",

        "He did.",

        "Miller and Behe have been battling over intelligent design for the last two years in different lectures and things, and now they've actually taken it to a courtroom.",
        "When Behe took the stand on Monday, he actually used some of the slides that Ken Miller had presented and read through them.",
