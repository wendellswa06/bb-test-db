        "So instead of calling it warrantless wiretaps, the president calls it Terrorist Surveillance.",
        "Now several polls did come out Friday that looked at whether the American people are concerned about the idea of their government gathering intelligence in this country.",
        "What did the polls tell us?",

        "It's pretty much tied in most polls.",
        "The New York Times says that if you phrase the question should President Bush authorize these kinds of wiretaps in order to protect the country against terrorists, then 53 percent say yes.",
        "If you take out all of those kind of value words, 46 percent say yes, and that's all within what they call the margin of error."
