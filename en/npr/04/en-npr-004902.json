        "The writer Leah Hager Cohen argues that it takes a special kind of self-confidence to express doubt, to admit you have something to learn.",
        "She's written a book called \"\"I Don't Know,\"\" and she gives the famous example of an airline pilot preparing to take off from Washington in 1982.",
        "The plane crashed, killing 78 people, because the pilot did not know the plane was in no shape to take off and did not want to admit it.",
        "He dismissed the warning of the co-pilot sitting beside him.",
        "Deicing had gone on, but by the time the plane was actually given the thumbs-up to get in line to taxi to the runway, more ice had built up.",
        "And the co-pilot could see on the aircraft in front of the one that they were in, that there was build-up on the wings.",
        "And we should tell people, this is National Airport in Washington, D.C., which means you have even less of a second chance than other airports.",
        "The runway's like an aircraft carrier.",
        "It's on the edge of the Potomac, and if you don't take off, you're in the water.",
        "So that's the situation these guys are facing.",
        "And so it sounds as though the co-pilot did try to warn - but perhaps in a somewhat subservient way, you know, cognizant of the fact that he was the co-pilot, not the captain - that maybe they'd better go back and get the wings deiced again.",
        "And the captain seems to brush off the warning.",
        "It seems to be an instance where he didn't want to know what the co-pilot was pointing out to him.",
        "There's a transcript reprinted in your book here that I'm now looking at, and the co-pilot actually says, as he's looking at the instruments: That doesn't seem right, does it?",
        "That's not right.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF FLIGHT RECORDING)",
        "No, that's not right.",
        "And the captain says, yeah, it's fine.",
        "Yes, it is (unintelligible).",
        "And the co-pilot actually allows himself to be convinced against his own warning.",

        "The co-pilot was in a less-powerful position than the pilot.",
        "He seems to have allowed the pilot's dismissal to, you know, make him also kind of drop this knowledge that he was trying to communicate.",
        "When you talk about these dynamics - the pilot and the co-pilot, the person in the position of authority, the person who may know something more than the person in the position of authority - now, we have something that begins to apply to other walks of life, I suppose.",
        "Yes.",
        "And it also raises a really important element in this whole conversation - which is fear, fear of losing face.",

        "All right, folks, it seems we have started all over again.",
        "If you rewind 20 years ago, you see the same headlines, and that's a hate crime coming out of Howard Beach, New York--a section of Queens there.",
        "A white teen-ager has been charged today for allegedly beating a black man with a baseball bat in Howard Beach.",
        "Here's the question and the rub that's different than 20 years ago, and that is, allegedly, the black youths that were there at Howard Beach are admittedly suggesting they were there to possibly steal a vehicle.",
        "They say that there were too many people around; therefore, they decided not to.",
        "And an altercation ensued at that point.",
        "Does this, George Curry, change the implication of hate crime at all if you can make the argument that these white you--the white youth were simply, quote, \"\"protecting their ground\"\"?",
        "Well, first of all, the white youth have no authorization to go out and beat people with a baseball bat.",
        "The fact is, even though these guys admit that they have criminal intent, they had not create--had not committed any crime at that point.",
        "They were--and so the point is--point of fact, they had not committed a crime.",
        "They are free to walk any street they want to at any time of the night or day.",

        "It--the question was--and even if they had done it, actually, they did not deserve being beaten to death on the street by people who do not have any authority, as George has so aptly put it.",
        "I mean, I think for me, though, it's just more shocking to hear that 20 years later we're visiting this scene.",
        "I understand that some of the elected officials and Reverend Al Sharpton--and you'll recall that this is really where Reverend Al Sharpton made his national name, was talking about and being out in front on the original Howard Beach incident.",
        "But to--later on, or soon they're all going to make some comment about what has happened now, 20 years later.",
        "And it just seems to me that I don't know how this ever ends.",

        "On the other hand, the interaction between vigilante justice, where guys with baseball bats beat up on young blacks because they think they may be criminals--and in this case perhaps think so correctly--on the one hand, and hate crime behavior, which is you beat up on somebody because you hate them because they're black--that line is kind of blurry here, isn't it?",
        "I mean, these guys have no justification for what they did--absolutely no justification for what they did.",
        "But I sometimes have difficulty with the concept of a hate crime because it requires us to dissect what the motives of the people are.",
