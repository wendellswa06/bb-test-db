        "...this brings up an interesting point, and Glenn beats me to it, and that's the idea that this coupled with the recent statements by Vicente Fox does bring new light to a question of how African-Americans are perceived in that part of the world.",
        "...anomaly, obviously, just in societal numbers, period.",
        "But do you think people see them as an anomaly as they look at African-Americans?",
        "See successful African-Americans...",
        "Well, I don't agree with that, but I'll tell you what.",
        "Now while we talk about the stereotypes, there's another side of that.",

        "Thank you.",
        "Well, this is the trip that--this is the ki--the incident that I think should have sparked a trip by Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.",
        "I'm not sure that the comment was--that Vicente Fox made earlier was worthy of a trip, but this seems to me to be such.",
        "I mean, here's the point.",
        "We have exported our racism all around the world.",
        "I have in my possession that I--it's something I got from a black memorabilia show years ago--a cup and saucer from Italy with the same kind of images on it.",
        "I mean, this is the kind of stuff that, you know, that has been going around--this feels like a show that everything old is new again--for years and years and years, and seems deeply rooted in the minds of, and obviously in the institutions of some countries that are outside of the United States, because we've exported it.",
        "But I think that the White House was right in saying this should not be tolerated and making a comment on it.",
        "And I would hope that Mexico--and particularly Vicente Fox, given his most recent statements--would take a stand against this.",
        "Well, I agree with you, Callie, that--I am--I wasn't all that upset over his--Fox's earlier statement because I think that there was an overemphasis on the word `even.",
        "And I--but I am upset about this.",
        "But it is made in the USA.",
        "This is an image that was exported, exploited and exported to other countries.",
        "And just when--as black soldiers fought abroad, the US white soldiers was telling them that we had tails and this kind of thing.",
        "It's the same old images that was created here, and it doesn't--it shouldn't be a surprise that the rest of the world are taking what started right here at home.",
        "And even--but let's be fair about it--even some African-Americans now collect these kind of images, and I just--I have no use for them at all, period.",
        "Well, that brings me to my point, and I was going to ask Callie: You mentioned that you have this.",
        "Do you collect these images?"

        "No, I--you know, at one time I thought it was an interesting way to be reminded of some of the horrors around the world, so I have a few of them.",
        "And particularly, this one struck me because it reminded me how far-reaching this--the kinds of racism that wee--that was homegrown--had gone.",
        "And I found it real shocking that this was out there.",
        "So this doesn't surprise me that a stamp that would be created in this image.",
        "But what surprises me, I suppose, is that in these days and times--and, particularly, coming on the heels of his most recent comment--that this would be happening.",
        "I would hope that because we're--this country is going to have many more interactions with Mexico--that some of the officials there--the government, Vicente Fox, somebody would come out and say, you know, `This is perhaps not the time nor the place for us to be supporting this.'",
        "Just one more comment, Ed.",
        "You know, Vicente Fox is basically lobbying us to change our immigration laws to make it easier for people to get across that border.",
        "I think that that's the humane thing for us to do.",
        "Look at the contempt that they show to an important part of the American electorate.",
        "Evidently, in their eyes we don't count politically in this country because they can afford to offend us gratuitously without a calculation that that's going to undermine their ability to get done what they want to get done in the United States policy.",
        "And that's a sign of at least our perception of weakness.",
        "I talk about African-Americans within the larger American political community.",
        "We're perceived as not counting.",
        "And I also think one other thing, if I may, Ed, at a time when someone like Antonio Villaraigosa is working very hard to bridge racial coalitions among Mexican-Americans and being proud of his heritage and that community's heritage and reaching across to African-Americans--I mean, this just--this is bad business.",
        "But it can be used--Jesse Jackson for one said, you know, one thing--and I agree--`We must work on these coalitions, particularly between Latinos and African-Americans.'",
        "Yeah.",
        "Maybe this is one thing that maybe ought to be at the top of the agenda--some better and more sensitivity, and it can start with these postage stamps and move forward and use it for that.",
        "Let me ask you all this question.",
        "Take it outside of Mexico--and with the burgeoning importance, frankly, and popularity of rap and some of the images that some suggest reflect and depict those that we've tried to run away from--Does this speak to a bigger picture, though?--and that's the picture of how African-Americans are seen throughout the world, that there is still this kind of bucking eyes, shuffling sense of that is what African-Americans are.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I don't think we're viewed--I don't agree with you.",
        "I don't think we are necessarily viewed that way, but I think we are victims of the American image of us and what they--the stereotypes that are portrayed right here at home.",
        "You don't have to leave this country--right here at home in terms of the coverage we get and what's likely to covered.",
        "And so I think that all plays into it.",
        "The rap plays into it as well.",
        "And we do not get a diverse depiction in our own US media, so therefore we shouldn't be surprised if we don't get the same thing abroad.",
        "Well, and you also know that when you travel abroad, I mean, you spend most of your time interacting with people who come--having just met for the first time, perhaps, an African-American tourist--some of the stereotypes that have been exported.",
        "So it's out there, and it's around the world."
