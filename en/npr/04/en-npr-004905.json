        "A company named Uranium One based in Canada needed approval to sell a 51-percent stake of the company to an arm of the Russian government called Rosatom.",

        "It also owned stakes in large mines - very lucrative mines in Kazakhstan, and that actually was primarily what the Russian government was interested in.",

        "Uranium being a strategic commodity, and therefore it requires a rather high level of approval from the U.S.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Multiple agencies had to sign off on this including the State Department.",
        "And why that's interesting is that the men who had built and financed this company behind this deal were some of Bill Clinton's biggest donors, and one man, the chairman of the company, had donated, we found, 2.35 million dollars in donations that the Clinton Foundation had failed to disclose.",
        "Had failed to disclose - you mean there was no public record of receiving the donation to the Foundation?",
        "Right.",
        "When Hillary Clinton became Secretary of State, the Obama White House asked her to sign a memorandum of understanding because Bill Clinton was going to continue to raise money for his foundation.",
        "And part of the memorandum of understanding was that she would disclose all donations.",
        "The other part of it was that they wouldn't take foreign donations while she was Secretary of State.",
        "And she's now saying that they won't take foreign donations if she becomes president, but what the story really underscores is sort of the special challenges when you have a foundation that's raising money from foreign interests that couldn't contribute, by the way, to an American political campaign, but can to these kinds of foundations.",
        "There's also the eye-popping $500,000 speaking fee that Bill Clinton received in Russia.",
        "What is the connection, if any, to the entire uranium mine acquisition?",
        "Yeah.",
        "That was paid by Renaissance Capital, an investment bank in Russia that has links to the Kremlin.",
        "And basically they invited Bill, and Bill gave the speech just after the Russians had announced their desire to acquire this 51-percent stake in this company, but before the U.S.",
        "government had signed off."

        "Again, I think it was in eye of the beholder.",
        "A lot of people said before this debate that the bar was set fairly low, because of recent interviews that the governor gave, that were not so flattering to her grasp of policy, or her ability to communicate it.",
        "The bar was pretty low, and you know, although she tended to answer what question she wanted to, when she wanted to, and said so much to the moderator Gwen Ifill.",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "She was like a - you know, I'm going to answer basically what I want to answer.",
        "But she did a make a point that I think was very distinct between the tax policy that she and Senator McCain favor, which is much like the existing Bush tax policy versus the Biden-Obama tax policy, which would restructure who gets tax breaks, and put it more to the middle class.",
        "And that's a very clear distinction for voters, they have to decide what they want, and I do think in that case her comments were helpful in helping people decide."
