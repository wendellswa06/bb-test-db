        "So I think the court sort of operates on a longer schedule.",

        "Some of the liberal justices may not like some of his laws, the Romney laws, but we won't know that for a couple years.",

        "As you look forward over the next presidential term, how much could this election determine, you know, the court makeup?",
        "Will there be vacancies, and could it be a really big deal whether it's a Republican or a Democrat filling them?",
        "It could be a really big deal if it's a Republican or Democrat in this way: They're sort of split four-four-one on all the big issues, four conservatives, four liberals, Justice Kennedy sort of a centrist Republican in the middle.",
        "Sure.",
        "Ruth Ginsberg is going to be 80 years old in the spring.",
        "If she - if Mitt Romney were elected in November and she left in the next couple years, it would be a big deal if a Romney conservative replaces a liberal Democrat like Ruth Ginsberg.",
        "Same thing with Justice Kennedy and Justice Scalia.",
        "They're both 76.",
        "They don't have any plans to leave, but, you know, four years, both of them are going to be 80.",
        "If Barack Obama would replace Scalia or Kennedy, that would make a - one-vote tip on the ideological balance, would make a huge impact on a whole series of issues.",

        "And I don't know whether you know much about the background of this, but in Texas, the first Mexican-American woman elected to the legislature in the mid-'90s got passed a law called the Top 10 Percent Law.",
        "If you were a top 10 graduate of a high school in Texas, you got automatically admitted to the state universities, including UT Austin.",
        "And that law has had a profound impact of changing the school, because kids - Mexican-American kids in the Rio Grande Valley, black kids in Houston and Dallas suddenly had a way into UT Austin.",
        "All you had to do was finish in the top 10 of your high school class.",
        "Correct, correct.",
        "And the last couple years, about a third of the incoming students, 35 percent, are Hispanic or black.",
        "So they were getting a lot of diversity on their own.",
        "And then separately, after the O'Connor opinion, Texas began a small affirmative action program.",
        "That's what's being challenged.",
        "I think Justice Kennedy is going to say, wait a minute.",
        "If you can achieve diversity through a race-neutral means, then there's no reason to have a race-based program.",
        "And I think that's the likelihood - that's the likely decision that'll come out of this case.",
        "And when this case is decided, would that set precedent for other areas beyond education, or is it limited to just universities and education?",
        "I think it's very hard to read, David.",
        "I was trying to figure, how do you write that opinion?",
        "You know, because just like a lot of law schools, for example, say, well, we don't have anything like the top 10 percent plan.",
        "So I don't - I can't tell whether he would write a Texas-only opinion or say something that no public institution may consider race until you've tried the other alternatives, which would be a big deal.",
        "So I think it's hard to gauge as to how he might write that, even if he comes out that way."
