        "They took out the word force.",
        "Most rapes are committed without a weapon and often just with threats.",

        "Under the new definition, the FBI is now saying, send us all your reports, men and women.",
        "We're going to count them all.",
        "So with the expanded definition, the number of rapes are up in most cities.",
        "Berkowitz says that since the definition excluded male rape for so long, it's hard to know the full scope of the issue, but there are some estimates.",
        "Other studies the Justice Department has done suggests that about one out of every 33 men will be sexually assaulted during their lifetime.",
        "And that compares to about one out of every six women.",
        "And since this is a new definition, can we even talk about trends?",
        "You know, does this become the new baseline and now we have to sort of start over again in talking about understanding sexual violence?",
        "Pretty much, but there's actually two different ways that the federal government measures sexual violence.",
        "One is this FBI study, which tallies the number of police reports that are made in local police departments around the country.",
        "The other is a broader study where they interview a random sample of tens of thousands of households and ask them a series of questions.",
        "And if someone answers yes to one of the sexual violence questions, they'll ask follow-up questions like did you report it to police?"
