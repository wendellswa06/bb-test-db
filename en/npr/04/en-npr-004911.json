        "So from that study, which gives us a much broader picture of the problem because it counts unreported rapes, that shows us that there's been a significant decline in sexual violence over the last 20 years.",
        "It's fallen by somewhere around half, but that that decline has really leveled off in the last few years, and the numbers have stopped going down.",
        "One of the unique things about sexual violence is that it's one of the most underreported crimes.",
        "According to the Justice Department, only about four out of 10 victims report their rape to the police.",
        "And do you think a new definition, you know, the different wording, is it possible that could reduce the stigma to an extent and increase the reporting?",
        "I think so.",
        "We've heard from lots of men who've contacted the National Sexual Assault Hotline who have a feeling that by expanding this definition, by recognizing that they're real victims - I guess is how they often put it - it helps validate their experience.",
        "It makes them feel like what happened to them is understood by authorities.",
        "It's interesting, ever since the Penn State story broke a couple years ago, which was focused, of course, on boys who had been abused, we saw a huge increase after that in the number of boys and men contacting the hotline.",
        "And that has continued to grow.",
        "The new language that the FBI uses, obviously, you consider that an improvement, but are there other changes that you would like to see or other information you'd like to see the FBI collecting?",
        "You know, I think that what we still need a really - a better understanding of is why are six out of 10 rapes not reported to police.",
        "What's stopping people?",
        "Because the only way we're ever going to really put a big dent in sexual violence is once more rapes are reported to police and more are prosecuted.",
        "Scott Berkowitz is the founder and president of the Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network, the nation's largest anti-sexual violence organization.",
        "This is just the first year that the new definition of rape has been in place.",
        "And not all local police departments are using it.",
        "The Police Executive Research Forum has been working to help local agencies with the change.",
        "Chuck Wexler is the executive director.",
        "I hope by the end of this year, you'd have 100 percent or close to 100 percent participation.",
        "But the definition had not changed in 100 years, so sometimes it's challenging to get bureaucratic organizations to change."

        "That was after voters had waited in line for six, seven, even eight hours - voters like 18-year-old Andre Murias, who said his first-ever voting experience felt more like a tailgate party.",

        "Farook, however, as many of us do, created the password on the phone.",
        "And Apple has a feature on its phones that can be enabled basically to erase all the data after 10 guesses as to what the password is.",
        "So you could see the federal government, if they tried to guess, they could lose everything on the phone.",
        "So the DOJ asked Apple to help them break through the encryption, and Apple said no. The DOJ went to a court, got a judge's order to compel Apple to help.",
        "So why doesn't Apple help?",
        "In a very strongly worded post on Apple's website, CEO Tim Cook said that helping the government in this case would make millions of other iPhones less secure.",
        "And he meant that in two ways.",
        "One is that to break into Farook's phone, Apple would have to develop a special software to disable the security feature.",
        "And if it does this, once it enables that, it will make all phones less secure because somebody could get a hold of that special software, and hackers could use it.",
        "His second reason is a legal one.",
