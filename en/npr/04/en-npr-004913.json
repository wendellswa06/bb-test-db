        "The distinction is that they all got it with the permission of Wikileaks, whereas we got it sort of over the transom.",
        "You know the criticisms that have been voiced here: Diplomatic cables are meant to be confidential; kings, prime ministers don't use language with American envoys on the assumption that they'll end up quoted verbatim on the front page of The Times.",
        "Sure.",
        "What's the public's interest in seeing these unvarnished cables?",
        "You know, the stories today I think provided the fullest account that I've seen anywhere of America's attempt to rally a coalition against Iran and its nuclear ambitions.",
        "And it included a fascinating story about the extent to which American diplomats are being enlisted to gather intelligence on their counterparts in other countries, down to things like credit card numbers and frequent flyer numbers.",
        "But if, indeed, the government had come to you and you asked the Obama administration for their guidance, for what they thought here.",
        "If they said release of that could indeed jeopardize maintaining the very coalition against Iran that we've been trying to assemble.",
        "Would The Times say, well, if you're right we won't publish that?",

        "To prevent students from stiffing the lender and leaving the government holding the bag, Congress has made it very difficult to get out of repaying the loan, even in bankruptcy.",
        "The question in today's case is twofold: Can the special requirements in the bankruptcy code be effectively waved by the lender and once a bankruptcy plan is approved by the court and paid off, can the lender come back years later to get more money?",

        "The lender noted that the federal bankruptcy code only allows discharge of an unpaid student loan if the borrower can show undue hardship in an advisory hearing with a formal summons issued to the lender to appear in court.",
        "A federal appeals court ruled that the company, by not objecting to the plan or appealing it, had effectively waived its right to an adversary hearing, and that it was too late now.",
        "The company appealed to the Supreme Court where today it's lawyer Madeleine Wanslee ran into a buzzsaw over the principal of final judgments.",

        "Now, for a man who was basically hanging over Lincoln's shoulder throughout this whole affair to not be mentioned at all - again, they're not saying he wasn't there - but in a way, there's a silence that's really kind of chilling to me.",
        "And I have to say, a number of very distinguished historians used Crook as a source in their coverage of this period.",
