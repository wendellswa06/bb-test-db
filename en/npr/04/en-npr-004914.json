        "...not only were my uncle's original journals there, but there was volume upon volume of other, you know, people within that area having donated archival historical documents.",
        "So I think that that might be - if you haven't already, it would be a place for you to visit and to check and see if there weren't some references to Lincoln's visit in those archives.",

        "But my teachers were never specific about what Lincoln would have done to make it so.",
        "What does your author think?",
        "And of course quite a contrast between Lincoln and his vice president and successor, Mr. Johnson.",
        "Well, Lincoln, though, would have faced some of the same problems Johnson had; that is, once the South got over the shock of losing the war, there really was a widespread effort to reinstitute the South the way it was before the war.",
        "And I think Lincoln would have had as hard a time as Johnson, even Grant wound up having, in terms of trying to, you know, change really a fundamental sense of this country.",
        "I mean, the racism that was prevalent in this country was almost to the extent of a religion, is that people just accepted it as something that was part of the normal flow of things.",
        "And to change that whole culture, it was more than one man, I think, could have accomplished.",
        "Clearly, though, Lincoln was better positioned as a negotiator, as a compromiser, as a...",
        "But not to put too fine a point, he's regarded as the best president in American history, his successor regarded as his worst.",
