        "It does create an antibodies in the society from the Iraqi perspective.",
        "And from the American perspective, there are costs associated with it, and we have other priorities.",
        "But certainly, I think there is a strong argument to be made when you look at events over the last eight years, that even a small force, a small American force provides a little bit of, if you want to call it a security blanket, no pun intended, but it basically is an indication of continued American interest in Iraq and that helps Iraqis chart a more independent political course, which is very, very hard to do in that part of the world, and very, very much in American strategic interests.",
        "You also argue that in a Middle East that's being reshaped by revolution in places like Tunisia and Egypt and Libya and Syria, as well as Iraq's next-door neighbor, Iraq could, in some ways, provide a model for those places as they look to re-establish new kinds of governance.",

        "It's a very emotional question for lots of Egyptians and Libyans, and it was very emotional for Iraqis.",
        "But if you look at the Iraqi experience, a policy called de-Baathification, you have many Arabs saying, well, that went too far and that undermined the ability of Iraq to really develop itself, get back on its feet in the timeframe that was required.",
