        "Thank you very much for the topic, Neal, and for the guest.",
        "I'm just wondering, where would it - what you're saying is that if I were an educator and nonprofit leader, and I wanted to travel to Iraq to contribute to a better civil society and a better educated public there, would I be more protected then if American troops stayed and could, therefore, do my work better and more safely?",
        "Or would I - is that what you're saying?",
        "O'SULLIVAN: I think that would be a too strict an interpretation of what I'm saying, at least in the short term because the number of American troops that we're talking about that, maybe, the Iraqis would be interested and certainly, perhaps, President Obama would be willing to leave behind the very, very small number - we're talking, you know, the current conversation is around 3,000 - these troops, you know, this is such a small number for a large country.",
        "These troops are not going to be providing security on the streets of Baghdad or any other town or city in Iraq, and, in fact, they haven't been doing that for years now.",
        "So you would not have the protection of American soldiers.",
        "The question is, does that manifestation of a U.S.",
        "commitment to Iraq, does that help create political stability, which obviously has a very close relationship with security.",
        "And so my argument to you would be, well, that this continued American presence, this continued American commitment is helpful at stabilizing Iraq over the long term, or over the medium and long term, and that means that, you know, you could expect a better environment.",
        "It doesn't mean I would recommend you go there tomorrow independently, although there are parts of Iraq - if you're an educator, there's an American university in Iraq, in Sulaymaniyah, in the northern part of Iraq, and you can quite easily go there.",
        "And I'm sure they would welcome the opportunity to benefit from whatever skills that you want to bring.",
        "So there are nuances throughout the country.",
        "And what is your comment, if I might follow up, as to whether the presence of American troops might be more of a political irritant?",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.",
        "That's the antibody she mentioned earlier, but yeah, yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No, I, you know, I acknowledge that there's certainly an element of that.",
        "There's a group of Iraq that you may have heard of called the Sadrists, and they're a group and they've actually been responsible for a lot of attacks on American soldiers, on Iraqis.",
        "They have a militia which gets support from Iran.",
        "They're very, very against the American presence.",
        "This has always been a very difficult thing for the Iraqi government to maneuver.",
        "This was true when the current agreement was negotiated in 2008, and it's true today.",
        "And so, like any sort of multi-polar political system, there are going to be a variety of opinions.",
        "And so the question is, can this party be managed?",
        "Can their opposition be overcome?",
        "And that probably requires some element of solidarity by other Iraqi figures, and that, you know, not an easy thing."

        "Hi.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "I think one of the biggest challenges around this entire subject of Iraq and our troops over there began when your guest commented at the very beginning on how this entire conversation is premised on the money spent over there as being an investment.",
        "I kind of have a difficulty accepting that as an investment.",
        "I think it's more of carefully chosen words to frame this - frame something that's not quite so pleasant into something a little more pleasant as this language - it's a lot more neutral and not as polarizing, which I can appreciate the results of that.",
        "But I do believe that it's more money spent as opposed to money invested.",
        "I'd like to hear her comments on that.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Well, I mean, I take your point that the word investment has certain connotations, but that - it's actually intentional on my part, saying that we have the option of potentially reaping some of the benefits from our engagement in Iraq - our very, very expensive both in terms of money and lives engagement in Iraq over the 10 years or eight years - or we have the option of saying, we spent every penny and every, you know, every person that we are going to dedicate to this mission.",
        "We're done with that and, therefore, even if it just requires kind of sticking with the problem a little bit longer, we're not interested in capturing the benefits that may flow.",
        "This is the - the difficulty of this is just the timeframe, that these things - it's very hard to say, OK, we're not going to gain anything no matter if we dedicate more resources to this or we are, where we have an inherent interests in the outcome on this part of the world or we have an inherent responsibility.",
        "So I agree with you the word investment, perhaps, is a little bit too clinical.",
        "But in a simple a way, it sort of captures this idea of a payoff that comes after you make a commitment.",
        "But you also understand how many times we've been told, oh, there's light right around the next corner if we just stay with it a little bit longer.",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Right.",
        "And that, I think, you know, this is a reasonable question for someone to ask a person like me.",
        "You know, at what point do you say we've, you know, made every effort we're going to make and now, you know, we should walk away?",
        "Now I would argue to you, and I do argue win my piece, that actually there are more tangible reasons to believe that this payoff isn't kind of this notational thing, and it isn't somewhere way down the line."

        "You mentioned energy and this whole idea that Iraq may be in a position to help global markets, not American companies but global markets, and, you know, is that just an idea or is that rooted in some fact?",
        "And if we look at what's going on in Iraq's oil industry, it's quite interesting that they had a very long debate over the course of the first six years about whether or not to welcome companies that could help them with the technology to develop their own resources.",
        "They decided they would do that.",

        "Yes.",

        "And when I hear things like oil and, you know, possible revenues, weren't we told that at the very beginning that the oil was going to pay for the war?",
        "I think the investment in dollars and, certainly, in lives and in reputation has been just immeasurably bad for the United States.",
        "And I think if I were the person with the opportunity, I would pull the plug, and every single dollar and every single American would come home.",

        "O'SULLIVAN: Sure.",
        "And I did acknowledge that Americans have heard arguments that sound like this before, and that's why I kind of point to, well, do we have any greater evidence that there's some substance behind these arguments, or are these wishful thoughts and thinking?",
        "I appreciate how many Americans are interested in putting this very, very painful, very divisive and very expensive war behind them.",
        "There's no question about that, and that's why I felt moved to write and to come on the show today to try to make the case that one doesn't have to have agreed with everything that's happened in the eight months to realized that there may still be some value in maintaining a long-term relationship with this country.",
        "And you misspoke, of course, eight years, not eight months but",
        "O'SULLIVAN: Oh, I did.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "Eight years, yes.",
