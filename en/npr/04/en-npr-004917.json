        "Stecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called \"\"The Wheelchair Kamikaze.\"\" More than a year ago, Stecker started writing about Zamboni's theory, which he calls chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.",
        "He hypothesizes that people with MS have narrowed or blocked veins that prevent the blood in the brain from draining back to the heart.",
        "The blood pools up, leading to inflammation, which in turn causes the immune system to attack the nerves in the brain and spinal cord.",

        "Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later.",
        "Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as stents, placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots.",
        "Several patients have even died as a result.",
