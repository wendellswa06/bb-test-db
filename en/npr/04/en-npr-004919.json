        "Okay.",
        "Age is one.",
        "But age alone doesn't say it.",
        "I mean, it's got to be the utter number of bottles, the legendary quality of what's in the bottle, and the age of the stuff itself.",
        "So some of this whiskey and scotch has been aged for 60 years.",
        "You open up the bottle - first of all, how do you drink it?",
        "I mean, is this something you put on the rocks or is that utter blasphemy?",
        "That would be blasphemy in this case.",
        "Really, you would say this is snifter stuff.",
        "But scotch actually has kind of a narrow-bodied glass that concentrates the aroma without losing a lot of the aroma in the atmosphere.",
        "You wouldn't want to dilute anything that expensive or that rare with water.",
        "And is this stuff that's actually going to taste any good or you're drinking this more for the kind of historical value of it?",
        "No.",
        "In fact, the spirits are basically - without the addition of air to oxidize it in the bottle, if it's well-sealed, it'll taste as good as the day it was bottled.",
        "Because unlike wine, which is sort of a living thing, once liquor is distilled, it is essentially - I hate to put it this way - but a chemical.",
        "And in this case it's a chemical that's made to taste really good, and it's quite inert in glass.",
        "So you can have something that was bottled 200 years ago and it would still be just as good today if it was well-sealed.",
        "It sounds like I've been doing this all wrong.",
        "I collect wine but maybe I should have been putting my money in whiskey instead.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Well, whiskey has a better chance of living a bit longer, let's say.",
        "Though amazingly enough, if it's not perfectly sealed, I have determined there is a kind of a mildew that will live in 100-proof liquor."

        "And then they can click on any restaurant logo and have a full page about that restaurant with the address.",
        "They can map it, how to get to the restaurant.",

        "Well, actually, as far as being high on the list, the restaurants come up in order of closest to the post office for that zip code.",
        "So if you were not looking for more of the quick service restaurants, you could also do by price range.",
        "But really, this site is also to show you the better-for-you options at any restaurant that's participating.",
        "So even restaurants that you don't typically think of as healthy or having healthier options may have some really good options available.",
        "The only problem, however, is that if you are someone with, say, a food weakness, I don't know who would be someone like that, and here I'm pointing at myself, you could walk in with the best of intentions and walked out with something that is oozing grease through a paper wrapper.",
        "Well, and I think that's really the beauty of this new Web site is it guides you to the menu items that are balanced in calories and fat with an emphasis on healthful ingredients and yet taste really great.",
        "So you're not sacrificing taste in any way and instead just really helping to enhance your health.",
        "You've got thousands, 30,000-plus restaurants on your site nationwide.",
        "Right.",
        "What is in it for the restaurants that your site recommends, if anything?",
        "Well, this site really helps restaurants to let their customers know that they have healthy options and to help their customers identify what items meet their nutritional goal by providing the nutrition data on the Web site."

        "Final question, do you ever think, well, this is great but what if people just ate at home more, wouldn't that solve some of the problems we're talking about?",
