        "Right, and when we talk about ahead, the key nuclear rival here for Pakistan is, of course, India.",
        "These numbers would put it ahead of India in terms of the actual just physical number of deployed weapons they have.",
        "Yes, I think since they both conducted extensive tests in 1998, the thinking has been that they were more or less at parity, that they had more or less the same amount of weapons, which were estimated four or five years ago to be somewhere between 30 to 60 deployed weapons.",
        "The Indians have also added to their arsenal, but the Pakistanis have done it more quickly.",
