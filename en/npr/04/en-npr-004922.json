        "Okay.",
        "We just have about a minute left, but I want to raise that this is all, of course, unfolding against the backdrop of President Obama trying to push a worldwide non-proliferation agenda.",
        "Is Pakistan's slow but steady increase of its arsenal a problem for him?",
        "Well, it's an immediate problem in terms of what is the kind of front-burner issue on that agenda right now, which is to get an international treaty that would ban the production of these fissile materials, highly enriched uranium and plutonium, that are used to build bombs.",
        "The United States has been hoping for some time to get substantive negotiations launched to head toward this treaty.",
        "Those negotiations have largely been stopped singlehandedly by Pakistan.",
        "Pakistan believes that although it has more weapons than India, India actually has more fissile materials, and they think the cutoff will put them at a long-term disadvantage.",
        "All right, thanks so much.",

        "We don't know yet what India's response to these new numbers will be, but that's obviously a big question mark.",
        "Tell me: Where are we in terms of talking about a nuclear arms race in South Asia?",
        "Does this mark an escalation?",
        "Well, it certainly does.",
        "And it's more complicated because India sees itself mainly as a rival of China, two emerging, great economic powers and military powers in Asia.",
        "So India really casts itself and its nuclear planning with regard to China.",
        "It sees Pakistan more as a problem but one that plays in a different stage.",
        "And Pakistan, meanwhile, says they need nuclear weapons, they need this number of nuclear weapons, as a deterrent against India.",
        "Do they have a point?",
        "Yes, well, India has conventional military superiority.",
        "So Pakistan sees its nuclear weapons as offsetting that.",
        "And because they would be the one to initiate nuclear war, they believe they have to have a dominant nuclear position to make that threat credible.",
        "As you say, this is all complicated and gets into regional concerns, not just issues between India and Pakistan, per se.",
        "That said, when we talk about an escalation in arms race in this part of the world, how great do you see the risk as being of some sort of nuclear conflict emerging between the powers that actually have these weapons?",
        "Well, I think the far greater risk, really, is in Pakistan itself.",
        "Your opening comment from Bruce Riedel, I think, hit it on the head.",
        "Pakistan is a very unstable country.",
        "We're not sure about the loyalties of the rank and file on the army.",
        "There's an Islamist extremist movement there.",
        "The whole country could fall apart quickly, and then no one knows what would happen to their nuclear weapons.",
        "So that's the real danger, not their deliberate use by governments.",
        "Okay, let me see if we can get a call in here.",
        "I'm going to take a call.",
        "This is Frank(ph) calling from Mountain View, California.",
        "Hi, Frank, thanks for calling.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yeah, my question is around chain of command and control of the nuclear weapons.",
        "Is it the army, the air force?",
        "We've heard much about the ISI, the military intelligence and some of the rogue activity that's been going on.",
        "I guess my concern is: How much are they going to really follow orders, or are they, you know, doing things that are off the reservation?",
        "Barry Blechman, the caller there asking about the nuclear chain of command, who actually controls the weapons.",

        "The political scene there notoriously shaky, historically shaky, history of coups.",
        "But you say as long as the military remains the stable force that it has been and the stronger force in terms of politically running the country, the actual hand on the nuclear button is a safe one?",
        "Yes, but the question is whether the rank and file of the Pakistani military is being slowly Islamicized, becoming more and more extreme and opposed to the policies of the government now supported by the military leadership.",
        "When you talk about rogue activities, this is concern about some sort of insider sympathies that might lead to risks with the weapons?",
        "Yes.",
        "As you know there I'm sure, there was recently assassination in Pakistan of one of the leading governors.",
        "And the bodyguard who conducted, carried out the assassination, was vetted by the same program that vets the people that secure the nuclear stockpile.",
        "So clearly, it's possible for people with extremist tendencies to get -to clear this hurdle and get within the program, and then they could either facilitate the stealing of weapons or just sell them or somehow get them out of the chain of command.",
        "And what can Pakistan do to prevent that?",
        "I mean, they're obviously aware of this as a potential problem.",
        "They say they have increased security clearance protocols, that type thing.",
        "What all are they doing to try to protect against this, which seems to be a real concern among U.S.",
        "officials, certainly, watching the situation there.",
        "Well, that certainly is a real concern, and they're doing the best they can.",
        "The problem is that the institutions themselves are not stable in Pakistan.",
        "The whole country can fall apart.",
        "We could see a chaotic situation like we're seeing in Egypt right now, with massive demonstrations but with more of a radical Islamist twist.",

        "It could split on ethnic lines."
