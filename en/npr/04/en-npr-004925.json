        "That's right.",
        "There's been no suggestion that he was misquoted or that the reporter violated any sort of ground rules, which leads me to believe that the reporter was let in there with the rules that this was all on the record.",
        "And to - you know, of course, as a journalist, I want to be allowed into as many things as possible in an on-the-record capacity.",
        "But from all of my previous dealings with General McChrystal and his staff, all of those types of conversations with his closest aides were always kept either on background or off the record.",
        "And not - background, not for attribution",
        "That's correct.",
        "All right.",
        "And, Andrew Exum, we have to turn to you just for a moment.",
        "This is very serious stuff.",
        "This appears to be, on the face of it, a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.",
        "Yeah, I mean, this is difficult for me, because I personally admire General McChrystal.",
        "I served under him in Afghanistan in 2004, worked with him last year in 2009.",
        "He's a man of tremendous talents that I really look up to.",
        "On the other hand, as a defense policy analyst and as a student of civil-military relations, I mean, it's a firing offense.",
        "So at this point, I think the president has a very tough decision ahead of him.",
        "He has to decide whether or not he's going to, in essence, allow this firing offense to go unpunished, or if he's not going to dismiss General McChrystal because there's this greater good and that good is stabilizing Afghanistan.",
        "Or, whether it's important to lay down a marker with respect to civil military relations and dismiss the general.",
        "I think it's a really tough decision, and I think that either option carries tremendous risks for both the president as well as the mission in Afghanistan.",
        "And as you pointed out on a blog today, if General McChrystal is allowed to say this without punishment, what do you say to a second lieutenant who mouths off?",
        "Yeah, it's a tough thing.",
        "You know, General McChrystal commanded the 75th Ranger Regiment, a regiment of great tradition, and I served under him in that regiment.",
        "And, you know, when you walk by something that's wrong and you don't correct it, you've just established a new standard.",
        "That's what officers are always taught.",
        "And if you allow a rule to go unenforced, if you allow a situation to go unpunished, then you've, in essence, created a new standard for all those who follow you.",
        "And so it's going to be awfully difficult to discipline a junior officer, for example, if you allow this to go unpunished.",
        "Now, I mean, there are several ways you could work around this.",
        "I mean, you could have General McChrystal resign and then the president not accept his resignation, you could - that would be one option.",
        "But either way, I think that both - any course of action the president takes is going to be one involving tremendous amounts of risk.",
        "Here's an email from Sam(ph) in Wichita.",
        "General McChrystal was telling the truth.",
        "The only reason he's apologizing is to protect his position."

        "Beyond dispute, yeah.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "But on the other hand, I think that General McChrystal is also a canny-enough officer and takes the profession of military officer serious enough to where he knows he's made a mistake here.",
        "He knows that he is not allowed to denigrate or to participate in the denigration of civilian officials in front of, you know, in front of reporters or even in front of his own junior officers.",

        "What really alarmed and angered many in the White House were some public comments he made in London back in the fall during the strategy review as the White House was deciding how many more troops to send to Afghanistan.",
        "And his comments there were viewed by the White House and by his superiors at the Pentagon at the time as being, in some sense, as a rebuke to the White House.",
        "And when President Obama was in Europe, he summoned McChrystal to meet with him and by all accounts, you know, President Obama dressed down General McChrystal.",
        "So, this is not the first offense, and - so for some in the White House who are very concerned about this, they view McChrystal as a recidivist on this regard.",

        "He always goes around the chain of command and he likes attention, as far as the media.",
        "He likes to shoot his mouth off, which is usually very bad for a general let alone along as someone in a lower rank.",
        "And a lot of the officers are not going to say that because somehow, you know, it's code of honor not to say anything bad about another soldier.",

        "Is - the article portrays General McChrystal as somebody who was very much under the radar when he was the head of Special Operations Command and - is what Bob says a fair characterization of him in terms of his role with the media in his role as commander in Afghanistan?",
        "Well, I think that, you know, McChrystal has been coming to this whole world of being a more public military figure, not just in terms of dealing with the press but in terms of dealing with political Washington, dealing with other nations because he is also wearing a NATO hat in his role in Afghanistan.",
        "All of this is somewhat new to him.",
        "And so, we're seeing a general - albeit a four-star general here - commanding the biggest war our nation is fighting.",
        "He is on his own learning curve in terms of all of these things.",
        "And so, while he is trying to take 100,000 or so U.S.",
        "troops and get them to wage a different sort of counterinsurgency fight there, he himself is having to learn how to navigate news interviews, how to navigate a congressional testimony and dealings with civilian officials.",
        "And for somebody who has risen up from that very secretive world in the Special Forces and in the Rangers, that is a big challenge."

        "And the article specifically describes the operation at Marja, which was supposed to be the model for what was going to then happen in Kandahar, as a disaster.",
        "Well - and this may be, perhaps, the biggest concern that folks in the White House have at this point.",
        "It's not simply a set of flippant remarks in a magazine article, but whether the McChrystal strategy is working as they all had hoped.",
        "Now, McChrystal's defenders would say, look, it's still early days.",
        "He still hasn't gotten all of the additional troops that were authorized by the president, that operations like Marja are things that take months, you just - you don't get results in days or weeks.",
        "But some of the early signs have been concerning.",
        "And it's not a question of the performance of U.S.",
        "or NATO forces, but it's broader questions like, are the Afghans willing to step up and work in partnership with international forces to stabilize their country?",
        "Is the Afghan government going to send enough civil servants down to these places to deliver basic services?",
        "Or are the Afghan security forces getting built quickly enough?",
        "Do the Afghan people feel like they need international forces to protect them from the Taliban?",
        "There are some fundamental assumptions that underlie the strategy that looking at it now, essentially six months in from the president's decision to send those additional troops and to fully embrace McChrystal's strategy, critics are asking, well, is all of this working as we had hoped?",
        "And so part of this whole question of should McChrystal stay or go will be wrapped up at the highest levels in terms of an assessment of whether his overall approach is the right one.",

        "If - there's a risk to removing him because you undercut the strategy.",
        "But if the strategy, you think, is not going well, maybe this is exactly the time to remove him.",

        "And second, I think, he got something else correct.",
        "Where you fall down on whether General McChrystal should be dismissed or retained, I think in large part, is going to mirror whether or not you think the strategy is working.",
        "If you think that the strategy is the most appropriate one for Afghanistan, you're going to be more likely to say, okay, civil military relations are important, but the stabilization of Afghanistan is more important.",

        "And if I'm the president of the United States, I'm really frustrated with General McChrystal right now because now I have to make a decision about - between civil military relations and keeping those healthy and establishing a good precedent, and between continuing our strategy in Afghanistan.",
