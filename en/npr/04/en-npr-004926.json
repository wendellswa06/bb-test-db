        "All right, well, if you could find these objects, then what might you do?",
        "Well, if we found one, the first thing to do is to make sure it really is a target - targeted at Earth, and that's part of the problem again, there's uncertainty in measurements.",
        "So you have the fact of those in, have to take measurements over a long period of time.",
        "But if we actually found one that was targeted for Earth, then we need time.",
