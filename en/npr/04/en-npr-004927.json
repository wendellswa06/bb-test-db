        "You could explode a nuclear device next to an asteroid or on an asteroid, or you can use a kinetic impactor, which is one where you simply run into the asteroid with a heavy spacecraft.",
        "Again, if you catch a spacecraft well away from the Earth, and you can just touch it and just give it a very small velocity increment, and that would be enough to keep it from hitting us.",

        "How did that go?",
        "It went very well.",
        "They actually did hit it, and that is an example of what we call a kinetic impactor; that was a small spacecraft relative to what we need to do for an asteroid.",
        "But it was a small spacecraft and it really demonstrated the capability of finding one of these things and hitting it with a body at a relatively high speed.",
        "And so all of these, you know, what you're looking for is something that would actually cross the Earth's orbit.",
        "And you know, we have an asteroid that, as they say, the poster child of these, it's called Apofiz, which is due to make a close approach to Earth in 2029.",
        "And then if it comes right through the right spot would actually come back and hit the Earth in 2036.",
        "And if that hit the Earth, how much damage would it do?",

        "I spent five days at a cultural center on the edge of the Dogbe village in the Baltic region of southern Ghana.",

        "Afterwards, when I asked him how he did it, he replied with a wide smile, `Mind over matter.",
        "He struck me as one of those deep-thinker, heavy outlook-on-life types, so I thought he'd be a good person to ask about my dreams.",
        "He said that dreams are only three- to five-second visions that register in a person's subconscious.",
        "Then he dropped the knowledge that people only remember dreams that affect them emotionally.",
        "I asked Kobe why all of my dreams in Ghana were about Oakland.",
        "He simply said, `Point of reference.",
        "He explained how in Ghana, many students and workers make a living far away from their home villages, but their memories of home stay with them.",

        "And you probably won't find the beautiful color schemes of kente cloth in Oakland, but you will find my boys coordinating their authentic jerseys with their high-tops.",
