        "(Soundbite of applause)",
        "Aides say in private Clinton is still struggling with her own anger and disappointment, but last night she encouraged her delegates to get over it.",
        "I want you to ask yourselves, were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young Marine and others like him?",
        "Were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids?",
        "Were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage?",

        "This will not be easy.",
        "Progress never is.",
        "But it will be impossible if we don't fight to put a Democrat back into the White House."

        "The convention had been buzzing about whether Clinton's embrace of Obama would be heartfelt, but to Harold Ickes, one of her top campaign strategists, there was never any doubt that she would do everything she could to bring the party together.",
        "It's in the country's interest, but it's clearly in her very narrow political self-interest to be for him full-throated.",
        "Anything that could be seen as undermining Obama, says Ickes, could also undermine Clinton's future in the Democratic Party.",
        "If he doesn't win, she will be seen - especially being a Clinton - she will be seen as not having fully supported him and it will be held against her big time by serious constituencies, starting with African-Americans.",
