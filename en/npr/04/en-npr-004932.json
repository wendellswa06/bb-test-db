        "And the way we do that is we make sure we leave Iraq with a security force that is capable of maintaining their own security.",
        "So my proposal is that we do a much better job, and be much more aggressive about training up the Iraqi security forces, so that they can do their job.",
        "Duckworth says her campaign is about more than Iraq.",
        "She cites healthcare, education and the budget.",
        "And while the party leaders who urged her to run agree that war veterans candidates have to address other issues, they believe their military experiences help show no party has the edge on national security.",
        "But not everyone thinks this warrior strategy is a good or fair idea.",
        "Some in the Sixth Congressional District say Duckworth is not only a carpetbagger, her home is a few blocks out of the district line, but she's a latecomer to the political scene who hasn't earned the right to the nomination."

        "The Christine Cegelis campaign put a scare in Republicans in what was Hyde's closest race since he was first elected in 1974; Cegelis appealed to grassroots supporters then.",
        "But her task is complicated this time because she has to take on her own party's leaders, many of whom have poured their money and influence into the Duckworth campaign.",
