        "And it was hard to see at times because it was perpetrated by a physician.",
        "In the book, you write about how you first realized that abuse was taking place.",
        "It took you a while to understand what was happening to you because it was under the guise of medical care.",
        "You write, quote, while I knew something had happened to me that was wrong, \"\"I didn't know yet that the penetration and everything I'd written off as pelvic floor therapy were anything but legitimate.",
        "I was, however, certain that no one would care about a teenage girl getting groped.",
        "Anyone could look around and know that.",
        "The sexual harassment and objectification of women were constantly downplayed.",
        "Rachael, it sounds like there were a couple of difficult things happening here - first, acknowledging the abuse to yourself and then thinking that you wouldn't be believed even if you told someone.",
        "Yeah, there were all of those dynamics.",
        "There was the dynamic of just being able to admit to myself what had happened and be willing to face those realities.",
        "But when I began to do so, what I was faced with at that point was realizing what an uphill battle it was going to be to fight for justice because I knew if I spoke out against Larry, what I was really taking on was a fight against one of the biggest universities in the country.",
        "I was taking on a fight against a national governing Olympic body for the sport that made the most money in the Summer Olympics.",
        "So part of what this memoir catalogs is the journey over the 16 years, not just to my own healing but of putting that case together and of finding the right dynamics to really be able to do that, to take charge of the situation, to take control away from the organizations, including law enforcement organizations, that were shielding and protecting Larry.",
        "You've also spoken publicly, and you've written in this book about some of the dynamics you experienced in the church as well.",
        "You write about experiencing abuse within the church setting as a child.",
        "It involved a college student who sexually abused you.",
        "And when you brought it up, you write - and you write, (reading) as is so often the case, misguided theology and a refusal to interact with experts on the issue had led the church to miss and then cover up sexual abuse within its own walls.",
        "Each time an abuser was found or a scandal uncovered, the response was the same - quietly dismiss the abuser, hush it up, tell no one.",
        "How did you not become jaded by the way you were treated by the church at that time?",
        "That was a significant part of my journey was being able to differentiate what I believe.",
        "You know, my faith actually teaches what I believe, true theology teaches versus the way it was used on me.",
        "And so being able to eventually come down to the point where I can say there is right and wrong and the way that my abuse was handled was wrong.",
        "And to be able to cling to the existence of good and evil outside of the societal response, outside of my community's response, outside of whether or not I ever saw justice on either of my abusers was really a critical part of my healing journey.",
        "In Larry Nassar's statement to the court last year just before he was sentenced, he said he'd been impacted to his inner-most core by the testimony of his victims, including yourself.",
        "But he did not apologize.",
        "He was, though, sentenced to life in prison.",
        "Did you feel resolution walking away from that day?",
        "Wow."

        "But my main problem with Sharpton is the media has positioned him to be the spokesman for the black populous.",
        "And that is incorrect.",
        "And even with that New York Magazine article, which is the most disturbing, I think Baratunde would appreciate this.",

        "…if anything, these candidates have really been looking for the - dealing with some, perhaps, some of the conservative people, conservative - socially conservative people that are on the blogosphere and in the populous to find out what's really going on with black America.",
        "Well, Baratunde, let me follow up on a point that you made a few moments ago…",
        "Yes.",
        "…about the media's responsibility.",
        "I want to delve into that a little bit more deeply.",
        "How much is the media responsible for giving Sharpton this status?",

        "Or has he earned some of that?",
        "I think it's a mix.",

        "I mean, wherever there's police brutality going down, he's one of the first people there.",
        "And so I think he's earned, in some respects, you know - from his work - the right to speak out as much as he can."

        "You've got former mayor Andrew Young saying that Obama is not black enough.",

        "Al Sharpton was very late to Jena.",
        "And - but what happened was once he did show up, all the media interviews went to Al Sharpton.",
        "I, in fact, called a former colleague of mine - as I've mentioned or you may read on my blog, I was a former network news producer -and asked her to tell the editors not to use him for this particular issue because there had been so many people out covering the issue for months before Al Sharpton would even return bloggers, like ours, who were calling the National Action Network to talk to them about it.",
        "Really?",

        "About a dozen activists staged a sit-in.",
        "Police came to the building lobby and led them out in plastic handcuffs as fellow activists sang encouragement.",
        "I once spoke with Karenga here at NPR about the meaning of Kwanzaa and why he created it, which you'll hear a piece of in just a second.",
        "He gave me three reasons: One, to reconnect to our African roots; two, to give us a time to come together in celebration like other cultures do; and three - and this is the real emphasis of Kwanzaa - to underscore the importance of community and family values among black folks all over the world.",

        "So, Carmen, how well does Kwanzaa coexist with Christmas specifically for African-Americans?",
        "Well, I'm not a religious person, but I don't understand why they couldn't coexist in perfect harmony.",
        "One is a religious holiday and one is a spiritual-cultural holiday geared toward promoting certain values.",
