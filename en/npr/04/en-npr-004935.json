        "And the only African-Americans of note that I can think of would probably be the Geechees or the Gullahs of South Carolina who have been able to able to maintain a sense of their African traditions and mores.",
        "So outside of those folk, black people are looking for something.",
        "So I think that it's an effort.",

        "Do you have any idea?",
        "Very few that I know, personally.",
        "Why do you think that is?",
        "I think black folks like their Christmas.",
        "They want that - they want just to keep it, you know?",
        "I mean, it's - we are a Westernized - although, we may be a forced-westernized people, we are heavily Western.",
        "And I think that we've - we're used to seeing even Cabrini-Green projects still expect to see a fat, white man come down a chimney.",
        "It doesn't exist in Cabrini-Green projects.",
        "So I think that's a reality.",
        "I think we are just too - we are caught up in a Westernized culture.",
        "And that's black folks want their Christmas.",
        "Well, certainly, to be fair, Kwanzaa has been around 40 years and Christmas has been around a few more years longer than that.",
        "Baratunde, but…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…what I'd like you to address is - I'm trying to think of the right word because it's not a competition.",
        "It's not a clash.",
        "It's not even a fair comparison.",
        "And yet at the same time, you know, black folks, they may send out Kwanzaa cards.",
        "Some people may know what the different days are.",
        "It just doesn't appear to have taken hold firmly yet.",
        "Do you agree or disagree with that?",
        "I - in my own personal experience, there's been sort of a wave of Kwanzaa.",
        "I mean, my mother, you know, we did the candles every year.",
        "She would actually help spread it through our school whether it's sort of parents' or black students' organization, so we did community celebrations and ceremonies.",
        "And for people who had their history completely kind of ripped out from under them, it's no surprise to me that we're not all necessarily clamming on Kwanzaa which was created in response to that.",
        "In terms of compatibility with Christmas, I agree with Carmen.",
        "There's no real competition.",
        "I mean, I think if Santa Claus and Wal-Mart can coexist with Christmas, then Kwanzaa should have no problem at all.",
        "It's a lot more compatible than either of those."

        "Well, I feel a little cynical about having a day or a week or a month because the problems are so pervasive in black community.",
        "There's a whole bunch of things that need to happen from economic and spiritual growth that need to happen in the community that really is hurting.",

        "We have to start somewhere.",
        "And if anything, if we talk about Christmas with - as I mentioned before, Santa Claus, Saint Nick and that kind of thing, it dealt with a form of paganism, so no one wants to talk about the paganism that's rooted in Christmas.",
        "But when it comes down to our holiday, all of the sudden, well, it's not really a real holiday.",

        "And real things all of a sudden seem totally fake to us, and fake things have this sort of power and the presence of the real.",

        "Why did 2018 feel to you like the year we crossed this threshold?",
        "It was just a year in which there was such a barrage of incidences of news stories both big and small that seemed to involve fakery at scales from the minute to the enormous.",
        "In November, for example, the Justice Department prosecuted a bunch of ad scammers who had more or less created a sort of simulacrum of the Internet where they had fake users making fake mouse movements, clicking on fake websites with fake social media profiles.",
        "And the only real thing on it was the ads.",
        "This was also a year when deepfakes was debuted, this technology that allows you to fake videos in a way that really was previously unforeseen and for basically anybody with a desktop computer to do it.",
        "It was the kind of thing, once you start thinking about it in this way, everywhere you turn you were sort of like, is this real; is this not real?",
        "And at the end, I was sort of realizing every day, when I try to log into The New York Times, I am prodded by a little dialog box that asks me to prove that I'm human and not a bot.",

        "My problem with it is that it has this corrosive effect on how we talk to each other, that if you start to understand how much of what you see online isn't what it represents itself to be, you start to see everything in that same way.",
        "If I can put a really minor example of it forward, I woke up this morning, and on Twitter somebody was going viral for accusing Netflix of having faked a bunch of viral memes about a new movie that they have.",
        "And I looked into it a little bit, and I realized, no, these were all people who, shocking as it might be, really liked this movie \"\"Bird Box.\"\" But we were so used to the idea that this is something that a company might do, that it might seed the world with these AstroTurfed, you know, crowd reactions or whatever that we weren't able to see that, no, these were just regular people who wanted to make jokes about something.",
        "OK, so reading your article, at the end I felt like you had a lot of insights into everything that's fake online.",

        "Well, I'm still trying to figure out if I'm a human or a bot.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "So solving that is my first priority.",
        "You know, I think that the first thing is figuring out what's wrong, that we need to really focus on the idea that this is a problem not of lost truth, which is I know a very popular kind of idea, but that it's a problem of trust - that we no longer are able to trust in institutions, that we are no longer able to trust in each other.",
        "And trust requires networks.",
        "It requires a bunch of different people acting in different arenas to lean on one another and to trust one another.",
        "So it can't just be a thing where we say, oh, Facebook and Google have to develop better technology because the truth is they have fantastic technology for detecting frauds and fakes.",
        "This has to be a thing where people in tech, people in media, people in politics and sort of people everywhere have to be willing to make changes in how they make money, make changes in how they approach people, users, consumers, voters and to recreate that sense of trust in society.",
        "Max Read of New York Magazine talking with us about how much of the Internet is fake, thanks a lot."
