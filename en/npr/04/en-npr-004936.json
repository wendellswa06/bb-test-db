        "She wrote when there were diapers to change and mouths to feed, and then she kept on going.",
        "Nearly 40 years later, Clifton is a literary star.",
        "She has won the National Book Award and she was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize twice in the same year.",
        "Tomorrow, she'll be in Chicago accepting the mother of all awards, the Poetry Foundation's Lilly Poetry Prize.",
        "The Lilly judges a poet's entire body of work.",
        "Lucille Clifton joined us by phone from her Maryland home.",
        "We had a chance to talk about the prize, her legacy and her humble beginnings as a wordsmith.",
        "(Singing) We will, we will walk with you, walk with you.",
        "...only our pictures are much uglier.",
        "But what we had subjects do was to push one button if they found a tool and another button if the fake bag didn't contain a tool.",
        "And when we had them do this in a block of trials where the tool was present half the time--so in half the trials, there was a tool; in half the trials, they were supposed to say no. Well, if they did that, they missed about 7 percent of the tools, but that's not what's going on out there in the real world of baggage screening or medical screening for--in radiology or something of that sort.",
        "There, the targets are much rarer.",
        "So we ran the same study with much rarer tools, and the tools only showed up 1 percent of the time.",
        "If you do that, you have to run thousands and thousands of trials.",
        "But when we did that, the error rates went up from about 7 percent to about 30 percent.",
        "Wow.",
        "Now we don't know if that happens out there in the world, but it's a troubling sort of a finding, given that we have people doing a lot of these sorts of rare-target or low-prevalence search tasks in situations that we consider to be very important, like security at airports.",
        "Let me just repeat what you were saying.",
        "In other words, when a rare tool came through, people sort of missed it.",
        "Well, these were the same tools."

        "We want them...",
        "Yeah.",

        "And we may be built by nature to do search tasks for targets that aren't spectacularly rare.",
        "The mechanisms that control your ability to do visual search were probably designed by nature to help you find raspberries on raspberry bushes or friends in groups of people, not to look for things that only show up one time in a hundred or one time in a thousand.",

        "Well, I--we don't know what's going on in the brain at a neural level.",
        "What we do know is that we think we know where the problem lies.",
        "The problem is: When do you know that it's time to quit searching?",
        "If you find what you're looking for, so if you found a tool or if you're at the airport and you find a knife in somebody's bag, that's no trick.",
        "You know that it's time to quit.",
        "But if there's nothing there, when do you quit?",
        "You can't search forever; the line would get too long at the airport.",
        "So you've got to quit at some point.",
        "How do you decide when it's time to quit?",
        "You end up setting a criterion in your mind that says, `I've searched long enough,' and that criterion is based on the success that you've had to that point."

        "Right.",
        "And if you're doing a search where there are targets some of the time and not there some of the time, you can calibrate yourself pretty well.",
        "But if the targets are very, very rare--well, you can see part of the problem if you imagine that you could be 99 percent successful if you closed your eyes and just said no all of the time.",
        "And the chunks of your brain that are working on setting that quitting criterion and that quitting threshold are being driven into a bad place.",
        "They're being driven to say no much too quickly.",
        "In fact, what we found in the experiment is that typically in these sort of tasks, the time it takes you on average to say `Yes, there is something there' is less than the time it takes you to say no. That makes sense.",
        "You wait around a little while to make sure you didn't miss it.",
        "When the targets were very rare, people were saying no in average amount of time that was faster than the amount of time it takes to say yes, and that's not going to be good.",
        "Well, if the baggage screeners read your paper, is there something that they can do, you know, to up the chances that something rare might be found?",
        "There are a number of things that one might want to try.",
        "For example, one of the things that the radiologists do in many cases--and I think actually has been tried at some baggage-screening centers--is to have two people look at the bags.",
        "If you imagine that these are essentially independent, random sort of mistakes that people are making, if one person has a 30 percent chance of missing a target, two people operating independently would have a 30 percent times 30 percent chance, and that's only 9 percent, and so they'd do much better.",
        "That would be one possible way that you might want to deal with it.",
        "Of course, you're going to need an extra person...",
        "Right.",
        "...at that point.",
        "Right.",
        "What about, you know, putting phony little pictures in there, so that you increase the rate that somebody finds something, so that they'll find the real object?",
        "Well, in fact, that's--the airport people already do that.",
        "That machine that you put your suitcase through on the way through the check-in gate has the ability to project into your bag a gun, bomb or knife.",
        "And if the screener finds it, a little message comes up and says, `Congratulations.",
        "You found one of our fake ones.",
        "Now go and check whether he's carrying something bad for real.",
        "But that way they can keep an eye on how well screeners are doing.",
        "At the present time those are still very rare targets because if you start putting in false targets on every trial or on 50 percent of the trials, again, you'd slow things down quite a bit.",
        "That might not be the most straightforward solution.",

        "When I was young, I'd sit on her lap.",

        "Plus, it's a very difficult task at the airport.",
        "One of the problems is that the machine puts in threats that they've found before.",
        "And if you train people, for example, to see guns and knives and the next thing turns out to be something that we haven't thought of yet, we may actually make it more difficult for them to find it by, in effect, directing their attention to the wrong object.",

        "But my earlier comment was, really, that I guess in the case of screeners, you train and train and train them so that certain objects for them are no longer rare but, in fact, common, even though for the rest of us they might be rare.",
        "And maybe that's kind of simplistic, but that's just what I was thinking at the time.",
        "Oh, the rareness here is not rare in the sense of something that's unusual and hard to recognize, though that's a problem in its own right.",
        "This is the case of if you take a perfectly fine, recognizable object--so in our experiments, for example, a pair of pliers or a screwdriver; everybody knows what that looks like.",
        "The rareness is that it only shows up on one out of every 100 screens that we show you, and that turns out to be the problem.",
        "Our subjects have no trouble recognizing the items when we show them.",
        "It's that when they're rare, you end up quitting your search too quickly.",
        "You're convinced that it's just not going to be there.",
        "Is there a time factor here, where you get tired, you know, after five, 10 minutes, an hour where, you know, you're pretty fresh at the first 15 minutes and you find things, and after a while you're getting to miss those rare objects?",
        "And maybe the answer is just to recycle people through a little faster?",
        "The airport does that, and we did that, too.",
        "We only had people searching for about 20 minutes at a time.",
        "Certainly if you were to put somebody on a search task for hours at a time, you run into fatigue problems that would make matters even worse.",
        "But in this case, it's probably not fatigue that's the problem because, you know, after 20 minutes you get up and wander around.",

        "Well, no. I just had a point to make that I was--I used to work on airplanes through the United States Air Force.",
        "And when we would have problems where, say, a pilot had lost an object into the cockpit of a plane, we'd have to rip the cockpit apart and then conduct searches.",
        "And, of course, 90 percent of the times we wouldn't know what the object was or how he lost it because of communication failure.",
        "But the point I wanted to make is that we would put several different eyes on it.",
        "Say, one person searched for a short amount of time--and I guess you just said that; that the more people that you put against the search, the more likely you are to find the object.",
        "Yes, that's absolutely true.",
        "And another possibility is that what you want to do is to have specialists--one of my colleagues, Kyle Cave at UMass, is interested in the possibility that what you really want to do is have one person looking at this bag for, say, guns and another one looking for knives, so that you'd increase your chance of finding it because you were a specialist in this particular case.",
        "Well, what about having the computer help you out a bit, you know, getting its recognition software a little, you know, better so it finds the things and the people just help out verifying them?",

        "The trick, if you have people just verifying, is that you'd better be sure that the computer is finding everything of interest.",
