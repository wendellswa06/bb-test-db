        "I think that it's a little bit of a different sort of a structure of the task.",
        "Often they're being sent, X-rays, with instructions to go and look at something specific, so they're given more instruction in many cases if you're in a pathology lab.",
        "But there are professions, I gather, where it is very much like the baggage-screening case.",
        "So, for example, my understanding is that at least in England there are a whole--there's a profession of cytologists whose job it is, basically, to look at pap smears, and the job is to look at one after another after another and find the ones that have abnormal cells in them and flag them.",
        "So there's--at least in the sort of abstract sense that we're thinking about the problems, the problems are, really, very similar.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So then you would ask another--you'd get a second opinion on all the slides then if you wanted to have a little better...",
        "Well, that's certainly one way of approaching it--would be to make sure that you get two eyeballs on the--well, then I suppose it would be four eyeballs on the same slide.",
        "And...",
        "But do we have any data that shows that that would actually improve things?",
        "I mean, if this second person is also getting tired of looking at stuff, how we do know, you know, if--logically it says it would happen, but would it make a really significant dent?",
        "The radiologists think it does.",
        "I--they have data that says that having two eyes cuts down on the number of errors vs. having only a single observer.",
        "So what do you say to all these screeners?",
        "What is the take-home message from your research?",
        "Well, I think the take-home message, from everything that I learn about the baggage-screening task, for example, is that it's a very difficult task; that there are lots of pieces of it that make it difficult.",
        "This would just be one possible contributing factor, which might be pushing people towards more errors.",
        "And I suppose the take-home message is let's go and try a few things that might make your life a little bit easier, whether it's a different style of training or having an extra pair of eyes looking at the screen; that we should appreciate how difficult it is to actually find threats in bags or, for that matter, tumors in mammograms and work to make it easier."

        "So it may be rare in the material they're looking at, but it's common in their experience.",
        "Do you have any...",
        "Whoops.",
        "That's the experiment for next year, or one of the experiments for next year.",
        "It's certainly the case that training is important.",
        "We got around that by using common objects, like screwdrivers.",
        "But if you or I took a look at a mammogram, even if the radiologist told you there was a tumor there, you wouldn't know where it was because you wouldn't know what to look for.",
