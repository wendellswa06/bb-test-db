        "Yes, I have.",
        "What's your take away?",
        "Well, in my own personal opinion of the movie, it was - cinematically, it was great.",
        "But the language was nothing different than what you hear on TV nowadays, than you hear in hip-hop lyrics.",
        "And I'm an a fan of hip-hop, but, I mean, you hear his type of language in black communities all the time.",
        "A lot of the...",
        "You're talking about the use of the N word, I assume.",
        "The use of the N word, exactly.",
        "So I don't understand why people are all up in arms about it.",
        "I mean, because everyone is using that word, it doesn't matter what race they are - every one is using it now.",
        "The other thing that I took away from it was the - a lot of the stereotypes in the movie still - are still in black communities.",
        "I'm from the South.",
        "I'm from the South.",
        "I was growing up under grandparents who were from slave tradition and I've seen a lot of what happens in these types of situations between black and white.",
        "So for me, it was just the reality check, but I did enjoy the movie.",
        "All right.",
        "That's Hayes in Houston, Texas.",
        "Let me take another call here from Noah in Durham, North Carolina.",
        "Lots of phone calls here from the Southern part of the country.",
        "Noah, you saw the film?",
        "What was your take away?",
        "My take away was that it really was a movie about the filmic representation and creation of a hero, and that Tarantino is trying to encourage us to get back to the old style of movie-going, where you go see a movie and then come out and debate it and talk about and question it.",
        "So the generation of the dialogue is, in a way, part of the point.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "In fact, thank you so much, Noah, calling from Durham, North Carolina.",
        "That's another point that Henry Louis Gates made in his piece for The Root.",
        "Gates wrote this: Whether you liked \"\"Django's\"\" post-modern take on slavery or not, one of its most salutary effects is that it's generated a greater conversation about the enslavement of our ancestors than any that I have witnessed, perhaps, since \"\"Roots\"\" because our society has long been in denial about African-American slavery, America's original sin since well before its abolition.",
        "I would hope we all might agree that this is a very good thing, a necessary discussion that is long overdue.",
        "And then we have this writing from Jelani Cobb, who's the director of the Institute of African-American Studies at the University of Connecticut.",
        "She called \"\"Django Unchained,\"\" Tarantino's most clever film to date.",
        "But he said, the premise of the film propagates historical myths about slavery.",
        "He says this in The New Yorker: Is this how Americans actually perceive slavery?",
        "More often than not, the answer to that question is answered in the affirmative.",
        "It's precisely because of the scant mythology of black subservience that these scenes pack such a cathartic payload.",
        "The film's defenders are quick to point out that \"\"Django\"\" is not about history.",
        "But that's almost like arguing that fiction is not reality.",
        "It isn't, but the entire appeal of the former is its capacity to shed light on how we understand the latter.",
        "In my 16 years of teaching African-American history, one sadly common theme has been the number of black students who shy away from courses dealing with slavery out of shame that slaves never fought back."

        "Peter, you watched the film.",
        "What did you take away from it?",
        "Well, I saw it in an audience - a mixed-race audience - and it reminded me of the experiences I had growing up in the '60s and '70s and seeing films like this that - it tends to bring people together.",
        "It addresses hard issues, but with entertainment, and there are clear-cut villains and clear-cut good guys in these movies.",
        "And there wasn't anyone rooting for the slave masters.",
        "There wasn't anyone rooting for the violent people in the town.",
        "They were rooting for Django and his partner.",

        "And we are talking about \"\"Django Unchained\"\" and what many of you took away from it, and we wanted to give you some of the takeaways that critics and historians have had.",
        "Django Unchained\"\" is not the only blockbuster film, you remember, that takes on slavery.",
        "Steven Spielberg's film, \"\"Lincoln,\"\" that was - was released just a couple of months before \"\"Django,\"\" this time from the perspective of the 16th president.",
        "And in comparing these two movies, journalist Marc Ambinder called \"\"Django\"\" probably the best movie about slavery ever.",
        "Quentin Tarantino's trademark style ensures that every historical point he wants the viewer to get is gotten, even to the point of ridiculous.",
        "And it is a ridiculous film.",
        "It is funny, Mark writes.",
        "The dialogue is spare and modern, the Southern accents not very well rendered, the visual effects hematologically generous, the soundtrack absurdist and raw.",
        "But this allows the director to show the viewer - well, force into the viewer's eyes and ears - the epic tale of slavery.",
        "It's precisely because the plot is so absurd and some of the characters so imaginatively drawn, that the stuff that fascinated Tarantino about the subject is intelligible.",
        "When off-the-hook characters do something, you notice.",
        "Django's\"\" plot is totally implausible, unlike \"\"Lincoln,\"\" which pretty much happened the way Kushner described.",
        "But I think \"\"Django\"\" conveys a better gut sense of what slavery - and, by proxy, what the Civil War was all about.",
        "Both movies are great.",
        "One makes you cry: The white men did something right; the country realized its mistake and began to atone for it with constitutional amendments.",
        "The other makes your innards turn: You'll know how utterly evil, insane and unique the practice of American slavery was and why political and legal transformations are still, today, not enough to expiate our shame.",
        "So I want to hear from Jay(ph) in Baltimore, Maryland.",
        "Where you wanted to get your gut check on \"\"Django,\"\" what did you come away with?",
        "I came away with two different points: one where Django was, you know, watching the slave being torn apart from the dogs and all, and he was able to deal with that, you know, that whole act and that kind of thing in order to get what he wanted."

        "Devon writes this: There are predominantly two kinds of violence in the film: one, violence against African-Americans in the context of slavery, which is unflinching and brutally painful to watch - example, the Mandingo fight scene - two: violence against the perpetrators of slavery, which is gleeful and cartoonish and a grotesque catharsis against the brutal violence of the slavers.",

        "We laughed together, we sat on the edge of our seats together and we cheered on Django together.",
        "But when I re-watched the film with an older white audience, there was no energy in the theater, no joy, no laughter and no relief.",
