        "And I can tell you that, you know, if this was to happen, you know, in my own - my - Catholic family, my friends who are Catholic, you know, if their daughter - if their - someone wants to marry a Muslim, this would be a topic of discussion.",
        "This would be a serious discussion.",
        "And I think this is - the show tackles it in a very honest way.",
        "These are just people living their lives.",
        "And the five families that are in the show are, you know, it's a nice, diverse - if you will - cross-section of people in America.",
        "And I think the show kind of tackles the sensitive issue without sensationalism.",
        "And I give credit to TLC for not taking the \"\"Jersey Shore\"\" route.",
        "And, you know, what we see here are just human people, you know, human beings with their human emotions - very real, very honest - you know, tackling the sensitive issue of, you know, here their daughter is Arab-American and Muslim, and she's marrying a man who's Irish Catholic.",
        "And the brother is saying listen, is he converting for the right reasons?",
        "And for him, the right reason is, you know, for the faith.",

        "You want to use your one, rare opportunity in the mainstream media to tell all the stories, right, to show all the representations.",

        "I say, well, not really.",

        "You know, to see a family that's African-American or Indian or Pakistani or like us, white Americans in a small town, would be much more ...",
        "Well, Susan, can you appreciate the difficulties of the producers who were trying to get in one, small area and focus on five families, pretty much who know each other and are grouped around a single - you can do a Muslim representation; it's hard to do the Muslim representation.",
        "I know.",
        "I just think it's so narrow.",
        "And honestly, the very small proportion of Muslims and taking all of them in that group that it was almost like - I don't know, in a way, I think it might have been exploitive of what they wanted to show - showing things that I would never see in my community, like situations with people running nightclubs and stuff.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Basically look, it's just - it's five families, it's five stories, right?",

        "You know, that's not what a (foreign language spoken) Muslim woman does.",
        "Well, Muslims do all sorts of stuff.",
        "You know, she opens up a nightclub, and you won't.",
        "So when it's time to tell your story, you know...",

        "And you know, it's reflective of life, right?",
        "And what I was saying is look, when it comes to Muslim-American representation, a lot of people from our communities want all of our representations to be avatars of perfection, right?",

        "That's the immigrant code.",

        "You know, human beings are flawed.",

        "So you have this lady who, you know, is opening up a nightclub.",
        "There is dissention within the community, which is showed - which is reflected on the show, and then you also have, you know, very, quote-unquote, traditional practicing Muslim women who voluntarily choose to wear the hijab, who take issue with her decision to open up the nightclub.",
