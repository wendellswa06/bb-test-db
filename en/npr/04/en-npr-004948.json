        "Then she prayed to me.",
        "And she cried so piteously.",
        "She said, I, I, I just had come down the steps, had gone to your room and you weren't in, and its 2:30 or 3 o'clock in the morning.",
        "And I thought of what that man did to you in St. Louis when you were a little girl, seven years old, and I thought maybe someone was taking advantage of you, and I was about crazy."

        "Well, it was so gradual that they became woven into the psyche which is the fabric of my psyche.",

        "We should also point out, a big reason why she was following you in those early daylight hours - she had a gun along with her.",
        "She wanted to protect you.",
        "Absolutely.",
