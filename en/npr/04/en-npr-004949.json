        "Tara Setmayer, let me--put your strategist hat on, if you will.",
        "When dealing with clients and talking about those running for high-profile positions such as Senate or Congress, many of these men and women are rich, quite frankly, and have to do--and you would, I bet--do due diligence in terms of financial records and the like.",
        "How problematic is it in making sure that most folks are clean or clean up prior to going in front of the ballot?",
        "Well, I, as a strategist, always put forth a policy of being forthright, because it will come back to haunt you if you try to hide issues like this.",
        "So what his folks did, knowing that he is raising his national profile in anticipation of an '08 presidential run, they said, `Listen, we know that this is something that has plagued you in the past.",

        "What they didn't anticipate is that this would launch two federal investigations.",

        "And then he won't have to worry about this.",
        "And any opposition in '08 will no longer be able to use this as an issue, because Bill Frist has had a rather squeaky-clean image as a working heart surgeon and a senator.",
        "He made a point to go--not be a part of the family business and become a heart surgeon.",
        "He never worked in any hospitals that were run by the family business, and the lobbyists were allowed to contact them.",
        "So he's been aware of this potential conflict of interest, and he set up a blind trust which is, under Senate rules, allowable the way it's set up.",

        "There's, you know, SAG which represents movie stars and recently the Ford Motor Company in Detroit cut 400 white-collar jobs.",
        "Now, Bill, does this mean that labor issues should be more important to white-collar workers, and if so, why haven't they been?",
        "Labor issues have always been important to white-collar workers.",
        "Part of the problem is that the way that the National Labor Relations Act was structured particularly with the Taft-Hartley amendments in the '40s made it more difficult for white-collar and so-called managerial workers to legally unionize.",
        "There was also a certain amount of self-deception or illusion that was promoted that said that they didn't need to organize.",
        "Now on the part of the union movement, unfortunately too many union leaders had insufficient vision to recognize that they needed to organize in the newer work forces.",

        "And, Stan, what about that issue?",
        "I mean, from your perspective, dealing with labor relations from a different point of view, do you think that white-collar workers should be concerned with unionizing?",
        "Well, I think especially in the public sector, it's very pervasive because as I'm sure many of your listeners know nearly half of all the unionized workers in America today are in the public sector and a very large percentage of those employees are, you know, in professions like teaching.",
        "That's a big share of them.",
        "So, of course, in the public sector, unionism for white-collar workers is already a major issue.",
        "I think, though, you're kind of suggesting that as a result of these layoffs of white-collar workers at Ford, that that should be something that would encourage them to consider unionizing.",
        "And given that the data recently cited by the Labor Research Association, which is a pro-union think tank in New York City, shows that the layoffs in the manufacturing sector between '99 and 2004 were twice as big in percentage terms for unionized workers as they were for non-unionized workers in manufacturing.",
        "I don't know why white-collar Ford employees would think that they'd benefit from unionizing with regard to job security.",
        "Well, Bill, what about that?",
        "Do unions actually at this point in time offer protection?",
        "Unions are certainly going through a turbulent period.",
        "Are they effective today?",
        "It's better for a worker to be unionized than not.",
        "The problem that workers across the country face is the complete and total disregard of national relations enacted in the law, the ability of companies, for example, to declare bankruptcy and thereby to avoid paying pensions, to restructure their collective bargaining agreements.",
        "So the issue isn't just whether people want unions.",
        "The data is fairly clear that more than half of non-union workers would love at this moment to join a former union.",
        "Well, that's what one survey says.",
        "It's more than one survey.",
        "And...",
        "Well, there's another survey recently done by John Zogby who's a pretty well-known pollster which indicates that it's roughly 35 percent of workers who would, you know, consider joining a union and only about half of those say they would definitely vote for a union given the opportunity.",
        "So I know there's a poll out by Peter Hart, although we haven't seen the wording of that poll, which gives a different result, but I wouldn't necessarily go by the Peter Hart poll as something that's...",

        "That being said, again, I go back to what this does to voters when you see the even alleged improprieties talked about when it comes to Washington, the White House, Congress, etc. So many people have become so disillusioned when it comes to politicians, is this just another notch in the belt?",

        "I think Roland makes a good point.",
        "We do see in politics a very short memory on these things, so it depends on whether this investigation goes long and whether they do decide that there was some information that he might have had that he thought the public had that they did not.",
        "Can a politician, Roland Martin, to use Rochelle's analogy of the Martha Stewart factor, reap the benefits that Martha Stewart seemed to after the fact, the idea that she, quite frankly, came out richer out of prison than she did going in?",
