        "But people will question whether--since this appearance of a conflict of interest has been questioned for some time, why he finally decided to eliminate that appearance of a conflict of interest a month before the stock dropped.",
        "All right.",

        "All right.",
        "Talking about the 2008 election, that brings the name Hillary Clinton to mind, and we thought it might be interesting to ask this question today, as ABC is ready to premiere the highly touted \"\"Commander-in-Chief,\"\" which puts a female president in the Oval Office.",

        "Whether that's acceptable or not, we can debate that all day long.",

        "I would love to see Colin Powell run and have those white Republicans have to actually go in there and pull that lever or punch that ballot, to see if they'd actually do it vs. telling a poller.",
