        "CHIDEYA What is the purpose?",
        "You have been at the top of one of the most major unions in America.",
        "What do you really believe is the purpose of a union in terms of shaping the ability of workers to chart their path at an organization on a very basic level because not everyone is in a workplace that has any unionized workers.",
        "It's almost exactly what you said.",
        "It's the giving the workers the right to collectively discuss their future and to work together to collaborate to improve their living standard and to work with other workers in their geographic area or their industry to determine their future.",
        "That's the purpose of the union.",
        "And what happens is when the employer has the ability to intimidate workers, when an employer can fire a worker for exercising his rights under the National Labor Relations Act and it takes years to get the worker reinstated, why should it surprise us that workers are afraid to organize?",
        "So this is one of the issues that we have to talk about if we're going to say that we actually have a democracy.",
        "Now if we want to admit that we don't, then it's a different discussion, but if we're saying that there should be democracy, if we're saying as the National Labor Relations Act said that the public policy of this country should be to support collective bargaining, a point that I think would be interesting to reiterate to President Bush, then we have a different discussion.",
        "Stan, let me just jump in and direct you to a very specific example.",
        "You have Dutch bank ABN AMRO announcing that it's going to cut 1,500 jobs and outsource them to India.",
        "How does the whole idea of globalization fit into the delicate dance between employers and employees surrounding unions and labor issues?",
        "Well, I'd like to point out in that context that late last year, Morton Bahr, who was until very recently the president of the Communications Workers of America and I guess he just retired, but he acknowledged that 39 percent of all jobs leaving the US through outsourcing are union jobs, even though just 14 percent of US jobs in manufacturing are unionized and it's only about 8 percent of the jobs in the private sector unionized.",
        "So clearly, you know, from the perspective of Morton Bahr, unionization is not a deterrent to outsourcing.",
        "In fact, you know, based on that statistic, it would be, you know, a factor promoting outsourcing.",
        "And I found what Mr. Fletcher is saying here astonishing because, you know, I regularly look at Mr. Fletcher's work on the Web site called House of Labor and a larger Web site called TPMCafe, and, you know, he's focusing here entirely on--and I can't address everything he's saying, but on employer opposition to unionization as the cause of the decline in unionization.",
        "And yet there was an article on that Web site recently I thought was excellent.",
        "And it might even have been by Mr. Fletcher.",
        "I can't recall at the moment, but it was on Progressive Grocer magazine and the author of that article--again, it's on a pro-union Web site, a Web site to which Mr. Fletcher regularly contributes--was talking about how this magazine showed that grocers--they focus entirely on the customers' needs in deciding how to manage the store.",
        "And he wished that union officials would exhibit a similar concern toward the needs of rank and file members and suggested that that would do a lot to reverse the decline in unionization.",
        "And yet, you know, when Mr. Fletcher gets on the air here today, he's talking only about employer opposition as the explanation for declining unionization.",
        "I think that's ridiculous and I think he knows it's ridiculous because he don't want to...",
        "But let me--before we start...",
        "...say it here in this forum.",
        "...hurling personal accusations, let me just jump in.",
        "There is also an issue in some cases--and I'm thinking specifically of the teachers union where people who are members of the union are split over whether or not the union itself has the right policy.",
        "Some teachers that we have spoken with are very much in favor of teacher union policy.",
        "Other ones think, `Well, you know what?",
        "We need to be more aggressive at kicking out bad teachers.",
        "From your perspective, Bill, what are the reforms that need to happen within the labor movement in order to move it forward?",
        "Well, let me say that I did focus on employer resistance because I believe that's the principal problem, but I think that it's absolutely right to point out that the union movement has been stuck.",
        "It's been stuck in a framework that is decades out of reality and that part of what was just made referenced to is that there needs to be, in fact, a different connection between the leadership and the base, that one of the things, for example, that we need to institute it seems to me immediately, we need to have a different kind of internal education and a referendum process.",
        "In other words, there needs to be far greater debate in unions about the direction that the unions are going and that what ends up happening when you don't have that debate, when the leadership believes that it can simply make those decisions, then, of course, the members are going to feel alienated.",
        "So I'm absolutely a very staunch critic of existing trade unionism and think that in order for unionism to revive itself, it has to fundamentally reform itself.",
        "What about that perspective, Stan?"

        "Well...",
        "You are hearing from someone who--you criticized Bill Fletcher for...",
        "...I appreciate that comment, but I think, you know, you have to go further because, you know, what he's talking about is more right to dissent within a union, more debate within unions, but I think that you're going to find that unless there's that right for the individual to decide for himself or herself whether or not he or she benefits from unionization, you're not going to have the right to debate within the union irrespective.",
        "It kind of pertains to the system that Lenin advocated in the old Soviet Union.",
        "He said, you know, `Well, there's no debate outside the Communist Party but there's maximum debate within the Communist Party.'",
        "OK.",
        "All right, Bill.",
        "Let's...",
        "Now I know it's in theory but it didn't last for very long, did it, after all the unions ...(unintelligible).",
        "I'm going to let Bill respond to that and then I have one final question before you gentlemen...",
        "I just think that that's sophistry, you know, when you introduce that.",
        "I mean, the issue is this.",

        "Stan, let's deal with sophistry, all right?",
        "Look it up in the dictionary.",
        "When we think about the issue or the ability of a worker to dissent from joining a union, I'll concede this point.",
        "I'd say if we want to have a situation where the employer has absolutely nothing to do with the unionization process, that is, the employer cannot say anything, cannot intimidate workers, etc., then you and I should have another discussion, but until that moment happens, then I'm not putting the burden of the problem with unionization primarily on the unions themselves because the power relationship is fundamentally different.",
        "The employer can say to the worker, `If you unionize, I'm going to have to think about moving.'",
        "I'm going to have to jump in, gentlemen.",
        "We have one final question before we're ready to go, and it's a very critical and important question.",
        "Hurricane Katrina wiped out thousands of homes and businesses and jobs.",
        "What do you think is going to rebuild the lives of people affected by that hurricane?",
        "Will it be the union movement?",
        "Will it be a federal jobs program like the WPA?",
        "I'm going to start with you, Stan, and please keep your answers brief, gentlemen.",
        "I'll try.",
        "I don't think that in today's America it's either the union movement by and large--I'm not going to say they won't participate, but the union movement by and large or the federal government that's going to be the engine that gets these people back to work.",
        "The market system that we have here in the US is going to be playing the primary role in getting these people working and feeding their families again.",
        "All right.",
        "Bill, briefly.",
        "First, we have to have a president who recognizes the depth of the crisis and is not simply flying over the area and saying, `This is really too bad.",
        "There needs to be real leadership.",
        "There is no leadership coming from the White House.",
        "The second, we have to have a recovery plan that really is thinking about--let's--all right--putting people to work to recover, to rebuild the area.",
        "There does need to be some sort of special unemployment compensation that helps the families survive in an X number of months because we're not just talking about days.",
        "We're absolutely talking about months, and we cannot rely on the forces of the market in large part because if you look at the South and the level of segregation, there is too great a danger that leaving market forces to play will, in fact, mean that there'll be a disparate treatment in terms of who gets served and who is not.",
        "I'm going to have to cut you off right there.",
        "We've just been listening Bill Fletcher.",
        "He's now with the TransAfrica Forum and a former executive of the AFL-CIO, and also with Stan Greer, senior research associate for the National Institute for Labor Relations Research.",
