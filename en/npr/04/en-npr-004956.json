        "And we have a story going in tomorrow's paper saying, based on the evidence of one of Biti's lawyers, Lewis Uriri, who says that he's not being interrogated not on the phony charges of treason, but by members of the Central Intelligence Organization, this is like the top thugs in the regime.",
        "And they want to know from Biti what was said by their own ministers, the Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa and the Labor Minister Nicholas Goche, and what behind the scenes.",
