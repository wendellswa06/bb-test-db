        "I have great respect for what he did during the 1970s, and for a little bit of the '80s, in terms of trying to build a new country out of what had been an exceptionally racist and unequal environment.",
        "And I even had some sympathy for his efforts to disempower a white, small minority who had been exercising extreme power over the economic life of his country."

        "He's not pursued a policy which is going to overcome the inequities of the society.",
        "He's essentially pursued a policy which is designed to help his own cronies, to help his henchmen and to conserve his position in power.",
        "And so, the sympathy that many of us felt for him long ago has finally dissipated, and we've all been able to see this for what it is, which has been well-described as a campaign of terror against his own people",

        "My suggestion is reconciliation or negotiation with the president of Zimbabwe, because I think that the military intervention would destroy the country, and with the negotiation, it would save lives and save the infrastructure of the country instead.",
        "Reconciliation with President Mugabe would be giving him some advantage when he steps out from the regime and making sure that the money that the AU would spend to kill people, or to destroy the country would be spent in to put the leader in a way where he feels that he will be safe when he steps out from the regime.",
        "And I think this is going to be like in the case of all dictators in the third world, because most of them stay in the regime just because they're feeling that when they step out, all the tribes and all their quarries (ph) will revenge from them.",
        "Yes, well, to take revenge on them, yes.",
        "David Hearst, that's been discussed as part of a possible package agreement with Mr. Mugabe and others in ZANU-PF and maybe in the military, some protection against prosecution.",
        "And also a prospect of a package of loans and grants to Zimbabwe to help it in a transition period once the Mugabe regime cedes power",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, I think there are a wide range of possibilities.",
        "But the last thing you said is the crucial point, once Mugabe cedes power.",
        "He has to go first.",
        "This is not a repeat of the Kenyan situation, where, after disputed election and 1,500 deaths, you had a foreign diplomatic intervention and the sitting president, Mwai Kibaki, ceded power or had a power-sharing agreement with his main challenger, Raila Odinga, for a very simple reason, that there can be no situation in which - or no credible situation in which Mugabe carries on as president and Tsvangirai his executive prime minister.",
        "And this is a real problem.",
        "Mugabe has to go first",
        "There is - is there any belief that those who are ruling with him, again the hardliners that the ambassador mentioned in ZANU-PF, and of course, military leaders as well, but that they will simply ask Mr. Mugabe to go after a decent interval, after this Friday's sham election, and then appoint someone to take over and who might be someone more acceptable",
        "I honestly can't answer that question.",
        "I don't think anyone can.",
        "I think the situation is very unpredictable.",
        "It's very, very unstable.",
        "As the ambassador said, there are plenty of indications of splits in the army, lots of tip-offs and cells, so the MDC officials know when to flee, because someone is phoning up and saying, look, an army convoy is on its way to arrest you.",
        "So, we know that there are plenty of the MDCs, plenty of sympathizers within the police and the army and I'm sure there are elements in ZANU-PF who'd certainly form part of a national unity government."

        "There has to be an AU statement or SADC statement saying, we do not recognize these results as legitimate",

        "Because the British had control a lot longer than Mugabe, and they never had any elections for blacks.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So I feel that your British commentator, and any of the British commentators, are extremely disingenuous because of their proud knocks and just basically robbing, looting and stealing, and then they poisoned the water with anthrax when they left.",
        "So I don't think the British figure in it at all.",
        "And I think that Mugabe and Zimbabwe can solve their problems without the West.",
        "It might not be within the same timeframe that the West needs, because the West needs to get in there and steal their resources now, and that might not be possible.",

        "We have a situation here where some three million people have had to flee Zimbabwe, where infant mortality rates have zoomed up to almost astronomic levels.",

        "There's also a concern, though, about protecting taxpayers, and for Democrats in particular, about protecting homeowners.",
        "You know, it doesn't look very good to be helping Wall Street that funded the housing bubble if you're not at the same time providing some relief for homeowners who've seen their home values drop and who are struggling to pay their mortgage.",
        "There's also an economic calculation there, because if you can help people to stay in their homes paying something on their mortgage, then these distressed securities will be worth more in the long run than if those homeowners just leave the keys on the table and walk away.",
        "Scott, how did it get to the point where the government is debating this kind of expenditure, $700 billion in a single weekend?",
        "Well, you know, for months now, Liane, the government has basically been putting out financial fires: Bear Stearns six months ago, Fannie and Freddie more recently, just this past week AIG.",
        "And each time the Fed or the Treasury would douse one fire, another would pop up somewhere else.",
        "In effect, we've just got a lot of dead wood from all these bad mortgage securities just waiting to burn.",

        "Well, if it works out right, a restored confidence in the financial markets, and that's good for the stock market.",
        "And if the credit crunch is eased, it should make it easier for people and businesses to borrow money and grow.",
        "It's also true that the $700 billion may not be down the drain.",
        "The idea is that the government would hold these securities for a time until the market stabilizes, and then sells them.",
        "So if the government pays, say, 50 cents on the dollar and ultimately they wind up being worth 75 cents, the taxpayers make a profit.",
        "If they wind up being 30 cents, the taxpayer's lost a lot of money.",
