        "Remind us why these protestors want this prime minister to resign, exactly.",
        "They say this prime minister is basically doing the bidding of the last prime minister - the deposed Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.",
        "And they say that he's doing everything in his power to make sure that Thaksin can return to Thailand and basically keep pulling the strings here, even though the military had the coup against Thaksin two years ago, and even though this government of Samak Sundaravej was democratically elected in December 2007.",
        "But nonetheless, they say he's just absolutely done nothing.",
        "All he's done is (unintelligible) Thaksin, that he's corrupt and that he's accomplished nothing in the seven months since this government took power.",
        "And any chance that the protestors will prevail, that he'll actually resign?",
        "And if so, what does that do to Thailand?",
        "I think there's very, very little chance that Samak will resign.",
        "In fact, he said he's not going to do it.",
        "I think there's very little chance that this demonstration's legs will last.",
        "I mean, it seems like there are fewer people here today than there were yesterday.",
        "I suspect there'll be a lot more people after work.",
        "But I think this thing may have crested last night.",
        "I mean, I was here about midnight last night, and there were tens of thousands of people here last night.",
        "And many of them were forming this protective cordon around the nine PAD leaders who the arrest warrants have been issued for.",
        "And the atmosphere here was very, very tense late last night.",
        "And people expected a confrontation.",
        "They thought one was going to happen, and it didn't.",
        "And today I saw the riot police that were stationed behind the building, many of them actually withdrew today.",
        "And you know what I think?",
        "I think the government is trying to wait these protestors out.",
        "They're going to let them sit here and there're going to let this thing sort of dissipate fizzle out, even though the protestors said that they're going to carry on until the government resigns.",
        "Well, and, you know, just finally, what would that mean if this protest just dissipates?",
        "In the long term, has this been sort of a political blip for Thailand?",
        "I don't think so, because we've had this political uncertainty basically since the original protest launched by this same group started against the deposed Prime Minister Thaksin in 2005.",
        "I mean, basically, you have this very deep divide between what I guess you could call a Bangkok elite and the rest of the country.",
        "Thaksin was very good at exploiting that divide.",
        "And he was reelected several times by the vast majority of the people here who are poor and who do not necessarily agree with the policies of the Bangkok-based political groups who are a part of the PAD's base here.",
        "Originally, there was some hope that an institution might buy the collection.",
        "Now, the best guess is that the photographs will end up in the hands of hundreds of collectors.",
        "The photographs at Sotheby's are on view until the auction."
