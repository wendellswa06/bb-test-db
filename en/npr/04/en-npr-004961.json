        "You were thrown in the deep end and you learned a lot, and you know, you had to pretend, I think, to be more of an expert than you were, especially in our area, in finance.",
        "In his memoir, for example, Obama recalls writing an article about interest-rate swaps - financial contracts in which parties agree to swap fixed and floating interest rates.",
        "His time at Business International rates only a few pages in the memoir, mostly as an example of the road not taken, when Obama opted for community organizing instead of what he called stocks and bonds and the pull of respectability.",
        "Armstrong says Obama's book exaggerates just how respectable Business International was, with its description of suits and ties and meetings with German bond traders.",
        "There was no dress code, Armstrong said.",
        "And there was nothing corporate about it.",
        "It was a company full of low-paid, hard-working, fun-loving young people.",
        "It wasn't part of this high-powered consulting or finance world.",
        "It was a little sweatshop.",
        "Armstrong says he was shocked when Obama quit after a year, without even having another job lined up.",
        "Most news accounts of Obama's career omit the New York chapter altogether.",
        "Levine, his former office mate, says she understands that.",
        "I can see why CNN would skip over it.",
        "I mean, a lot of people, you know, had stops along the way in their careers that don't exactly fit the rest of the story.",
        "And maybe it was enough of an exposure for him to the corporate world to be kind of like, OK, well, that's not exactly what I want.",
        "Still, researching and writing about hedges and forwards and currency fluctuations did give Obama at least a passing familiarity with the financial markets that's still evident today.",
        "Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was surprised to learn that Obama had worked for Business International, which is now part of The Economist Group.",
        "But he wasn't surprised that Obama was a quick study.",
        "If he has a thought and you disagree, he wants to make sure he understands the other side of the issue.",
        "And my impression, at least, is that he's got a good feel for financial markets and how they might react to what government does.",
        "And he's got a good feel for it.",
        "Financial markets have grown much more complex since Obama was writing about them in the 1980s.",
        "And maybe he would have developed that same feel for the markets even without the job at Business International.",
        "But first colleague Levine says it was a good start.",
        "We definitely learned our ABCs of the financial markets at BI.",
        "There's probably no question about that."

        "Mr. Obama said he would hold the BP energy company responsible.",
        "I want every businessperson here in Florida to know that I will be their fierce advocate in making sure that they are getting the compensation they need to get through what is going to be a difficult season.",
        "Later this evening, President Obama will take this issue to the nation in an address from the Oval Office.",
        "Joining us to anticipate that speech is NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.",
        "Mara, what should we expect to hear the president say tonight?",
        "I think you're going to hear him lay out his plan for going forward.",
        "If that press conference he had a couple weeks ago was all about accepting blame for what had gone wrong and the deficiencies in the federal response, this is going to be about what happens next, how to make sure this kind of spill doesn't happen again, how to contain the oil, how to restore the Gulf environment to its prior state.",
        "And you're going to hear him give more details about this new streamlined claims process that he wants to set up, funded by BP, administered by an independent body that would make people and businesses who suffered economic damages from the spill whole.",
        "I think he has two big challenges tonight.",
        "One is to show that he's on top of this and, at the same time, he has to lower expectations for any quick and easy solution."

        "The stakes for him are very high.",
        "Presidents are judged by how they respond to crises, the things they can't anticipate or control.",

        "And I think his image as a strong and effective leader is at stake.",
        "So is the public's trust in the basic competence of government.",
        "It's very difficult because the government has so little power to control this or fix it immediately.",
        "But what people want in a crisis is immediate government action, even people who are otherwise skeptical of government intervention.",
        "Given the stakes, does it make sense for President Obama to try to widen this discussion beyond the spill and beyond the Gulf and even oil itself, to talk about the overall problem of energy, the global issue of climate change when the country is so fixated on what's happening in the Gulf and holding BP responsible?",
        "Well, you know, there are people - some people believe that if you have a problem that's difficult to solve, make it bigger.",
        "And I think tying this crisis to the need to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel is something that the president has decided to do.",
        "I think you'll hear him talk about it tonight.",
        "He wants to use the spill as leverage for a climate bill.",
        "And while the spill does underscore the need to move away from our dependence on fossil fuels, foreign and otherwise, the details of a bill and how to get bipartisan support for it remain very, very difficult and there is a risk.",
        "He's going to put a lot of presidential attention and capital into finding the votes for this bill.",
        "He's going to spend less time talking about jobs and the economy, which is still the number one issue for voters, as you know.",
        "Now, we will no doubt hear a lot of reaction after the speech from Republicans and other critics of the president.",
        "Do we have a sense of what they might be saying?",
        "Well, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell went to the floor today.",
        "He gave a prebuttal of the president's speech.",
        "He says the president has failed to unite the country in the wake of this crisis.",
        "He said to the president, stop the spill and clean it up but don't use the crisis to push for a new energy tax, which is how Republicans described the cap and trade bill.",
        "So, I think you'll hear more of that.",
