        ": So, Dr. Moore, why should this be such a rallying cry for Evangelicals?",
        "Well, I think for two reasons.",
        "One: God cares about the creation.",
        "He displays himself in nature.",
        "And so, the more that people are distanced from the creation itself and the more that people become accustomed to treating the creation as something that is disposable, the more distanced they are from understanding who God is.",

        ": And it's really interesting that the Southern Baptist Convention, which you're a part of and you helped pass a resolution that they put out on the BP oil spill, and I want to read some of the language here.",
        "It called on the government to act determinatively and with undeterred resolve to end this crisis and to ensure full corporate accountability for damages, cleanup and restoration, and to ensure that government and private industry are not again caught without planning for such possibilities.",
        "When I see words like corporate accountability and talking about the government being involved with private industry, I'm very interested in the discussions that led up to this because it seems to go against some of the political thinking we've associated with Evangelicals in the past.",
        "Well, there's really nothing conservative and certainly nothing Evangelical about a laissez-faire view of a lack of government regulation because we as Christians believe in sin.",
        "And so that means if people are sinful, if all of us are sinful, then all of us have to have accountability and that includes corporations.",
        "And so, simply trusting corporations to go about their business without polluting the water streams and without destroying ecosystems is really a naive and utopian view of human nature.",
        "It's not a Christian view of human nature.",
        "And so we believe...",
        ": But isn't there some division within the Evangelical community about this issue?",
        "Yeah, certainly.",
        "There are divisions in Evangelicalism about how we ought to engage this issue and what it ought to look like.",
        "There are some Evangelicals, of course, who hold to a much more libertarian understanding of the relationship between government and protecting natural resources.",

        "I mean, do you see Evangelical Christians being, I guess, pulled in a couple of different directions here?",
        "I think it's good for Evangelical Christians to be pulled in multiple directions, if being pulled in directions means that we're thinking through issues from a Biblical point of view rather than from a purely political point of view.",

        "But Connerly says the fault lies within inferior high schools and middle schools and elementary schools, not with his law.",
        "It's much more convenient to blame 209 and to blame the university's requirements than to do the heavy lifting of getting our students prepared so that they can compete.",

        "Last year, more the 45,000 kids applied to UCLA.",

        "How can that be?",
        "Because, Hunt says, other applicants come from affluent suburban schools with college coaches and scores of advanced placement courses that raise student GPAs even higher.",
        "Hunt is the director of the Bunch Center for African Americans studies at UCLA, which recently published a report on declining black enrollment.",
        "In it, he says Prop 209 is a problem, but so is UCLA's own admissions process, which he says, fails to take a student's background into account.",
        "According to Hunt, the state's other premier school, UC-Berkeley, which has a higher percentage of blacks, also has better guidelines.",
        "They more holistically review the student file.",
        "They look at grades and SAT scores in the context of the high school the student went to.",
