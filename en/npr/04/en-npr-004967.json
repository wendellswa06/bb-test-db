        "But even a healthy slug of that is going to take us through tonight and into tomorrow.",
        "And the big reason for it, and it's not just the Democrats - a lot of Republicans putting in amendments, too - it's because so few people have really had much chance to get involved in the process thus far.",
        "The bill was written on the Senate side by a small task force of Republicans that included no Democrats at all, no women among the Republicans at all, and which met in - behind closed doors.",

        "But this is the thing I want to ask about.",
        "What do you make of lawmakers telling Politico and other news organizations that they wanted something way more limited than this, Ron, that they wanted a ban on paying for gender reassignment surgery but the president just went much farther than they asked?",
        "The assignment surgery - the reassignment surgery is really where the costs are.",
        "Otherwise, the other costs for transgender members of the services appear to be less than what the Pentagon budgets for Viagra and Cialis.",
        "So there's also a readiness question here, which the Pentagon is still studying.",
        "That study is due out in December.",
        "But the president did seem to jump the gun here.",
        "We should note that questions about the transgender issue had been holding up, or have been holding up, a specific spending measure that also includes money to begin building the Mexican border wall that the president wants.",
        "And the president would like to see that particular issue moving along and that spending bill getting approved...",
        "Yeah.",

        "Hey.",

        "So the president spoke of a potential to create 13,000 manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin.",
        "Is that a sure thing?",
        "No, it's certainly not a sure thing.",
        "But let's start with the specifics.",
        "The plan is to have Foxconn invest about $10 billion here in the United States, starting with a major factory in Wisconsin that'll manufacture LCD screens, you know, the things that help your smartphone have displays and power car dashboards and other various technologies.",
        "But 13,000 is a very optimistic target, and it really depends on whether Foxconn gets some of the tax incentives and other perks that it's been promised to set up shop in Wisconsin in the first place.",
        "OK, Foxconn - obviously this is a company that makes stuff for Apple, makes stuff for Google.",
        "It's a big and important company, but doesn't it also have something of a dark reputation?",
        "Yeah, it's something of a quiet giant.",
        "I don't think most Americans really know that Foxconn exists, but it came about in the 1970s.",
        "And these days, it puts together some of the technologies that consumers know most, whether it's iPhones or Xbox Ones.",
        "But its big footprint really hasn't come without controversy.",
        "And for years, it's been dogged in China, where it has a good number of factories, for the way that it treats its workers.",
        "There are labor activists that feel that Foxconn has mistreated those employees and overworked them.",
        "And there were a spate of suicides at the company in 2010 that led a number of its partners, including Apple, to begin to audit its working conditions.",
        "Wow.",
        "Well, how did Wisconsin get Foxconn to say it would build a facility in that state?",
        "Well, lots of money, or at least the promise of it.",
        "Governor Scott Walker, who was on hand for the unveiling at the White House yesterday, said he would provide about $3 billion in incentives, including tax credits tied to Foxconn's pledges for job creation.",
        "But at the end of the day, that's going to come down to state lawmakers who have to approve it.",
        "OK, so not quite a done deal.",
