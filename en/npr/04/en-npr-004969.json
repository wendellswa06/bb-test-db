        "There was a moment when it seemed like President Trump's one-time campaign chairman would testify in public in connection to the Russia investigation.",
        "That moment has passed.",
        "The Senate judiciary committee is, like other committees, looking into Russian interference in the election, which is why Chairman Chuck Grassley issued a subpoena for Paul Manafort.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We want Manafort to come like we want Trump Jr. to come, and other people that we're going to call in.",
        "The point is that we're willing to give all sorts of accommodations.",
        "Accommodations - in other words, the subpoena was a way to force Manafort to agree to different terms other than public testimony.",
        "And Manafort did, we're told, agree to give up information in some different way, and the subpoena was dropped.",
        "All right, NPR's Geoff Bennett has been following all of this, and he is here this morning.",
        "So Geoff, why would the Senate judiciary committee cut a deal with Manafort to avoid public testimony from him?",
        "Well, because the committee just felt like something is better than nothing.",
        "And in this case, the something the committee wanted is to speak with Manafort directly, even in private, because, you know, Manafort is a central figure in the broader Trump-Russia investigation.",
        "He has a lengthy lobbying and consulting career, and he has well-documented ties to Russian businessmen and politicians.",
        "There's another dynamic here, too, in that there's a bit of a political turf war happening among the congressional committees looking into this Russia issue.",
        "And so what we saw is the Senate judiciary committee really trying to flex its muscle and - and show its relevance.",
        "But I'll tell you, all day yesterday, even with that subpoena hanging out there, people close to Manafort were telling us that it was unlikely that he would show up, that in the end, they would strike a deal so that he wouldn't have to endure that spectacle of a public hearing.",
        "And in the end, that's what ended up happening.",
        "So does that mean Manafort's never going to have to testify?",
        "Well, so both committee leaders - Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat - have said they expect public testimony will follow these private interviews.",
        "But I think that's doubtful in the short term because I - I put that question to someone close to the committee, and the response I got back is that Manafort and Trump Jr., for that matter, could perhaps testify in public at some point, which in Washington-speak, is as close to saying never as it gets."

        "Yeah, all right, so speaking of the Russia investigation, there's another matter to address - the matter of Jeff Sessions and his fate.",

        "Even yesterday, Trump gave this press conference with the prime minister of Lebanon.",
        "And during that, he was asked about Jeff Sessions' fate.",
        "Here's what he said.",

        "He should not have recused himself almost immediately after he took office.",
        "President referring there to Jeff Sessions recusing himself from the Russia investigation.",
        "And this miffed the president.",
        "Yeah.",
        "He - he went as far as to say, if I had known he was going to step down from that investigation, I would have picked someone else, which is pretty extraordinary.",
        "Right, because the president views Sessions' recusal as the original sin, which, you know, paved the way for the appointment of the special counsel.",
        "So for the last week, the president has made clear how he feels, but really not what he plans to do about it.",
        "There is some thinking that the president could have an ulterior motive here in publicly humiliating and belittling his AG.",
        "And that's if Sessions resigns or if Trump fires him, the president could appoint a more compliant attorney general, who would then get rid of the special counsel.",
        "You know - you know, when Trump used the word beleaguered to describe Jeff Sessions, it's actually the president who seems rather beleaguered.",
        "He keeps complaining that he's not being protected by Republicans, that Sessions is not protecting him from the investigation.",
        "And he made a remark to the Boy Scouts the other day about loyalty, and made - he made a remark to the side of that - the Boy Scouts have the value of loyalty.",
        "He said he wished there was more loyalty in Washington.",
        "NPR's Geoff Bennett's reporting on this.",

        "They want - they wanted more immediate action, like government-funded - funded and mandated clean air zones with charges, you know, for the most polluting vehicles to enter areas with high pollution, for example.",
        "And there's, you know, some concern about the timing.",
        "I mean, like, 23 years from now - that's a long time.",
        "You know, is it actually going to happen?",
        "But...",
        "It would mean - it would also mean, I mean, setting up enough charging stations for electric cars, which is a big endeavor, I imagine.",
