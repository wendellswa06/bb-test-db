        "Sure, there might be weeks when working as a seismologist in California is a pretty laid-back gig.",

        "So in that part, it's a little unusual.",

        "Sunday morning a magnitude-5.2 event shook up the desert near Palm Springs.",
        "Then Tuesday night things really got interesting when a 7.2 temblor off the coast of Northern California created a tsunami warning.",
        "Yesterday afternoon a magnitude-4.9 quake near Yucaipa was felt from LA to San Diego and, just as the ink on the seismograph was drying, another shakeup, this one a 6.6, occurred again off the coast of Northern California.",

        "Oh, just 51 years, that's all.",
        "Sure, Johnston has seen his share of quakes, but like some others, he's unsettled by the sheer number of them this week.",
        "A lot of people are worried the quakes are related, but Lucy Jones of the USGS says there's no guarantee of that.",
        "Random distributions by definition occasionally cluster or they wouldn't be random.",
        "And what if they are related?",
        "That doesn't really make a difference.",
        "If it's triggered, if it's related, that doesn't change it being an earthquake.",
        "In other words, with little damage and few injuries reported from the four quakes, it's a little early to start speculating on when California will collapse into the Pacific.",
        "Back at Denny's, Bruce Johnston says even with the quakes, he wouldn't live anywhere else in the country.",
        "They have tornadoes, they have all other natural disasters.",
        "You get super hot in the summer and super cold in the winter, so that's why I haven't been back in 51 years."
