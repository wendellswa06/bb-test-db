        "He's owned a funeral home.",
        "He's built affordable housing.",
        "And his feeling about small business in this place is that you have to depend on others to survive.",
        "So he's had a lot of opportunities to leave Maquis Park, and he says he won't do it because being in the - doing business in the ghetto is like being in a fish tank, that you really have to depend on others.",
        "And once you leave the ghetto, you are leaving your fish tank.",
        "And so it's a kind of perverted, strange notion of the bootstrap thesis, that you're not only pulling yourself up, but in his mind, he wants to bring everyone along with him, his network of associates - so that if he's going to go into another neighborhood, he feels a little bit lost.",
        "And that explains partly why he doesn't take up a lot of opportunities that would take him outside the city or in other parts of the city, even outside of Maquis Park.",
        "And he's a very successful businessperson, too, so if you can - if those kinds of constraints operate on him simply because of his perception that it's - he's a little fearful of going out in the world, then you can imagine what somebody who's not so successful feels like in this very poor, working-poor community.",
        "This is a good place to talk - to jump off, because I'd love to hear what some of the jobs that you discovered in this world.",
        "I mean, this man whom you're speaking about had jobs that I think other folks would recognize.",
        "But tell us about the range of work that you discovered in this neighborhood.",
        "Sure.",
        "There's a wide range of goods and services that are offered off the books or under the table, depending on how you want to call it.",
        "Some are criminal: prostitution, drug dealing, the sale of stolen car parts.",
        "And, you know, others are activities that you might find in any neighborhood: people making wedding dresses but not reporting their income, people selling homemade music or homemade food, people offering auto repair in their alley, people offering tax preparation - just all sorts of activities that are not really illegal per se, it's just that folks aren't reporting their income to the IRS.",
        "Why aren't they?",
        "I think at root in this community - this is a community that has consistently for the last 40 years had welfare receipt - rates of welfare receipt that hover around 50 or 60 percent with double-digit unemployment.",
        "So this is a very, very poor community, and so these folks are basically surviving through all of these means of making money off the books.",
        "But that's not the only reason.",
        "If you look at some of the successful businesspersons who work off the books, you know, they may, for example, hire somebody and pay them under the table.",
        "Why do they do that?",
        "Because they might not be able to afford a security guard or a night watchman, for example, or somebody to work full time, and they'll pay them a little money here and there.",
        "They may not - they may want to get around the unions.",
        "They may not be able to - they want to hire and fire in a more flexible manner.",
        "So the underground economy offers them tremendous flexibility to make changes and to save a little money and to tap into a local population that, frankly, is quite desperate for the income.",
        "Now it may be a ridiculous question to some people, but I would like to ask is some of it ignorance?",
        "People just don't know how to do the work any other way.",
        "I mean, they wouldn't know how to get a license.",
        "They just know what they know, and they just do it the way they do it.",
        "I mean, are they aware that perhaps one - you know, some people get a license to open a braiding salon, that there are other ways to do it?",

        "I think part of it is that this is what they've seen others do and others before them.",

        "Another is just sheer lack of opportunity.",

        "And some of it is probably just lack of information.",
        "So, ignorance in the sense that folks are just outside the loop.",

        "Often, those resources fail to really connect to folks who are extremely poor, and so people are just devising strategies to get by by themselves.",
