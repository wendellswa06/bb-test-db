        "And it was a police officer's car.",
        "And the police officer wanted to kind of meet the folks in the neighborhood.",
        "And he brought his car to James and - for an oil change.",
        "The police officer thought it was $20, and James thought it was 30, and I just happened to be standing around a little fire in a garbage can warming my hands.",
        "And they couldn't find an independent arbiter, so they said what would you do?",
        "And just because it was cold and I wanted to find a solution quickly I said well, why don't you pay him 20 this time and bring your car back twice more, and you'll pay him 30 the next two times?",
        "And once I did that, I started noticing how often this kind of impromptu way of resolving disputes actually occurred.",
        "And that drew me into this world of looking not only at the economic side, but also how do people regulate all of these activities to make sure that things just don't go out of hand and get crazy?",
        "Why do you think they called on you?",
        "I'm sure you have excellent judgment, by the way.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But I mean - but why do you think you were called upon?",
        "Just to put some context behind this, this is Chicago in the early and mid-1990s, and although it is a very, very diverse community, its political geography, it's really - is really black and white, as it has been for 100 years.",
        "And I'm not African-American, and I'm not a white ethnic American, and so I don't threaten either group.",
        "And that's been the way that I could actually do a lot of research in this community.",
        "And so I was not considered to be a police officer working for a police officer, nor was I considered to be a hustler on the street who might have an interest in their economy.",
        "And so I became, by virtue of my ethnic identity and by virtue of having been there for years, considered somewhat neutral.",

        "And it's very interesting in dealing with, you know, people that are business owners that want to get started in all this, but they start looking for a business loan.",
        "And then we find out that they've never, you know, reported their income.",
        "They don't file income tax returns.",
        "And it makes it hard for banks as well, so I think it is part of a, you know, a lower social-economic level which in turn makes us responsible to educate the people as well to go and talk to local business organizations, talk to chambers of commerce that can assist them and give them some guidance as well.",
        "Omar, is it your view - is it your thought that some of these entrepreneurs could get loans if they knew about them?",
        "That it's really a question of disconnect between the services available and getting the information to the people who could benefit from them?",
        "Absolutely, absolutely.",
        "It's just a matter of getting some guidance on, you know, how to prepare a business plan and then be able to go to a bank and say, look, I'd like (unintelligible) market here.",
        "And a lot of these entrepreneurs - I mean, they are making money.",
        "They are boosting the global economy, providing sometimes even jobs for their local neighborhood.",
        "And by getting the specific guidance they need and education, then they can qualify.",
        "I mean, there's the SBA loans, there's different ways that we can help, either at a micro level as well.",

        "But does that exist in this country?",
        "Omar raises a couple of good points, and this is one of them: that internationally, in the developing world, we have done a far better job in getting small pools of money for entrepreneurs to be able to develop agricultural schemes that might get them steady income to start small businesses elsewhere.",
        "It exists here, but not to the same degree.",
        "We don't often look at the inner city or urban neighborhoods generally for that sort of micro financing, and we need to do more.",
        "You know, part of the problem is that when - for a lot of these small businesses, when they go into a bank or they apply for a loan, the bank kind of looks at them funny because sometimes all they need is $500.",
        "All they need is $100 to make - just to make that rent payment or to pay that electric bill or to buy a hammer or something so they can get buy.",
        "And the bank says you don't need $10,000?",

        "So because of the nature of what they need just to get by, there's kind of an information gap.",

        "But just - but to the point, micro, I think really doesn't exist in this country as we know it, obviously.",
        "The really - you know, in Bangladesh or in some of these places, you could get a loan for $500, you know, to buy a cow or some beads or something of that.",

        "And you're saying that's really hard to do, actually, in the United States.",
        "It's hard to do, and it's impossible to do in some areas.",
        "You know, we've had something called a Community Reinvestment Act that was supposed to force banks to be responsive to the communities where their deposits were coming from as a way to ensure that inner city folks got access to financial services.",
        "There's been an awful lot of trouble in enforcing that act and getting banks to be responsive, in part because of this: the scale of what's needed in the inner city often is not simply an influx of millions of dollars, but an influx of $50 at a time.",
        "And banks and financial institutions don't have the flexibility, and they're not seeing that that is a need.",
        "How big do you think the underground economy is?",
        "I hate to answer your question like this, but I guess it depends.",
        "And it depends how you want to measure it.",
        "And the General Accounting office and the IRS, every year they struggle to really produce good estimates.",
        "Just to throw out a few, the IRS estimates roughly $500 billion a year in income is going untaxed and unreported that could actually be getting into the public coffers.",
        "If you were to look at just workers, 10-15 percent of workers are working in the underground economy.",
        "And so, you know, we're losing their taxes and - or a consumer pricing - I'm sorry, a consumer behavior indices.",
