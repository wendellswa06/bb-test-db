        "That perhaps this experience - has this kind of changed your attitude about it?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Not only does it give me more sympathy, certainly like I said, the frustration factor - you think, no wonder.",

        "It did, you know.",
        "I had been studying poverty and urban poverty for a long time, and the overriding question is why aren't the poor working?",
        "And so, you know, before I really started this work, I would look like probably most people and see folks hanging out in inner cities not working and saying, you know, they're unemployed or they're lazy or something like that.",
        "And then having done this and look at the tremendous amounts of creativity and hustling that takes place at a day-to-day level, you start to just notice the -it is a problem that there aren't meaningful jobs certainly, but you also see other kinds of problems.",
        "So that people with enormous amounts of skill and human capital just simply can't in some cases get the right forms, in some case know how to fill out the forms, can't get the financing, and so on.",
        "So there's information gaps.",
        "You know, we have a digital divide problem that still exists today.",
        "So it forced - I think we have to just change the way we look at the nature of work in the inner city, so that we see it as both a problem of a lack of jobs, but also a problem of helping folks who have skills to get one step up and start businesses or otherwise.",
        "We're down to our last couple of seconds, so I just wanted to ask you this and I know this is a hard question to answer briefly, but I'm going to ask you to try.",
        "Folks will hear you speaking - and hopefully look at your book -and they'll say you know what?",
        "If you could do this illegally - you can fix cars, you can do hair, you can run errands - if you can do that off the books, why can't you do it on the books?",
        "What would say to that?"

        "So folks not only are dealing with trying to start businesses and go get permits and regulation, etc., but they're also dealing with all the side effects: the enormous amount of unemployment and the enormous concentrated poverty.",
