        "So they'll hand over documents if asked and - and perhaps we could see them on camera answering those questions.",
        "Yeah, I mean, notably they're not under oath behind closed doors, and there's a little bit of a flap over that with Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the judiciary committee, who said, well, you know, anything that's said to Congress would be - if someone lies, it would be illegal.",

        "Well, Trump hasn't been thrilled with how the communications staff has been operating, especially when it comes to leaks and the fact that there's so much information that's getting out beyond his control."
