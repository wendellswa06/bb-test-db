        "Just five out of millions of variants analyzed.",
        "The first thing that's most important is that they represent very, very, very small effects, Together, the five variants account for much less than 1% of the variability in the traits that we're looking at.",
        "So they explain virtually nothing about the behavior, and they reveal little, if anything, about the biology that might underlie those genetic variants.",
        "Using another technique, the authors say genes could still influence 8% to 25% of the behavior they studied.",
        "But even in a sample of a half a million people, it was impossible to tease out anything about those genetic variants.",
        "One obvious conclusion from these results is nobody's going to come up with a blood test to predict these sexual behaviors.",
        "Individual-level prediction is effectively an impossibility.",
        "It doesn't explain a lot, but it's at least a first step.",
        "Melinda Mills wasn't involved with the study, but she wrote a commentary about it.",
        "The Oxford University sociologist says, for one thing, it further undercuts a previously published report of a so-called gay gene on the X chromosome.",
        "And since they didn't find a gradient of sexual behavior, it undermines Alfred Kinsey's decades-old scale, which ranked people on a spectrum of sexuality, from exclusively heterosexual to exclusively homosexual.",
        "Mills was intrigued to see that of the five variants that the study did find, two appeared in both men and women, two were only in men and one was only in women.",
        "It looks like there's something different driving women and men.",
        "And I think that just means that, you know, there's a lot more to be examined in terms of women's sexuality.",
        "And that's really been under-researched.",
        "Studies like this that seek to link genetic patterns to behaviors or disease usually explain far more than the fraction of a percent of the variance that was the case for this study.",
        "That leaves Cecile Janssens, a professor of epidemiology at Emory University, puzzled why this study was even published.",
        "I don't think that they found anything that is worth reporting."

        "She notes that findings like this should be replicated in different samples.",
        "But in this case, only three of the five genetic variants showed up in a separate sample.",
