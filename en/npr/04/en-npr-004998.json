        "Is this cover shot a photo or a photo illustration?",

        "Have you heard from the governor's office about that photograph?",
        "Did they call you up and say, hey, the colors are wrong and beyond that there's something else going on in this photograph that is odd, that is unflattering, that we don't like?",
        "Yes, and they contacted us, exactly, to say that the color of the shirt was different and the jacket, yes.",

        "So people see a lot of things in a photograph, you know, so it's always hard to kind of know and anticipate what each reader will see in it and clearly this one really hit a chord.",

        "Right.",
        "Well, the U.S.-joint forces command conducted an elaborate, an extensive study of the war from Iraqi's point of view.",

        "inspections, fearing an invasion, and he worried that there might be residue from chemical and biological weapons from way back before the 1991 war, and he wanted his guys to go in a clean out that debris before the inspectors came.",
        "And this strikes me as an utterly plausible explaination.",
