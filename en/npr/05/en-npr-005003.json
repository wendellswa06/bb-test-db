        "has spent $156 billion on the war there.",
        "That's according to the Pentagon.",
        "But that $156 billion price tag is just for the Defense Department.",
        "It does not include how much, for example, the CIA has spent on intelligence operations, or how much the State Department has spent on diplomacy or reconstruction efforts.",
        "Start factoring those in and the total cost of the war, so far, rises closer to $227 billion, according to the Congressional Research Service.",
        "And here's an interesting milestone.",
        "Next year, for the first time, the Pentagon expects to spend more in Afghanistan than in Iraq.",
        "That reflects the reality that more troops are pouring into Afghanistan even as the war in Iraq winds down.",
        "If anything, it's more sobering to consider the cost of the war in lives.",
        "The Pentagon says 907 U.S.",
        "service members have been killed so far in the Afghan war, more than 4,400 wounded.",
        "Fifty eight died last month alone, making October the deadliest month for U.S.",

        "Well, there hasn't been much Afghan reaction yet because this came pretty late in the day.",
        "Although, it does seem that the challenger who dropped out, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah is planning to challenge this decision tomorrow.",
        "He is planning to hold a press conference from what we're told and his spokesman has already made some suggestion that this is just not acceptable to him.",
        "But if you look at what Western reaction is, they have quickly - basically, the international community has quickly rallied around President Karzai and they're trying to move this ahead.",
        "There was no discussion of fraud, no discussion of things to come.",
        "The only person who said anything about the fact that this government now -that President Karzai's new administration will have to really come to terms with some of the deficiencies here was Ban Ki-Moon, the U.N.",
        "secretary-general, who said that lessons must be learned and that the people of this country here in Afghanistan deserve support and deserve services and deserve security and that the Karzai administration will have to provide that.",
        "You know, based on what you're saying it, sounds like the role of Abdullah Abdullah is going to be pretty unclear.",
        "I mean, he's dropped out but he's planning to challenge Karzai's role now?",
        "Well, this is all part of a negotiation tactic.",
        "I mean, Dr. Abdullah all week long had been in intensive talks, closed-door talks with President Karzai.",
        "These talks were being nurtured, shall we say, by Western diplomats who were hoping that these two would come to some kind of power-sharing agreement and avoid a runoff to begin with because of all the security concerns being raised.",
        "And so, the talks broke down, which is sort of the unspoken reason for why Dr. Abdullah dropped out.",
        "It's just unlikely that Dr. Abdullah will get the kind of power that he was hoping to get, which would include appointing, or having a say in appointing ministers and setting Afghan policy.",
        "Now that the West seems to be accepting or trying to push President Karzai ahead as a legitimate victor, it's unlikely that Dr. Abdullah is just going to sit by and accept that."
