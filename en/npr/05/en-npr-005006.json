        "He explained that during an hour-long outpatient surgery, he would make a small incision near the base of her thumb.",
        "Then he'd implant a small piece of biodegradable polyurethane-urea material, where the two bones in the joint come together.",

        "DONOVAN (Surgeon): It's taking the bone off the bone.",
        "That's the key here, is that we definitely want to get the bone off the bone, 'cause that's what's happening.",
        "O'Donovan explains that for many people the pain of arthritis creeps in when the cartilage that cushions and separates the bones wears out.",
        "He says the new polyurethane prosthesis, which he implants surgically, serves as a replacement.",
        "Holding a diagram of this implant, he say the new space created in the joint by the artificial prosthesis relieves the pain, and he says eventually the idea is that the prosthesis serves as a frame that may help the body's own tissue to re-grow.",
        "Dr.",
        "O'DONOVAN: It's a material like a graft material, and it's - the fact that it's urea means that the body can attach to it, and then over time it will basically eat it up and then be replaced by its own tissue.",
        "Well I would have been surprised if they'd found otherwise.",
        "And you're right, I have commented and I think on your show that it was extremely unusual for Jim Comey, as the FBI director, to make that kind of pronouncement.",
        "It is the role of the FBI to investigate, to gather up evidence, and then you turn over that evidence to a prosecutor - and they are the ones who make a decision as to whether or not they believe there's enough there to sustain a prosecution.",
        "And so to have Jim Comey make that pronouncement in that press conference without a prosecutor by his side, I found to be extremely remarkable and unfortunate.",
        "And as a person who knows him and has had your own clashes with him, I have to ask you why you think he took that course of action.",
        "Well I think, I mean, he's made public pronouncements about believing that this was the best way to preserve the integrity of the investigation, to preserve the reputation of the FBI.",
        "But taking that on and failing to adhere to the protocols of the Department of Justice put Jim at great risk of criticism and of making a mistake.",
        "It is consistent with what I've observed in Jim Comey in the past, in other situations, where he believes he knows best and goes off on a course of action that sometimes have tragic results, and I think this is an example.",
        "Now, of course, Democrats aren't the only ones who've blamed the FBI for their political troubles.",
        "Another issue in the report is the conduct of two FBI agents, Lisa Page and Peter Strzok.",
        "They were texting each other during the campaign.",
        "Those texts demonstrate an antipathy - I don't know what else to call it - to Donald Trump's candidacy.",
        "The IG report says that their politics didn't influence the investigation in any way, but President Trump and his supporters have been claiming that the FBI is biased against him."

        "I mean, that is their right as citizen.",
        "But I don't expect them - and they shouldn't be involved in having conversations, particularly with others within the department and particularly on a government email server.",
        "It's just so dumb because we now have a situation where even though the inspector general has reached this conclusion that he doesn't believe their apparent bias ultimately affected the outcome of the investigation, it does give ammunition to those who believe that the investigation in connection with the Clinton email server and perhaps now the investigation with respect to the Mueller investigation is somehow rigged.",
        "And in the end, that's what's really unfortunate from my perspective.",

        "I mean, the ongoing argument that the president is making is that there is a bias against him and antipathy toward him that is so deep that it couldn't possibly be fair.",

        "I think that for a large, large degree, the people who work at the Department of Justice understand what their obligation is and that is to pursue justice fairly and impartially.",

        "One of the things I do admire about Jeff Sessions, despite all the criticism from the president of the United States, direct criticism of a job that he's doing, and criticism people of his decision to recuse himself, you know, I think he is pursuing policies that the president campaigned on.",
        "Some of the policies people may not like.",
