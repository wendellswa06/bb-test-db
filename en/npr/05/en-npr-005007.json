        "I think what he surprised people with last night was how direct he was.",
        "In fact, one Evangelical leader turned to me in one of the breaks and said, the straight talk express is back.",
        "Because he took tough questions from Rick Warren, and handled them very directly and said things Evangelicals would want to hear.",
        "Just from your point of view as a member of the audience last night, do you think that Barack Obama bringing up his relationship with Jesus Christ is enough to counterbalance his views on abortion?",
        "I think that is the contrast.",
        "Obama's strength among Evangelicals is that he talks the talk, he has the language and the faith of an Evangelical, but McCain really has the positions on issues that Evangelicals want to hear.",
        "I do think Obama has a more limited objective with Evangelicals since he leads in really every other faith based category of voter.",
        "All he really needs to do, I think, is make some nice inroad into the Evangelical vote.",
        "That's a victory of sorts, certainly compared to where Democrats have been in the last two elections.",
        "At the end of the day, however, I think more Evangelicals will be impressed with McCain's position on the issues.",
        "And I think he will still win the Evangelical vote very strongly.",
        "It's just a question of whether they will turn out in as big a numbers as they did for George W.",
        "Bush, and whether he can hold a sufficient percentage of them to win the election.",
        "Mr.",
        "Davenport, do you think that this, given that it was in an Evangelical church, had a bigger impact in the Evangelical community than maybe in politics nationally?",
        "Well, I think so.",
        "I think the place where it occurred will cause some people to pay greater attention.",
        "Secondly, I would say Pastor Warren got them to talk about things that would probably not be discussed in a televised debate.",
        "Like whether evil exists?",
        "You're right.",
        "You're not going to hear questions like, does evil exist?",
        "What's your personal relationship with Christ?",
        "And what does it mean every day?",
        "Give me an example of your greatest moral failure, and America's greatest moral failure.",
        "Those aren't questions that TV anchormen generally ask.",
        "And if they do, candidates usually are well-scripted to evade them.",
        "There are several things Senator Coburn and six other senators object to in the global AIDS reauthorization bill.",
        "They don't like the increase in funding from 15 to $50 billion over the next five years.",
        "They insist that 55 percent of the money be spent on HIV/AIDS treatment, and they don't want to include a provision that would cover treatment for other diseases."

        "I may not agree with his tactics, but he is standing in front of the bill saying I like this program, and I want to keep what I see as the heart of it intact and not see it frittered away or modified.",
        "Frittered away, Coburn has complained, on prevention programs that do not emphasize abstinence.",
        "Instead, Coburn wants a guarantee that at least 55 percent of the money is spent on treatment, Moore says.",
        "And treatment not only means giving drugs to people who need them.",
        "It really means tracking people who are found to be HIV positive through the period of literally years - five, six, seven, eight years - before they actually need the drugs.",
        "But Paul Zeitz of the Global AIDS Alliance, a non-profit group that represents AIDS advocates and service providers, is worried that Coburn's demands could undo legislation that was brokered through delicate negotiations.",
        "There is a broad bipartisan consensus in support of the major aspects of the bill.",
        "Folks on either side of the aisle now have to show flexibility and move towards a compromise so that the bill can be passed and signed into law before President Bush goes to the G8.",
        "Those G8 leaders of Western governments plan to meet in early July in Japan.",
        "The US contributes nearly half of the funding for AIDS treatment.",

        "It would be a real setback for the United States government -and that includes the Congress and the administration - if he goes empty-handed.",
        "AIDS workers in developing countries, he says, have learned that simply handing out pills is not enough.",
        "They're going to have to do a lot more - train health workers and treat other diseases like tuberculosis.",
        "Most people that die from AIDS die from co-infection with tuberculosis.",
        "We've already seen that if TB isn't advanced, then there are the emergence of mutated strains, like the extremely drug resistant strain that's circulating in southern Africa right now."

        "But the sense is that the administration knows that they really don't have any good options and that even Republicans are running from the White House on this and saying that it looks as if the administration is just waiting for the next president - be it Democrat or Republican - to be there the day that all the chaos comes as people are rescued and taken out of the Green Zone and Iraq is left to fight for itself.",
