        "Yeah.",
        "This was the inaugural journey of this new train line between Seattle and Portland, and there was some excitement about that.",
        "There were TV cameras seeing passengers off at the station.",
        "This train got just south of the city of Tacoma, it reached its maximum speed of about 80 miles an hour, and then it hit a curve where the maximum speed was supposed to be 30 miles an hour.",
        "And that is when 13 of these - of the train's 14 cars derailed, including one that spilled off a bridge onto the interstate.",
        "And as Patricia Freeman described, you know, that's when passengers were thrown around the train.",
        "I guess the question for investigators is, why?",
        "Why be - why travel so quickly into that curve?",
        "Or why the train didn't slow down as it approached that curve - exactly."
