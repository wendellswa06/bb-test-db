        "Well, McCabe is the deputy director of the FBI, which makes him the No. 2 official at the bureau.",
        "He's not a political appointee.",
        "He is a career bureau guy.",
        "He's been there more than 20 years.",
        "His role as deputy director gives him a job kind of overseeing domestic and international investigations that the bureau conducts.",
        "And, of course, the biggest domestic investigations in the past couple of years have been, one, Hillary Clinton's email server, and, two, of course, the Russia investigation.",
        "So his job has put them kind of smack dab in the middle of these two enormous, politically charged worlds.",
        "I'm also thinking, when Jim Comey was fired, he's the guy who stepped up and was the interim director for a while.",
        "So...",

        "We presume that whatever the FBI knows, he knows it.",
        "So what are lawmakers wanting to know from him?",
        "Well, one big reason that lawmakers - particularly, Republican lawmakers - want to talk to McCabe is a senior FBI agent by the name of Peter Strzok.",
        "Strzok, of course, is the guy who's been in the news as of late because of text messages that he sent that included politically charged language.",
        "Republicans say that Strzok also played a role in changing language in then-FBI Director James Comey's statement wrapping up the Clinton investigation.",
        "It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News.",
        "Strzok, of course, was removed from Mueller's team - because he was a member of special counsel Robert Mueller's team - over his text messages.",
        "And the GOP says that - or members of the GOP say that these texts show political bias.",
        "There's one in particular that talks about an insurance policy in - and this took place in Andy's office.",
        "That is believed to be Andrew McCabe's office.",
        "And they also want to talk about the Trump dossier.",
        "They want to know whether the Trump dossier played a key role, if any role, in the FBI's decision to launch its Russia...",
        "Oh, the dossier that was put together by Christopher Steele, that former British spy.",
        "Exactly."

        "This is where - in the 1950s and early '60s - they blew up a hundred nuclear bombs above ground, each producing beautiful but dangerous mushroom clouds of radioactive particles.",
        "The military stopped open-air testing in 1962, but now it wants to conduct a large-scale conventional explosion - seven hundred tons of ammonium nitrate and diesel fuel that'll create a mushroom cloud 10,000 feet high.",
        "The cloud - according to the military - will not be dangerous to breathe, as they've tested the dirt in the vicinity and found it does not contain hazardous levels of radioactivity.",
