        "They go back to the very beginnings of the paparazzi in post-World War II Italy.",
        "American movie companies were doing a lot of shooting in Rome then because it was cheap, and so there were a lot of movie stars hanging around and a lot of unemployed Italian men hanging around.",
        "They picked up cameras and started to shoot.",

        "So it is a very complex relationship with celebrities themselves who are the subject matter of the material.",
