        "Hi.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "I was invited as a child.",
        "My best friend was a little bit overweight, and because her mom was in charge of the weight-loss camp, she invited me to be a model child because I wasn't overweight.",
        "Oh, wow.",
        "And I was supposed to be the example of what these other girls should become.",
        "So, what did you do?",
        "What were you asked to do?",
        "I was just asked to be there and do what they were doing, and just show them that because of the way my body was, it was easier for me to do what they were being asked to do.",
        "And if they would strive to be like me...",
        "Wow.",
        "That they could, you know, accomplish things better and what not.",
        "But what I've found from it was not only was it hard for me because it was trying to teach me that it's not OK to be overweight.",
        "And also, my best friend, I mean, I could see - she went to Weight Watchers, she went to so many different clubs, and I could see that it really strained on her self-esteem.",
        "Did the other kids - did these kids resent you, I wonder?",
        "Were they angry at you?",
        "You know, they were really accepting.",
        "It was kind of odd.",
        "But it was an interesting - I didn't really know that I was supposed to be the example until after I had gotten back home.",
        "And I had had some comments like, oh, well, you know, aren't you glad that you're not like that?",
        "You don't want to become like that, do you?"

        "And the whole time you were just sort of pointed out as if you're the example?",
        "Pretty much.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Pretty much.",
        "So, did you think they're a good idea or not?",
        "I mean, what's your opinion of them in the end.",
        "I think they're horrible.",
        "I think that everybody needs to just accept themselves for the way they are, and you know, work on being a better person.",
        "You can't cure somebody, you know, if they don't think there's something wrong with them.",
        "And telling somebody that there's something wrong with them, you know, I think, does more damage than just, you know, working to be a good example and have a better, you know, maybe diet or exercise or whatever, without telling them, oh, you know, you're fat, this is not OK, you need to be like so-and-so because that's just so degrading to somebody.",
        "Even as a child I think that it does irreversible damage to somebody.",

        "It came from the mouths of very sensitive boys who decided to nickname me Moose and they would scream it down the hallways at school.",
        "And the effect of that on you was?",
        "Oh, it was awesome.",
        "I loved it.",

        "You won't find that in any of the brochures, certainly.",
        "Most camps call it fit camp or health camp, but once you've been a camper and counselor, as I've been, at these camps where they basically limit your caloric intake and up you exercise, once you're a camper, you can sort of make fun of it and say, wow, my parents shipped me off to fat camp.",
        "So, that's what I've decided to call it in the subtitle of \"\"Moose,\"\" because I wanted to keep it as true to the experience as it actually was.",
        "So, your parents sent you there.",
        "Did you want to go?",
        "I actually did want to go very much, because I hated school.",
        "I hated the reflection in the mirror.",
        "I wanted so much to be someone else, and I mistakenly believed that someone else involved, you know, my changing my weight.",
        "I thought that if I was thinner, the rest of my life would change.",
        "Did you have any fear of being stigmatized?",
        "I mean, did you tell other kids what kind of camp you were going to, or did you hide it?",
        "What did you do in terms of that?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Police say the unidentified gunman killed three people and injured at least 15, and then police shot and killed the gunman.",
        "I admitted it but I've since learned - I've written on my website, stephanieklein.com, about, you know, the experiences, and what I did was I wrote people's actual names that I went to camp with thinking, well, maybe I'll get re-in-touch with them.",
        "And I did, but not in the way I'd hoped.",
        "A lot of people said, take my name down!",
        "I don't want people to know that I ever went to a fat camp!",
        "So, I did respectfully taking their names down right away, because I didn't even realize that people would be ashamed about it.",
        "Now, so, you're sort of saying - it seems to me you're saying that there was some comfort in being in a camp with other kids who were in the same predicament that you were in, so to speak.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "There's, you know, there was that comfort of, oh, wow, you know, no one's - not everyone is noticing me for my weight anymore, or at least not for being fat.",
        "I was noticed for being on a thinner side of fat, and there's a comfort in that the opposite sex is finally - and this is true for everyone, not just me - is paying attention to you, and everyone's having their first kisses and their first boyfriends and girlfriends at fat camp for that first summer, because at home, the opposite sex isn't paying attention to you.",
        "But all of the sudden at camp, everyone's pretty much in the same oversized boat."

        "Now, one thing you said that is interesting is that nobody was really talking about health so much back then.",
        "It was really all about appearance.",
        "Yeah, it was absolutely aesthetics.",
        "I mean, I remember when I came home crying one day to my father, finally worked up the courage to say, you know, the kids at school call me Moose.",
        "And he started actually not comforting me, but laughing hysterically.",
        "And that was something that I shared with a lot of the kids at fat camp.",
        "You know, we found that common ground, because of all us were, you know, ridiculed by - whether it was our parents or our peers, you know, once we got to camp, we realized that that we had that commonality, not just the weight, but how we - well we were received there.",

        "And the things that your guest is sharing are absolutely, you know, the same things that our daughter said when she came home.",
        "On one hand, I really want to express to parents maybe that have an overweight child that fat camp is a lot of fun.",
        "My daughter had a blast.",
        "She lost, gosh, 20 pounds in three weeks.",
        "And then the second time she went for a summer and lost 45 pounds.",
        "But the down side of fat camp is that it is quick weight loss, and unless the family is also taught to change their lifestyle, and the child is truly taught to change their lifestyle, the kid will gain it all back, and that is exactly what happened.",
        "It did happen.",
        "Did she ever lose it again?",
        "I mean, did you go through the steps you're describing, changing lifestyle and really dealing with it on a daily basis?"
