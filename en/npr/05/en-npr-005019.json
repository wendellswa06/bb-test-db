        "It really varies from person to person.",
        "I went because my brother was going to be camp counselor there.",
        "He just got wrapped up in this thing and so I came along, too.",
        "We'd grown up heavy, but never particularly concerned about it.",
        "And at camp, my kids, they just thought I was - I mean, I could do cartwheels and a lot of them couldn't, and that was a (unintelligible) difference between us.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "At fat camp, we used to make a joke that right here - around here, he's Joe All Star, but in the normal, quote/unquote, \"\"normal world,\"\" he's Joe Lunch Bucket, and that we all really have this big chance to shine, where at fat camp, we can all be forwards instead of fullbacks.",
        "And I absolutely was among one of the kids who felt - I was 100 percent the popular girl when I was at fat camp, and at home I was Moose.",
        "And I returned back to that world, and I think one of the challenges for camps, or any controlled environment that you put someone in, is how do you give them a taste of what it's really, really going to be like once they do leave that controlled environment?",
        "And how are they going to maintain and make the right choices when they don't have someone telling them what to do?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Did it give you any confidence at all when you return to school?",
        "I mean, did you feel better about yourself?",
        "Did that help you at all socially or not?",
        "It didn't help socially.",
        "You know, I think a lot of us, what we get is what I called the someday syndrome.",
        "And it's true with weight, but it's true other things, too, thinking, oh, someday when I'm thinner, I'll be popular, someday when I make more money, I'll be happy, whatever it is.",
        "And I learned, even at that young, young age of 13, that I had to start figuring out how to be happy whether I was thin or not.",
        "It really didn't have anything to do with how popular I was.",
        "And that was a hard lesson for me to learn, that it had more to do with my personality also.",

        "Now, you covered health issues for decades.",
        "So, is there real consensus among experts on whether these weight-loss camps are a good thing or a bad thing?",
        "Well, there actually is, and I also - I co-wrote, a number of years ago, a book called \"\"The Stoplight Diet for Children,\"\" which was based on a federally funded program that was at the University of Pittsburgh, Behavioral Modification for Families.",
        "And it showed that kids could lose weight, and the same thing is true of children who go to these camps.",
        "They may be imperfect in some ways, but there are some really good studies - I did a quick literature search and found that in some cases kids can lose as much as 12 pounds over a summer, which is pretty significant for kids who are morbidly obese.",
        "That may not be as much as they need to lose.",
        "But it is the opportunity, as you've been hearing, to - for some of these kids to bond together, and yes, then you just - you have to reenter the real the world and that may not be always exactly the way you want it to be.",
        "But it does offer the opportunity - and these studies show that - to learn some good habits and develop some good exercise routines, but the trick is applying that when you get home.",
        "Continuing.",
        "Yes.",
        "And that's always the hard part about losing weight.",
        "That is always the hard part, and I was the creator of the Lean Plate Club franchise at the Post, and now I'm doing something called sallysquires.com.",
        "But this is something that's not just true for kids.",
        "This is true for adults, too, that we - this isn't, you go on a diet, you go off of it.",
        "This is figuring out a lifestyle that you can live with for the rest of your life, and that's what so important for these children.",
        "Stephanie Klein, when you look back on it, do you think of it in positive or negative terms, your experience?",
        "That's hard to say.",
        "I mean, it's both.",
        "There was absolutely the camaraderie and the wonderful feeling of not being alone.",
        "We all lost weight.",
        "I lost 30 pounds that first summer.",
        "It was a never a question of, are you going to lose weight?",
        "It's, are you going to return the next summer even fatter, was really the big question that we should be asking, because it's not so much about losing weight at the actual camp.",
        "I think a big part of these camps, what they should be doing, is having these kids journal what they're eating, so they get into the habit of journaling, because you are more aware of what you're putting into your body when you do something like that."

        "And just to give just a quick example, the parents sometimes would try to be helpful, and they sent menus, saying, OK, well, maybe you could go over in nutrition class what you might be - here's a menu from a local restaurant - what you might be ordering that's a healthy choice once you're home.",
        "Sounds like a great idea, except as kids, we took those menus, and forget about talking about the menu in nutrition class.",
        "The bunk lights would go out, we'd turn on our flashlights, and we would have someone read all the content of the menus out loud...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Oh, God.",
        "Because we were, like, so craving and wanting what we couldn't have.",
        "And that's part of the struggle.",
        "I mean, sure, in a controlled environment, you can lose the weight, but it's setting them up to be in a mind set of, I want, I want, I want, I can't have, but when I leave here, I can.",
        "And that's we need to change.",
        "And that is one of the really important questions that in - this has to be a family approach, or wherever these kids are going back, that you don't go away and then come back into whatever situation it was that was helping to gain weight unless everybody's invested in it, and that's what the study showed at the University Pittsburgh, that the whole family has to be on board, whether everybody's overweight or not.",
        "Everybody has to make this commitment to eat more healthfully together."
