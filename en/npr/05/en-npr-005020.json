        "I was at that age that, when I finally got finished there, I was able to transition into athletics, which helped me keep the weight down.",
        "I never did lose.",
        "But I do think that the part that is being reiterated over and over about lifestyle change is the most important thing, and I really appreciate that.",
        "Thank you for letting me have a call.",

        "It's true for adults.",
        "It's true for me now.",
        "Right, mm-hm.",
        "I didn't like exercise, and I certainly wasn't going to like more being forced to do caterpillar drills and slimnastics class at fat camp.",
        "What I have found as an adult, and now that I'm a mother of twins and I'm going to face the same thing when my children are older, is, how do we come up with good exercises that kids like?",
        "And for me, it's all about distracting yourself.",
        "So, for me, I walk around and I'll walk - and this was true as a kid, too - I would hike with a camera.",
        "So, the goal wasn't losing weight.",
        "It wasn't, OK, sweat.",
        "It was, get that great photo.",
        "Take that great photo.",
        "So, my mind wasn't on the weight loss and I could last a lot longer and enjoy it more, because it became a hobby instead of, oh, I've got to force myself to get on the treadmill.",
        "Right, right.",
        "Let me ask you, Sally Squires, it sounds to me, from what we're hearing, you know, both from Stephanie and some of the callers so far, that it's almost like this is, like, therapy and that it succeeds on a certain level as therapy, maybe not so much as a permanent weight-loss program.",
        "Right.",
        "And it's great that these kids, when they go - and teens, when they go these camps are seeing some success, because we know from major studies, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program, that small amounts of weight can really make - weight loss can really make some significant changes in blood pressure, cholesterol, some - the things that we want to see go in a different direction.",
        "But you're right, you have to look at, what's the situation that these kids are in that has allowed them to gain this weight, at a time in previous generations when kids were extremely lean?",
        "I mean, this was - to be overweight as a child was very rare.",
        "And so, we have to keep looking for things that we can change in our environment and in our homes that allow these kids not to grow that size, and then, if when they do, to help them get back to a more normal size.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Do you think that these kinds of camps now are - Stephanie was talking about the fact that when she was going to these camps, it was all about appearance.",
        "Do you think these camps are a little more, as the rest of society is, a little more conscious about the health benefits and really concentrating on the health aspect of weight loss?"
