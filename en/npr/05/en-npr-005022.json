        "Well, no specific reason.",
        "But the president and Dan Coats had a pretty rocky relationship throughout his tenure.",

        "Which we should say is an exceptional number of replacements to make it, even with - even though we're now at the end of his first term.",

        "Can you give us some of the highlights?",
        "Yeah.",
        "What were the moments?",
        "I think when Trump and Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, had a summit last summer, at a press conference afterward, Trump questioned whether Russia interfered with the election.",
        "And Coats took this highly unusual step of issuing a very blunt statement saying the consensus of the intelligence community is that Russia interfered, and they're still doing it, and we're not going to stop presenting this unvarnished truth.",
        "So that really stood out.",
        "But just this last January, Coats went on and testified on Capitol Hill after the president had said North Korea's nuclear program was no longer a threat and that the Islamic State had been defeated, and Coats contradicted him very publicly.",
        "So you didn't hear a lot from Coats, but when you did, it seemed to be shooting down something the president had recently said.",
        "The DNI is a tough job, right?",
        "You are - theoretically, this is a job - you're overseeing all the other intelligence agencies.",
        "It was created after 9/11.",
        "What's his legacy - Dan Coats?",
        "Right.",
        "So, you know, it is this sort of funny position where you're overseeing 16 other intelligence agencies.",
        "But I think one thing he did do was shift the emphasis or was part of this communitywide effort.",
        "You know, for almost two decades, the focus has been on terror groups, al-Qaida and ISIS.",
        "And Coats has really stressed the traditional big state rivalry.",
        "He called them the big four - Russia, China, Iran, North Korea - and said the U.S.",
        "should be placing greater concentration on that."

        "The other thing was election security, and in fact, in one of his last acts, he appointed an election security czar, somebody who will oversee or coordinate all the government efforts heading into the 2020 balloting.",
        "So Coats was also known as a guy who didn't really seek to politicize intelligence, as is the job of the DNI.",
        "Could that change with his successor, though, John Ratcliffe, who's been such a vocal defender of the president?",
        "Well, that's been the concern.",
        "Again, early days - he still needs to be formally nominated and confirmed.",
