        "And so he says that he thinks, on balance, this tax bill will do that more than he originally anticipated.",
        "I talked to him a little bit last week, and he said his biggest concerns were on the individual side of the tax code.",
        "He was worried that there were going to be too many tax cuts there, but he seems to now think that, on balance, this is a good thing."
