        "Well, European Union members have long been at odds over migration policies.",
        "They're viewed as issues of national sovereignty and security.",
        "And, as you've just suggested, they don't want the burden of these newcomers.",
        "So why now an attempt to forge a common policy?",
        "Have things just got that bad?",
        "Well, certainly the death last month of the some 900 migrants and the continuing flow from Libya is definitely jolting the European Union into doing something.",
        "And in this so-called EU new migration agenda that they have, there are other things.",
        "It calls also for an overhaul of asylum regulations.",
        "It would introduce a European asylum process, which is not the case today.",
        "Now it's done in the individual countries.",
        "Last year, there were a record 600,000 requests for asylum in Europe.",
        "And talk to us about this possible military operation to hunt down human traffickers and destroy their boats.",
        "How likely is that to happen?",
        "Well, depends who's talking.",
        "The EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, sounded very optimistic after her talks at the U.N., but many diplomats and human rights activists are skeptical about using force against smugglers in international waters and Libyan territorial waters.",
        "Obviously the boats would have to be empty before they're going to be destroyed, and that means probably raising them down inside Libyan ports.",
        "But that, of course, raises the Libya conundrum; it's in a state of anarchy with two rival governments, and the one that's internationally recognized says it won't authorize the use of force on its territory.",
        "And also the EU foreign policy chief this week told the U.N.",
        "that refugees and migrants intercepted at sea will not be sent back against their will.",
        "So that sounds like the smugglers will stay in business.",
        "It's a booming business.",
        "A report released yesterday by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime - that's a network of law enforcement and development groups - says the smuggling trade is worth up to $323 million a year in Libya alone and that much of that money is being funneled into terrorist groups, including the self-proclaimed Islamic State.",
        "The report also says that intervening off Libya's coast is unlikely to stop the human flow to Europe because the smugglers don't really care what happens to migrants once they've left Libyan shores.",
        "Sylvia, thanks very much.",
        "Thank you, Renee.",

        "For two years, Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been out of the headlines at least in part because he's been mostly out of sight, holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.",
        "Now he says he is leaving soon.",
        "He announced that at a press conference in London today.",
        "Let's get the latest from NPR's Ari Shapiro.",
        "Ari, this has been a story with lot of twists and turns.",
        "Can you give me the 45-second back story to remind us about Assange and why he's so controversial?"

        "In Sweden, Assange is wanted on entirely separate allegations of rape and sexual assault.",
        "Ecuador offered him political asylum at the embassy in London a couple of years ago, and things have been more or less quiet since then until now.",
        "Until now, which makes you wonder, I mean, if he's really a legal target in two countries, he had this asylum, he was safe in the Ecuadorian Embassy, why's he leaving?",
        "He says it's because of health concerns.",
        "During his news conference this morning he said, quote, \"\"as you can imagine, being detained in various ways in this country without charge for four years and in this embassy for two years, which has no outside area, therefore no sunlight.\"\" He said, it's an environment in which any healthy person would find themselves soon enough with certain difficulties.",
        "He said the United Nations' minimum standard for prisoners is one hour a day outdoors, and he noted that he's not even officially even a prisoner.",
        "OK, so he's saying all of this at a press conference.",
        "Did he talk about the allegations against him in the United States and Sweden?",
        "Yeah, he did.",
        "In fact the entire event had a pretty defensive tone.",
        "Assange laid out his rebuttal to the allegations against him both in the U.S.",
        "and in Sweden.",
        "He said he has not been officially publicly charged with any crimes.",
        "He said that a few times.",
        "British officials always said that if he set foot outside the embassy, he would be arrested immediately, which would likely mean deportation to either Sweden or to the U.S.",
        "to face trial.",
        "During this press conference, Assange argued that his persecution is a threat to journalists everywhere.",
        "In terms of tone, he spoke slowly, often stopping and restarting his sentences.",
        "You remember in the past in interviews, he has come across as dashing, energetic, sort of a renegade.",
        "Yeah.",
        "During this morning's event, he looked kind of weak and tired."
