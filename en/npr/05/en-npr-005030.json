        "Not really.",
        "Each person's recovery from a brain injury is different, and in John's case or another patient's case, it's something that we monitor closely, knowing that the rate of recovery varies from person to person.",

        "A lot of factors.",
        "One is the injured brain itself.",
        "In general, the younger you are when you have the brain injury, your chances for recovering will be better, as well, as compared to someone who's much older.",
        "The type of the injury, the severity of the injury or if there were any complications that occurred after the brain injury.",
        "That is why the first several days following a brain injury is critical, because there are complications that are quite difficult to prevent.",
        "No matter what we do, they occur.",
        "And many times those complications, when they set in, even with the best therapies given may hinder a person's recovery in the long term.",
        "Swelling of the brain.",
        "Swelling of the brain.",
        "There are complications such as hydrocephalus, which is an abnormal collection of fluid in the brain.",
        "Someone may have an infection.",
        "Someone may have lost blood, or the blood pressure is not maintained well.",
        "And those factors can contribute to a poor recovery.",
        "We also hear that - we've learned that various parts of the brain regulate certain parts of human activity.",
        "And when someone like John Keller says I lost my sense of smell for two years, how does - if that section of the brain has been lost due to the injury, if that's the part of the brain that's been taken out for one reason or another, how does the brain re-teach itself to smell?",
        "Oh, there are different ways.",
        "Loss of smell is one of the more common problems that we encounter with people, especially those who have a fracture in the front part of their skull because the nerve that controls smell is located in that area.",
        "It's a very fragile nerve.",
        "So it's easily injured.",
        "And fortunately, that test -smell is not tested all the time in many people with brain injuries, either because our patients are not able to respond accurately, or sometimes the clinicians just forget to test that.",
        "But an injury to the nerve that causes a loss of smell is not rare at all.",
        "And there are different ways to treat this.",
        "Sometimes in spite of all efforts, that ability cannot be recovered.",
        "But we try to incorporate that in therapies by presenting different stimuli, different smells.",
        "And, you know, that's quite important for us to assess because if we're going to send someone home from the hospital, and this person is going to live by himself or herself, and if unfortunately there is a gas leak, how will this person know?",
        "So it's something that we will look at.",
        "So if we are not successful in rehabilitating this sense of smell, then we have to find ways how we can get around that.",
        "Dr.",
        "Francisco, stay with us if you will.",

        "Some 20 percent of all brain injuries are due to violence.",
        "Half of all injuries are alcohol-related, and men are more likely to suffer TBI than women.",
        "Traumatic brain injury has also become the signature wound of the war in Iraq, largely because of roadside bombs, and improvements in battlefield medicine allow more wounded troops to survive those attacks.",

        "Dr. Francisco?",
        "Sure, I think that relates to what I mentioned earlier.",
        "The earlier we can prevent complications from happening, we're giving our patients a better chance for recovery.",

        "What they're going to do may have a profound impact on the eventual outcome of our patients."
