        "Well, luckily, the first person onsite was an RN and kept her stabilized until the AirLIFE showed up.",

        "All right, Farai, talk to me about, first of all, how you and your sister are doing locked up in that car together.",
        "She'd be able to point at a refrigerator - the most common example she gave me - she pointed at a refrigerator, tell you how it works, tell you different things in it, but she could not say the word refrigerator while actually looking at the fridge.",
        "The same thing, she could open up milk.",
        "She could tell you about the milk and the cow and such but not be able to tell you that that is called milk.",

        "Well, thank you very much.",

        "There's a very big chance that he may have strained his neck muscles, as well.",

        "So sometimes if you do something within the appropriate context, so if go down to the patient's room, and I have them actually attempt to brush their teeth as part of their typical morning routine, and sometimes you'll see the skill level almost start to kick in, in a way.",
        "And then there are other times where you really do have to draw the patient's attention to each part of the task, and it's certainly effortful, but you're hoping to see that pay off in the end.",
