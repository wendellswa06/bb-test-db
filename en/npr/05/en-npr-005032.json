        "You know, some of our patients are discharged at a severely disabled level.",
        "And so trying to encourage the patient and the family not to give up, to keep at the therapies, to keep working on all of those skills can sometimes be a challenge.",
        "So frustration, effectively.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Dr.",
        "Francisco, I wonder: I know you have experience with that, as well.",
        "Is frustration a significant problem?",
        "It is.",
        "And unfortunately, a lot of people tend to give up because they do not see the changes that they want to see in a quick - in a short time.",
        "So we have to act as advocates to our patients and their families, as well, and remind that sometimes it takes a very long time before recovery can take place.",
        "You heard this from John Keller earlier.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The caller from San Antonio, for instance, mentioned that it took about a year and a half before they saw any significant improvement with -in his friend.",
        "So while it really is - it would have been great if we can see all the changes within a week or two.",
        "That is not the reality.",
        "Our - many of our patients take very small steps.",
        "We do not expect big changes in a week or two, even after their discharge from rehabilitation, which may last as long as three to four weeks.",
        "Once they're discharged, we tell them that this is not the end of the recovery.",
        "Recovery will take place over a long period of time.",
        "Sarina Piergrossi, I wonder, sometimes do people understand that they still need therapy, they still need help?",
        "Not always.",
        "That can be the tricky part, especially with brain injury, although we see it sometimes with stroke patients.",
        "But that lack of insight or awareness into one's deficit - so, you know, the rehabilitation process is definitely hard.",
        "And if you have a patient that doesn't necessarily buy into the need for using a piece of equipment or using some sort of strategy to complete a task, then that certainly make it much more difficult."

        "And so sometimes, the therapy then is directed at getting them to see those deficit areas, to understand how they impact their function or their performance, their ability to return to work or to return a social life, and trying to kind of expose them to that over time so that they start to buy into the need for more therapy or their need for some sort of alternate approach to a task.",

        "I just said, I couldn't agree more with Sarina.",
        "Many times, we find ourselves negotiating with our patients and their caregivers, their family members.",
        "We have to explain to them exactly why a particular device is needed, or why therapy for a long period of time will be needed.",
        "And many times, they burn out, so sometimes we give them a break.",
        "And then after that, we reengage them into rehabilitation process.",
        "We're talking with Doctor Gerard Francisco, chief medical officer at TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital, an institute for rehabilitation and research in Houston, and chair of the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at the University of Texas.",

        "What would be the difference?",
        "Hi.",
        "I'm also an occupational therapist, and I've worked in brain injury for many years.",
        "And I was agreeing with Sarina saying the - sort of buying into the deficit or being able to see the deficit, the lack of insight is often an issue.",
        "And you were speaking of, doctor, earlier, the lack of smell, and a lot of times that's not assessed.",
        "And I try often, in an occupational therapy evaluation, to definitely assess the sense of smell and whether it's functional or not.",
        "And I had a patient who really didn't believe he had a lack of smell or a problem with smelling, and I had to convince him, build that insight, build that awareness.",
        "So I turned him around in the clinic, and behind his back, across the clinic, use a wood-burning kit and actually burnt wood to the point of smoke, and had him turn around to prove to him that he couldn't smell the smoke prior to turning around, to show him that he needed to have the smoking -smoke alarms, have, you know, batteries working and to inspect his food visually, you know, defend on or compensate with another sense, like vision, because of lack of smell, to read expiration dates on foods, to have, you know, ventilation and open windows when using cleaning products.",
        "I was trying to build compensations for the sensory deficit.",
        "So...",
        "That's interesting.",
        "He didn't realize the range of things he'd need the sense of smell for.",
        "Of course, you'd probably need a smoke detector, anyway, even if you do have a sense of smell.",
        "Right.",
        "Right."
