        "Well, under the laws of war, if the United States is at war, it has a very strong legitimate argument that it can target certain individuals with a lethal strike.",
        "That's always been the case in warfare.",
        "As soon as you move to a law enforcement model, you can't just strike and kill people because you've decided that they're a potential threat to American citizens.",
        "Which, by the way, many people would think would be a good thing.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, and under the law enforcement model, which is very clearly spelled out in UN agreements that the United States has signed, you have to give the target an opportunity to surrender.",
        "That pretty much means that you have to send in ground forces.",
        "We did when we raided in Abbottabad, when we sent in the SEALs with instructions to arrest bin Laden if possible, kill him if necessary.",
        "We did it when we sent Delta Force in to Mogadishu in 1993.",
        "If there is resistance when you introduce ground forces, you introduce the potential for catastrophically large numbers of casualties, both American military personnel and civilians.",

        "In the case of Mogadishu, 500 to 1,000 Somalis were killed.",
        "That's a number roughly equal to all of the civilians killed in drone strikes over the last 10 years.",
        "I think it's a difficult question, but I do think that people ought to understand that when you step from a war model to a law enforcement model, that implies the likelihood of far greater numbers of casualties on both sides.",

        "It was a secret site where you could get pot, heroin and meth.",
        "And the Silk Road was run by a figure known only as the Dread Pirate Roberts.",

        "From the start, the Silk Road was more than just a Craigslist for illegal drugs.",
        "There was a philosophy to the site - a belief that people should be able to buy and sell pretty much anything without government interference, but not without a leader.",
        "On February 5, 2012, this nameless system administrator, the guy who had actually created the Silk Road, gave himself an identity.",
