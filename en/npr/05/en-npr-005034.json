        "If a contact group is not formed in the next few days, they can impose further travel restrictions, more broad economic sanctions.",
        "Russia, it looks like from some of the demands they're making, is interested in ensuring in some way that there's a guarantee that political parties sympathetic to Moscow would retain some kind of role in governing Ukraine.",
        "Moscow points to an agreement signed February 21st and some of the promises of constitutional change in that that the Kremlin would like to see happen.",
