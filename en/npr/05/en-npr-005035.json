        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Now you wrote in a piece for the online magazine Slate that you dispute these poll findings that indicate some 80 percent of the people in Lebanon support Hezbollah.",
        "Why do you think that's wrong?",
        "Well, because I certainly am not seeing that around me on the ground.",
        "And because I'm basically listening to the preoccupation of politicians in the country.",
        "The fact is that virtually no one that I've spoken to - and this is anecdotal of course - outside the Shiite community wants to have anything to do with what's going on.",
        "There's great anger directed against Hezbollah.",
        "But at the same time, I mean at official levels among the political community, politicians are extremely worried of sectarian tensions, precisely because of what Hezbollah has done.",
        "That certainly doesn't indicate mass support for Hezbollah.",
        "They've won a lot of support by providing services to people in the south, to Shiites in the south.",
        "Basic services like paying gas bills and providing food.",
        "They will have to do a lot now, now that there are thousands of refugees, thousands of people homeless, thousands of people needing basic services.",
        "How are they going to do that?",
        "Can you imagine an end to the Syrian war in which one side decisively defeats the other on the battlefield?",
        "That is, either your side is crushed by the Assad regime, or you march triumphantly through the streets of Damascus having defeated the government?",
        "If not, don't you at some point have to negotiate with the regime some end to the fighting, a cease fire, a peace agreement for the country?",
        "One worker who has remained is Jassiel, who only wants to be identified by her first name.",

        "She says the immigration law has struck fear throughout the Hispanic community in South Alabama, in part because of a provision that allows police to jail suspects on reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally.",
        "They're scared.",
        "They - it is sad because they feel like they are being treating as a criminal.",
        "All we ask is that those who live and work in our state do so legally.",
        "That's Republican Governor Robert Bentley at a news conference yesterday announcing a new initiative called Work Alabama, a response to the mounting complaints from businesses that the new law is driving away even the legal seasonal workers they count on.",
        "On a short-term basis we want to match up the jobs that are available today in Alabama with the people who are looking for a job right now."

        "Yes, we lost al-Qusair.",
        "And at the last week of the fight, the regime used very heavily the air force, supported by the long-distance artillery and the artillery of the tanks and the SCUD missiles.",
        "And in every minute, there were more than 18 to 20 missiles against that part of this town - every minute.",
        "And they destroyed really everything in the northern part of the town.",
        "And (unintelligible) they couldn't face a very, very powerful offensive because they were armed only with light Kalashnikovs.",

        "But, Gen.",
        "Idris, given the weapons and the foreign assistance that the Assad regime had in al-Qusair, would shoulder-launched missiles and anti-tank weapons have actually made that great a difference in that fight?",
        "Or were you simply overpowered regardless of what the rebels were armed with?",
        "Of course, we need these anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles, and that would change a lot of things.",
        "But what happened in al-Qusair was, it was better to go out of this town and to rebuild themselves to attack the regime forces elsewhere.",
        "So you're saying it was a tactical withdrawal from al-Qusair.",
        "But can you actually imagine retaking that town, having the strength to oust the government from al-Qusair?",

        "And my main fear is that they will try to redirect Shiite anger, Shiite frustration, Shiite suffering against the parties political adversaries.",

        "They will try to impose a government that does not reflect the parliamentary majority, but that will bring in many of their allies, allies that are close to Syria, close to Iran.",
        "And that effectively, they will control the government, because sitting right behind the government, will be the most effective military force in the country, which is Hezbollah's militia.",
        "So they will shape the quote unquote civilian institutions of the state, reshape them in their favor, and they will protect it with the Praetorian Guard that is Hezbollah's armed force.",

        "What are they talking about, what are they afraid of?",
