        "As a result, Goldwein says, the CPI overstates the price increases that consumers actually pay.",
        "That's important because the government uses CPI to set cost of living adjustments for Social Security and other programs.",

        "Over ten years, that's more like three percent.",
        "Over 20 years, that's more like seven percent.",
        "And so, if you continue to use this index, it does have large long-term effects, even though the effect from each year to the next is very tiny."
