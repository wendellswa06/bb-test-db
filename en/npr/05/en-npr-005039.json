        "And what did you learn from him, do you think, Margaret Cho?",
        "Well, I think that I felt - I had a very strong connection with him.",
        "We had actually never physically met, but we had a sort of a correspondence where he would send me his book and I would send him my book.",
        "And he was a very big fan of mine, which was really incredible because I was a huge fan of his.",
        "And I think what I learned from him is a kind of understanding that the surreal - in the realm of surreal, there is plenty of room for compassion, as well.",
        "So I thought he was an incredible man.",
        "What an icon for comedy and what an icon for somebody like myself who watched him my entire life.",
        "So he was really a great man.",
        "Lewis Black, did you think you learned anything from George Carlin?",
        "Yeah, I learned where I wanted - what I wanted to aspire to.",
        "There's really, when you look at the history of comedy, there's Lenny Bruce, who kind of cuts a swatch through the - you know, he kind of creates a road, and then you had George and Richard Pryor, who I think created kind of a highway and took us from where Bruce was.",
        "They're the ones who really said, OK, this is - we've come this far where we can continue to move down that road.",
        "And I learned that talking about things that are dark is legitimate in humor.",
        "One of things that Carlin always talked about, at least in interviews, not necessarily from the stage, but he always talked about his - he felt an obligation to find lines and then cross them.",
        "And Margaret Cho, I know that that's something you do, too.",
        "Yes, I would like to be able to do that, to be able to push boundaries and to challenge the audience as much as you can.",
        "And to never underestimate that, which is, I think, something that was really important, that's something that George Carlin was really amazing at, is he really brought the audience up a level.",
        "You know, brought everybody up a notch.",
        "You know, he did not speak down to people.",
        "He was very - I don't know, he was so smart and he just assumed everybody else was, and so you actually all were considered smart, you know, in his world, which is great."

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I remember the kind of - there was the straight George Carlin, and I remember that vaguely, but the hippy-dippy weatherman was really kind of - it was really kind of stunning because it was one of those, oh, wow, he's doing - these are pot jokes.",
        "He's talking about grass!",
        "It was like unbelievable that you could, you know, because there was so little in terms of, you know, on television, the kind of, where comedy could really breathe.",
        "It was really extraordinary to watch this kind of humor.",
        "You mentioned Lenny Bruce, and I think Carlin often said that he was sort of a tie and a suit comedian doing a double act until he saw Lenny Bruce, and he said, now I know what I want to do.",
        "Yeah, I'm sure that's the case.",
        "I mean, because it really was - I mean, Lenny kind of broke that ground and George really, I think, George went further with it.",
        "And in a lot of ways - the stunning thing about George, I think, and Margaret would agree with this, is the precision of his language.",
        "I mean, that \"\"Stuff\"\" thing you played.",
        "It's unbelievable.",
        "It's like music."

        "That brevity is the soul of wit.",
        "It's so true.",
        "He's so brief.",

        "Did you ever borrow any of his material?",
        "Not on my show.",
        "My problem was, you know, the thing I always had difficulty with was I had such a lousy memory.",
        "It's what makes comics great to me is I could watch Margaret and then watch it two weeks later and I'd laugh again because I wouldn't remember.",

        "I'm the same.",
        "If Carlin had done all the drugs he said he did, how could he remember all that material?",

        "And my older cousin, who I idolized, had just left to college and his record collection was in the basement.",
        "And so at 10, I'd sneak down there and I would listen and giggle with my hands over my mouth at these incredible things that George was saying.",
        "It was - basically, he destroyed the idea of dirty words for me.",
        "He was subversive.",
        "He was outright subversive, wasn't he?",
        "Absolutely, and it made me realize that - OK, if someone drops the F-bomb, so to speak, out of context, it's ignorance.",
        "But if you're exploring why it's dirty and how do people react to it and what's funny about it, it's art, and he was an artist.",
        "He was a wordsmith.",
        "He forged ideas around words that stick with me to this day, and I mourn his passing.",

        "He never played down to his audience.",
        "Not in the least.",
        "It's one of those things - I believe it's why he stayed on HBO, in part because HBO was smart enough to recognize that, but also, HBO's a place you can go ahead, that's one of the few channels you have as a comedian to actually say what it is you want to say directly to your audience without anybody looking over your shoulder.",
        "And he really took advantage of that to the max.",
        "There's at no time with anything that he does a moment of pandering.",
        "None!",

        "I'm a retired deputy sheriff from Los Angels County, and several years ago, almost 30 now, I stopped a Volkswagen van that was speeding down Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu.",
        "And when I pulled the vehicle over, I walked up and the driver rolled down the window and it was like a scene out of a Cheech and Chong movie.",
        "The smoke just billowed out of the car and I recognized Mr. Carlin right away.",
        "And at first I was a little stunned.",
        "So we talked for a minute, and when I realized that he wasn't incapacitated or anything, I told him that if he'd roll down the windows and air out the van and not do over the speed limit, he could go on his way.",
        "And he just stared at - he looked at me up and down and he looked in his mirror at the police car and he said, are you a real policeman?",
        "And I assured him that I was and told him that it was a pleasure meeting him.",
        "And I was going to ask him for an autograph on a blank ticket but he had a stack of pictures, eight...",
        "I think he was going to say eight by 10 pictures before his cell phone battery ran out.",
        "A remarkable story.",
        "Yeah, that's a great story."
