        "Marijuana was not the only drug he used, and he said much later in life that he regretted a lot of that, and particularly the effect that it had on his daughter, yet it was a big part of his act.",
        "And Margaret Cho, he was very honest about his own mistakes in life and about the effects that they had on his life, and he was never shy about holding himself up to the same standards he held everybody else up to.",
        "Which I think is really marvelous, and one of the things that made him have such a huge, huge, like, fan base.",
        "People really responded to that honesty and that just - that purity of just - the purity of heart that he had in talking about it.",
        "And his humaneness and his fallibility was a very, very important part of his work and his struggle with addictions and everything.",
        "It was really a wonder - his candor was so wonderful, which is one of the things that I really got from him and it influenced me a lot.",
        "And Lewis Black, it could also be emphasized that he found a way, his path was just not in his comedy, but he made it possible for other comedians to go out and make a living doing what they did.",
        "He certainly made it possible for me to make a living.",
        "I don't think Margaret or I would have had the opportunities we have as comedians without him.",
        "Because there are not a lot of us who kind of go in that kind of a path, that followed his kind of path.",
        "And it's, you know, he's the one who really, you know, made it easier by talking about both Margaret and I in a variety of places, I think, opened up the opportunities we had."

        "Yes, that's right.",
        "We've been sort of through this before.",
        "The real bottom line question here, Neal, was, who was going to decide in the end whether these people could be detained indefinitely?",
        "Would it be the military, which is what the Bush administration said, or judges?",
        "And at five to four the court said, judges, that since the beginning of the constitution, the notion has been that if the government is going to lock you up and hold you, that you have the right to go before a judge and to argue that you've got the wrong man.",
        "I'm not who you say you are, and I should be freed.",
        "Basically, that's what the court said, that in the end, this is a matter for judges to decide.",
        "What you just described is pretty much the writ of habeas corpus: produce the body and goes back not just throughout the U.S.",
        "Constitution but in English common law.",
        "Yes, that's absolutely right, and the court detailed a lot of that history.",
        "As you know, the difficulty, of course, is whether habeas corpus applies in a military setting because there's a whole lot of law on the other side that says, well, if you're a war prisoner - as Justice Scalia said, we didn't give the several 100,000 Germans held in the United States hearings because that was a war situation.",
        "So we've been in court fighting about six years over what's the right way to understand the detainees in this current, whatever it is, war on terror.",
        "And as I say, the court has been closely split all along, but they keep coming out to it's basically been a five to four majority, to say, this is a matter for judges to decide in the end.",
        "And so they're saying these people can go to court and can argue for their freedom.",
        "They also said, the last time this was rejected, the Bush administration went to Congress and had Congress pass a law setting out these new procedures, and all of these things.",
        "Effectively what the court's decision today was to overturn that law?",
        "Yes, that's exactly right.",
        "Four years ago the courts said the habeas law on the books gives these people a right to go to court.",
        "The administration went back to Congress, they changed the law.",
        "And then, now two years after they changed the law, the Supreme Court said, no, it's unconstitutional to take away the right to habeas corpus except during times of grave national emergency when the writ can be suspended.",
        "This is not that, and therefore the law is unconstitutional.",
        "And of course, it was suspended during the Civil War,famously, by Abraham Lincoln.",
        "Yes, that's correct.",

        "Well, the government set up sort of a mid-point procedure where they said some military officers would review your case and decide whether you're an enemy combatant.",
        "And the the court basically said that procedure is flawed in a number of different ways.",
        "You don't have a real lawyer, you can't demand to see all the evidence against you, you can't bring in new evidence.",
        "And the court said, that's basically flawed.",
        "That doesn't substitute for the right to go before a judge.",
        "And so, as I say, this is a sort of, you can go before a judge.",
        "I should say, though, the court did not in the end say what the law is.",
        "I mean, suppose - I can think of two situations.",
        "One is, you have a detainee, you go before a court, and there's no real evidence that this person was a dangerous fighter.",
        "He says, I was a cab driver, I was a goat herder, and I was picked up.",
        "That person, I think, will be able to argue, I should be released and released now.",

        "What does the judge do?",

        "If you're a civilian, and I say, Neal, you're a dangerous guy.",
        "You can say, oh, sure, that may be so, but you've got to charge me with a crime.",

        "Until the war is over.",
        "So they didn't actually decide the substantive question.",
        "What is the law, in the end, when these cases go back before federal judges?",
        "I just wonder, in terms of the Supreme Court, is this going to be the Bush administration's last bite at this particular set of issues?",

        "We can do that immediately, and this has been a tremendous victory.",
        "We've finally gotten the rule of law restored, and in many ways de-politicized this whole detention situation in Guantanamo and gotten each of the individuals and the government assertions now into a Federal Court before a district judge and a regular habeas proceeding.",
        "And it's a tremendous victory.",
        "Is it clear to you though, if a court says your client is being held unconstitutionally that he would be then released?",
        "I think that the Supreme Court was very careful in how they crafted the decision, and really, the idea of practicality is just a theme throughout the whole opinion.",
        "And so when it comes to the question of remedy, the court made clear that it is the same in any other historical case of habeas.",
        "If the court finds that our client or an individual is being held unlawfully in Guantanamo, it has the ability and flexibility under habeas to craft an appropriate remedy."
