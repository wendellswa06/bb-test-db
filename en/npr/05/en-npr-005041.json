        "So it really, in many instances for these individuals, they are going to be found to have been held unlawfully.",
        "The government just simply doesn't have a legal basis for detaining them.",
        "They don't have facts to prove that they were fighting because these men weren't fighting.",
        "And people like that most likely will be ordered to be released if the government doesn't just release them on its own.",
        "I think that individuals who have committed a crime, whether it's a violation of the laws of war or criminal act, the court will likely give the government an option to charge them rather than release them.",
        "And let me ask you, in particular, you have, I think, a couple of clients in Guantanamo Bay.",

        "Sure.",

        "One situation that we have, or one of the situations of our clients, involves a man who is from Libya who cannot be returned to Libya because he was - the United Stated alleges that he was part of a political opposition group to Gaddafi, who of course is a very anti-democratic dictator.",
        "So if our client is sent back to Libya, he faces certain persecution and will be imprisoned and may face torture.",
        "So, he's someone who the United States has been trying to send back to Libya and has been refusing to let him be reunited with his family in another country.",
        "There are approximately 50 or so prisoners in that similar position.",
        "We're hoping, now that a habeas court is involved, we'll have a judge supervising his case that we'll be able to negotiate with the United States to have him, in particular, reunited with his family in a safe country.",
        "For other clients, we believe they're being held based on information that's been extracted through torture either of themselves or because of other detainees' torture.",
        "And those are the kinds of cases that we'd want to get before a judge and be able to say that the government's only evidence against our client is information that comes from torture.",

        "Which is why, by the way, they're not before military commissions.",

        "This is a pretty simple question.",
        "And forgive me if I'm naive, but I'm wondering why the government is so afraid of bringing these detainees between - in front of the court and being able to say why we have them?",
        "I understand we have to protect our law enforcement and military agencies and the people we have undercover or whatever they're trying to do, and trying to protect the American people.",
        "But what's the problem?",
        "Why can't we tell people why we have them if we're supposed to be leading the world in the fight on terrorism?",
        "David Savage?",
        "What was the government's argument for saying they do not have the right of habeas corpus?",
        "Well, I think there was two questions there.",

        "I don't know the answer to the question of why they didn't allow more openness.",
        "In other words, the substance of the answer is the government believes, the military believes, these were dangerous people.",
        "We picked them up on the battlefield in Afghanistan, or something like that.",
        "We think they were dangerous fighters.",
        "They were committed Islamic something or other, militants, and if we let them go they're going to go back to Afghanistan or to Iraq and fight against us.",
        "That's what they say.",
        "I don't know the answer to the question of why they wouldn't allow that to be said, to some degree, in a public hearing.",
        "That's what we're going to get, is a public hearing.",
        "But I think they do think they know why they want to keep them.",
        "I don't understand why they wouldn't allow some of that evidence to be presented to the public so it could understand it better.",
        "All right.",

        "The so-called tribunals of the trials of some of the detainees alleged to have committed war crimes?",
        "They are already under way.",
        "Well, there's about 15 of those detainees out of the 270 prisoners that are facing commissions.",
        "And although the opinion doesn't deal directly with the legal questions, in most cases, the court's findings about Guantanamo and their ruling that Guantanamo actually falls within the scope of the court's jurisdiction, those may have implications for the Commission.",
        "And it certainly means that as those prisoners go through their trials that they would have some relief in habeas, in some form, once the trials are over in federal court."

        "Hi.",
        "My question is about what this case does for the Congress's ability to strip course of jurisdiction?",
        "Because my understanding is that Congress had tried twice to say, lower courts, and appellate courts can't hear these cases.",
        "While the Supreme Court has original jurisdiction it's unlikely that they would take up hundreds of habeas cases.",
        "So given that this seems like such a - you know, this is kind of the third time around, is it ever possible for Congress to say, you know, there are these classic cases that courts can't hear, or will the court always say where there's some fundamental right, like this, with, you know, the right to challenge your detention, that it's so important that lower courts must hear it and Congress can't get in the way?",
        "David, what do you think?",
        "What does the ruling say?",
        "Well, I think his basic - his big question is unanswered.",
        "That is, we never confronted the situation where Congress has stripped away the power of the courts to hear a whole category of cases.",
        "And it's been uphill.",
        "It does seem like the Supreme Court's inclined to say, this is in the Constitution.",
        "Congress can only take it away in a time of insurrection.",
        "They didn't do that here.",
        "And they basically rejected Congress' move to get them out of this business.",
        "And I thought that was going to be a really hard issue for them.",
        "And I think that's why they spent sixty pages writing this opinion.",
        "Because they had to conclude that the habeas corpus was so fundamental, so much a part of the principle, it was in the Constitution at the time, and in effect, Congress can't limit it, can't take it away.",
        "Gitanjali Gutierrez, is that your interpretation?",
        "And I hate to sound dramatic, but the consequences for all the horrible things that these people are going to accomplish is not going to be on the shoulders of political branches.",
        "It's going to be on the shoulders of the court's majority.",
        "Yes.",
        "It is.",
        "It is.",
        "I think the court recognized that habeas is a historical tool that people use to keep from being imprisoned unlawfully, whether it's the king or the president.",
        "And they did spend a great deal of time going back to the British Empire and historical case where habeas was recognized.",
        "And so I think the decision earlier, the first time the Supreme Court considered the detentions, it was a case considering a statute, a habeas statute.",
        "But this is a constitutional decision.",
        "It gives it much more finality.",
        "And it was a rebuke to the Congress for trying to take away that right."

        "The basic proposition here is that the court believes, henceforth, without any historical basis or any basis in prior caseloads - they disingenuously, by the way, misconstrued, avoid acknowledging how many cases they've overturning - they're basically saying the Constitution follows the flag.",
        "It's not about Guantanamo.",
