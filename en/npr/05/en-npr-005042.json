        "And by the way, they said it very candidly.",
        "We want to sit at the table, and we're going to have first and last say in this.",
        "And by the way, our view is fundamentally that no issue anymore in national securities' fear can be resolved without us playing a role.",

        "We exist that you're sufferance political branches.",
        "You can give us something statutorily, you giveth, but you also taketh.",

        "You and Congress have overstepped, this is not constitutional?",
        "Of course it's their role to say if there's a Constitutional basis for it.",
        "But the notion that every exertion of political power by the United States as a government, as a body polity, is necessarily subject to judicial review, especially when it's done overseas and impacts non-Americans, would have stunned every single framer.",
        "I mean, that's breathtakingly arrogant.",
        "The Constitution doesn't say a judiciary has to be stirring every pot.",
        "What do you think the practical effect of this ruling is going to be?",
        "The practical effect is, first of all, it engenders an almost uncertainty.",
        "It basically says the Constitution applies to what you do overseas, certainly in the case of habeas.",
        "But potentially in a case of many of our Constitutional provisions.",
        "But we're not going to tell you exactly what it means.",
        "So you go back and come back to us, you pass another statute and another statute and another statute, and then we'll tell you again.",
        "We'll be, basically, the school marm here.",
        "But that's sort of a big picture.",
        "The small picture, away from Constitutional, you know, high-faluting stuff to pracatical implications.",
        "They made it very clear in their discussion why what Congress created here, and by the way, your caller was wrong.",
        "Congress did not divest everybody below Supreme Court level of jurisdiction.They put the jurisdiction for a year in the D.C.",
        "circuit, OK, instead of starting with a district court which, by the way, Congress could abolish.",
        "Now it's going to abolish all district courts tomorrow.",
        "It has no Constitutional entitlement to having district courts.",
        "Congress can abolish all court of appeals.",
        "The only court that has to remain in inviolate is Supreme Court.",
        "But basically, what they said in their discussion of why the particular judicial review mode that Congress created here is insufficient, and they made very clear, majority opinion, written by Justice Kennedy, that they want presence of lawyers, but they want the presence of individuals believed to be enemy combatants during the entire portion of proceedings.",
        "Now, we're not talking about the commissions here, we're talking about, basically, a process to confirm that you're indeed an enemy combatant.",
        "And by the way, Neal, it's not limited to unlawful enemy combatants, it's limited to lawful ones, too.",
        "So, henceforth, in every war in which the United States is engaged in a fight, whenever they capture somebody and take this person, you know, 10, 15 miles away from a battlefield to some secure location, that person will be entitled to Miranda, to a lawyer, to Miranda warning, to a lawyer, and an opportunity to have access to some district court.",
        "Even if that person is wearing the uniform of the opposing army and carrying a weapon?"

        "No, but forgive me.",
        "That's a question of process, that's a question of a system.",
        "Lots of arguments made by criminal suspects and enemy combatants don't hold any water.",
        "My point is this.",
        "On the face of his decision, anybody who claims that he is not an enemy combatant, no matter how compelling the evidence may seem to be against that person, is entitled to essentially, a criminal level - justice level of due process.",
        "Which is enormously, enormously, practically difficult.",

        "And by the way, while you're at it, you didn't even give the political branches any guidance as to how to deal with those issues.",
        "Because again, it is not, repeat not about habeas only.",

        "government supposed to know?",
        "I mean, with just combat operations, which involve many things other than detaining captured combatants, how is it to know in what way is it appropriate for it to comply with the full panoply of relevant constitutional provisions?",
        "I don't know.",
        "I don't think anybody in the administration knows.",
        "So we're going to have to come back to - I mean, this whole thing, as I said, is breathtaking in its enormous grab of power, well beyond Guantanamo, well beyond detention issues.",

        "David Savage, as I'm going through that, is this an overreach by the Supreme Court, as we just heard by David Rivkin argue, or was it a correction of overreaching by the president and the Congress, as we heard earlier?",
        "Well, that's a hard one.",
        "It depends whether you like the majority or the dissent.",
        "You know, I think there has been a majority in the court all along to say that if you're going to hold these people for a long time, you have to give them some judicial review.",
        "Kennedy acknowledged in his opinion, by the way, that this doesn't apply to - we would have a different view in an emergency, and we would have a different view if this was a short-term thing.",

        "But it's going to be a continued long, heavy on litigation, a long process ahead.",
        "Would this whole thing have been moot, unimportant, not argued, if the Bush administration had said, these are prisoners of war in the first place, Geneva Convention applies?",
        "I think so.",
        "I think had they said from the beginning we're going to treat them like prisoners of war, we're going to give them the brief, what were supposed to be battlefield hearings and then we're going to hold them, basically they would have been acting under a recognized military law, international law, and I think there's a good chance we would not have been through six years of litigation on this.",

        "Jim, I'm trying to devise a question from what you've been saying, and what I'm getting is, David Savage, does the constitution draw a distinction between - there are certainly procedures for declarations of war, which were not followed in this particular case, they haven't been followed since the Second World War, but nevertheless everybody pretty well accepts that war is a concept that does not necessarily require a declaration.",
        "Nevertheless, is there a distinction in any way between war and terrorism?",
        "And by that he means they will be looking for a Security Council resolution that will recognize an independent Palestinian state at some time in the future.",
        "Well, yes, and it's I think unfortunate in the period of 2002, 2003, that the Bush administration didn't go back to congress and try to get a legal authority to hold people in this war on terrorism, and say something like, these people are allied with terrorist groups, they're dangerous people.",
        "They're not standard prisoners of war and they're not standard criminals.",
        "But we want to give them some reasonable hearings to sort of determine who they are, but then have the legal authority to hold them indefinitely because they're bad people and we don't want to set them loose to go back and cause problems.",
        "And it's unfortunate that the administration didn't do that.",
        "They thought if we set up this prison outside the sovereign territory of the United States, that no federal courts, and no fed - and we could run this as a military matter.",
        "And that's the way they operated from 2000 - that was the model.",
        "The whole thing was to keep federal judges out of this.",
        "And so we spent all these years litigating whether the detainees could go into court and challenge their detention.",
        "The answer is now, yes, they can, but we don't really have a lot of law as to what it is, you know, whether the government can indefinitely hold people it says are dangerous.",
        "And obviously, much remains to be decided on that down the road.",
        "Remains to be decided, yes.",
