        "Doubled in the past year, according to one report, as spamming technology has become more sophisticated.",
        "Today we're going to talk about why it is so hard to block the spammers.",

        "It's true, but if you look at Bill Gates's other predictions -back in the 1980s he said, what was it, 640 kilobytes was enough for anyone.",
        "I'm not sure if he's a great technology forecaster.",
        "Nevertheless, what happened?",

        "It's true.",
        "The way that the spam fight has gone over the last 10 years or so that I've been writing about it is that you come up with some good anti-spam defenses, and then the offense comes up with some new schemes that foil them.",
        "And so it's a constant arms race, and right now the spammers are winning.",
        "And so the leapfrog technology as anti-spammers find some device that filters it out, the spammers figure out another way to do it.",
        "Exactly.",
        "A few years ago - maybe two, three years ago - the idea was let's look at key phrases in messages and say well, Viagra, mortgage solicitations, phrases like that are not that likely to appear in most peoples e-mail, and so you can do some statistical computations and figure out hey these - if it matches this pattern roughly, then let's filter it.",
        "But now spammers are using things like image files they're sending.",
        "Instead of sending it in text, they'll send it in a gif or jpeg.",
        "They'll also do things like send text taken from encyclopedias, from even works of fiction to try to bust these spam filtering techniques.",
        "It also matters where this spamming originates from.",
        "It does.",
        "In fact, what's been happening, especially in the last year or two, is that system administers, network administrators who were responsible for keeping their customers, their employees' in boxes and were not entirely overflowing, keeping them sane, they'll start blocking out entire blocks of internet addresses.",
        "Sometimes even entire countries, saying there's so much spam that's coming from say South Korea and we get so few legitimate e-mail messages, that let's just block that entire nation.",
        "This is a distressing trend, really, but there's not much that can be done.",

        "Well, this is geek speak for the concept that computers on the Internet are relatively insecure, especially if they're running Windows.",
        "You stand a better chance of having a secure computer if you're running Linux or Apple's OSX operating system.",
        "And so, because Windows at least historically has had a lot of security issues, it's easy - and because it's more prevalent - it's easier for a malicious person to exploit.",
        "So what they do, a bot will take over your computer and essentially infect it and then use it as a source of spam.",
        "And because your computer, up until the moment it got infected, was a perfectly legitimate computer - it had a very good reputation, so to speak, it was not known as a source of spam - and then it goes over to the dark side at that moment; it's very difficult for the anti-spam guys to detect.",
