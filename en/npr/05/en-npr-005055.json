        "Well, there's a difference of opinion on the political consequences of a shutdown.",
        "Tea Party groups aren't worried about it at all.",
        "As a matter of fact, their battle cry is cut it or shut it.",
        "The White House is wary of the political consequences.",
        "They've seen the polls that show people think both parties would be blamed if there was a shutdown.",
        "John Boehner, who lived through the last shutdown in 1995 when the Republicans were blamed, are worried that his party will bear the brunt again.",
        "But the bottom line is that Washington will look dysfunctional if there's a government shutdown.",
        "If our elected representatives can't bridge their differences on one percent of the federal budget on a bill for the last seven months of one fiscal year, how will voters, and more importantly, financial markets, react to that at a time when they're trying to evaluate how able our political system is to grapple with the much bigger, longer-term fiscal issues like the deficit and the debt and entitlements?",
        "I don't think they'll have any choice but to see a shutdown as an utter failure of leadership all around.",
        "Let's stay with those long-term issues, Mara.",

        "Well, I think he's hoping to reclaim some support for this war.",
        "This campaign has become very unpopular, and this president, frankly, has become very unpopular according to polls that gives a snapshot right now.",
        "In December, the president gave a series of speeches on Iraq.",
        "It was the one thing we can point to, I think, over the last seven or eight months, that seemed to work a little bit.",
        "The president's poll numbers dropped markedly after Hurricane Katrina.",
        "During those speeches in December we saw an up-tick, and I think the president's starting from a low number right now, it's not going to be a fast recovery, but if one is going to happen, he's hoping this series of speeches can be a start.",
        "So, he's hoping to, I guess, take the argument directly to the public?",
        "Directly to the public and through what he likes to call the media filter.",
        "He has always said that the world of journalism, in Washington, can prevent him and cloud the message that he's trying to get to the American people, and this is his way of at least trying to get some soundbites through to other parts of the country.",
        "Well, let's listen to another one.",
        "In this one, President Bush is talking about the Iraqi security forces and their work after the golden mosque bombing.",
        "And we saw the fruits of those changes in recent days in Iraq.",
        "After the Samarra bombings, it was the Iraqi security forces, not coalition forces, that restored order.",
        "In the hours after the attack, Iraqi leaders put the Iraqi security forces on alert, canceling all leaves and heightening security around mosques in critical sites.",
        "Using security plans developed for the December elections, they deployed Iraqi forces in Baghdad and to other troubled spots.",

        "What evidence does the White House have that the Iraqi forces are improving?",
        "It's a good question.",
        "The president often turns to numbers that he chooses and his staff chooses and suggests that the number of Iraqi battalions, the number of Iraqi forces, who are acting independently without the help of U.S.",
        "coalition forces, is going up.",
        "He presented some numbers today which he said were a bit farther up than in December.",
        "It's a very hard thing to measure, and when Pentagon officials have been grilled on Capital Hill about what these numbers really mean, there's certainly some doubts.",
        "But the president likes to say that as we see the number of battalions who are acting on their own go up, it shows that slowly but surely there's progress being made.",
        "Can you amplify this a little bit?",
        "Is there, are there some specific markers, by the year's end are they supposed to control a certain amount of territory?",
        "Is there anything we can look to as a, I guess, what's the word, a real matrix for analysis here?"

        "There is.",
        "The president has given a goal, and it's for Iraqi forces to control more territory than coalition forces by the end of this year.",
        "It's not clear what exactly that will mean, it's not clear they'll get there.",
        "But that's a benchmark that he set up.",
        "And there've been a lot of benchmarks in terms of number of American forces killed, number of Iraqi casualties, benchmarks haven't been necessarily a good thing for this president or this White House, and I think he's trying to set up one that he hopes will show some level of success.",
        "It's worth mentioning too, an important point, right when we're getting to election time for the president's party.",
        "Well, so, two questions then.",
        "Is this a realistic benchmark?",
        "Is the president taking a risk by setting a benchmark, since you pointed out he has not always been successful achieving them?",
        "He absolutely isn't, and whenever he sets a benchmark, it's a risk.",
        "When he declared victory on a very memorable day on the top of an aircraft carrier, we saw the danger in talking about success and benchmarks.",
        "But I think this is all the president can go on right now.",
        "He's very aware that this is a war that is appearing on television screens, that it's not going very well, and he realizes that at this point he needs to lay out some measures of success and try to reach them.",

        "We're harnessing every available resource to deal with this threat.",

        "Our plan has three elements, targeting, training, and technology.",
        "David, what do we know about this program?",
        "Another type would be just pumping up small stocks, especially small-cap stocks.",
        "They could just say hey, this small-cap stock is going to go up, time to buy it now, and they don't need a working Web site to pull that one off.",
        "Because they can just buy the stock and then - buy it low and then after it's pumped up, sell it, and they've made a profit.",
        "But does that actually work?",
        "I mean, when you get, you know, a blind e-mail saying Forschluggener(ph) Enterprises is going to go through the roof, doesn't anybody actually buy Forschluggener?",
        "I understand that you all eat dinner together at the end of every day.",
        "I want to know, what's that like?",
        "What do you talk about over dinner?",
        "Well, it has three components, according to the president.",
        "The first is to target and eliminate the terrorists and bomb makers who are making these so- called IEDs.",
        "The second, he said, is to give special training to U.S.",
        "forces in how to protect themselves against this.",
        "And the third is to find new tactics for defending against IEDs, and he laid that out today.",
        "He met with General Meigs at the White House over the weekend, and the president will often do this, if he's going to be talking about a certain subject to the American people, the White House will schedule a meeting with someone in the administration or in the military who knows a lot about this.",
        "They'll have a meeting.",
        "The president came out afterwards and said, I learned a lot, I can now pass it on to the American people.",
        "And here he is today talking about the program, so that's a three-pronged approach."

        "In this speech, did you hear a shift in the way the White House talks about the possibility of civil war in Iraq?",
        "You know, it was interesting, the White house tried to give this speech and this series of speeches a new packaging.",
        "They tried to say that the American people don't get a good picture of Iraq from the 45-second bites that they see and that the president is going to explain it.",
        "They said that he's going to drill down, find new issues, and really talk about them to the American people.",

        "Our director of National Intelligence, John Negroponti, told the Congress, Tehran has been responsible for at least some of the lethality of anti-coalition attacks by providing Shia-militia with the capability to build improvised explosive devices in Iraq.",
        "Coalition forces have seized IEDs and components that were clearly produced in Iran.",
        "Such actions, along with Iran's support for terrorism, and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, are increasingly isolating Iran.",
        "And America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats.",
        "Just briefly, David, why do you think the president brought Iran into this speech?",
        "Well, the president has tried to paint a picture of Iraq in a way that suggests that there are outsiders who are causing these problems, trying to suggest that there are outsiders trying to start a civil war.",
        "He doesn't want the picture to be that we've been unable to unify this country, the United States, so anything he can do to say there are outsiders who are causing the damage and we're going to go after them backs up his point that this is part of some global war on terrorism.",
        "Otherwise, it's a country that's in big trouble, and that's not the message he wants to send.",
