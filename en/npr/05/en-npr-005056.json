        "And so you could forge from lines.",
        "And so I could, in other words, pretend to be sending mail from npr.org, and it would probably go through.",
        "And so SPF and similar techniques are ways to try to make computers a bit more honest and repair some of the problems that arose out of the more freewheeling days of the 1980s.",
        "And so it involves putting information into your computer's domain name records, that it says this is - these are the only hosts that can send mail from npr.org.",

        "We need police, law enforcement, to take this more seriously, especially the spammers who are breaking into systems, running bot-nets, committing fraud, and we need better technology as well.",

        "Because all somebody really needs to do is just change the name and address of the return address, and then it's from somebody completely different from somewhere totally different altogether - and you can't block the entire world.",
        "I've been coming up with an idea that, maybe, if they could change the way software functions; change the protocol a little bit, so that maybe have it be like you have your e-mail address contact list on your remote server, where you retrieve your e-mail from; and like instant messaging, block everybody that you don't know.",

        "So if you have one e-mail address that you use for registering addresses and things like that and then have one that you only use for personal contacts - and tell your contacts not to give out your e-mail address - it really helps cut down spam a lot, on the one that you really want to look at.",

        "So if no one is buying what they're selling, why do they continue to use this as a method for advertising?",
        "Let me ask that to Declan McCullagh, and you sort of answered it before.",
        "You only need a few idiots to respond to make it profitable, right?",
        "Exactly.",
        "Just because of the massive volumes involved, you send out a million spam messages, and even if your response is one-tenth - one-one-hundredth of one percent, it's still going to be worthwhile."
