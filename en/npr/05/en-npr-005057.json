        "In other words, they have to stick a postage stamp on it.",
        "And if we can do the same thing in the spam world, say I'm only going to let e-mail come in if you put a five-cent postage note on it - maybe this can be done with digital money, maybe this can be done with PayPal - then that's at least one promising technique.",
        "Or something called Hashcash is a very preliminary look at this, and that's make the sender perform a math computation that's going to take him, say 10 seconds.",
        "That's not a problem for a legitimate sender, but it is a problem for spammers when they're sending out millions of messages.",
        "So there are some techniques on the horizon that might help in this ongoing fight against spam.",
        "But then I'd have to look at all those messages I get about my PayPal account, which I don't have.",
