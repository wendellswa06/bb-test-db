        "Right.",

        "Yes.",
        "We did this survey in 2001 for the first time and then repeated it in 2004.",
        "It is a slight increase, but it's a notable increase because it's very hard, you know, a three-year period to find changes like this.",
        "What do you mean?",
        "Well, often you don't really notice very many changes.",
        "In a three-year period, there haven't been very many changes in the health-care system.",
        "One of the changes that we have noted through other research is that increasing costs are borne now among workers and their families in terms of out-of-pocket costs and this is now playing out in terms of we're seeing increased numbers of women are also delaying care because of costs.",
        "Is that why you think you're seeing this increase, that companies can't pay as much for health insurance for their employees?",
        "Right.",
        "I think that it's a shift from the premium cost.",
        "Now people are paying more in terms of deductibles.",
        "People are paying more in terms of co-pays and cost sharing.",
        "Your cost sharing for prescription drugs has also risen as well.",
        "There's a lot of other evidence that shows that, and what this survey really shows is that it's having an impact on accessing health-care services.",
        "Now Medicaid covers health-care costs for many of the poorest Americans, but we're seeing now a number of states looking to cut their Medicaid rolls.",
        "What effect would you expect that to have on the number of women foregoing care?",
        "Well, three-quarters of the adult Medicaid population is women, so I think that if you see cutbacks in eligibility or increases in cost sharing or co-pays, you may see that the poorest women have trouble accessing care because the cost is definitely going to be a barrier for them.",
        "If they don't have coverage, they're definitely going to limit their care, and if they have co-pays with Medicaid, that could really pose a problem for them as well."

        "What else did you find in this survey of women?",
        "One of the things that we looked at is women's experiences with the health-care system once they get in, and what we found rather surprised us which is that very many of the preventive services and counseling services that we are now recognizing are important for women are not discussed during the medical visit.",
        "And is this something one would expect the doctor to bring up or should women be told to bring these things up and what kinds of issues are you talking about?",
