        "Those changes switched it from a highly contagious virus to one that wasn't.",
        "NPR's Richard Knox reports the experiment could have implications for what may be the most urgent question in science.",
        "What does it take for a flu virus to go pandemic?",
        "Some researchers say the best way to answer that question is to look at the worst pandemic virus ever - the one from 1918.",
        "It exists in a couple of high security labs.",
        "Scientists reconstructed it out of genetic fragments taken from people who died nearly 90 years ago.",

        "The virus was still lethal, but there was a big difference.",
        "In the cages next to those particular ferrets, the contact ferrets were fine.",
        "There was no signs of disease and no signs of spread.",
        "So that was quite striking.",
        "I didn't think it would be that simple.",
        "One reason the nearby ferrets didn't die is that the ferrets infected with the mutant virus didn't sneeze.",
        "The reason they didn't sneeze is apparently this.",
        "By changing just two molecules in the virus's code, scientists prevented it from infecting cells in the animal's nose and throat.",
        "This raises a disturbing question.",
        "Could such slight changes turn a relatively non-contagious virus into something dangerous?",
        "In particular, scientists wonder if today's H5N1 bird flu virus is just a couple of mutations away from becoming the next pandemic killer.",
        "And I think the answer to that is no. In my opinion, this is not possible, or not easily possible.",
        "That's Peter Palese of Mount Sinai Medical School.",
        "He's a co-author of the new paper.",
        "He notes that over the past three years, H5N1 has killed no more than 160 people.",
        "So if that virus could have gone pandemic easily, it would have by now.",
        "He says it might take many more than just two genetic changes.",
        "Still, Palese thinks there may be other viruses out there with the potential to go pandemic, such as the virus that caused a mild human pandemic in 1968 and then retreated to birds.",
        "But Tumpey thinks researchers should keep an eye out for the two key changes that made the 1918 virus so contagious.",
        "If they pop up in the Asian bird flu virus, he says, alarm bells should sound.",

        "Was the pope naïve when he gave this speech, or did he know he was going to get this reaction?",
        "Well, the Vatican position is that he was speaking as a scholar in the university where he used to teach theology, addressing fellow scholars.",
        "They say the speech was about how faith and reason must be joined in the contemporary world and that violence is not rational, and therefore is incompatible with the nature of God.",

        "Well, he has never hidden his dislike for the inter-religious meetings John Paul promoted, fearing the faithful would get the impression that Catholicism and Islam are on the same footing.",
        "Moreover, this is a Eurocentric pope, and one of his prime concerns is Europe's loss of faith and the memory of its Christian roots.",
        "Many analysts say that Benedict fears that in an increasingly secular and multi-cultural Europe, Catholicism will become just one option on the religious table.",
        "At the same time, he sees Muslim immigrants in Europe as more comfortable and self-assured in manifesting their religion, and therefore as a threat to Christian values.",
        "So what do you think the pope's vision is for relations between Christians and Muslims?",
        "He wants a political and cultural dialogue with Muslim leaders, not an interfaith relationship.",
        "And one of the first signs of his harder line was the removal from office of the Vatican's top official dealing with the Islamic world.",
        "And at the top of Benedict's agenda is reciprocity, which is the buzzword for religious freedom of Christians in majority Muslim countries.",
        "For example, Vatican officials will often point out that while millions of Saudi Arabian dollars financed Europe's biggest mosque here in Rome, not only are Christian churches banned there, Bibles can't be imported, and priests are under threat of arrest.",
        "And the Vatican has been concerned about anti-Christian actions in Turkey - where several priests have been killed - and about church burnings in Pakistan and Nigeria.",
        "And now it's not clear whether the pope's scheduled visit to Turkey in November is still on.",
        "But despite the specter of an Islam versus West confrontation, some European commentators suggest that something good might come of this entire affair.",
        "They hope moderate Muslims in Europe and in the broader Islamic world, who also feel threatened by Islamist violence, will find their voice and come out more forcefully against extremism and fundamentalism."
