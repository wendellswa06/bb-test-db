        "One is Peter Maass, who profiled the North Korean leader for the New York Times Magazine, and he's on the line.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "Is Kim Jong Il as isolated as his country seems to be?",
        "Actually not.",
        "He's certainly not as connected to the rest of the world as, you know, say the prime minister of France or the UK, but he is connected to the rest of the world.",
        "He does watch foreign television - all of the time, really.",
        "When people, foreign visitors, do visit him, they find him very much up to date on a range of world issues, though also other issues, including, you know, who won the most recent Academy Awards.",
        "He follows the Academy Awards?",
        "Yeah, well, when there was an American delegation led by Madeleine Albright that visited Pyongyang in 2000, he actually mentioned to one of the members of that delegation that he owned copies of all of the finalists for Academy Award for best movie.",

        "There are a lot of legends about Kim Jong Il, but most of them have been kind of shot down by now.",
        "The legends were that he was just this kind of pudgy playboy who just stayed up all night long drinking and slept all day long.",
        "The conclusions that people made from that kind of legend was that he's therefore, you know, no more capable to run North Korea than Hugh Hefner, and nobody ever expected that he would ever actually be able to stay in power.",
        "That's been totally overturned, because indeed, when he took power in 1994 - when his father died - everybody pretty much, in South Korea and in America as well, really didn't expect him to stay in power terribly long.",
        "He has.",
        "And what's emerged - because now there's much more information about him, from defectors, from people who've spent time with him - is a portrait, particularly when he was he was younger, of somebody who - even from a young age, as a teenager - was very smart, was interested in politics, was taking notes, was traveling with his father to Russia and really kind of learning about power, how to manipulate power, how to stay in power.",
        "Because it was never certain at all, never really kind of preordained, that Kim Jong Il would lead North Korea.",

        "Well, his father had several other children.",

        "His father had brothers.",
        "Kim Jong Il had a stepmother who he did not get along with at all, and who he was very much at odds with.",
        "He competed against them and he came out on top, and that's really not easy to do.",
        "It was often said of Saddam Hussein, that he was insanely brutal, but quite smart in his own way.",

        "It began with the line - when you visit our great city this coming Wednesday, I would appreciate the opportunity to meet.",
        "That letter came from the mayor of Louisville, Greg Fischer.",
        "Mayor Fischer has some ideas for the president about the kinds of gun safety bills that could make Americans safer and how the country's mayors can help with that.",

        "This is the people that are closest to their citizens - the mayors - saying this is what your citizens are demanding.",

        "This morning, I talked to a grandma that said - she said, I'm thinking about buying my granddaughter a bulletproof backpack that comes with a bulletproof vest.",
