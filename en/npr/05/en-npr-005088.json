        "One is that Bannon talks about that infamous Trump Tower meeting in June of 2016 that featured Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and the meeting that they had with the Russian lawyer, who was offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.",
        "Bannon describes the meeting as treasonous, as unpatriotic.",
        "And he says that those three should've called the FBI immediately.",
        "A second thing is that he also says that there's no way - there's no way that Trump Jr. didn't walk the Russians up one floor to the 26th floor of Trump Tower and introduce them to Trump himself.",
        "We should explain that's his - he doesn't know that happened, but he just finds it inconceivable it didn't.",
        "He doesn't offer any proof.",
        "He wasn't in the campaign at the time.",
        "But this would be important if true because Trump has denied any knowledge of the Russian overtures, any knowledge of Russian outreach.",

        "Inky, an octopus who's about the size of a basketball and of undetermined age, has lammed it out of his tank at the National Aquarium of New Zealand and is at large somewhere in Hawke's Bay on the east coast of New Zealand's North Island.",
        "Near as experts can figure from his splotchy tracks, Mr. Inky - somehow he deserves that honorific - squeezed through a slight gap at the top of his tank, flopped to the floor, then slithered about eight feet overland to slide down a drain pipe more than 160 feet long and finally to plop into the bay.",
        "He left behind his tank-mate, Blotchy, who so far has told authorities nothing.",
        "Blotchy is an octopus, but no stool pigeon.",
        "The escape apparently happened several months ago but was only certified in the past few days.",

        "They have a complex brain, says Alix Harvey of octopuses, excellent eyesight and research suggests they have an ability to learn and form mental maps.",
        "We should be careful not to project human traits onto octopuses.",
        "But it's hard not to note that Inky chose to bolt from surroundings in which he was safe, secure and handfed to the dangers of an open sea that teems with sharks, seals and whales that might eat him.",
        "Inky chose liberty over security.",
        "And when you hear that Inky and octopuses have the brains to plot Steve McQueen-ish escapes, build coconut shell edifices and form mental maps, for me at least, it gets a little harder to think of them being grilled and served for dinner.",
