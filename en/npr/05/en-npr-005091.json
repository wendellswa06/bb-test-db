        "Well, yes, and I was just about to say, and the fact that Romney had the money and the endorsements, he always has the money and endorsements; sometimes he wins big, sometimes he doesn't.",
        "But he certainly won big in Puerto Rico, and that gave him some momentum into yesterday's primary in Illinois.",
        "And the seven-to-one spending advantage in Illinois did not hurt, either.",
        "No, but he's had these spending opportunities, you know, advantages in Ohio, in Michigan, both of which were very, very close.",
        "So to say that he won because he spent, you know, a lot more money than Santorum, there's some truth to that, but that doesn't always pan out.",
        "It certainly panned out in Illinois.",
        "He got 47 percent of the vote.",
        "He beat Santorum by 12 percentage points.",
        "Even more importantly, he got far more delegates than Santorum on the way to 1,144.",
        "Well, OK, before Puerto Rico, we were looking at a couple of Santorum victories.",
        "Romney appeared on the ropes.",
        "We were talking about a brokered convention.",
        "All of a sudden - more on this later, but all of a sudden Romney seems to be on the road to recovery.",
        "He's trying to reclaim the I-word, inevitability.",
        "But we have Louisiana coming up.",
        "Right, exactly, how's bayou?",
        "No, but I mean look, Mitt Romney is the nominee, definitely, certainly - of course until Saturday, when Rick Santorum could very well win Louisiana.",
        "And then we have the doubts about Romney all over again.",
        "But big news today was that Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who was always mentioned as a dream candidate, should there be a brokered...",
        "Brokered convention - my favorite two words in the English language.",
        "Yeah, lots of luck with that.",
        "But Jeb Bush said look, enough is enough, you know.",
        "We've had 34 contests so far; the party should come together and unite behind Mitt Romney.",
        "In the meantime, House Republicans led by Paul Ryan, the Budget Committee chairman who - well, took a line in the sand, I guess, about a year ago when he outlined a budget plan that called for deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid - so-called mandates - and big tax cuts for the wealthy; and he then got the House Republican leadership to sign on again yesterday for another, more defined version that's going to clarify the battle, come November, as one over this Republican budget plan."

        "Yeah, I'm not convinced - I don't really know - I'm not convinced that this is a smart move, politically.",
        "Obviously, this has come - a month to go before the presidential election, when the House could theoretically shut down again - because what Paul Ryan did with these tax benefits for the wealthy, for the cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, welfare eligibility, things like that, is that it basically reneges on the debt-ceiling agreement that both sides made last summer.",
        "So this is really opening up the can of worms all over again.",
        "Republicans are girding for a fight.",
        "But the White House says look, you know, this is unfair.",
        "We'll welcome this fight.",
        "Either way, it will be a fight.",
        "It will be a fight, either way.",
        "It'll be fight on the floor in Congress coming up this fall, and then in November - well, all through the campaign.",
        "This is going to define the difference between the two parties.",
        "And it was Mitt Romney running to endorse the plan.",
        "Interestingly, so did Newt Gingrich.",
        "No word of right-wing social engineering this time around.",
        "Right, exactly.",
        "I think Newt Gingrich may have learned his lesson.",
        "But Newt Gingrich, I mean just one more thing about Newt Gingrich - here we go again.",
        "We keep counting him out at the - he has to win this or he's finished; we're back to Louisiana again.",
        "If he doesn't win in Louisiana, look, he just got $5.5 million more from Sheldon Adelman(ph).",
        "I think it's Adelman(ph).",
        "Adelman(ph), and I don't know where he's going to get any more money.",
        "He finished fourth place in Illinois, behind Ron Paul.",
        "And you know, Newt Gingrich kept saying, we can't have a nominee who keeps finishing in third - talking about Romney in Mississippi and Alabama.",
        "Well, you know, he finished fourth in Illinois.",
        "I don't see a brokered convention - which of course, is not going to happen - but I don't see a brokered convention...",
        "Oh boy, do we hope so.",
        "Anyway, we have some people on the line who think they know the answer to this week's trivia question - which is, again: Should Mitt Romney win, he will have been the nominee with only four years in elective office.",
        "Prior to Mitt Romney - should he be the nominee - who would be the last major-party candidate to have served in elective office, to have fewer years in office...",
        "Wow.",
        "...than Mitt Romney would have if he is - anyway, 800-989-8255.",
