        "Mike, but the argument was, of course, in 2008, John McCain wrapped up the nomination very, very early while the nation was captivated by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.",
        "And the Republicans got no boost, or no coverage, for so many months.",
        "And so the goal was, of course, to make it more interesting in 2012.",
        "But that doesn't mean we should always fight the last battle.",
        "What happened in 2008 - and John McCain got the nomination; I believe it was the first or second week of March, after Super Tuesday II, that he was able to claim the nomination.",
        "That's when Huckabee withdrew.",
        "He came over to the RNC; we had a great meeting that day.",
        "We made resources available to him during this interregnum period between having a presumptive nominee and a real nominee.",
        "So that's not that far off from where we are today.",
        "Is this process, though, at this point, do you think there is a possibility - by the AP's count, Mitt Romney has just about half the delegates he's going to need.",
        "He - is he going to wrap up this nomination before Tampa?",
        "I think it's likely that we will have a nominee.",
        "It's unlikely that we will have a brokered convention.",
        "And I believe, as I said previously, that momentum will play a role, and you'll start to see that happen as we get further into the process.",
        "And that speaks to the strength of an organization - fundraising, and having full slates on every congressional district.",
        "Those kinds of qualities are going to add up over time.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I was part of the 2000 Bush campaign from the very beginning, and I had five states I was the chairman of, and we knew what the rules were in those five states.",
        "We understood how to get delegates on the ballot.",
        "We understood how to get the nominee on the ballot.",
        "We knew who the county chairmen were in most of the states.",
        "You have to run a national campaign.",
        "And that's one of the reasons that having run once before gives someone an advantage - because they start with that body of knowledge, and their organization starts with that body of knowledge.",
        "Mike, you talk about how running a national campaign - and of course, Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum are running national campaigns.",
        "But when you think of the South, and you think of the South as the strongest region for the Republican Party, Mitt Romney doesn't seem to fare very well there.",
        "He has not done well thus far in the South, but I would also add to your list that Ron Paul is running a national campaign.",
        "But he is faring - Mitt Romney is faring well with the delegates in the South because with the new rules, with the proportionality now, he is picking up a substantial number of delegates in the Southern states.",
        "Email question, and this from Deb(ph) in Ohio: Does this prolonged primary process hamper Romney's vetting of vice presidential candidates, especially if he doesn't get enough delegates till the convention?",
        "I doubt she would even consider it, but it would boost Romney's candidacy if he would add Condoleezza Rice as VP to the ticket."

        "Well, I don't think it will because if the campaign is as good as I think it is, they will have a process in place that - a certain time, would kick in and start vetting.",
        "I was part of that process in 2000.",
        "I remember sending in a notebook with several hundred names of Republicans who had been elected officials, or were currently elected officials, to a guy named Cheney.",
        "Of course, you have removed yourself from this process.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "So I think any good campaign already has a process that's ready to go, and can do it in a very timely manner.",

        "I'm 26 and have kind of always just really not seen what, you know, I guess, the benefits of the primary are.",
        "But this being the first one I've actually paid attention to, it's been neat to see just, you know, what every one of the candidates is doing.",
        "And it's almost as if you're bringing out all the guns to see who you're going to bring to the big fight, you know.",
        "So you appreciate the drawn-out process; gives you a chance to take a look at everybody?",
        "Yeah.",
        "At the same time, too, though, it shows you just how intricate this whole system is.",
        "You know, I had no idea it was so, you know, complex - with all the different states going and then like, things like Super Tuesday and like, South Carolina.",
        "We were the third state to vote, and I didn't realize like, how big that was, you know."

        "Ordinarily, his campaign would've run out of money some months ago.",
        "Well, that's true, to some extent.",

        "They can't pay for the staff expenses.",

        "Mike, some people say that the battle in 1976 between Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford, going all the way into the convention, hurt the party and really didn't help it unite in time to beat Jimmy Carter.",
        "Do you see any problem with the mood of the party right now vis-a-vis the likelihood of Mitt Romney as the nominee?",
        "Well, I was a delegate in 1976 and served on the rules committee, and was very much a part of that whole process.",
        "And it was a very energizing process, all the way from the contest about, did you have to name your vice president before you were nominated - Reagan had said that he was going to have Schweiker, and there was a rules fight to make Ford say he was going to nominate someone; they thought that would tip the convention - all the way up to the final moment of the convention, when Reagan came down on Ford's invitation and made this great speech that you knew was setting him up for the next time.",
        "We did have a chance in winning in 1976, even with all the distractions that were going on.",
        "Gerald Ford made a couple of campaign mistakes.",
        "Obviously, the reference to Poland and where it was located, was one of those.",
        "In Dick Cheney's new book, he talks about the '76 campaign.",

        "It didn't.",
        "And a prolonged - there's a difference between a good vetting and a good process, where the primary plays out and you understand who your candidate is; and a prolonged knockdown, drag-out process.",
        "And I think that's the balance that we're trying to strike.",
        "I've been involved in this for a long time and know a little bit about the history of conventions versus primaries going back to 1832, when conventions came into play, and in 1856 for the Republicans.",
        "And the first primaries were in 1910.",

        "We didn't do the quotas, and we said look, states' rights; and states need to be able to develop their own system.",
        "And as parties mature, particularly as we were getting stronger in the South, we needed to have different rules for different parts of the country.",
        "So most of us believe that a national primary for the Republicans and the Democrats would not be the right thing to do; that you do get benefit from having something of a vetting process.",

        "In '76 and perhaps in 1980.",
        "I'd have to look and see where they were in 1980.",
        "But there is an advantage in letting all the states play out.",
        "But there's also an advantage in the calendar and making sure that you have enough time, from the time that you get your presumptive nominee until you get your nominee in the general election, to raise the substantial amount of money that you have to have - and Barack Obama has changed that by taking public financing the last time - and to have a chance to heal the party.",
        "Those are the two things.",
        "The calendar has been such a big part of this because - one of my principles in being for or against changes in party rules has to do with this timing.",
        "I don't want to see us having the formal primary process in the year before the presidential election.",
        "And that's what is just about to happen because New Hampshire, the secretary of state there has the ability to move that around.",
        "So I believe that we do have a process that's long enough.",
        "It started in - this year, early in the year.",
        "And even though we didn't have votes until - I mean, started last year, early in the year - even though we didn't have votes until early this year, I think that vetting was really good.",
        "Go back and look at - historically, there have been a lot of candidates over the years who've put their toes in the water - or formed committees; they've raised money.",
        "And then they've decided that they didn't have what it took to run the national campaign, and got out.",

        "The big one, of course, was - the Democrats control the redistricting in Illinois completely, one of the few states that Democrats do control all the, you know, the mechanics of it.",
        "And in the 16th Congressional District, they lumped two Republican incumbents together - Don Manzullo, who was first elected in 1992; Adam Kinzinger, a freshman - and they both knocked - both ran against each other.",
        "Kinzinger, with the backing of Eric Cantor and some of the leadership, defeated Manzullo.",
        "So he'll keep the seat Republican, but the Republicans do lose an incumbent."
