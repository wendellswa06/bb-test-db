        "I mean, clearly, people are clamoring for more transparency about this.",

        "Very little.",

        "But so far, they have not released anything, certainly no tapes.",
        "And they said that's so they don't compromise the investigation that's still underway.",
        "Meanwhile, though, police have arrested someone else in the shooting, Erron Brown, a 20-year-old.",
        "How's the community reacting there?",
        "Well, it's divided.",
        "Protesters have been conducting protests most nights since the shooting at the mall or other locations around the city of Hoover - blocked a highway at one point.",
        "Certainly, there are some that are in support of it, that say this is an issue of justice for the Bradford family.",
