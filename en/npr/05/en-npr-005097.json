        "His colleague, Yasmin El-Rifae, says the behavior of the police and the attackers are in part the result of Egyptian society's tendency to blame the victims in sex crimes.",
        "The attitude is: these women are asking for it by being in the square instead of staying at home.",
        "She says even more disgraceful is how key players in the current crisis are trying to get political leverage out of the attacks and pointing fingers at one another.",
        "You have the Muslim Brotherhood using evidence and footage of these attacks online and at their own rallies to basically point the finger at Tahrir, and say, see, the opposition are all a bunch of thugs.",
        "Then you have a lot of the opposition forces essentially denying these assaults.",
        "Activists say to date, no one has been prosecuted for - let alone convicted of - sexual attacks in Tahrir Square.",
        "Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson, NPR News, Cairo.",
        "There have been a lot of calls for new gun control in the wake of the massacre in Florida.",
        "But are these calls actually influencing lawmakers?",
        "House Speaker Paul Ryan is in no rush.",
        "After the mass shooting in Florida, Ryan said - not for the first time - that he opposed a knee-jerk reaction or taking rights away from citizens.",
        "President Trump did say this week through his press secretary that he's open to improving the background check system for gun purchases.",
        "And the president is scheduled to do some listening this week.",
        "All right, let's talk to NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley, who is with us.",
        "Hey, Scott.",
        "Good morning, David.",
        "OK, Steve said the president's going to do some listening.",
        "He is slated to hold what they're describing as listening sessions with both law enforcement and students.",
        "What exactly's going to happen?",
        "Right.",
        "It's students and teachers tomorrow, and then state and local officials on Thursday.",
        "When the president spoke last week about the school shooting, he said he wanted to make school safety a priority, and he added, no child or parent should have to be nervous about safety when they're in an American school.",
        "Of course, a lot of people are nervous, and some of the most eloquent calls for gun control have come from the survivors at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."

        "Right.",
        "In his statement last week, the president said nothing at all about gun control.",
        "But as you all mentioned, his spokeswoman did add yesterday that he is open, in particular, to a push by Texas Senator John Cornyn and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy to make sure that people who should be disqualified from buying a gun actually show up in the database that - of people who are barred from buying a gun.",
        "OK, so at least some Republicans talking about that - the president saying may be open - or his spokeswoman saying may be open to background check laws.",
        "But is this something that there could be enough support for in Congress?",
        "It has changed a lot.",

        "He became known as a skeptic of the Bush administration's approach to that war.",
        "He also questioned terrorism policy, and later, this Republican leader endorsed Barack Obama for president.",
        "You said in 2007 that you thought we as a country were taking too much counsel of our fears.",
        "How would you describe our approach to terrorism now?",
        "I think that the point I was making back in 2007 was that there is no question that terrorism is a continuing problem, but we were a lot safer in 2007 than we were before 9-11 in 2001.",
        "We've done a lot of excellent work with respect to the intelligence work we had ongoing, our law enforcement activity, and especially what we did in Afghanistan to put al-Qaida on the run.",
        "But at the same time, in making ourselves safer, there was a period of time when we started to act as if we were afraid of everything, and so it made it hard to get visas.",
        "We made it harder to come here to the United States, to go our schools, to go to our hospitals for care.",
        "And my point then - and it's still my point today - is that terrorists have been dealt a serious blow.",
        "They're still there.",
        "They might get through again.",
        "But the one thing the terrorists cannot do - not one of them, not 10 of them, not 10,000 of them -they can't change who we are.",
        "So we can't take such counsel of our fears that we change who we are, even though the terrorist aren't able to change who we are."

        "And so I think we're a lot better off, we're a little more comfortable, we're a little more at ease than we were in 2007 because we've done such a good job against al-Qaida.",
        "But we have to be on guard that we don't spend so much time worrying about terrorism and guarding ourselves that we start to lose the essence of who we are as an open, freedom-loving people, welcoming the rest of the world.",
        "Another thing you said in that 2007 interview is that you thought that Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, the prison there, should be closed.",
        "Well, I felt that way for years.",

        "Although there have been some high-profile cases that have nearly gone wrong, and I think of issues like the effort of a terrorism trial in New York, where you discover where the security questions, the political questions, have become quite problematic.",
        "But that has nothing to do with the judicial process.",

        "Maybe you should have done it in Gaithersburg, Maryland or in Buffalo, New York or outside of Fort Drum, New York.",

        "You endorsed Barack Obama for president quite famously in 2008, and one of the reasons you gave seems quite relevant to this discussion of how the country has changed since 9-11.",
