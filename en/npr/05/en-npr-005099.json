        "So you're saying that Europe's energy future is intrinsically linked for the foreseeable future to Russia's natural gas supplies?",
        "I would say that Europe's natural gas future - I wouldn't say its energy future - but its natural gas future is intrinsically linked to Russian energy supplies.",
        "It's linked through very long-term contracts of a type that you're not familiar with in the United States because you phased all that out about 20 or 30 years ago.",
        "But the way we do business in Europe is through 15 to 35 year contracts.",
        "A lot of Russian gas contracts last until the mid 2020s, some last until the mid 2030s.",
        "These are not contracts that can be broken without massive payments of damages.",
        "So it's not simply that we depend on Russian gas, but we are contractually linked to the Russians for a very long time.",
        "What about any natural gas supplies coming out of the Middle East?",
        "Is this an option for Europe at all?",
        "Well, indeed, it is an option, and we do import some Middle East gas.",
        "But we import it in the form of liquefied natural gas or LNG, and the problem here is that LNG is more of a global market.",
        "So if other countries are prepared to pay more than Europe, they get the LNG supplies.",
        "And this is what has happened, particularly post-2011 and the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan.",
        "That Asia has been short of LNG and been prepared to pay far higher prices than Europe.",
        "And most of our LNG has disappeared into Asia since 2011.",
        "So again, just to reiterate, that means that Europe's position with Russia, when there is a crisis like this of a political nature that we see in Ukraine - energy, gas supplies is always at the forefront?",
        "I would put it a different way.",
        "This is a political crisis.",
        "It is very desirable that we do not turn this into an energy crisis.",
        "Now the Russians are essentially saying pay us what you owe us, and they're also saying parenthetically to Europe, you have taken on Ukraine as your political ally.",
        "So it is now your responsibility to make sure this country pays its debts.",
        "We cannot continue to supply this country with gas without some kind of assurance we're going to get paid.",
        "We already have a huge unpaid bill.",
        "We're not going to allow that bill to grow.",

        "And I would say that within my crowd in high school, you know, we didn't do a whole lot of drinking.",
        "I mean, it was more like a social event than anything else.",
        "But I would say that the majority of, like, the binge drinking that I would do now is, like, in my college years.",
        "I think it would be surprising to see big changes at the federal level.",
        "As you mentioned, Paul Ryan suggested last week that he doesn't want to do anything too quickly.",
        "Remember, the very first - one of the very first actions this Congress and this president took when they came into office last year was to roll back an Obama-era rule that was aimed at making it harder for people who'd been judged to have mental disabilities to buy guns.",
        "So that was unwound by this president.",

        "We are seeing action, though, at some state-level capitals like Tallahassee.",
        "A number of states have adopted moves to make it easier for families or, in some cases, law enforcement to petition to at least temporarily keep guns out of the hands of troubled people.",
        "So that may be a more fruitful avenue for gun control advocates.",
        "One thing to remember, of course, is that you don't just want to ask what people across the country feel about gun control.",
        "Lots of surveys say vast majorities of people would like some gun measures.",
        "The question that needs to be asked is, are there sufficient numbers of Republicans in very conservative districts in the House of Representatives who feel that their constituents want them to do something on gun control despite their concerns about the Second Amendment?",
        "And a lot of different...",
        "Yeah, this is one of those asymmetrical issues where people on one side are a lot more passionate than the other.",

        "Hi, David.",

        "Well, I think the message that they're carrying is that, this time, it has to be different.",

        "They say too many children have died and are dying in schools and on college campuses.",
        "You know, this is the third mass shooting I've covered, and the energy here really is unlike anything I've ever seen.",
        "And a lot of their argument is just a basic moral demand that adults have to protect children.",

        "Students here want age restrictions, better background checks, and a lot of them do want rifles like the AR-15 banned.",
        "Brian, it has been so amazing that these students have decided to wade into this, you know, sensitive debate, going to Tallahassee, talking about a rally in Washington.",
        "They decided to do this at a moment when things are still so raw.",
        "There's still funerals happening, right?",
        "Yeah, yeah.",

        "People here are heartbroken.",
        "There were two more funerals yesterday, David, for Alaina Petty, age 14, and Luke Hoyer, who was 15 years old.",
        "And I have to say, Parkland is a community that really viewed itself in a certain way, as a really successful American community, diverse, and safe and welcoming, with great values.",
        "And this school has been the centerpiece of that in a lot of ways, and so now that sense of safety and wholeness has been shredded - a lot of sorrow, people who tell me they don't feel safe.",
        "So whatever happens in Tallahassee and Washington, that's going to take a long time to heal.",
        "Scott Horsley earlier said this is one of those asymmetric issues where the people who oppose gun control tend to feel much more passionately than the people who support it.",
        "But this is a moment where gun control activists may hope that the situation is flipped.",
        "Because of those raw feelings, people may feel more strongly than normal about gun control.",
        "That would be their hope, anyway."
