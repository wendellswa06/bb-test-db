        "Thank you and good day here.",
        "First of all, before we dig into the - kind of the history, I wanted to ask why you wanted to write this piece.",
        "Is there something that you observed going on now that made you feel it was important to highlight this bill?",
        "The secretary of HUD said that we ought to wait maybe seven years before we enforce the act.",
        "And of course, you take an oath to uphold the law.",
        "You don't reserve the right to not do it in that way.",
        "You know, this has been going on for a long, long time with discrimination against minorities.",
        "And we're trying to change that.",
        "That's what this law was designed to do.",
        "That's what this law requires state and local governments and private realtors and so on to do.",
        "And I think that when the new secretary of HUD said what he said about let's wait another seven years, that really ticked me off.",
        "Well, to your end, you point out that the Trump administration has sought to delay enforcement of the HUD integration rules by at least seven years.",
        "The secretary of HUD, Dr. Ben Carson, has referred to these rules as mandated social engineering.",
        "You know, but what about that point?",
        "I mean, their argument is that people should be able to live where they want to live.",
        "And after a certain point, if you remove barriers through discrimination, then beyond that, you're forcing people into something that they may not want to do, and that that's not their view of the way America should be.",
        "The view of how America speaks is reflected in our laws.",
        "And one of the laws is fair housing.",
        "It very clearly prohibits discrimination in the sale and rental of housing in America.",
        "It's been a sad fact of American life that the practice in many communities has been quite the opposite.",
        "That's why we passed the bill - to make a change.",
        "There's a lot of bad consequences that flow from segregation.",

        "Vice President, thank you so much for speaking to us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "That's right.",
        "The market's started out pretty strong.",
        "It's been a little up and down, but thanks to that news from JPMorgan Chase and some surprising housing news, the number of new home construction projects jumped by more than nine percent last month.",
        "That's the biggest jump in more than two years, but as usual, you've got to read the fine print.",
        "The gains were mostly because of a change in the building code here in New York City that spurred a wave of new apartment construction.",
        "Overall, construction was down.",
        "Also today there was news that fewer people applied for jobless benefits last week than economists had expected.",
        "And some other news is weighing on the markets.",
        "Coco Cola said today, the weak economy hurt its results.",
        "Continental Airlines lost money last quarter again because of the weak economy and high fuel costs.",
        "So there's a lot of mixed news today."
