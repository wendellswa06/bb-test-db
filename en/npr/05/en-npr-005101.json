        "That's the sound of a light saber.",
        "Ben Burtt invented that sound for \"\"Star Wars,\"\" and he's something of a legend in the sound world.",
        "So when it came to the Lincoln film, Ben Burtt wasn't going to settle for just recreating old sounds.",
        "He actually wanted to record those real sounds - sounds Lincoln heard.",
        "So Burtt and his team set out - recording equipment in hand - to capture the sounds of Lincoln's life.",

        "It's kind of next to his heart.",
        "It's something that would have been with him at all times.",
        "And so I began to investigate the possibility would anybody actually wind up one of these watches and see if it still would tick.",
        "And nobody had ever done that, as far as I could tell, when I began talking to museum people across the country.",
        "Eventually, I discovered a watch which is in the possession of the Kentucky Historical Society.",
        "This was a watch passed down from Lincoln's son Robert Lincoln.",
        "And so they brought in a watch smith, and they wound it up.",
        "It takes a key to wind a watch from that era.",
        "And lo and behold, there was the ticking of the sound of Lincoln's actual watch.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF TICKING)",
        "Just across the street from the White House is the famous St. John's Episcopal Church.",
        "It's known as the church of the presidents.",
        "And it was there during a time when Lincoln was president.",
        "I mean, you wanted to capture the sounds you would hear from that church, which is this:",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF BELL RINGING)",
        "So you went in and recorded the bells at St. John's.",
        "Yes.",
        "I felt that another sound from Lincoln's era that he would have heard would be any church bells or bells ringing in the neighborhood of the executive mansion in that time period.",
        "And our investigation showed that there were at least two bells still in existence in Washington, which were in churches that you easily could have heard from the White House."

        "How did you get the sound?",

        "I'm assuming you didn't do it that way.",
        "Unfortunately, because Washington now is a very busy town full of traffic, it didn't make sense recording the bell from down the street level.",
        "The best way was to get up in the belfry itself, crawl around and get really close next to the bell so you could isolate the sound as best as possible from the modern-day sounds of the city.",
        "And then we used it as an off-screen effect in the ambience of the movie.",

        "The carriage that Lincoln rode to and from Ford's Theater is actually in the Studebaker Museum in South Bend, Indiana.",

        "Ben, I mean, you could have recreated these sounds in studios and nobody watching the movie would have known the difference.",
        "Why did you go to such great lengths to get the actual sounds of the actual things that Lincoln interacted with?",
        "I love American history, and I've always been a student of it.",
        "And in particular, I've been very interested in Lincoln.",
        "And so when this opportunity came up, I felt, well, here's a chance to get in touch with actual history.",
        "I always do research when you're collecting sounds and making sounds for a film.",
        "And authenticity is normally not necessarily the prime directive in doing sound design.",
        "You're always searching out sounds that have the right emotional impact, and they may not even be authentic at all.",
        "But for this film, I didn't want to make guesses.",
        "I wanted to essentially capture the spirit of what might have been.",
        "And it was inspiring to do so because when you go and record some of these things, you feel very close to the subject."
