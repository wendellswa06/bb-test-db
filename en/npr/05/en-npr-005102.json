        "Atomwaffen, or Atomwaffen, means nuclear weapons in German, and the Atomwaffen Division is an American group that started in Tampa, Fla., in about 2015 that openly idolizes Adolf Hitler, the Third Reich and all the sort of Nazi leaders of the 20th century.",
        "Their goal is the violent overthrow of the U.S.",

        "Basically, what they say is we're working very hard on this.",
        "We are aggressively policing our particular directives and regulations within the services that say you cannot be a member of a white supremacist group and serve in the armed forces.",
        "They say that there have been 27 reports of domestic extremist activity within the ranks over the last five years.",
        "What other people tell us who are experts in this field and really watching it closely is they think the numbers are likely a lot higher than that.",
        "And we should say even though you didn't get that interview, a Pentagon official did ultimately release a statement to you, which is where you got that information.",
        "Right.",

        "Does binge drinking cause brain damage?",
        "Well, this is some early evidence pointing in that direction.",
        "Previously we've done some studies comparing groups of kids who binge drink as compared to kids who don't binge drink, and we've seen some differences.",
        "The study was really helpful because we actually characterized the kids before any of them had started drinking.",
        "And then we followed them overtime, some of them started to binge drink, others did not.",
        "And we found that those who had started to binge drink began to go downhill relative to the kids who remained nondrinkers.",
        "So you had a baseline of them earlier in their teenage years and following through the point where they started drinking or not.",
        "Exactly right.",
        "And how did you do this?",
        "Well, we recruited kids from just regular schools here in the San Diego metropolitan area, and we did some brain imaging and tests of thinking and memory with kids when they were, kind of, 12 to 14 years of age.",
        "And because we had great participation from our local schools and the families who were involved, we were able to continue to follow these kids, really, every three months to at least ask them brief questions about what their substance use had been like for the past - since we had previously talked to them.",
        "And I assume that was all private.",
        "You didnt tell the parents what they said.",

        "And it was interesting to me that you were using brain scans of various types?",
        "That's right.",
        "So in addition to looking at how these kids perform on different kinds of tests of thinking and memory abilities, we do several kinds of brain imaging techniques with them too, using MRI, which is very safe, but this helped us to look at a couple of things; the size and shape of different brain parts, the way that your brain uses oxygen as it's performing different tasks, and also the quality of white matter - which is a key part of our brain for the rapid relay of information.",
        "And as I gather the effect that you noticed was different in boys and girls?",
        "That's right.",
        "We were kind of surprised to see the effects play out a little bit differently for girls as compared to boys.",
        "In what ways?",
        "Well, for girls, we saw that relative to girls who remained pretty much nondrinkers, those girls who started to drink a little bit more heavily in their teenage years, went downhill on tasks of what we would call spatial functioning - so your ability to kind of like copy a complicated drawing, to solve a puzzle.",
        "So that is an area that sometimes is not always a relative strength for girls",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "and a kind of was particularly vulnerable to this kind of effect from binge drinking.",
        "And with boys?",
        "For boys, we tended to see that those guys who had started to get involved with some heavy drinking episodes in adolescents began to perform worse on attentional tasks.",
        "So it's kind of boring tasks where you have to really focus and kind of work quickly and something that's not all that exciting, which sometimes happens in real life."
