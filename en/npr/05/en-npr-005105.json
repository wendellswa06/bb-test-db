        "I mean, do you think the federal government is doing enough to combat these kinds of groups and this kind of ideology?",
        "Susan Tapert joined us from the studios of member station KPBS in San Diego.",
        "Again, she's a neuroscientist of the University of San Diego of -University of California, San Diego whose study was published in the January 2010 issue of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors - additive, addictive behaviors, I think.",
        "Anyway, tomorrow, what's next for No Child Left Behind, plus Barry Strauss' historical thriller, \"\"The Spartacus War.\"\" Join us then.",

        "I'm Neal Conan, in Washington.",
        "Today we introduce a new feature to the show.",
        "From time to time, NPR's Farai Chideya will speak with our correspondent Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who is based in Johannesburg, South Africa.",
        "Charlayne will update us on events and issues from the continent.",
        "So needless to say, we're excited about this new addition.",

        "Thanks, Ed.",
        "Today we're going to explore a criminal case in South Africa that could have a serious impact on the current government.",

        "Charlayne, good to have you with us.",
        "Thank you, Farai.",
        "So let's talk about Jacob Zuma in South Africa.",
        "The ANC's popular deputy president is fighting a rape allegation.",
        "Zuma's supporters say the charges are political; women's organization says it points to a culture of violence against women and a culture of impunity.",
        "Why is this so significant?",
        "This case is important, Farai, because I think it's probably the biggest challenge to this government since the end of apartheid in 1994.",
        "Back in May, the president had to fire the deputy president.",
        "So now the deputy president is no longer the deputy president of the country; he's still deputy president of the ruling party.",
        "The newspaper that leaked the story has not revealed its sources, and the deputy president and the woman in question have both said that the allegations are false.",
        "But it has created more tension within the country, within the ruling party, and even those who've been supporting the former deputy president are starting to waver, and this at a time when South Africa is establishing itself in the international community as being for good governance, being a sound political system after 11 years now.",
        "So it is not a good time to have this kind of thing surface in the country.",
        "I want to go to a country neighboring South Africa, Zimbabwe.",
        "There has been a change of heart by the country's elderly leader, Robert Mugabe.",
        "He started out by evicting some white farmers.",
        "Now he has turned to something called Operation Drive Out the Trash, ousting more than 700,000 people, almost all of them black Africans, black Zimbabweans.",
        "What has Mugabe done in terms of changing his opinion of his own actions?",
        "And what political decision-making power does he have left with an overwhelming threat of economic sanctions by the US, the UK, international lending agencies and the like?",
        "Well, make no mistake, Robert Mugabe is one of the shrewdest politicians on this continent.",
        "He has survived opprobrium on the part of the West and also has presided over the virtual disintegration of his country, which used to be the breadbasket of Africa, and now it is Africa's basket case.",
        "People are going hungry there.",
        "They have no jobs.",
        "They're flooding into South Africa, trying to find work just so that they can sustain their families.",
        "Well, as you just said, this operation that he unleashed, Operation Restore Order back in May, destroyed the homes of some 700,000 Zimbabweans, mostly poor people, living in shacks in the slums.",
        "That effectively affected more than 2.4 million people.",
        "And initially, the United Nations, which went in and confirmed the charges of human rights organizations that there were gross violations of human rights during the flattening of thousands of shacks and small businesses and markets--the United Nations came in and confirmed that there were gross violations of human rights and offered to rebuild some of those shacks, or at least build shelters for so many of those people who were made homeless by the slum demolition campaign.",
        "Initially, Robert Mugabe said no, but for some reason--and it could be pressure from the international community which, of course, he would never acknowledge--but he has now agreed to allow the United Nations to build 20,000 temporary shelters.",
        "So those shelters are going to begin building those within a very short period of time.",
        "And this is a big victory for the people who were critical of the government's actions, and also a victory for the United Nations.",
        "Finally, let me ask you a more theoretical question, and just in brief, some political scientists argue that it's easier to replace a colonial system, which is in many ways dictatorial, with a dictatorship, even if it's considered a liberated state, so you can go from a colonial system to a dictator more easily than from a colonial system to a democracy.",
        "Is that, in part, what's affecting some of the upheavals on the continent right now?",
        "I really find that a very theoretical question, because this comes at a time when increasing numbers of African countries are, in fact, moving to multiparty systems.",
        "This is the--what I call the second wind on the continent; the first, as former British Prime Minister Harold MacMillan said, just before the end of colonialism, that there was a new wind of change blowing across the continent and it was heralding the end of colonialism and the institution of independent states.",
        "And, as you know, over the years, those states, newly independent, have had serious problems of governance.",
        "I mean, many of them went the socialist route and, of course, that didn't work, Tanzania and Julius Nyerere being primary among them.",
        "But now you have this second wind where the African Union, led by people like Thabo Mbeki and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Bouteflika of Algeria and Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal--all of these leaders have signed on to multiparty democracy.",
        "They have put in new rules of the road for African leaders and the West, in fact, in partnership.",
        "Africans will get their economic and political houses in order, respecting human rights, respecting individual choice and civil liberties, in exchange for economic support from the West."

        "So I think that to posit that it's easier for countries to go from colonial systems to dictatorships is just to ignore this second wind of change that is fragile on the continent, but is nevertheless appearing, at this point, to be inexorable.",

        "He never stopped.",
        "At Southern University in Baton Rouge, he founded a jazz studies program.",
        "It was the first of its kind - one of the first of its kind.",
        "Over the years, he's taught the likes of Branford Marsalis, \"\"American Idol\"\" judge Randy Jackson, Herlin Riley, and Charlie Singleton.",
        "Batiste died Sunday morning, hours before he was to perform with Marsalis at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.",
        "Rather than cancel the show, Marsalis played on.",
        "He dedicated the performance to his mentor, Alvin Batiste - musician, teacher, and consummate jazzman.",
