        "Part of the problem is that the water flows in deep gorges too steep to access.",
        "And two 20th century agreements have also kept the Nile at bay.",

        "The underground facility is like a scene out of Fritz Lang's \"\"Metropolis\"\" - a giant concrete labyrinth of turbines and transformers designed to create more than 400 megawatts of energy.",
        "There's enough power here to power many of Ethiopia's neighbors.",
        "The facility also has the potential to irrigate the farms of this region out of the Stone Age.",

        "But I think the effect, going back to what the original question was of the admission, is actually more of a PR effect, in that it helps to gain back the public trust in an administration, specifically in the government in general.",
        "I believe he's being honest when he says he doesn't know the solution, and I think the general public would appreciate that more than hearing people kind of blow hard on the solutions and know that they are not as sure about what they are saying as they pretend to be."

        "And it's supposedly officially going to be released today.",
        "And some of the issues involved the strategy for dealing with Iraq.",
        "And given the fact that he was a member of this group, the fact that he says there are no new ideas that are going to come out in this report, there are no new ideas for addressing the Iraqi situation, gives you pause.",
        "But maybe he's just trying to find a way perhaps to keep open the possibility of some ideas coming from other sources.",
        "Farai, can I stick in also that Jeff's point is very well taken.",
        "But we have to look at the entire issue, which is that, yes, if somebody is being very certain about what's going on Iraq - and I presume, I just take the liberty to presume that what we mean is somebody who says that we can win -then yes, we have to think about the fact that they cannot be sure that they can't know.",
        "But then on the other hand, if you really look at the entire literature about whether we can or can't win in Iraq, and how and how it relates to history, then we also have to understand that those who say that it absolutely cannot be won generally have no more general, godly or empirical authority to say so than those who keep on just waving their arms and telling us that we have to stay the course.",
        "It's very, very complex.",
        "John, what did you think about the comments of Sgt.",
        "Neal Saunders where he basically said soldiers fight, that's what we do; and to expect soldiers in a possible scenario to become peacekeepers or aides or something to the rebirth of a new Iraq is perhaps not very - it's not logical.",
        "That's a where you draw the line.",
        "Because as far as I'm concerned that comment, it lacked a certain imagination.",
        "Yes, in history, soldiers have fought and the kind of dialogues we have now would not have made any sense to somebody in, say, Sparta, Greece.",
        "Yes, humanity advances.",
        "And my personal opinion, based on what I cannot consider godly authority, but is that, yes, there is something called peacekeeping that we need to get better at because there are indications from the past 20 years that it works and it does good in the world.",
        "And so, yes, soldiers fight, sounds good, there's a historical precedent.",
        "But for me I think we could look further than that.",
        "But notice that I say I think, and so it's about dialogue and looking at the issue from a lot of angles.",
        "But you have to train these soldiers and sailors and Marines, the troops, you have to train them in peacekeeping techniques.",

        "Right.",

        "Or does it mean that you're for bringing a halt to the needless death of those same soldiers.",
        "So I think that issue will continue to go back and forth, and what does support mean?",
        "But when it comes to down to it, a soldier's job is to fight.",

        "I think that we should share the burden of all of this more often for that and various reasons.",
