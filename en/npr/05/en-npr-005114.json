        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Thank you.",
        "And I can't imagine when you call people on the phone - you say you're from the Maryland Tax Department - they're exactly welcoming.",
        "No, actually, everyone's first response, when you say income tax to anyone, is they're scared.",
        "I can understand that.",
        "But after talking to them, by the end of the conversation, I think that we all know that we have to pay our taxes, even myself as a taxpayer.",
        "And it's necessary, especially for local and county governments, to be able to fix our roads, help with the schooling, many things.",
        "I'm sure you, like the rest of us, take a look at your paycheck and say: FICA, I mean, come on.",
        "Exactly, and not only that, of course we have furlough days.",
        "That's not easy on anyone's pocket, but it's more important for me to have a furlough day than for someone to lose a job."

        "It's good to be with you again, Neal.",
        "And you know, when you hear the rhetoric about, you know, big government, those elected politicians, well, the rhetoric is about those we remember back to Oklahoma City 15 years ago, even that man who crashed into that building in Austin last week, and the people who take the brunt of this are just ordinary people who work in government offices.",
        "Yes, Neal, and that's especially unfair because all of the evidence suggests that when people say they have distrust in government, whether national government or local government, they're mainly not talking about reflecting on their own personal experiences with, you know, government bureaucracy.",
        "Trust in government is all the evidence says is not very much driven by that.",
        "It's more driven by your general assessment of how big things in the society are going, if they're going well or going poorly, and whether in general you think the government is honest and trustworthy.",
        "The very high levels of trust in government, the highest that we know in terms of when we've been keeping records of these things, were driven after World War II by the success of the U.S.",
        "government in, you know, the New Deal, getting out of the recession, getting out of the Great Depression and winning the war, and 75 percent of Americans said they trusted the government.",
        "It didn't mean that they were necessarily happy or unhappy when they, you know, filled out their IRS form.",
        "It meant that they basically trusted the government to do what was right most of the time.",
        "That high level of trust collapsed, first of all, in the face of Watergate and Vietnam - a huge collapse around the time of intervention in Vietnam, and then another big drop when Watergate was revealed.",
        "Again, that didn't have anything to do with individual, you know, government officials or government workers in post offices or revenue services or whatever.",
        "It had to do with whether it was based on the fact that it had been revealed you couldn't trust the government."

        "And then again, as is well-known, the Pew work shows this and other work has shown it, too, when the economy is in great shape, as in the '80s or during much of the '90s, trust in the government goes up because basically, again, it's not having to do with anything that's happening at the local, you know, post office or IRS.",
        "It's basically people who are thinking, well, things are going pretty well.",
        "And we are now at a level, in terms of the economy, as everybody knows, it's the worst since the Great Depression.",
        "And since we're still in the midst of it, and we haven't yet gotten out of it, I think it's not at all surprising that people are expressing very low levels of trust in government - again, not to do with I mean, the patterns at the local level tend to be somewhat disconnected from this.",
        "In general, people are more trusting of state and local government than they are of the national government but...",
        "Yeah, I was just about to ask you about that, though that gap has been narrowing.",
        "Yeah, and it varies, actually, from place to place.",
        "Sometimes, some people actually trust the national government more than they do the local government.",
        "There are many examples of that, too.",
        "It depends on how good your local government is, basically.",
        "I mean, I think it's best to think of these trust-in-government measures, either the national level or the local level, as being basically an effort by reasonable people to say, you know, how do we think public officials are doing these days?",
        "And if you live in a place where the local government is pretty corrupt, not surprisingly, trust in local government is lower there.",
        "If you're, let's say blacks.",
        "Blacks, especially in the South before the civil rights movement, blacks had extremely low levels of trust in local government and extremely high levels of trust, extremely high levels of trust in the national government.",
        "That was not - kind of something that was just in their minds, and it didn't have anything to do with the particular actions about how they were treated at the post office.",
        "It had to do with the fact that local government was more racist, and the national government was less racist.",
        "And when you see these, this sort of vast movement we're going to get a lot of callers on the line; our lines are choked at the moment but when you see these - the movie, you know, throw the bums out, we need to get government much, much smaller, these people are just eating away at our prosperity and are stealing the legacies of our grandchildren, what does this say about our society, about our civil engagement?",
        "Well, look, Americans have always been a little skeptical about government.",
        "We historically have had a much smaller and still do today a much smaller government than most other countries at our stage and rate of development and so on.",
        "So it is true that Americans are a little more skeptical than most people in the world, about government.",
        "One call - that's all.",
        "It is also true that it's hard for any government to mount successful policies to deal with anything, to deal with the recession or to deal with, you know, health insurance or whatever, in the face of widespread public distrust."
