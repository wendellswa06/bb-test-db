        "The reason I called for - to today's show is because one of the reasons I left, after 15 years working for a Michigan county government, were some of the attitudes of the public that I met and, you know, acquaintances in the neighborhood, that sort of thing, towards the fact that I was a public employee, as well as some of the relatively unsavory things I had to do.",
        "I was mostly in solid waste and...",
        "Well, I can understand that, but what kinds of attitudes were you getting from people?",
        "Well, just as your visitors there were saying, that, you know, people have the attitude that the public employee is, oh, just hanging around, chewing up the state and county tax money and waste you know, being wasteful and not efficient and that sort of thing, which really bugged me at the time because the entity that I worked for was what they call an enterprise fund, which meant we operated like a business.",

        "But in the end a couple other points that I wanted to make is, people tend to think that government employees, like you mentioned, are paid well and have all these grand benefits and that sort of thing.",
