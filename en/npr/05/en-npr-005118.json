        "Thank you very much.",

        "In that way, the incremental cost for most roofing application is zero.",
        "Your air-conditioning load would be significantly lower.",
        "Your - if your building is air-conditioned - if the building is not air-conditioned, your building is going to be a lot more comfortable with white roof.",
        "And then having a lot of white roofs around the city would improve the outdoor ambient condition and also would improve the air quality in the urban heat islands.",
        "And finally, if you have - for each 100 square feet of roof area that you turn white from black, you offset one ton of CO2 emissions.",
        "So, for a typical house which has about 2,000 square feet of roof area, installing a white roof rather than a black roof, you would offset 20 tons of CO2 emissions.",
        "That's a huge amount.",
        "That's a huge amount particularly if it is being done on an international scale.",
        "We have done some analysis and we are finding out that if the entire world, particularly in the tropic and temperate regions of the world, adopt a white and cool-colored technologies for their roof, they would be able to offset about 24 gigaton of CO2 emissions.",
        "As a comparison, the current emission of the CO2 for all around the world is about 25 gigaton.",
        "So, that 24 ton gigaton is about one year of the entire world's CO2 emission.",
        "And the effect is significant.",
        "To look it in another way is that there are about 600 million cars in the world, and they all emit about four tons of CO2 on the average per year.",
        "A cool and a white roofing program that can be implemented within a natural cycle of the next 20 years, that when the roofs come in for a new roof, installing a new roof, you would install a white roof rather than a dark roof, that would be - a 20-year program of a cool roof would be offsetting half of the emissions from all these cars for the next 20 years.",

        "You know, not - how beautiful the blue against the white is.",

        "No, it's not at all difficult.",
        "It is an option, but it would incur some additional costs.",
        "And the - if you are thinking about getting the energy benefits to pay for the additional cost of having your roof painted by a professional, the - there is not that much of an energy savings to pay for that cost.",
        "But if you make that decision at the time that you're installing the roof…",
        "Right.",
        "…incremental cost is zero.",
        "So if you want to go and, you know, find a weekend and paint your roof and coat your roof with long-lasting white material, I'm not going to stop you, and I'm actually going to join you to do that.",
        "But in terms of the cost effectiveness and counting the bins…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…probably a better way is to do it at a time that the roof needs some major renovation.",
        "I get you.",
        "I - but of course, you could cover your roof in solar panels and that would shade the roof also from the sun.",
        "That is also an option.",
        "And one point that I always make is that people typically install a solar panel only on something 20 to 30 percent of the roof area.",
        "You can still enjoy both having a solar panel as well as a cool roof.",
        "Now, let's talk about all the blacktop road surface.",
        "You know, you -everybody notices how hot that gets immediately from the sun, just - even in the wintertime.",
        "What could we do for that?",
        "Is there a kind of blacktop that could be made a white top instead or at least closer to something that's more reflective?"
