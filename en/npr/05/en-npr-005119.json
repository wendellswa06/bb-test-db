        "Oh, there's a variety of options available for installing light-colored or cool paved surfaces.",
        "And these all depend on the type of surfaces that is out there.",
        "As an example, if one is installing blacktop for their parking lot, one can install in areas that water is not the problem a grasscrete, which is a mixture of grass and concrete base that make the paved surfaces cooler.",
        "That's one option.",

        "That is correct.",

        "Ah.",
        "So that is called as grasscrete.",
        "And in the mix of the asphalt, one can use lighter color aggregates rather than dark color aggregates.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And there are technologies that allows the - first, one puts the dark asphalt binder on the surface, on some limited number of low-traffic roads, and then spray light-color aggregates on top of those and then press this light-color aggregates into the binder.",
        "So that's yet another technology…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…which is known as cheap seal technology.",
        "And more importantly, a lot of people are installing concrete in some of the paved surfaces, such as driveways, sidewalk and some high-traffic area roads.",
        "And using concretes that are low in carbon content would make those paved surfaces a lot more deflective than a typical dark black asphalt.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "And I should also make the final point in here that we are not asking - we are not looking for road surfaces to be white.",

        "The difference in their solar reflectance of these two surfaces is about 0.15.",
        "That would mean that a concrete surface would be, perhaps, about 15 degrees Fahrenheit cooler than a blacktop surface under peak summer condition suns.",
        "Well, that's interesting because one of the, you know, things you see homeowners are doing, they're putting down a sealer on their - this big black sealer on their driveways.",

        "He said, first off, the defense budget makes up half of the entire discretionary budget for the federal government, so it's always a target.",
        "The second reason is that the budget's not just big, it's growing.",
        "The DOD budget grew, including war funding, by over 70 percent over the past decade.",
        "Even if you exclude war funding, it still grew by close to 40 percent.",
        "Why?",
        "So, I looked at this in my last budget analysis.",
        "And over the past decade, the number of people in the military in active duty actually remained about the same.",
        "Harrison says what happened is that personnel costs skyrocketed, mainly incentives to keep service members from quitting during wartime.",
        "Congress added pay raises for troops every year and the Pentagon keeps paying more for health care and pensions.",
        "So, as a result, the cost per person in the military increased by 46 percent in real terms over the past decade.",
        "Now, the Pentagon has already been asked to cut more than $450 billion from its budget, but if the supercommittee fails to make a deal, then automatic defense cuts kick in - up to another $600 billion.",

        "So, it's all about what baseline you're comparing to.",

        "For example, last year, the U.S.",

        "That amount over 10 years gives you a projected cost of $1.6 trillion.",

        "War funding is projected to drop to $118 billion in FY12 and it will continue dropping in FY13 and beyond.",

        "Acquisition programs are an attractive target when you're trying to find budget savings, particularly when you need to find the savings quickly.",

        "You know, no private companies are buying nuclear-powered submarines or stealthy fighter jets.",
        "And so, if DOD does not continue some level of steady funding for these industries, free-market forces will just eliminate them.",
