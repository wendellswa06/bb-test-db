        "And this is - there have been suggestions in the past that there was help coming to these Shiite groups from Iran, which is a Shiite nation.",

        "Now they went on to say in general that they could not say for certain that the government was linked, and it does seem like this is really a new step in the rhetoric from the Bush administration.",
        "And is the general citing any evidence - new evidence about the relationship between Iran and the Shiites in Iraq?",
        "No, he was asked - he was pressed on that point of what the new evidence was.",
        "And he said he thought it would be best not to describe that specifically.",
        "It's my understanding that what's going on is that he is taking a harder line in interpreting the available evidence that there is - that is, the evidence that as far as I know is largely circumstantial.",
        "But he used the word irrefutable, which certainly suggests he has more information.",
