        "Not necessarily.",
        "That'll be up to the board of One Fund Boston, whether they believe that whatever money is after June 15th should be allocated to these victims as second payment or whether it ought to be allocated in different amounts or to the community as a whole.",
        "That'll be up to them.",

        "Yes, actually, if you look at the history of the nation, it is a rather recent phenomenon.",
        "9/11 was of course a federal law, but these private donations that - after tragedy have sort of proliferated over the last few years.",
        "I think part of it is copycat.",
        "You see that it worked before.",
        "Part of it is the 24/7 news cycle, where everybody now gets very emotional, learns about these horrible tragedies, immediately writes a check, sends it in.",
        "It is a rather recent phenomenon, actually.",
        "And it's an interesting - because of that phenomenon, you have become the indispensable man.",
        "You have become the person everyone turns to in these situations, and there is a wonderful title for people who do what you do, it's called special master.",
        "That's a legal term that's developed over the years, special master, a special appointee with a special, designated assignment for a limited period of time.",
        "I must say I push back all the time when people say that I've carved out this special area of specialty.",

        "That was 16 months.",
        "We got out six and a half billion dollars to 220,000 people who in that case BP, like 9/11, had to surrender their right to litigate in order to get the money, but virtually all of them did.",

        "And then the final category, eligibility, the lowest category, but compensable, outpatient hospital treatment, emergency treatment at the hospitals.",
        "Those are the categories of eligibility.",
