        "How are you?",
        "Great.",
        "So, let's talk about these early voters.",
        "They are rushing to the polls.",
        "Some people have had to stand in line in Florida for two hours.",
        "So, Marc, what do you know about how officials are dealing with this?",
        "We just got off a conference call with the supervisors of all the counties and the secretary of state.",
        "They all report that things are going smoothly, except that, yes, democracy has a price.",
        "And early voting has a price, and that's waiting in long lines.",
        "One thing that we do know is that they're largely Democratic.",
        "In Florida, normally the absentee ballots that are cast skew Republican, the early votes skew Democrat.",
        "We're finding that now Republicans had jumped out to a lead, and as of yesterday when you factor in everything, Republicans were ahead by about 12,000 votes.",
        "As of this morning now, the number of Democratic ballots cast has outpaced Republicans by about a thousand.",
        "So, that's where we are right now.",
        "Well, you have very specific information.",
        "It sounds as if people are taking this extremely seriously.",
        "What about the evolution and - you know, I don't want you to belabor this point, but how much between the contested 2000 election, which, you know, kind of dragged on for over a month in terms of counting ballots and legal challenges, and now, have voting technologies changed?",
        "Or are people using systems that are pretty similar to the ones they used in 2000?",
        "Well, not at all.",
        "In fact, the legislature banned punch-card voting machines which were at the center of the butterfly ballot and also the caterpillar ballot.",
        "There was in Jacksonville a dispute in the 2000 elections.",
        "Then the large counties went to touch-screen voting machines and ATM-style, but those have actually got banned last year, except for blind people.",
        "And now we're using optical-scanned ballots, so we've had three presidential elections with basically three different types of technology.",
        "So, it's a little different now, but now there's a paper trail, a paper ballot, which can enable people to more closely track how votes were cast.",
        "I would break in here too, and say that one other thing that's troubled me about how our voting systems have evolved over the years, is that they seem to be dictated more by political issues, than actual effectiveness.",
        "One of the arguments against the current system we have, where you sort of fill in bubbles on a card, is that there's a- there's much more - there seems to be more of a possibility for voter error.",
        "But our current governor, one of his big, you know, pushes when he was running for election was that, you know, we should have a paper trail.",
        "And it sort of became this political issue, where people didn't necessarily look at what system would be most effective for Florida voters.",
        "I reported on our attempt.",
        "A bunch of news organizations in Florida went back, and looked at all the ballots from the 2000 election, and found essentially, that because there was a confusing ballot in Palm Beach County that led to a lot of people voting for a candidate they didn't intend to, that was what really screwed up the election.",
        "So, it's been troubling to see these voting systems constantly changed, but without a real focus on what the real problems might be."

        "All right.",
        "Well, we actually had some interesting conversations with a couple of news makers.",
        "We spoke with Eric Holder, senior advisor and senior legal counsel to the Obama campaign yesterday, about the team that his campaign is assembling.",
        "He said his camp is hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst.",
        "We're hoping that there will not be anything by way of voter suppression efforts, where people will be challenged unnecessarily, or impediments will be placed in front of people who want to exercise their rights to vote.",
        "We also talked to George Terwilliger, a legal advisor to the McCain campaign.",
        "And he is keeping an eye on the issue of false voter registration.",
        "If there is a false vote, then the vote of every legitimate voter is diluted, and the very heart of the franchise of democracy is threatened.",
        "Marc, going back to the whole question of, you know, all of this early voting.",
        "What sense do you get of the teams that are building up?",
        "I mean, where there - do we know if there were for example any observers - outside observers around these early voting?",
        "Correct, so in a roundabout way, could be fired by the president because the president would have to, you know, talk to the attorney general and express his view to do that.",
        "But again, the Justice Department and the White House are supposed to be, in theory, independent.",
        "So let's go back overseas now to hear more about what else President Trump is doing.",
        "As we mentioned earlier, he is in the Philippines attending the first of two Southeast Asian summits.",
