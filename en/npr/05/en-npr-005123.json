        "Eric, what about virtual belly-bumping and by that, I mean, in the media.",
        "What trends have you noticed among the campaigns and the kind of messaging that they're putting out?",
        "You have, of course, Senator Obama taking a little break right now to go visit his ailing grandmother, Senator McCain in Florida, but what kind of messaging are you hearing overall from the campaigns?",
        "What are you noticing as a media critic?",
        "Well, what's obvious is that they both have trained a barrage of television ads on the TV audiences in Florida.",
        "And McCain's ads, as you'd might expect, center on Obama's - his allegations that Obama lacks experience, and also tries to raise questions about his judgment, by referring to his association with people like former Weather Ground - Weather Underground leader, Bill Ayers, and things like that.",
        "Obama has ads that try to link John McCain to George Bush, and talk a lot about him voting with the president 90 percent of the time, and they even have a video clip of McCain himself affirming the statistic.",
        "So, these are - you know, these are all messages that would not be new to anybody who's been paying attention to the campaign.",
        "And it's interesting to see this new poll that was released that was a cooperative between my newspaper, and Marc's newspaper, and a few other news outlets, that indicates that independents seems to be swinging towards Obama, because of the views about the economy, it seems.",
        "I want to move on to one other issue, and that is very much along the lines of the economy.",
        "You've got the world's stock markets plunging again today.",
        "Yesterday, former Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, admitted he had too much faith in a free-market economy.",
        "Now, for years he was regarded as someone who could do no wrong.",
        "What did you think of his statements?",
        "And I'll start with you, Marc.",
        "Yesterday, and the overall idea of falling on his sword a bit over his strategy around shaping the economy.",
        "Well, if you ask me personally, it's nice to hear a political figure, albeit, you know, he was in an appointed role and he no longer is, actually saying he was wrong.",
        "One of the things we get too often is that mistakes were made.",
        "Things are in the passive voice, and people don't actually step up and say, oops, or I made a mistake.",
        "If Florida - this is the state that the economy is basically built on the construction industry, and the construction industry's bottomed out.",
        "We've lost more than 100,000 jobs in a year's worth of time.",
        "State budget's tax collections have decreased by about six billion dollars in a year's worth of time.",
        "One in every 174 homes are in foreclosure.",
        "It's a hard-hit state by the economic crisis, things are going slow.",
        "It's also a big state, it's not easy to get for - it's almost as far to get from Pensacola to Chicago, as if Pensacola to Key West.",
        "So we - you know, we have all of these different issues that we have to face, you know.",
        "No longer high gas prices bedeviling people, but people can't afford to buy new cars, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.",
        "People are losing their jobs.",
        "So, it's not a state where you can afford not to pay attention to the economy, or not to try to fix it.",
        "Getting back to Eric's point, that was probably one of the biggest criticisms from our pollsters when looking at the numbers over McCain as it is, that he wasn't paying enough attention to that.",
        "And now it appears he is.",
        "Well, Greenspan told the House Oversight and Reform Committee that, quote, \"\"We are in a once-in-a-century credit tsunami.\"\" And again, this was a question that even he now is acknowledging of whether or not his decision to keep interest rates low, helped create the housing bubble."

        "And just looking at all the condos with that kind of blue rap on the new windows, and thinking, well, what's going to happen to all those places that are finished, but unoccupied.",
        "But Eric, you get the last word in this.",
        "It's one thing to have people falling on their swords, it's another thing to rebuild the economy.",
        "What signs are you seeing of how things will be covered again from the media perspective.",
        "Have you seen changes in how the media is covering the economy, whether it's to be much more detailed, or to be more people focused.",
        "What are you seeing on that regard?",
        "No.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "What I've seen is - I've seen, you know, financial news outlets trying to capitalize on the incredible interest that we have in the economy.",
        "But what I've also seen is that pundits and commentators who were dead wrong about what was going on, are the people who have the most visibility now.",
        "And I'm thinking specifically of CNBC's Jim Cramer.",
        "He's made a lot of mistakes in judging what's going to happen with the stock market.",
        "And yet now, he's regularly featured on \"\"The Today Show.\"\" He's regularly featured in other NBC news outlets, because there's so much interest in financial news.",
        "But what I also say is, I'm not as hardened by Alan Greenspan's admission, because this whole congressional hearing seem to be about pointing the finger of blame at different people.",
        "You know, calling all these segments of the economy before Congress, and telling them, you messed up, you messed up.",
        "And of course, nobody's telling Congress that they messed up too.",
        "And part of - what we've come to understand I think, number one, is that the people who were supposed to understand how this economy was working, didn't really understand it.",
        "From Jim Cramer to Alan Greenspan.",
        "They couldn't understand the effect of not regulating some of these really complex sectors of the economy, such as credit-default swaps.",

        "The research appears in the journal Science Translational Medicine.",
        "So instead of the steroid sprays, the decongestants, the saline rinses, might a bacterial spray be a better option for keeping the sinuses congestion-free?",

        "We haven't talked much about what's going on in our noses.",
        "What is happening up there?",
        "That's true, and I think the field of human microbiome research has really, in the last four, five years, really exploded upon the scene and shown us that many niches in the human body are colonized by bacteria, be it our skin, our mucosal surfaces.",
        "These are the softer linings that line the nares, the sinuses, the gastrointestinal, the airways and the urogenital tract.",
        "And what we're beginning to see is that these linings of the human body are actually home to a diversity of microbes.",
        "And from much of the studies that have come from the gastrointestinal tract, which has been going on a little longer, we've seen certain hallmarks that are associated with health and disease.",
        "We know, for example, that when patients have chronic inflammatory disease, one of the characteristics is this loss of diversity.",
        "And sinusitis is quite a significant health care issue.",
        "And really, to date, much of the microbial studies that have been performed have largely been based on culturing and bacteria, so trying to grow them on agar plates.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But we know that that shows us maybe a very tiny fraction of the bacteria that are truly there.",
        "So instead, we wanted to use these culture-independent approaches that have been developed over the last few years to identify the conglomerate of organisms that are present and the true diversity of bacteria that are present and determine whether that's different in states of health and disease, specifically in the sinus niche, because it's an area that really has not had a lot of studies performed in it before this.",
        "And so you've found that people who had less sinus problems had bigger diversity in their...",
        "Yeah, that's true.",
        "Yep, exactly.",
        "So we applied these methods, which you can think of as kind of scanning for molecular bar codes for bacteria, and each barcode will tell you which bacterium it came from.",
        "So you can get a profile of what types of bacteria are present in a given sample.",
        "And you also get to find out how much of that type of bacteria is there.",
        "So we get kind of like a fingerprint of who's present from a bacterial standpoint in the samples.",
        "And we simply took surgical samples of the sinus lining from patients with chronic sinusitis and healthy individuals who didn't have sinus disease but were in for surgery for different indications.",
        "And we simply compared those samples and asked the question, what's different between patients with chronic sinusitis and healthy individuals?",
        "And we show that the sinusitis patients had this incredible collapse of the microbial community in their sinus cavity.",

        "And they hope they now can focus on other matters that are important to voters, like taxes and health care and jobs.",
        "Yeah, I mean - well, I mean, so Donald Trump is sounding confident saying there was no collusion; this is going to be all fine.",
