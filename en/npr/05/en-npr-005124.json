        "Does this mean that these investigations are going to get less partisan now?",
        "Well, I think for the moment, yes.",
        "I think this decision by Rod Rosenstein really stabilized the issue on Capitol Hill.",
        "Don't forget, Democrats now have gotten their No. 1 demand.",
        "They were saying they were going to block the confirmation of the new FBI director unless there was a special counsel.",
        "So this does clear the way for a new FBI director.",
        "And I think Rod Rosenstein, by appointing Mueller, did something miraculous.",

        "Who would have thought that could happen in 2017?",
        "Any lessons from previous investigations like this that we should - we should learn from?",
        "Well, I think that the White House needs to compartmentalize this.",
        "That's what you hear from people who went through these investigations in both the Bush and Clinton White Houses - in other words, set up a separate communications staff or person to answer questions about this.",
        "Try not to let it totally consume the White House staff - because this is a grinding process.",
        "And it can sap your energy and your focus.",
        "And this already is a White House that has been accused of being undisciplined and disorganized.",
        "Rod Rosenstein was someone who some people may have known of but not all of America.",
        "And now his name is right in the middle of all this.",
        "He's going to be on the Hill today, worth noting that.",
        "He's going to brief the Senate on the decision to fire James Comey.",
        "He'll do the same for the House on Friday.",
        "So that's something we should definitely track - and as well, looking at Rosenstein and his leadership of the department at this moment.",
        "Welcome to the spotlight, Rod Rosenstein.",
        "Yeah, right.",

        "Well, if Google has its way, ambient computing will be a profound change in how we relate to computers, OK?",
        "We'll talk to them instead of type into them.",
        "And they will be all around us all the time but in the background, OK?",
        "So they were in the mobile era, right?",
        "Basically, the whole world bought smartphones.",
        "And now the leaders at Google are saying, oh, actually, that's no good because the relationship is too distracting.",
        "So it's time we just make things that are smart and connected to each other and follow you and study you and tell you what you need before you even ask."

        "You point the camera to some herb or wildflower, and it'll tell you, oh, you know, those are forget-me-nots.",
