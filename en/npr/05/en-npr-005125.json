        "Reporter Ari Shapiro has this look at some of these cases that involve questions of race and gender discrimination.",
        "Supporters and opponents of Samuel Alito say his record on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals shows a judge who wants to raise the burden of proof on employment discrimination cases, essentially making it harder for people who say they were discriminated against to get in front of a jury.",
        "Jim Copland, who directs the Center for Legal Policy at the Manhattan Institute, supports Alito.",

        "I think any plaintiffs attorney will tell you that it is hardly easy to bring a successful case of discrimination under gender and race protections today.",
        "I think what Judge Alito would do would make a difficult standard even more difficult and thus render the underlying law largely ineffective.",
        "One of the judges on the 3rd Circuit said as much in the majority opinion for a case that came before the court in 1997.",
        "An African-American woman named Beryl Bray sued her employer, Marriott Hotels, after the company passed her over for a promotion.",
        "Alito would have upheld the lower court's decision in Marriott's favor, but the other two judges hearing the case disagreed.",
        "The majority said that Alito's position would virtually immunize employers from these kinds of suits and eviscerate anti-discrimination laws.",

        "You really just don't know who's going to show up on a random Tuesday in March, and the thinking is Trump can help with that.",
        "But as a side note, I should say, this race is really not so much about the future of this one district.",
