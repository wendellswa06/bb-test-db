        "And, in that context, we saw all the hallmarks of sinus infection, lots of mucin hypersecretion from the host.",
        "And when we did the same and added the lactobacillus species, we didn't see any hallmarks of pathogenesis or infection.",
        "And, in fact, when we did another group of mice where we took out their native microbiome, we instilled the protective species along with this pathogen that we've identified.",
        "Again, we saw no signs of infections suggesting that the lactobacillus species protected the surface of the sinus and evaded infection by the corynebacterium species.",

        "You know, there are a number of reporters who've contacted me that have said, what do you we do?",
        "I've got sinusitis.",
        "What do I do?",
        "It clearly is a prevalent problem in the general population.",
        "But clearly, we need controlled clinical trials to determine the efficacy of these kinds of interventions.",
        "And the FDA has ruled that if we are doing such trials, we need investigational drug status for every species that we want to instill into a patient to treat our disease.",
        "So it maybe a while before we can actually get to a point where we would be instilling these kinds of organisms into the sinuses.",
        "But it's certainly another way of thinking about treating chronic inflammatory disease, of the sinuses, at least.",
        "There's certainly prostins in the gastrointestinal tract.",
        "For example, when there's recalcitrant C.",

        "Fecal transplant works very well.",
        "So taking the feces of a spouse or a relative, and basically repopulating the gastrointestinal tract with those species, has a rate of 91 percent efficacy.",
        "So I think we could consider this for mucosal services as, perhaps, the general rule that this kind of restoration ecology approach to try to reinstate the healthy protective organisms in this niches, maybe an alternative strategy for treating some of these chronic inflammatory diseases.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Did we once all have them and they went away somehow?",
        "Or what - why did some of us have the healthy population and some of us don't?",
        "Well, that's all down to exposures.",
        "And, you know, one of the things that clearly can deplete a microbiome of diversity is antimicrobial use, which clearly is more prevalent in use and perhaps inappropriately.",
        "Antibiotics, you mean.",
        "Exactly.",
        "In the last several decades.",
        "That's clearly one obvious approach to deplete the diversity.",
        "The other thing is, we think that viral infections, which frequently perceive these kind of chronic outcomes in inflammatory disease, including in the sinuses, they may actually perturb the microbiome and induce, perhaps, inflammation from the host that actually kills some of these protective organisms.",
        "And one of the hypothesis were working off is that we know that pathogens can induce a host inflammatory response.",
        "And they do that to, we think, generate an ecosystem in which they're fitter.",
        "And perhaps some of these beneficial organisms, if the other side of the coin, they try to modulate that immune response because they're exquisitely - exquisitely sensitive to it and are, you know, they want to, again, generate a niche in which they are fittest in.",
        "So this is one of the hypothesis we're working off at the moment.",

        "And those children showed significant benefit in symptoms of rhinorrhea and things associated with kind of upper airway problems, upper airway infection.",

        "It's not - these niches are not isolators.",

        "And not only did they do it in the gastrointestinal tract, these anti- inflammatory cells would actually traffic to sites remote from the gastrointestinal tract, for example, the skin in a model atopic dermatitis and the joints in a model of arthritis.",
        "So clearly, the gastrointestinal tract is a prime target for, perhaps, altering immune responses at sites remote from the - that niche.",

        "Well, let me ask you a wild question that just struck me.",
        "If you overly - if you're a mouthwash user and it kills everything in your mouth or any bacteria, 99 percent of the germs, it says, are you doing yourself a disservice?",
        "I - we - nobody has looked at that.",
        "And it's - again, anything that perturbes these communities, you know, there's the potential for pathogenic organisms to outgrow in that kind of depleted diversity community.",
