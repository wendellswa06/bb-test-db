        "And they were such a wild, extraordinary bunch - ex-bank robbers, kids that had very unsettled backgrounds - that the RAF actually considered disbanding the Eagle Squadron.",
        "They were a bunch of renegades, as one RAF squadron leader said.",
        "But in fact that decision wasn't made and by November of 1941, only 10 months later, a month before Pearl Harbor, 71 Eagle Squadron was the highest-scoring squadron in the RAF.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I should say that perhaps the most effective propaganda campaign ever waged by the British took place during 1940, and it was aimed at convincing Americans that Britain was worth supporting.",
        "Here was a young, dashing American, a two-time gold-medal winner, nicknamed the King of Speed on a celebratory cigarette card.",
        "Here was this young man proving that America was not neutral, that in fact America's youngest and best, some of them, were already fighting and risking their lives for freedom in England.",
        "And the British government decided to use him.",
        "Even before he joined his squadron during the summer of 1940 he was asked by the actual air minister, no less, to go to America and whip up support for the British on a propaganda tour.",
        "And he actually turned around to the air minister, this young untested fighter pilot, and said no, I won't do that.",
        "When I've shot down some Germans, then I'll go back to America and gain the support that you need.",
        "He was seen as a very important propaganda tool, as in fact were the Eagles later on that year of 1940.",
        "And of course Billy Fiske did not - he did get his share, but he was killed himself before that moment came around.",
        "Just one of those original seven survived the war.",
        "Yes.",
        "Actually two of the seven were killed during the Battle of Britain: Billy Fiske and another guy called Hugh Reilley.",
        "Hugh Reilley - it was only discovered that Hugh Reilley was in fact an American when someone went through his belongings in his quarters after the news had been received that he'd been killed by one of the great German aces, Werner Moulders.",
