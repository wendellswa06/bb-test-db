        "I'm in the middle of writing a biography of Dorothea Lange and I saw the pictures probably for the first time in 2003 at the National Archives.",
        "But at that time I just - it never occurred to me that they had never been published.",
        "I assumed that somewhere I would find a book of them.",
        "And when it actually became clear that I really knew all of the sources about Dorothea Lange I realized that they really needed to get out.",
        "And why had they been suppressed for all this time?",
        "They weren't suppressed for all this time.",
        "They were only suppressed during the war.",
        "But when they were placed in the National Archives, no one brought them to any public attention.",
        "They were part of all of the papers and documents related to the work of the War Relocation Authority and other agencies involved in controlling the internment.",
        "There are a number of historians of the internment and a number of photography scholars who knew they were there and had published a couple of these photographs in books.",
        "But there are more than 800 photographs and my estimate is that a maximum of 10 of them were ever published.",
        "I wonder, Gary Okihiro, as you're looking through that huge collection -and she was a great photographer - how did you pick what ended up in the book?"

        "Well, there are several reasons for selecting them.",
        "The first, I think, is the very human story that she tells of old people, young people, women, children and so forth, caught in the act of forcibly being removed from their homes and being detained in these horrible conditions - in horse stalls for example with open latrines and very poor conditions, interior wise.",
        "So, the photos that we selected, I think, tended to depict all phases of the removal and the confinement, which are in three phases and then also to show some of the kind of horror involved in the entire process.",
        "Did all the pictures survive?",
        "Yes they did, but some of them are not in terrific shape.",
        "There's been some problems with thinning of the negatives.",

        "I am, of course, post-Second War generation, and recently over here in Japan, there was the coverage on the TV news network of the museum, I believe based in California where one of the internment camps was located, and there is a museum showing the exhibits and the materials and documents and so forth of what took place there during World War II regarding the Japanese-Americans."

        "And first of all, I was really surprised - I'm really surprised about the openness and candidacy(ph) among the American (unintelligible) about this issue, and it still seems like this newly released photographs might be stimulating another round of discussions of what really happened during that time period.",
        "And I guess my question for the guest speakers is what does the new development of these newly released photographs could have or add to the discussion of what the ideal life or what it means to be an American citizen today, as well what that continues to mean, to be an American citizen, in the future?",
        "It's a question that's come up in the present war, as well as the war in 1941 and '42.",
        "Gary Okihiro, I wonder what you think.",
        "That's an excellent question, and in fact it was one of my major motivations for getting involved in this project, once again having written so much on the camps.",
        "You know, the 1988 Civil Liberties Act set up a community fund to educate the American public about this event and in the hope that this would never happen again to any group of Americans, whether they are citizens or not.",
        "And yet, post-9/11, in 2001 and most recently the USA Patriot Act, among other things, has enabled us to detain people arbitrarily, profile them for religion, primarily on their basis of religion and country of origin, and hold them in indefinite detention, which is again so eerie - so eerily resembles the World War II experience.",
        "I wonder, Linda Gordon, is this something you've thought about, as well?",
        "I think it's unavoidable that we think about it, and I think it was very, very central to Dorothea Lange's work.",
        "The question is who is an American.",
        "At the time that she was working, not only overt racists but, huge proportions of the American population assumed that American meant white.",
        "And in her work, even that previous to the documentation of the internment, I think that she was trying to use visual images to create a new and a more capacious understanding of what it meant to be an American.",

        "Well, during the war she had no access to them.",
        "They didn't - were not her property.",
        "In fact, she, like I think most photographers who work for the government, she held back a few negatives, and there are a few prints in her private papers.",
        "But she couldn't publish them because to do so would've let people know that she had stolen them, so to speak.",
        "Afterwards, she was both very, very busy with other projects and her health was declining.",
        "But also what's interesting is that she believed that these were not her best work because the circumstances under which she did this photography were extremely restrictive.",
        "There were many things she was forbidden to photograph.",
        "She was more or less prevented from getting into conversation with the internees.",
        "She only finally saw this work as a whole in 1964, the year before she dies, and at that time, she was using every bit of her remaining energy to prepare for the first one-woman show given to a photographer at the Museum of Modern Art, which occurred in 1965.",

        "That is certainly what they were told.",
        "The fact is that on the one hand, although there was a lot of racism being ratcheted up by the press and political leaders, in fact there's also evidence that many Japanese-Americans were friendly with their Anglo neighbors.",
        "Many had white neighbors come to visit them in the camps.",
        "I do not believe there was any evidence that their physical safety was significantly threatened.",
        "And furthermore, if it had been, this would be an outrageous response.",
