        "Ptolemy hijacked it, and he had the tomb of Alexander, so this made the city, which was already quite a prosperous place, a place of pilgrimage.",

        "The story is that vinegar melts these pearls so this would have been the most tremendous loss of wealth, you know.",
        "What's quite funny, though, I think in a way, is that apparently there isn't a vinegar that is so strong that it would dissolve pearls.",
