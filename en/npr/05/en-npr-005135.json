        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "My husband is an active-duty submariner, and one of the things that I'm so grateful that you're having this show is a lot of people don't understand what it means to be a military wife.",
        "And with the submarine force, we don't know when our husbands are leaving.",
        "We get 24-hour notice, if we're lucky, when they're leaving, and sometimes less than that.",
        "And so it's really hard when people ask you do you know where you husband is, or how long is your husband away for.",
        "We can't talk about that.",
        "You know, a lot of us have Facebook accounts.",
        "We can't post anything on Facebook.",
        "If you post something on Facebook, it can lead to losing the privilege of getting information on the boats' whereabouts for all of the wives, and that's a really stressful thing when you can't talk to your friends or your family about your husband's schedule or where he is or when he's coming home.",
        "And I think that that's something that isn't understood.",
        "Lisa Faris, I'm not sure that the parallel is exact, but there had to have been similar strictures on your knowledge about where Chris was.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think the thing that helped me the most, and I think we've lost this because of the way the war has worked, is those relationships that you build back while the guys are forward, that I think we stopped communicating and getting to know the other ladies that are in similar situations and getting that bond to help you through it.",
        "You can't talk with outsiders about some of the missions and things that they're doing, but having that support system in the rear, where you can talk to people that are actually going through the same thing is so important.",
        "And you don't feel as alone.",
        "And being able to say things out loud and feel like you're in a unity of trust is so important for getting through those deployments, and I think we've lost that, and we need to get back to the old way of doing things a little bit.",
        "It really is, and I'm grateful you had mentioned in your - earlier, Lisa, the FRG.",
        "And I'm really grateful that you had mentioned that.",
        "The FRG is the Family Readiness Group, and it's the support for the families while their husbands or wives are away on deployment.",
        "And that's something that's really made a difference.",
        "And it helps a lot to have that community of people that are there and going through the same thing.",
        "But I just wanted to bring it up.",
        "I don't know how it works with the other branches, but it's hard when you don't know your husband's leaving, and then he comes home and tells you, OK, I'm leaving tomorrow.",

        "Lydia, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",

        "This email from Jeff(ph): As I went through my training and deployment, I learned very effectively how to not feel.",
        "My marriage did not make it, and it seems even as of now the only love I can feel is towards my daughter.",
        "CSM, how do you turn your feelings on and off?",
        "CSM is command sergeant major.",
        "Yeah, you know, in our USA Today article, we talk about how I discovered that ability to think of myself as already passed in order to deal with fear out on the battlefield.",
        "So I know exactly what he's talking about.",
        "And again, this got back to the realization through self-reflection that it's OK to have that tool in the toolbox, just don't spend all your time trying to protect it, which I think is what I was doing.",
        "You couldn't let the family get that close to you because I frankly had a fear of would I lose that tool out on the battlefield.",
        "And I found out very quickly no, you won't lose that tool at all.",
        "You can absolutely stay connected to your family and be able to use whatever it is that you use to cope with the stresses of being in a combat environment.",
        "I don't mean to put words in your mouth.",
        "But, in other words, that when you were in that combat environment, that's how you felt and you didn't want to change it because it worked for you.",
        "Absolutely."

        "And you found that there were alternatives though?",
        "No. I still use the same tool.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "I found the ability to put it into perspective, that rather than having that tool always out next to the toolbox, when you come home, put it back in the toolbox, close the toolbox and you can open it whenever you get back overseas.",
        "And, Lisa Faris, how much difference does it make?",
        "It makes a big difference.",
        "I mean, Ashley having the opportunity to spend quality time with him instead of rushing him out the door has improved everything greatly.",
        "I mean, there's still adjustments.",
        "You're still getting used to living together.",
        "I mean, we haven't lived together in 10 years, and now we're empty nesters living in a big house all by ourselves.",
        "And I wake up some days going, gosh, I wish he could deploy because he's been home every day, and I'm not used to that.",
        "So be careful what you wish for, but it's the quality of time that's wonderful.",

        "It's fun.",
        "It really is.",
        "We actually - it's not as fun as I thought it would be, with the tired department.",

        "But my question to you, Sergeant Major, is with TRICARE, do you happen to know if there are any initiatives out there for them to improve some of their mental health services, especially for spouses?",
        "You know, Secretary Woodson was at the defense resiliency conference earlier this year, and this is a topic the Department of Defense is looking at.",

        "Both the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense have a lot of programs out there for PTS as well as traumatic brain injury and whatnot, and rightfully so.",
        "And we're trying to be heard that after 10 years of war, we need to relook just the day-in and day-out marital relationships.",
        "The reintegration briefs that we get now are the same that we got at the beginning of the war, but things have evolved.",
        "As we outlined in our story, there's not a great deal of access to mental health providers on local economies in a lot of places.",
        "And I think we could do more within the Department of Defense to get more health providers for the families.",
        "So I know that it's being discussed.",
        "I know that it's being looked at as the department reviews all of its family care programs.",

        "For many female military members, our potential mates are often limited to our male counterparts.",

        "I just had a comment about the things that work for my wife and I with multiple deployments has been just the communication.",
        "We've found that we communicate better and more while deployed than while I'm home, just being able to keep each other informed of what's going on, decisions to be made and making an effort to stay part of the decision process for the things going on at home even if I'm not here.",
        "And just found that that has helped us stay closer even when we're miles apart.",

        "Communication, I joke about, you know, when you read stories of wars gone by where a letter was a sent three months before it was received, you know, and the reply took just as long to get back, you know, to the soldier in the trenches, you know, so six months later you get an answer to what you sent.",
        "Those days are so long gone, and communication is so much better now than what has ever been that the only excuse for separation during a deployment is lack of effort.",
        "And no excuse for that.",
