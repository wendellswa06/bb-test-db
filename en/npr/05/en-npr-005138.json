        "And do you find that, in your correspondence with listeners, that they trust this organization less because of some of the things they've found out about it?",
        "Well, I think NPR took a little bit - a hit.",
        "I think we all recognize that.",
        "But I think, you know, the listeners, the real listeners, the core audience are willing to cut NPR a little bit of slack and understand that anybody can make a mistake.",
        "And I think we've all seen that NPR has tried to self-correct, which is good.",
        "You know, I don't think anyone disagrees that mistakes were made.",

        "It's something that's growing.",
        "It's something that we all - if we don't have one, we aspire to.",

        "In particular, there was a story on the national news last night about vitamins and mortality in seniors taking vitamins, and they implied a causality there when, in fact, I think they're really just correlated; that people taking vitamins may be more likely to take them if they're ill to begin with.",
        "When you say it was on the national news, you mean on NPR or somewhere else?",
        "Yes, well, that was on NBC News last night, just as an example.",

        "I couldn't agree with you more on that causation and correlation.",
        "I spent the last four years up at Harvard teaching on migration policy, and spent a lot of time looking at a lot of economic analyses and studies and so forth.",
        "And that very issue of causation and correlation is key to anything you have to say about any kind of social science research.",
        "And I think most journalists understand the difference, but sometimes they do make that mistake.",

        "No balance whatsoever.",
        "And I'm not sure which side she feels is unbalanced.",

        "Yes.",
        "It's so seldom as a reporter that you can draw a firm, hard conclusion.",
        "If you do an investigation then, by all means, you should draw your conclusion.",
        "But if you're reporting something that's an ongoing event and there are different sides on this thing, you can't draw a conclusion so often, or so many things are ideological differences.",
        "What's the conclusion on the best way to create jobs in America, for example, or so many things like that?",
        "You know, listeners and website readers then rely on us to try to give them the unfettered positions of the different sides so that we can always decide for ourselves."
