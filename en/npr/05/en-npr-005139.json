        "And you do an analysis where you try and - analysis means you explain why and what and how.",

        "That doesn't comfort Macke, although he admits it's effective, maybe a bit too effective, because along with those honeybees, the chemical probably killed even more wild bees and other insects."

        "You need to know how deep would the water be.",
        "In other words, in order to properly price a policy, an insurance company would want to know if a flood occurred, would repairs involve replacing a few carpets, or removing tons of mud and debris?",
        "Lohmann wants to make flood hazard maps that would provide that kind of information, detailed enough to make predictions for individual properties.",
        "But to make such detailed maps requires an enormous amount of computing.",
        "Ten years ago, this would've been immensely expensive to run those kind of computations."

        "You have easily 2,000 to 3,000, now up to 4,000 little processors in each graphics card.",
        "So what you do is divide a map into a grid and each processor calculates the flood risk for a different square on the grid, all at the same time.",
