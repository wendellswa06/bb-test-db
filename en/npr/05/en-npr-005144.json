        "It's a state that right in the heart of the Bible Belt, it's a place where a lot of the voters I speak to bring up their sort of moral values and the idea of sort of a moral candidate, the idea that candidates should be pro-gun, pro-life, anti-gay marriage, and that's one of the reasons why this race is so close.",
        "On some of the hot button issues Harold Ford, Jr. has stances that are difficult for a Republican to pin down as liberal.",
        "Harold Ford is a U.S.",
        "congressman, has been for the last 10 years; and he has got votes marking him being in support of the Patriot Act, for going to war in Iraq, for supporting a ban in gay marriage.",
        "So you have the situation here where the Democrat is moderate enough, has enough experience on the campaign trail to really mount a very strong campaign against a very strong Republican candidate who we all expected to have an easier time of it.",
        "And finally, in one of the analyses I saw, Harold Ford is really relying on urban areas to pump up the black vote and push him over the victory line.",
        "Do you think that that is how things will play out if he wins?",
        "And if he doesn't, what will be - you know, if Corker wins, then what will be his cause of victory?",
        "Well, the fact of the matter is there is just 16 percent of the vote in Tennessee is made up of black voters.",
        "And Harold may come from Memphis, but Memphis is not enough to win this campaign.",
        "There are a lot of rural counties where he has to make inroads; there are a lot of independent-leaning counties that are in the suburban areas around a city like, say, Nashville.",
        "This is where both candidates have been making so many appearances because these are the counties where someone who wants to win statewide has to make serious inroads.",
        "I think that there has been a little bit of conversation of late about whether there are some white voters in the polls who say they're going to vote for a Democrat but maybe when they get to the polls are going to change their mind because of Harold Ford's race.",
        "This is nicknamed the Bradley effect after a 1989 L.A.",
        "mayor who was looking good in the polls until the last minute when he lost by, you know, just, I think, 1 percent.",
        "I think his campaign shouldn't be completely characterized by that; I don't think that's what he would want.",
        "And I think he has done very well in his approach.",
        "But it's going to be clear that when this race is over, win or lose, there's going to be a lot of conversation about how race played into the final vote.",
