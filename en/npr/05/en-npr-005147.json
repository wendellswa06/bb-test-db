        "Why are lights such a problem?",
        "Besides the energy that we're going to save from doing that, why do the birds need the lights off?",
        "Well, Glenn might want to mention something about this, but in big cities, in particular large buildings, birds do get confused and get attracted to lighted areas, especially under foggy conditions when they're migrating and they could run into buildings and die.",
