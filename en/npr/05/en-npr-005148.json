        "They are in the western United States.",

        "That's, you know, we had this winter out on Montauk, there was a Scissor-tailed Flycatcher from Texas.",
        "What's it doing - right now in Staten Island, there's a Western Grebe, another western species.",
        "This winter, we had a Scott's Oriole, which is from - normally found in - sort of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, in Union Square Park, in the middle of one of the busiest neighborhoods in Manhattan.",
        "So, birds turn up in strange places.",
        "I've often been asked: Is it a sign of global warming that we're seeing more of these birds in weird places?",
        "And I'm not sure.",
        "It could be.",
        "But it could also be because there are more people looking today than ever before.",
        "There are just so many birders out there looking at birds that I think we notice things that we didn't notice before.",
        "I want to bring another guest to help us talk a little bit more about the center of the U.S., some of the spring activity in the central flyways specifically.",
        "That's a patch of land 50 miles wide in central Nebraska.",
        "It's a Brad Mellema.",
        "He is director of the Iain Nicolson Audubon Center at Rowe Sanctuary in Gibbon, Nebraska.",
        "Thanks for being with us, today.",
        "Well, the central part of Nebraska is really coming alive with spring migration as we speak.",
        "And our marquee bird that comes through this area among many others is the Sandhill Crane.",
        "And the Sandhill Cranes are making their way north to begin their breeding habits in parts north of here.",
        "And what happens is we get over fully 80 percent of the full population of Sandhill Cranes that winter in places across Texas, New Mexico, even over to Arizona, even parts of the country of Mexico.",
        "And they all gather, if you visualize, an hourglass shape across North America into this small section of the Platte River.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And they feed, and rest, and fatten up, and get ready for their flight north to - visualize that hourglass again - from Hudson Bay in Canada all the way across Canada, Alaska, the Yukon Delta, even across the Bering Strait into Siberia to nest and - couple of eggs.",
        "We actually have an audio clip of what the Sandhill Crane sounds like, so let's hear that.",
        "(Soundbite of Sandhill Crane chirping)",
        "Wow.",
        "That's very distinct."

        "Now, I want you to visualize that.",
        "Of course, it's the Sandhill Crane.",
        "And here in Nebraska on Rowe Sanctuary, we'll have a couple of roosts on the critical Platte River both upstream and downstream for our visitor center hosting anywhere from 20 to 40,000 birds simultaneously.",
        "All those birds squawking like that at once.",
        "It's football-stadium loud when they all get excited.",
        "It really -the auditory experience of watching the Sandhill Cranes, in my mind, is 75 percent of the experience.",
        "Wow.",
        "Okay.",
        "So let's say that some people are getting excited about seeing and hearing these birds, where should they go?",
        "What's a good perch, so to speak, for them?",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, a lot of people do come to Nebraska every spring, and the broader crane season, we like to say, is from mid-February through about mid-April with — right now, we're seeing what we consider to be peak numbers of birds in the region.",
        "And this is a great time to come to Nebraska, and we'll have good viewing up through about, oh, the first week of April.",
        "So, we've got another week or 10 days, where we can count on good numbers of birds being in the area.",
        "And so…",
        "Is there a sanctuary, a park or some place they could go?",
        "Yeah, yeah.",
        "Well, Audubon has a sanctuary here on the Platte River and there are also public viewing decks that are provided between the cities of Kearney and Grand Island, Nebraska.",
        "The birds do fan out further than that, but the larger concentrations are kind of in that 60- to 80-mile stretch of the river.",
        "What else might you see flying overhead?",
        "A lot of waterfowl."

        "You'd see hundreds of thousands of geese spiraling down and landing in the - that alone is a huge spectacle.",
        "And we'd see the bald eagles that would follow the migration and pick off the cripples during hunting season.",

        "You know, I'm not sure whether I should keep my fingers crossed whether they'll see it or not.",
        "You know, it's - I have such mixed feelings because it would be magnificent to know that the birds are still there.",
        "But, also — then that means we'll probably lose them during my lifetime, and I'd rather it was somebody else's fault.",
        "What do you mean?",
