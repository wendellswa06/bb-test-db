        "…verifiable proof.",
        "And, you know, the thing that I like to always remember about ivory-billed woodpeckers, you know, a bird - the rusty blackbird is actually a bird that inhabits the same habitat that the ivory-billed woodpecker did or does, if you believe it's still there.",

        "You know, because there was a time in, you know, 1930s when we rediscovered ivory-billed woodpeckers - they had been thought to be extinct even then, and we discovered this population of six or eight pairs of them, and we absolutely knew they were there.",
        "And it was this last fragment of forest that still had things like red wolves that are now, you know, extinct except in captivity virtually and, you know, panthers that we just have, you know, 100 left in southern Florida and so on.",
        "It had all those things and it had ivory-billed woodpeckers.",
        "But over — about a 10- or 12-year period, that entire forest was cut down to the last tree.",
        "And we, you know, there was one female left that would come out of this one Rhus tree, calling for a mate until that tree blew down.",

        "And, you know, what was the major reason why we cut those trees down?",
        "To make packing cranes.",

        "Yeah.",
        "…to be doing that, you know?",
