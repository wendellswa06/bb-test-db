        "What would you like to do on the site and a feature that you haven't done yet?",
        "Oh, we certainly want to add video because that's really important because, again, you know, if we're just sort of a static Web site where it's sort of go-and-find-out-what-bird-you-saw, it's not near as interesting if we can say, gosh, here is what a red-winged blackbird looks like in a picture, but gosh, here's a video as well.",

        "So, you don't have to go out and purchase a CD or something with all the bird calls on them?",
