        "The one thing I agree completely with what Glenn is saying that, you know, more often - most of the time, you know, wind farms are not a major problem for birds.",
        "I mean, that all of the studies that have been done so far on modern wind farms have found very few examples of major incidences of mortality.",
        "But one thing that I think people overlook is where their energy comes from now and the impacts right now, you know, in - where you guys are, in New York City, your energy is probably coming from coal.",
        "It was mined in Appalachia, in the heart of the range.",
        "If a bird has declined by more than 80 percent, the Cerulean Warbler - and we're talking about hundreds and hundreds of thousands of acres are going to be lost from mountaintop removal mining there, you know, and as well as energy and, you know, it's affecting gas and oil wells in the range of sage-grouse and prairie chickens, you know, all the birds that are rapidly declining.",
        "And, you know, the Alberta tar sand is the largest - second largest oil deposit in the world in northern Alberta, part of the range of - where rusty blackbirds are trying to breed, you know, an area the size of Florida that's going to be strip mined and crisscrossed for oil and gas.",
        "So, people need to balance out where those things are.",
        "Just because you don't see them in your backyard doesn't mean we should forget the kinds of impacts that, you know, these other kinds of energy extraction industries are having.",
        "Sometimes, the carbon footprint can step right on the birds, too.",
        "Yeah.",

        "But it's a pretty interesting bird because, you know, most seabirds nests on islands or cliffs, and this bird actually goes up and flies into old growth trees and lays its single egg way up in the - hundreds of feet up into - in a Redwood tree or some other sort of tree along the Pacific Coast, and raises this little young bird up in one of these trees, bringing food to it from the ocean.",
        "And, you know, you can imagine the first flight of this chick.",
        "He has to make it, sometimes, you know, 10, 20 miles inland.",
        "He's going to make it all the way to the ocean in one shot.",
        "So, just an incredible life history, and that's a bird, unfortunately, that was really decimated by the logging of the redwoods in Northern California and the other kinds of old-growth forests along the Pacific Coast.",
