        "I think it is really amazing to see the type of human being who he is.",
        "And I think in this day and age, it's very rare to see that, and that's one of the reasons I come here.",
        "The big topics of the weekend, touched on time and time again during a five-hour Q&A session on Saturday, where Berkshire Hathaway's increased size and questions about who will take over as CEO when the 82-year-old Buffett steps down.",
        "While admitting the company's expansion has changed things - some for better, some for worse - Buffet demurred when it came to succession specifics.",
        "But shareholders I spoke with weren't too concerned about the question of the next Buffett.",
        "Angel investor Karen Linder of Omaha, author of the book \"\"The Women of Berkshire Hathaway\"\" and a longtime shareholder, says knowing there is a succession plan in place helps, even if it hasn't been fully revealed.",
        "Overall, she says, the company is very open.",
        "As shareholders of several companies, this is probably one of the most transparent.",
        "And we get more communication from Berkshire than maybe some of our other holdings.",
        "Buffett says he has no plans to leave anytime soon.",

        "So your story, Helen Simpson, as we just heard there, is narrated by a man, and it deals with all of the things that keep him awake in the wee hours of the night, things like work-life balance, whether he looks fat, whether he should go part time to spend more time with his kids - all issues that, I think it's probably safe to say, are better known for keeping women awake at night.",
        "Were you writing with your tongue firmly in cheek here?",
        "Well, yes, in a word.",

        "And then I just...",
        "Terribly earnest, hmm?",
        "Yes.",
        "And then I thought well, actually, all you have to do is what I've - what I do in my ordinary life when I hear some woman being talked down.",
        "I think, well, I wonder if they'd talk to a man like that?",
        "So I just thought, OK, I'll reverse everything in this story.",
        "We'll have the man worrying about whether he's a good father or whether he's feeding the children right, whether he can go part time.",
        "And we'll have the woman being the one who leaves the bathroom in a state, and belches and farts, and so on.",
        "But - well, let me ask on behalf of all the men who will be out there listening and saying, now hang on a second - you know - we worry about work-life balance and whether the kids are doing all right as well.",

        "What gives?",
        "And Mitchell said, look, I can't keep you from speculating, but I would simply ask that you judge me on the quality of the work and to remember that I was subject to far worse accusations on the conflict of interest when he went to Ireland because of his own Irish background in trying to broker peace in that area of the world.",
        "And he said, you haven't heard any accusation that I did a bad job there, so I would similarly expect that any concerns about my conflict of interest in this case will disappear over time.",

        "He did not go out of his way to blame the players' union for its resistance to testing as much as some other people have.",
        "He was extraordinarily evenhanded in his parsing out of what would have to call blame.",
        "He blamed everybody.",

        "He said it's important to let go of the past, have a new beginning and make sure that you handle things better moving forward.",

        "Of course, that would, you know, invite the response of the players' association to appeal them and everyone would spend a lot of money, you know, worrying about it and he thinks its best to just let it all go.",

        "To be honest with you, Senator Mitchell gave the impression that the steroid era continues; that this is merely a milestone in what will continue to be a game marked by the use of illegal performance-enhancing drugs, specifically human growth hormone for which there is no urine test and other substances which players have figured out how to either take - how to take and then possibly get rid of them, or if they test -he did not paint a very pretty picture of not only the era which some people think we are exiting, but the era he claims, I believe, that we're still in.",
