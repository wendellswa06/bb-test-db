        "So many folks in the FBI are doing all that they can to keep us safe.",
        "The reality of it is that they are two separate issues.",
        "But let's take that second issue - the school shooting.",
        "How much pressure is the FBI under at this point?",
        "Well, there is nothing that indicates the Russia investigation is what led them to not, as they said, follow the right protocols.",
        "It's separate groups of people doing separate things.",
        "And separate problems, although, obviously, as you said, the FBI did acknowledge that protocols were not followed.",
        "They had been tipped off to the shooter in Florida.",
        "And we do not know the extent of what they did not do.",
        "We will get answers to that.",
        "They are going - there's going to be an internal investigation into that.",
        "You know, the question always arises after these events is - what is Congress going to do?",
        "Is there going to be a legislative response?",
        "And I think most lawmakers were pretty candid, again, that there still does not seem to be a broad governing coalition to do any kind of major gun legislation.",
        "There is - one piece of legislation that has the closest thing to a chance to being revived in this debate is a bill led by Republican Texas Senator John Cornyn, which aims to close loopholes in the existing federal background check system.",
        "We have seen some failings in that system in recent shootings.",
        "And that's sponsored by a Republican.",
        "It is.",
        "OK.",
        "And it has broad bipartisan support.",
        "However, this bill, as is with many bills, has problems that when you start the gun debate, does it become a magnet for more controversial pieces of legislation.",
        "This one has other members of Congress who would like to attach to it legislation to make it easier for concealed carry weapon permit owners to travel across the country more freely.",
        "And that is when the debate gets bogged down again and again and again."

        "What were they like?",
        "Well, there were three funerals yesterday.",
        "Two of them were for students - 14-year-old Alex Schachter, he's a freshman who was in the marching band; Jaime Guttenberg, also 14, she was a dancer; and the third was for Scott Beigel, the geography teacher who ushered students back into the classroom during the shooting.",
        "These funerals aren't open to the media, but they have drawn huge crowds.",
        "A few have even been moved to hotels to accommodate the crowd.",
        "And I talked to Jennifer Corral (ph), who attended Guttenberg's funeral, and said there were just thousands of people packed in the hotel ballroom.",
        "It's a big community, and we all care about each other and the kids and their families and everyone and the school and the teachers.",
        "Everyone needs to know that they have us all behind them, and we support them, and we love them, and we will make something better somehow.",
        "And today, there's going to be another funeral and tomorrow, the school athletic director, Chris Hixon - there'll be visitation for him and more funerals to come during the week."

        "So, Cheryl, let me ask about the issue we heard about from our congressional correspondent, Susan Davis, who pointed out that once again in Congress the opening bid is there's really not much that Congress is willing to do in the way of gun control.",
        "There might be minor pieces of legislation - not even sure those can pass.",
        "That's the tone in Congress.",
        "What is the tone on that subject among the students who survived the shooting?",
        "Well, they don't think the economic future of the game is in jeopardy and then obviously, despite the fact that they were the names of lots of current and former Yankees on that list, they don't seemed to be too worried about the way they're conducting business either.",
        "The only current player known to have met with Mitchell is Jason Giambi, now at the New York Yankees who won an MVP award when he plays for the Oakland Athletics.",
        "Giambi was almost forced to appear before Senator Mitchell by baseball commissioner Bud Selig after Giambi, more or less, admitted publicly using steroids.",
        "Senator Mitchell, as we heard from Alan Schwarz, did not recommend harsh punishments for the players' name.",
        "I urged the commissioner to forego imposing discipline on players for past violations of baseball's rules on performance-enhancing substances, including the players named in this report, except in those cases where he determines that the conduct is so serious that discipline is necessary to maintain the integrity of the game.",
        "I make this recommendation fully aware that there are valid arguments, both for and against it.",
        "But I believe that those in favor are compelling.",
        "And Senator Mitchell outlined recommendations for how steroids and other drugs should be handled in the future.",
        "The program should be administered by a truly independent person who holds exclusive authority over its structure and administration.",
        "It should be transparent to the public, allowing for periodic audits of its operations and providing regular reports of aggregate data on testing and test results.",
        "It should include adequate year-round, unannounced testing and employ best practices as they developed.",
        "To ensure that the independent administrator can accomplish these objectives, the program should receive sufficient funding.",

        "I think it's very interesting that near the end of what you were playing for your listeners just a few minutes ago, Mr. Mitchell made a distinction.",
        "He talked about the integrity of the game and he said that only players, the only players who should be punished are those whose conduct has been so, you know, so bad that it threatens the integrity of the game.",
        "I'd be very interested to know a little more about how he defines that.",

        "That's another thing entirely.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And this is perhaps why none of the players named in the report shows to step forward and talked to Mr. Mitchell because it's one thing to be accused of using steroids or human growth hormones.",

        "Yes, I think that's most properly characterized.",
        "I think the other thing that's kind of ironic - and then people haven't really talked about it very much yet, but this past baseball season, the 2007 season, saw record-breaking revenues, didn't seem to matter to the people who pay baseball's freight that the Bonds thing was an ongoing embarrassment.",
        "And even as he broke the record, there was a kind of this cloud hovering over him about prosecution down the line."
