        "And said that to he - by his estimation, half of the guys in the sport used it.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, I think that the important point that Mr. Mitchell made was - his sources were limited.",
        "He had this former clubhouse guy in New York to talk to and a couple of other guys who had been, you know, were facing federal charges themselves and so it was to their advantage to be candid with the commission.",
        "But he didn't have people in every major league city.",
        "He didn't have people who would have been in contact with the numbers of players other than the ones in New York, for example, and some of the other places.",

        "Yeah, your guest implied that because revenues aren't down that maybe people don't care about this and - I don't think those two are necessarily connected.",
        "I mean, I care very much about the integrity of the game and the players in it, but that doesn't mean I'm going to turn the TV off.",
        "I care about baseball more.",
        "Okay.",
        "So that - but that's a very much more precise way of saying what I said in a rather clumsy way.",
        "So I appreciate your correction.",
        "You're right.",
        "People don't care about it to the extent that they're going to turn off the TV and stop paying attention to baseball.",
        "They care about the game enough so that they're willing to maybe just put aside the fact that numbers of guys who are using steroids or human growth hormone.",
        "Well, I don't know what you mean by put aside…",
        "Well, they keep watching, even though, they know that that's the fact.",
        "Right.",
        "They don't let it deter them from watching the game."

        "Dale, let me ask you this, though.",
        "In 1994 when the season was interrupted - the World Series cancelled by a strike - well, people certainly cared about that enough that the next year when baseball resumed, attendance was drastically down and indeed a lot of people say the genesis of this - of management and it's willingness to look the other way while the drug problem grew and metastasized, was the fact that they were the long bow(ph), the homerun chased between Mark MaGuire and Barry Sosa was bringing people back to the Bowl Park.",
        "What's the difference between people caring enough about after the strike, not to go in this situation do you think?",
        "That's a tough one.",
        "I don't know what the connection if there is a connection.",
        "But the strike was, you know, a disagreement between the management and players and it left a bad taste in people's mouths on both sides - you know, regardless of who was at fault.",
        "I think maybe one of the major differences, Neal, was that the management labor strife in that particular instance canceled the World Series.",
        "And people value the World Series.",
        "They value the Super Bowl.",
        "They value the NCAA Final Four.",
        "These are big, gigantic party occasions and people look forward to.",
        "I mean, they matter to them a lot, even if their home team doesn't make it, for example, to the World Series.",
        "That baseball - the combination of management and labor could be so incredibly self-destructive as to actually cause the World Series not happen was more alarming, I think to most people, and more offensive to them into their sense of the dramatic even than the evidence of widespread use of illegal drugs and, you know, steroids, human growth hormone, et cetera.",
        "Dale, thanks very much.",
        "You're welcome.",
        "So long.",

        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "See, I was just wondering about the whole - the big picture of everything.",
        "Starting in the high school sports and the college there seems to be a lot of use at the lower levels that nobody really pays attention to, or they almost like their sweeping under the rug because it's the risk reward to so hyper kids nowadays that they'll take a little bit of a risk to get rewarded.",
        "If you have raw talent and you have to make yourself just a pinch better, sometimes they're slipped under the rug for certain reasons that people like to turn the blind eye to.",
        "I think that's something that Senator Mitchell talked about today when he said, yes, it's important that we stop this if we can in Major League Baseball, but the effects of this redound throughout sports, as you're suggesting, down to college level to the high school level, and indeed, below that."

        "Well in a - it's basically everything they've done has been entirely in the self interest of the players, and entirely in the self interest of the owners.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah, I think that's one way of looking at it, although it's interesting that you're calling from San Francisco and saying that because a good number of Giants fans don't regard themselves as suckers, and they regard what Barry Bonds did as quite magnificent regardless of what may have fueled his achievement."
