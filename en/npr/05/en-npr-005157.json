        "Merce Cunningham is considered one of the finest dancers and choreographers of all time.",
        "He made his performers dance outside the box.",

        "Merce Cunningham died last Sunday at the age of 90.",
        "Karen Michel did several interviews with Merce Cunningham over the years and sat in on one of his last rehearsals.",

        "Among them, Merce Cunningham was exceptional.",
        "There's certain people in music, in painting, in science, in history, who stake a claim on ideas and change the experience forever.",
        "And this is absolutely true for Merce.",
        "Merce Cunningham wasn't about easy.",
        "However hard or difficult it is, for me making dancing, making movement, even though I can't do it myself, is the most nourishing thing in life that I know of.",
        "(Soundbite of clapping)",
        "Sitting in his wheelchair at stage left in his sparse studios in Manhattan's West Village, Cunningham watched his dancers intently just a week before his death.",
        "His perpetual corona of white curly hair topped a deeply lined face and piercing eyes.",
        "He paid particular attention to the RUGs, the Repertory Understudy Group, the next generation of Cunningham dancers.",
        "Julie Cunningham, no relation, was one of them once.",
        "She's been a member of the company for the past five years.",

        "Even in the last few works that I have been in the company and he's created, he's always changing direction and opening up new possibilities.",
        "It was the possibilities of movement that consumed Merce Cunningham and pushed him to challenge dance's narrative and music-bound traditions.",

        "At the same time, I work with movement, physical movement, to make a dance and I have with it a piece of music.",
        "But not in the sense of one supporting the other like the music supporting the dance, or the dance somehow illustrating the music in any sense that way.",
        "In Cunningham's dances, everything came together just before, if not at, the first performance.",
        "How they came together is by chance.",
        "It was a method he developed with his life-long professional and personal partner, John Cage.",

        "From an early age, Cunningham was an extraordinary dancer.",
        "His long line, the arch of his back, and his athleticism characterized his dancing.",
