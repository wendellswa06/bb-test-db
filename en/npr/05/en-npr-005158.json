        "This is NPR News.",
        "Voters in Arizona's 8th Congressional district go to the polls tomorrow in a special election.",
        "They'll be choosing someone to fill out the term of former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.",
        "Giffords resigned her seat after being critically wounded in a shooting last year.",
        "She wants to focus full-time on her recovery.",
        "Running to fill the remaining six months of her term are her former district director and a Republican businessman who's also an Iraq War veteran.",
        "NPR's Brian Naylor has the story.",
        "The special election bears some small resemblance to the 2010 campaign in the Tucson-based district.",
        "Jesse Kelly is once again the Republican candidate, hoping to reverse the results of almost two years ago when he lost by some 4,000 thousand votes.",
        "He's running against Ron Barber, who was Gabby Giffords top aide in Arizona.",
        "But of course nothing is the same in the 8th District since the 2011 shooting, in which Giffords and Barber were wounded and six people killed.",
        "In an interview, Barber says he's in the race to help the middle class.",
        "I've been hearing over and over again from middle-class Arizonans that they're really feeling squeezed, and that no one really cares about their concerns.",
        "Barber and Kelly have tangled over a number of issues in what, by all accounts, will be a tight race in a year when both parties are scrambling for every seat.",
        "Kelly, who in the 2010 race called Social Security a Ponzi scheme has backed away from that comment.",
        "He declined to be interviewed by NPR, but told MSNBC that beneficiaries of Social Security and Medicare should be given choices between government and private programs.",
        "Right now, Medicare recipients are getting less quality care than they ever have because the access to doctors is decreasing.",
        "That's because the government simply won't pay its bills.",
        "Doctors are trying to get paid for the Medicare patients and they're not getting paid by the government.",
        "Give future generations choices so they won't be stuck with anything bad.",
        "Kelly says he would repeal the Affordable Care Act or ObamaCare.",
        "Barber says parts of the program should be kept and others made to work better.",
        "In the aftermath of last years shooting, Kelly has toned down his send a warrior to Congress theme from 2010, although a PAC supporting Kelly this time around did send out a fundraising email using a photo of the ex-Marine in camouflage holding an assault rifle."

        "Barber has tried to keep Kelly from tying him to the president in a district that leans Republican.",
        "During a debate, he famously refused to state whether he'd vote to re-elect Mr. Obama.",
        "Now he says he would, but says Republicans are trying to nationalize the race.",
        "This race is really about Congressional District 8, the southern part of our state and the communities and the people that live here.",
        "I'm not going to be drawn into a national debate about issues that have nothing to do ultimately with what's good for the people I hope to represent.",
        "Barber has out-raised and outspent Kelly, but Kelly has benefited from slightly more from spending by outside groups.",
        "Early voting has been underway for some time.",
        "Barber held a rally Saturday night with Gabby Giffords, who made a rare public appearance on behalf of her former staffer.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF CHEERING)",
        "Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, said Giffords' decision to step down to focus on her rehab was incredibly difficult.",
        "But she knew that at that point it made sense for her to step down.",
        "And the person that she knew could represent this community the way she did is this man standing to our left."

        "According to Palestinian officials, the death toll now is 130 Palestinians killed.",
        "Of course, on the Israeli side, there's quite a bit of violence as well.",
        "We're hearing from Israeli officials that more than 100 rockets hit Israel and two people died today, bringing the total death toll in Israel to five Israelis.",
        "One of those rockets, in particular, hit in Rishon Letzion, which is a suburb of Tel Aviv.",
        "Until now, we've seen a few rockets hitting close to Tel Aviv, but this actually managed to strike a building.",
        "No one was hurt there because they were all inside the bomb shelter, but it seems to have had a real sort of psychological impact on Israelis, who are asking if this is really the right time for Israel to go ahead with the cease fire agreement.",
        "One of the Israelis I spoke to earlier today here near the Gaza border said to me that he thinks that Israel should reconsider going forward with the cease fire agreement.",

        "I do not think that there should be a cease fire because the operation is not over.",

        "Not only in Tel Aviv, not only in Jerusalem.",
        "And that's something you're really hearing a lot of, people here in the southern part of Israel, which has grown all too accustomed to rocket fire are saying that Israel should continue its operation, while those within the center and farther north are saying that a cease fire agreement will be best for both sides at this point.",
        "So at this point, we're now in the seventh day of the hostilities.",
        "Given what you've told us, is there a sense of a broader shift in what the Israeli public is saying about this?"
