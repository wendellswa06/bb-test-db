        "What we learned, though, as we went through this outbreak is that this strain was not of the same severity of the 1918 strain and that the type of disruptive interventions like school dismissals would not be needed going forward.",
        "Our actions were more aggressive at the beginning, when we knew very, very little, and were lightened up as we learned more.",

        "It's very dynamic, and while we wish we had all the answers, we wish we knew exactly what was going to happen in the weeks or months ahead, unfortunately we don't and so we try to take the best information available and work in partnership with the stakeholders that are really going to be affected by these things and move forward in ways that are prudent for the communities.",

        "I've heard we had, in some of our schools around here, up to 30-percent absences, just people keeping their kids out, and maybe that might be the reason why it didn't get out of control as much as people thought it might.",
        "And so the school was not closed, you just decided to keep your kids out.",
        "Right, right, and the reason we do that is we do have one child who is susceptible to lung infections and stuff.",

        "And you know, we've taken microbiology, and we've learned about the flu, and I'm not saying that I have a huge amount of practical experience of dealing with, you know, epidemics, but the same people who were going to get the flu anyway were the people that were at the highest risk for swine flu: the young, the old, the immuno-compromised.",

        "Now, 100 years ago, a public-health officer would quarantine or isolate you, but now we use that data, as Dr. Schuchat said, to really think about issues of how severe this epidemic is, who's dying or becoming hospitalized so that we can ratchet up or down our public health responses.",
        "And what we're finding is that not every state makes, in this case, H1N1 a reportable disease, and we're working on that; has the lab facilities to actually process all the cases of bona fide flu and also what's called influenza-like illnesses.",

        "Might you try them next time?",
        "Rear Adm.",
        "SCHUCHAT: You know, there was a partnership between Google Flu and the CDC that took information about influenza surveillance from many years going backwards, and Google used algorithms to try to mirror the kind of laboratory-based surveillance that we did, using search words that people would put in during the regular flu season."
