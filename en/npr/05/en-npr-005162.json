        "Then they found a very nice correlation with increases in influenza detection from their search words and what we were finding with our laboratory system.",
        "That type of system, though, breaks down completely when you have a public outbreak and concern about a new strain of influenza because, as you know, there were eight million Web hits a day on CDC's Web site for influenza, and so the Google collaboration wasn't something that we could use going forward.",
        "On the other hand, there have been innovative approaches to understand the situation and certainly innovative approaches to get information out.",

        "This was an outbreak that, so far, has disproportionately affected young people under 18.",

        "I got tickets for my son and I to fly to Phoenix, and my son, young adult, 20 years old, was with his father, my ex-husband, and the family, his step-family, were afraid to let him travel with me.",
        "They were afraid to have him in an enclosed airplane and to be exposed to people as we traveled.",
        "So I had to leave a decision up to my son as to whether or not he wanted to go, and unfortunately, we were right at the peak or the height of the hype at that point, on May 1.",
        "And my son decided to stay home, even though he wanted to see his grandma one more time, because he was afraid the family would hold him responsible should he come back with the flu.",
        "What was interesting is a student at Notre Dame, near us, had just been diagnosed.",
        "So I felt that it was more the hype of the media than anything the CDC or WHO was giving out.",
        "I felt they were very responsible and told us that they really just didn't know what to expect, and you know, as information became available, they'd let us know.",
        "But because of all the - as one of your listeners mentioned, all the information on Fox News and all the other stations that didn't seem to have anything else to broadcast at the time, it really scared people, and unfortunately it impacted my family.",
        "I'm sorry to hear about that, and your mom is - what happened?",
        "Well, I guess it depends on what media you access.",
        "You know, this is not a new issue.",
        "Media's been around for quite some time, and during the 1918 pandemic, while there wasn't the same multiplicity of media outlets, you had many newspapers who had many editions a day who were reporting it."

        "And in Newark, after the mayor closed down all sorts of public gatherings, such as theaters and the like but not saloons, the Newark Evening News complained about that, and the mayor threatened to close them down.",
        "So this is not new.",
        "Since we've had the printing press and the telegraph, we have had this media hype, and I guess the important thing for listeners is to avail themselves of the best possible media to stay informed.",

        "in multiple locations.",

        "And even before there were airplanes, influenza would circle the world in a pretty short period of time so that we don't think we can totally interrupt travel or trade, and one of the challenges in intervening in an infectious disease outbreak like this is how to balance the benefits to health and risks to health with the benefits and risks to other sectors because society is more than just the health component.",
        "So I think, you know, as we saw with the school dismissals, the unintended consequences of that were difficult in some communities.",

        "And given the transcription of the RNA virus is one mutation per kilabase pair(ph) transcription, what's the probability that this is going to follow the same steps as the 1918 and mutate into something more severe?",

        "Rear Adm.",
        "SCHUCHAT: Yeah.",
        "Thank you, John, for that outstanding report; also for raising the question of multiple waves of influenza.",
        "The 1918 pandemic was, as you said, multiple waves with the first a mild one and the next one much more severe.",
        "Unfortunately, we don't know exactly how this virus will change, whether it will persist at more severe or less severe.",
        "So far, there's been quite a bit of scientific study of the virus.",
        "Multiple isolates have been sequenced and they've been - information on the sequences has been shared widely in the scientific community.",
        "So far we know that the virulence markers, the severity marker that was present in the 1918 strain, isn't present in this.",
        "But we don't know all that we need to know about virulence.",
        "And we certainly don't know whether this particular virus will mutate or re-assort to become more severe.",
        "So that's the kind of thing that we are working on, that we're, you know, taking steps to prepare for really intensive evaluation of what happens in the Southern Hemisphere, where we expect that this virus might start to circulate during their winter season, our summer season, and of course to be ready for what may happen here in the fall."
