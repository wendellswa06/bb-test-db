        "So, the checks can absolutely go out on August 3rd if the president wants them too.",

        "The so-called dynamic kill of the well is essentially killing the well through the insertion of mud.",
        "A permanent sealing of the well, Salazar said, would be done by drilling two relief wells that won't be finished until August.",
        "Salazar exuded far more confidence than EPA administrator Lisa Jackson did when she appeared with him before the Environment and Public Works Committee.",
        "The one thing I have taken away so far is that the ability to get this oil out of the ground has far surpassed our ability to respond to the worse case scenario.",
        "Jackson added she was amazed how little science there is on underwater oil disbursements.",
        "The EPA, nonetheless, authorized their use late last week to try to break up and degrade the leaking oil.",
        "It's leaking because so-called blowout preventers installed at the well head didn't work.",
        "Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden pressed Salazar on how much Minerals Management Services - the agency inside his department that regulates oil drilling - had to do with that failure.",
        "Do you believe that Minerals Management has adequately regulated blowout preventers?",
        "No. The answer is no. I don't - I think that there is additional work that should have been done with respect to blowout prevention mechanisms."
