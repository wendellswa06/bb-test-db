        "And now, the thing is - some other people took this up, and they looked at it subsequently, and they found, actually, it's a lot more complex than all of that.",
        "And they did studies that actually indicate that the point spread and that sometimes when the local team is an underdog - that actually seems to have some sort of an influence on the number of domestic violence cases.",
        "The point of course is domestic violence is, one, a very serious issue, two, it's a very complex issue, and three, when you're actually looking at this in a broad way, I mean, you'll find that there - that people who've done serious research on this suggest there are any number of other days where you have the same kind - similar or even greater increases and - you know, even a day like Christmas.",

        "This is public radio after all, but up next, why this year's big game might be a little less super.",

        "Allen St. John's compiled those factoids and many more in his new book, \"\"The Billion Dollar Game: Behind the Scenes of the Greatest Day in American Sport - Super Bowl Sunday\"\" - comes to the conclusion that in fact, the Super Bowl alone has a greater cash value than the annual gross domestic product of North Korea.",

        "And they go through what turns out to be, well, a critical play in the game - the critical play in the game, perhaps, you describe it; I'm not going to argue with you - maybe the greatest play in the history of the Super Bowl, and that's of course, Eli Manning's pass to David Tyree.",

        "He didn't go down.",

        "I thought he was on the ground, and then he came out of the pile and just slings it.",

        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: Yeah, it was just - and it was live, and it was an improv.",

        "They go from game to game to game.",
        "This is what's called Fox's A-Team.",

        "Mr.",
        "ST. PAUL: I mean, he's the guy who will take this and slice it up, you know, \"\"Rashomon\"\" style, and show you not only, you know, the sack and the guy celebrating the sack and something like that, he'll show you the guys who were covering the wide receivers that allowed the guy to get the sack.",
        "And in short, he'll show a lot of action off the ball.",
        "And in short, it's a little bit like, you know, \"\"The Paper Chase\"\" with John Houseman, were he'd call on you when you least expect it.",
        "And that's what the all the cameraman had to learn - that they had to really stick with their assignments.",
        "And there were a few times during the course of the year where that didn't quite happen, where guys sort of just didn't quite fight against that impulse strongly enough and made a few key mistakes, which of course drives these guys crazy.",
        "And here was a moment where all of that discipline and just all of that teamwork just came together perfectly, you know, and again, after that heart-stopping moment where they thought, where's the play?",
        "Right, because the Giants had five wide receivers, Tyree the least of them.",
        "The cameras should've been on the other people, but they had one on him, and it was great.",
