        "And of course, you needed a name for it.",
        "Pete Rozelle, who was the commissioner, said, this would be the AFL-NFL World Championship Game.",
        "On the other hand, a guy named Lamar Hunt from the AFL - you know, these were the guys who signed Joe Namath, and they sort of shot from the hip a little bit - watched his kids playing and they said - and said, so, what is that?",
        "And they said, it's a Super Bowl, Dad.",
        "And he's like, hey, that's a football…",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: But the Roman numerals actually came about - but Pete Rozelle hated the Super Bowl name.",
        "And Lamar Hunt, again - just as kind of tossing a bone to Pete Rozelle - said, well, why don't we - we'll put an Roman numeral after it.",
        "That'll give it a certain level of gravitas.",
        "So - and again, it was a couple of years before the NFL actually just finally gave up and said, hey, OK, we're going to call it the Super Bowl, too.",
        "It wasn't really until Super Bowl - kind of to Super Bowl III was sort of transitional, and by Super Bowl IV, they had just kind of given up that fight.",
        "Here's a couple of quick email questions.",
        "Dan in Georgia - How about the myth that a large number of people who watch will go and use the facilities, and the result is that everyone flushes at one time, the water pressure in major cities drops significantly.",
        "Could we expand the myth by using the drop in water pressure to identify commercials (Laughing) that aren't worthy of watching?",
        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: That is actually really true.",
        "And I would encourage everybody to just wait until after the game, if you want to just - if you want to preserve your local sewage system.",
        "And this question...",
        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: But seriously, folks, the answer to that is actually - it goes back to actually the days of the radio serials, when we had these very primitive, you know, plumbing systems, and you would occasionally have a water main break or sewage break because of that.",
        "And then it got to the point where, again, it just sort of - the myth took on a life of its own, and people would report it and say, you know, there's a water main break.",
        "There was one - a big one in Salt Lake City at a certain point, and they reported it as being a Super Bowl water main break and brought - dredged all this other stuff up without actually talking to the public works guy, who pretty much said, yeah, it was old and it was rusty.",

        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: Oh, thank you so much.",
        "That's - it is Cinco de Mayo.",
        "But the question of course is how much?",
        "Forty-nine point five million pounds of guacamole.",
        "Now - I mean, I don't really have an idea of just how much that is, you know, visually.",
        "Well, actually that would fill a football stadium.",
        "If you make it into guacamole, it will fill a football stadium nine feet deep.",
        "Now, that seems like an awful lot of guacamole.",
        "But the guacamole council or something, they decided that that just didn't seem enough.",
        "So, they actually reconfigured this to figure out how many avocados you could get into the stadium, and it turns out that, once you're factoring in the peels and the pits and the air space and all of that, it's 19 feet worth of avocados that will fill a typical NFL football stadium.",
        "And what...",
        "Mr.",
        "ST. JOHN: So, that's an awful lot of guacamole.",
        "But leaving themselves open to the observation that how do you get that measurement?",

        "Mr.",

        "It was not actually quite a record.",
        "Everybody sort of - they were expecting it to break that magic $100-million mark, and it didn't.",
        "It was actually - you know, it was a kind of average type of year.",
        "And again, which is interesting because there was a really big line against the Giants.",
        "And the other point is that of course they would have actually, you know, lost a lot of money if there had been more that was bet.",

        "On the other hand, and as for the illegal betting - well, of course, nobody really calculates it.",
        "But that said, you know, it goes well beyond of course, you know, just the guy on the corner who's taking a $10 bet.",
        "I mean, there's a huge offshore industry in all of this.",
        "And again, you know, that is a - you know, there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars - possibly into the billions - you know, of money that's bet on the Super Bowl at all levels, illegally or quasi-legally."

        "On the one hand, it was like the Las Vegas casinos had some problems with that.",
        "And then on the other hand, it was like - I think the New England Aquarium was one of the places that ran afoul of it.",
        "And more recently, there have been some church groups that have had issues with this.",
        "And again, you know, it's one of these cases where you can sort of find the silver lining in all of this.",
        "Several of the church groups that sort of ran afoul of this got sort of cease and desist letters from the league and all that.",
        "It never got to the point of actually - of anybody actually suing anybody, but more or less saying, hey, this is what our rule is, and just - and, you know, obviously, you could be subject to legal action if you don't abide by it.",
        "And some - it turns out that actually some of the churches took this as an opportunity, one, to use that publicity in a positive way, and on the other hand, to just do different kinds of Super Bowl parties, something that would be smaller at the congregant's house, something like that.",
        "And in a way, it sort of ended up being - you know, there was a silver lining to the whole situation.",
        "But yeah, the NFL was, I think, a little bit nervous about the sort of - about the negative publicity that they were getting.",
        "I don't think this is something that they were really trying to do, and I don't think they probably even realized just how many church groups there were who, you know, use this as a way to sort of just get people together on Super Bowl Sunday.",
        "So, Brad, what size screen are you going to be watching the game on?",
        "Oh, I'll be setting it up on about a 15-foot screen.",

        "Is the spread this year bigger than it was last year?",
        "Mr.",
        "St. JOHN: I think it's a little bit less than it was last year, but again, the point is that's why they play the game.",
        "And last year was a perfect example, and you could even see this despite the fact that, you know, you didn't have any thought of what was going to be happening in terms of the economy.",
        "There's still this idea that you could see that people were just pulling back a little bit and returning the focus to the game because after all, that's what this is about.",
        "I mean, the fact is, yeah, you have the commercials and you have the halftime and you have Bruce Springsteen and all that, and that's great.",
