        "We are fighting two wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the F-22 has not performed a single mission in either theater.",

        "The plane was designed in the mid-1980s.",
        "Its mission was to assure air dominance over advanced Soviet fighter planes, but the world and warfare have changed.",
        "Now it's not really clear what the F-22 will be used for or fight against.",
        "Most analysts say future wars are much more likely to be so-called low-intensity conflicts like Iraq and Afghanistan.",

        "Winslow Wheeler is an analyst with the Center for Defense Information.",

        "He says the Air Force can't move beyond its Cold War past.",

        "They can't figure out what to do without this airplane and they have not thought their way out of that box.",
        "No more important weapon system in my mind to the United States Air Force and the national security of the United States than the F-22.",
        "Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia has a different view.",
        "America has dominated the airway since the Korean conflict, and if we don't have that air dominance and air superiority, then obviously our troops on the ground become much more vulnerable.",
        "That's one of the arguments made by the Air Force and supporters of the plane.",
        "American military operations are predicated on ruling the skies.",
        "Without that, U.S.",
        "troops could be attacked from the air, something that hasn't happened in more than 50 years.",
        "Press F-22 backers in what might conceivably threaten U.S.",
        "air superiority and they point to advanced missiles and planes made by the Chinese and the Russians.",
        "There is another argument for the F-22.",
        "Again, Senator Chambliss of Georgia, the state where the plane is assembled.",
        "It brings jobs, and it's jobs all across the country, it's not just jobs in my state, but it's jobs all across America from one coast to the other.",
        "One coast to the other is right.",
        "There are more than a thousand contractors and subcontractors working on the F-22 in 44 states, a practice in defense contracting known as political engineering.",
        "Lockheed Martin is the lead contractor making the plane.",
        "Larry Lawson is the general manager of the F-22 program.",
        "There's 25,000 jobs, direct jobs.",
        "These are folks who their full time job is to show up and work on the F-22 program.",
        "And then there's another 70,000 jobs that are collaterally affected by the program.",
        "These are suppliers to our suppliers, people who provide support to factories."

        "And that bubble is something that we call the heliosphere.",
        "Helius, from the Greek for sun and sphere, just the region of influence.",
        "So the heliosphere is the region of influence of our sun.",

        "And at a very great distance about three times farther than the farthest planet, is the edge of this bubble.",
        "And beyond that, is the local part of the galaxy.",
        "The local part of the galaxy is filled with radiation that we call galactic cosmic rays or galactic cosmic radiation.",
        "And basically, this protective bubble formed by the solar wind excludes the vast majority of these galactic cosmic rays.",
        "So yes, it does protect the inner solar system quite a bit from the high-energy radiation outside in the galaxy.",
        "So does that mean if we have a weaker solar wind, more of those potentially harmful rays, would you say that it might be heading in our direction?",
        "That's true.",
        "As the solar wind weakens, the - it's sort of like a tire that's being inflated or a balloon.",
        "If there's less pressure on the inside, the pressure on the outside makes it a smaller - makes the heliosphere smaller and allow some more of those cosmic rays to make their way into the inner heliosphere to the planets and to the region of space that we care the most about.",
        "But we have our own earth's magnetic field that might protect us.",
        "Right.",
        "So we on earth are actually protected two more ways.",
        "We have our own magnetic field, which forms something we call a magnetosphere around the earth, the region of influence that the earth's magnetic field dominates.",
        "And inside of that, we have our own atmosphere, and the galactic cosmic rays are largely stopped in the earth's atmosphere.",
        "So here on earth, we don't really have a problem with galactic cosmic rays, but if we were for example, astronauts on our way to Mars...",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "We wouldn't have any of those protections, and the trip for example to Mars takes many months, and so in that sort of environment it is a concern just exactly how intense the galactic cosmic radiation making it's way into the inner heliosphere actually is."

        "Tremendous international mission launched in October 1990, flew out Jupiter and used the intense gravity of Jupiter to sling it out of this equatorial plane, and go over the poles of the sun.",
        "And what's really important about our observations from Ulysses is, it doesn't just tell us about the solar wind here locally, but it tells us about the solar wind at all latitudes.",

        "There are smaller scale ups and downs to it, but on average, sort of a continuing decrease over those 15 or 16 years, and that's been through the previous minimum of the sun spot in solar-activity cycle through the maximum.",
        "The last maximum of the solar-activity cycle and now through the current minimum of the solar-activity cycle.",
        "So even as the sun's output has varied on solar activity has come and gone, the overall pressure, the overall energy being put out by the sun into the form of solar wind has drop to nearly 25 percent.",

        "Yeah.",

        "No - and no theories about why.",

        "Many of us believe that that's ultimately what provides the energy source that drives the solar wind, but as to why the sun's dynamo would be putting less magnetic flux into the crone eye, and I certainly don't know and I don't know anybody that probably does.",

        "The thing that's interesting about the drop in pressure of the solar wind is it extended not just in the solar minimum face, but actually through the previous solar maximum.",
        "So, while we see the output of solar and the pressure of the solar wind go up and down somewhat over the solar cycle, the larger effect we've been seeing is a sort of a decrease even across the solar cycle for max to min, and so it's something going on in the sun that's changing on a longer time scale than just this 11-year cycle.",
