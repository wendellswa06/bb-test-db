        "Yeah, so that's a great question which of course we can't answer, because we don't have the data.",
        "The sun itself has changed a lot over the centuries and the millennia.",
        "We know that there have been times when solar activity was very, very low, that (unintelligible) minimum several hundred years ago, and even solar maxima had very small numbers of sun spots and that sort of thing.",
        "It was probably a case that the solar wind was weaker then, but it wasn't being measured, so there's really no way to know for sure.",
        "It is the case of course, but all of the solar winds and all of the energy of the solar is driven by the sun, so if the sun is putting out less power into the corona, you know, that will manifest itself as less energy in the solar wind.",
        "Now, we're used to seeing the energy from the sun being invisible.",
        "Sunlight, it heats us up, we see it every day.",
        "Where does the solar wind come from?",
        "So, of course the vast majority of the energy, the sun, is actually invisible light, which heats the earth...",
        "Mm-hm.",
        "And all the things that we're used to.",
        "The energy of the solar wind probably comes from this magnetic file which is produced in the dynamo down inside the sun.",
        "Now the dynamo is this fusion reaction?",
        "(Unintelligible)",
        "No. The dynamo is motion in a conducting material.",
        "In this case it's a plasma...",
        "Mm.",
        "It's a cyanized gas.",
        "And when you have motion in this conducting gas, you basically can generate magnetic fields"

        "Mm-hm.",
        "Which generate magnetic fields.",
        "And I mean, interestingly, I mean, the solar cycle that we see, the direction of the sun's magnetic fields flips over every 11 years.",
        "And so, for 11 years it points south and for 11 years, it points north, and back and forth.",
        "So there's something very interesting going on inside the sun, generating this dynamo.",
        "Mm.",
        "And as that magnetic field is generated, some of it leaks out, and is submitted out into open magnetic field in the corona which then can be converted in to power in the solar wind.",

        "Yeah, that of course is one of the really interesting things about science.",
        "When you start to get data and observations, and start to understanding things better, almost always you find that the problems are harder and deeper than you thought when you started.",

        "As far as the three-dimensional structure of the solar wind and the heliosphere goes, Ulysses has really been unique.",
        "And right now, while there are things that we scientists talk about as possible replacements someday, there's nothing really planned to go into a similar orbit over the poles of the sun.",
        "And I think participation should be determined by some generalized definition of international influence, which means, yes, economy, money, but also military power and willingness to act on the global scene as sort of a responsible shareholder of the larger system.",
        "On the other hand in less than a month, right now scheduled for October 19th, there's going to be a new space probe launched by NASA called the Interstellar Boundary Explorer or IBEX for short, which instead of going and traveling out to this interstellar boundary, it's actually able to make images of the interstellar boundary from the inside looking out.",
        "And it will be the first time that we'll be able to actually see this interaction between the solar wind and the galaxy.",
        "And we'll be able to see that looking all directions in space from an earth orbiting satellite.",
        "It's about where Voyager is now."

        "And so they're making really great measurements, both Voyager One and Voyager Two, but as we were just talking about with the sun, actually the biggest that we've learned from the Voyager One and Two observations is, we didn't understand that nearly as well as we thought we did.",
        "We've mostly taken data which has, you know, caused great surprises and mysteries.",
