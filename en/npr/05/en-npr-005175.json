        "If you look at folks who live over 100 years of age, invariably they have a very, very early stage of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.",
        "So that's why we've kind of started to think about this as aging in the lung.",
        "And in some people, it happens more quickly or more prematurely than in other folks.",
        "Armanios thinks this aging process is related to an enzyme called telomerase.",
        "Telomerase is in every cell in the body and is critical for preventing premature aging.",

        "At least 10 percent of them have defects in telomerase.",
        "Armanios has been working with Carol Greider, who won the Nobel Prize last year for discovering telomerase.",

        "Without having a clue about cause, we don't have a shot.",

        "Concerns about safety, uncertainty about how to handle nuclear waste and the high cost of plant construction all made proposals for new plants seem unlikely.",
