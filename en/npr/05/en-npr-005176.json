        "And by the way, who pays for the costs of - the human health costs?",
        "Most people going to the supermarket, looking to make an affordable, relatively healthy dinner for their families, are not going to be thinking about land values and about global warming at that point.",
        "I mean, can you blame them?",
        "I mean, clearly, what has to happen is people have to eat less meat.",
        "Americans have been convinced of a diet that is frankly unnatural and not what our parents ate, not what our grandparents ate.",
        "I mean, they ate meat.",
        "Americans now eat 150 times as much chicken as they did 80 years ago.",
        "When, you know, factory farms talk about feeding the world, they're not talking about feeding hungry people.",
