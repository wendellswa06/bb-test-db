        "For the next half-century, no piece of economic regulatory legislation was struck down under the Commerce Clause.",
        "In 1995, that streak came to an end when the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned the possession of guns within a thousand feet of a school.",
        "A five-justice majority said that was a bridge too far, because the law did not regulate any economic activity.",
        "A second case of this sort followed five years later.",
        "But in hindsight, neither did much to change the overall deference to Congress on regulating the economy.",
        "Now comes the Obama health-care overhaul, known as the ACA - the Affordable Care Act - a law under full assault by the modern conservative movement.",
        "Some, like Georgetown Law professor Randy Barnett, the architect of the challenge, say openly that they believe many of the New Deal cases were wrongly decided.",
        "They are well-settled precedents, and they're not likely to be revisited in my lifetime.",
        "But I do think that according to the original meaning of the Constitution, they were wrongly decided.",
        "I don't think that the court should simply defer to what Congress wants, especially when the issue is the scope of Congress' own power.",
        "Barnett argues that the health-care law can be struck down without undoing 75 years of judicial precedent.",
        "But his critics, including George Washington law professor Jeff Rosen, contend that's disingenuous; that the goal here is to achieve what has not been achievable even by conservative Republican presidents and Congresses - rolling back major economic regulation.",
        "Let's not pretend that this is a - just modest case of applying existing precedents.",
        "The question is: Are we going to reverse decades of judicial deference in economic matters?",
        "Jeff Shesol is author of a book on the Roosevelt court-packing plan.",
        "That expansive understanding of the Commerce Clause has been the basis of minimum-wage legislation, of workplace safety legislation, of economic protections and in fact, of our civil rights laws.",
        "Nonetheless, Shesol says comparisons to constitutional crises of the 1930s can be overblown.",
        "Roosevelt and his allies really believed that if they could not enact major reforms to deal with the Depression, there would be a total economic collapse that would make the Depression look like a cakewalk.",
        "That the conditions would be paved for the rise of a dictator.",
        "They were watching what was happening in Europe, and they really believed that if they couldn't get these pieces of legislation through the Supreme Court, that the whole thing might come crashing down.",
        "Then, as now, advocates on both sides thought the very survival of democracy was at stake.",
        "Nina Totenberg, NPR News, Washington."

        "According to a U.N.",
        "AIDS office report, roughly 400,000 South Africans are infected with HIV each year.",

        "That's why I'm here.",
        "A local clinic just a few blocks from here is attempting to provide health care, including HIV treatment for Brenda and other sex workers.",
        "The philosophy of the clinic is that to stop the spread of HIV, you can't ignore some members of the community.",
        "Migrant prostitutes may be one of the most marginalized groups in the city, but they have vast sexual networks through which HIV can spread rapidly.",
        "Brenda says she recently went to the clinic for help with a sexually transmitted infection after she'd had a bad experience at a hospital.",
        "Before, I went to a general hospital.",
        "They give me some (unintelligible) tablets and (unintelligible) the infection which I had.",
        "When I went there, they gave me good treatment, and I was fine.",
        "I really appreciate that.",

        "She says they're welcoming to women from the street and don't look down on migrants.",
        "The sex worker clinic is housed on the second floor of a local government health clinic, but it's run by the Reproductive Health and HIV Institute at the University of Witwatersrand.",
        "This is a specialized clinic for sex workers.",
        "Nurse Maria Sibanyoni runs the project.",
        "In short, what you can say is that this is a sex work friendly clinic."

        "The first thing he needed to accomplish with the speech was to address the issue of Reverend Wright head-on.",
        "This is an issue that threaten to kind of hijack his campaign taken into the direction that he didn't particularly want to go, and keep him on the defensive.",
        "You know, in my estimation, but you know, I think he did that - what surprised me was he seemed to do a lot more.",
        "He seemed to turn it into more of an opportunity to start a larger discussion about race.",
        "That, you know - who knows exactly where that leads, but I thought that was a really interesting thing for him to do, and the kind of bold thing for him to do.",
        "Joe, did he meet his objective today?",
        "It's hard to tell, I think the determinant of that is going to be us - could have been the media and how it's covered.",
        "I mean, this was a speech that was delivered at 11 o'clock in the morning, not many people were watching.",
        "And it'll be interesting to see what the sound bites are the night on television.",
        "To my mind, the crucial sound bite may not be one that makes it to air.",
        "He said that he refused to disown Reverend Wright which may make it to air.",
        "But the next thing he said was the most important thing.",
        "He talked about his white grandmother who he loved and who loved him more than anything else in the world and how she would often say things - ethnic things, slurs that were incredible embarrassing to him.",
        "And, I think that, that speaks to almost all of us in white America because all of us had grandmothers like that.",
        "I had two of them.",
        "In making that revelation did he explain his long-standing relationship to Pastor Wright…",
        "I…",

        "I think he did.",
        "Gene?",
        "I think he did too, although, I'm a little unsure about that.",
        "I did a - in an intervening time I've done in Internet chat.",
        "And - well, I thought his explanation about Reverend Wright and the relationship was fairly straightforward and fairly complete.",
        "I was surprised to have a number of people who posted to the discussion, self-identified as white, saying, it wasn't enough for them and they wanted to - they wonder why he didn't, just go ahead and disown the guy.",
        "If - but, you know, it's interesting that it was the grandmother part of the speech that really jumped out at Joe.",
        "What jumped out at me was him later when he was talking about the racial chasm."

        "Gene, I'm not sure this is the exact portion of the speech that we were thinking of.",

        "(Soundbite of political speech)",
        "Finding our particular grievances for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs to the larger aspirations of all Americans, the white woman struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man who's been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family.",
        "Now, when you talk to the Barack Obama campaign, they were quite clear that they were speaking to various audiences and part black Americans who may have wondered or even worried whether he would throw Jeremiah Wright overboard, to white voters who question why he might turn to such a firebrand for spiritual guidance.",
        "Those voters, that second group, white voters - particularly white, working-class voters.",
        "Gene, do you think that message of unity got through?",
        "Well, it seemed to me he was speaking directly to them.",
        "He - there is a part of the speech of which he referred to some really hot-button issues.",
        "When, you know, essentially, when you see a minority who gets an advantage in getting a job or getting into college, when your child is bust across town to a different school, I mean, these are the issues that we fought so bitterly about for so long.",
        "And, you know, to try to kind of, get at those resentments I thought was a kind of audacious thing to attempt.",
        "Joe, beyond the question of race, there's also a question of how his political views might have been shaped during the 20 years of attending Trinity and listening to Jeremiah Wright at the pulpit, for instance, were his views on the Middle East influenced by a pastor who suggested that the problems in the region are rooted in America's blind support for Israel?",
        "Did Barack Obama deal with that today?",
        "Well, he certainly mentioned it and he certainly said unequivocally that he disagreed with Wright about that.",
        "I think that in Obama's case, the deal to indulge in a little dime store psychology here, his dad left when he was 2-years old.",
        "I imagine that he has spent much of his life trying to find a substitute and in many ways, Jeremiah Wright was that substitute, that there's a strong emotional bond there.",
        "Now, if we were to accept your dime store psychology that this - that Jeremiah Wright was somewhat of a father figure for him, that suggests that this has been a very difficult week and this would've been a very difficult speech to get up there and have to explain that relationship.",
        "I would imagine that this was the toughest moment in this campaign for him.",
        "And given that, I think he brought it off very well."
