        "Now that term the Anthropocene was actually coined by a Dutch atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen about five or six years ago.",
        "And what Paul Crutzen thought was that changes to atmospheric chemistry changes in levels of CO2 in the atmosphere for example, changes in pollutants, changes in the way in which we modify the planets had actually built up to such an extent that we were now living in a completely new period of geological time.",
        "So what we have is a record of rocks with generally the oldest rocks at the bottom, and over the years, over the past 200 years or so we've divided packages of time based on rock successions.",

        "Well we examined a range of different parameters, included the biology, the chemistry, and soil of the earth.",
        "And certainly if you look at, say, the amount of sediment being carried across the face of the earth, that is now much greater than in, if you like, the natural pre-Industrial past because of the amount of building we do, the amount of agriculture, and so on.",
        "Then of course changes, we've seen very significant changes in ocean chemistry as we release more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, for example, that's interacting with the surface of the ocean, it's changing the alkalinity of that ocean, pushing it towards more acid conditions, and that's having an effect on the biota, for example, that we see in the ocean.",
        "We may see a broader fundamental change in biodiversity in the not too distant future.",
        "Today's life is really future fossils.",
        "You know, so if, let's say coral reefs are now suffering, partly because of increased temperature, partly because of increased acidity, and if some of these coral reefs die out, then the coral reef rock, which is what we as geologists see, will stop being produced into the geological record that is forming right now."

        "And of course, geologists looking back from the very far future would see that record in the rock record.",
        "I mean you could say that this interval would be characterized by a huge amount of concrete around the planet, for example.",
        "So I think from a geological perspective, this Holocene to Anthropocene Epoch will leave just as distinct a record in the records as any of the previous ones going back into the deep past.",
