        "Welcome to the program, Mr. President.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Now, you have been credited with bringing your country back from an almost unimaginable orgy of killing, a genocide that left 800,000 people dead.",

        "What do you think is the key thing or the key things that have enabled Rwanda to make this kind of comeback?",
        "It's a combination of factors.",
        "I think through the tragedy the country has experienced here, there have been lessons to learn.",
        "In fact, the genocide that took place here in Rwanda was due to bad politics, was due to bad leadership, and if you have a clear path along which you lead the country, and then you develop institutions and allow people to participate in the processes that help develop them, then you will most likely succeed, as we've made progress in Rwanda, even though we started from a very, very complicated situation.",
        "Although, as you know, during this campaign and leading up to your election, there has been a fair amount of criticism about the lack of participation from what would be called opposition groups.",
        "Your critics, including international human rights groups, say that political opposition has been suppressed.",
        "Well, we've had a lot of criticisms indeed, most of which is just very unfair and have no basis.",
        "What we've done (unintelligible) have been successful if there had not been participation of Rwandans.",
        "This kind of progress and the success would not have been achieved.",
        "That is very definite.",
        "President Kagame, many people voted for you in Rwanda because they are very pleased with the prosperity, with the unity.",
        "They remember the genocide.",
        "But getting 90-plus percent of the vote, as you have done in this election, is evidence that there was no serious opposition.",
        "Why would you not at this point be allowing for that sort of opposition to be created in your country?"

        "Well, what then do you say when you hear yourself described of late as an authoritarian leader with a vision, or a benevolent dictator?",
        "I think this is said by a few but very loud mouth people in the circles(ph), and what matters to me and to the people in this country is that -are we making progress?",
