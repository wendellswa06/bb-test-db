        "Senator Lieberman is a strong supporter of the war, he faces a tough challenger from Lamont, a wealthy businessman and political newcomer.",

        "Well you know the polls in a race like this are really hard to depend on, it's a primary election and it's very difficult to do polling in a primary election.",
        "And it's in August on August 8th, which is summertime, and many people will be away vacationing, so it really difficult to try to gage what turnout is likely to be.",
        "So that being said, the latest polls that have come out, have showed Lieberman with about a 10 or 15 point lead over Lamont.",
        "But they also show that the race is tightening.",
        "Any understanding as to why Lieberman would say he would run as Independent?",
        "Doesn't seem to be a strong message of confidence going into the primary.",
        "Right, I think that what is probably happening is the internal polling that the Lieberman camp is doing, is showing that Lieberman has a reasonable chance of losing this particular election.",
        "Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense if he thought you know that he had a very good chance of winning this primary.",
        "It wouldn't make sense for him to come out a few days ago and announce that he is going to seek signatures on a petition to run as an Independent in the event that he loses the Democratic primary.",
        "So that admission a few days ago by Senator Lieberman is a pretty good indication that his own internal polling indicates he's in trouble.",
        "What kind of campaigns are these two candidates running?",
        "Well, Lamont is running a campaign that is focusing on Joe Lieberman and Joe Lieberman's connection to President Bush.",
        "In Connecticut President Bush has a very low approval rating, even much lower than what we see at the national level, national he's about 35-36 percent, in Connecticut he's about 25 percent.",
        "So, he is a very unpopular president and the Lamont campaign is running a set of ads and a campaign which is really tying Joe Lieberman to President Bush.",
        "That's fairly easy for Lamont to do, given the high profile issue of Lieberman's support for Bush's war policy in Iraq."

        "He's really as liberal as most Democrats in the senate in terms of his actual voting record.",
        "The problem with Lieberman, is he's stuck his neck out on a very high profile issue which many Democrats are angry about, mainly his support for Bush war policy.",

        "They haven't seen him shoot off the cuff, they haven't seen him next to Joe Lieberman, making arguments about public policy.",
        "So, I think tonight's debate is the introduction of Ned Lamont to many voters in Connecticut.",
        "So I think the way Lamont gets defined in tonight's debate and the way Lieberman tries to define him, will be very important.",
        "Right now, I think voters are viewing this election as a referendum on Joe Lieberman.",
        "And that does not work to Lieberman's advantage in a Democratic primary.",
        "Democrats around the country are watching this race, certainly will be watching the debate tonight, and war seems to be the big issue when looked at from the outside - this race isn't seen Nationally as a referendum on the war.",
        "Is the war the biggest issue, there in Connecticut?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "If it wasn't for Lieberman's support for the Bush war policy, it would be unlikely that Lieberman would have any competition at all for the Democratic nomination.",

        "I bet, embolden them.",
        "Absolutely, it will embolden them.",
        "The fact that this race now has a national profile, I think the outcome of the race, if Lamont is the winner, will give the Democrats a whole lot of ammunition to say, look, we're united."
