        "That's Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman of the University of California, San Francisco.",
        "She led that study.",
        "It finds that half the patients getting the most common CT scans to check for cancer, heart disease, strokes, blood clots in the lungs and so on are getting more radiation than they should, sometimes much more.",
        "Also, radiation doses varied enormously from one hospital to another and even within the same hospital for images of the same body part.",
        "Smith-Bindman says patients are getting so many scans because they expect their doctors to order them.",
        "Some people have even gotten whole body CT scans at malls just to make sure they don't have any health problems.",
        "Patients definitely want imaging.",
        "They're entitled to imaging.",
        "And they don't appreciate that imaging, in fact, comes with this potential harm.",
        "But there's no doubt that doctors are mainly responsible for this skyrocketing popularity of CT scans.",
        "Dr. James Thrall is chairman of the American College of Radiology.",
        "He says there's a definite wow factor from CT scanning.",
        "It's a like a virtual tour of the patients' insides.",
        "Many of us sort of became hooked on ever better image quality before we came to the realization, the epiphany that it was the diagnosis that was important and not the quality of the image.",
        "Thrall says at his institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors who order a CT scan must list the reason.",
        "A computer program gives it a score, a low score indicates the test is probably unnecessary.",
        "Our experience over the past five years has been rather phenomenal.",
        "Before we instituted the system, the annual growth rate for CT scanning was 12 percent, a remarkable number.",
        "After we instituted a system, that dropped to one percent.",
        "Which is less than the growth in the hospital's patient load.",
        "In other words, now there are fewer scans for patient.",
        "Thrall thinks the claim that CT scans will cause 29,000 extra cancers a year is overstated.",
        "But whatever the number, he says...",
        "There are opportunities for us in the field of radiology to do all the good things we do using less radiation.",

        "All the carnitine that we need we make from our - not from our diet, but we just make it on our own.",
        "And it plays an essential role in energy metabolism.",
        "It helps to take fatty acids into something called the mitochondria, which is the powerhouse of the cell, and burn fatty acids as fuel.",
        "And while the carnitine is not an essential nutrient, that means that we don't need to have it in our diet.",
        "We actually synthesize all the carnitine that we need from protein, and that protein can be either from plant or animal.",
        "So even vegetarians or vegans make all the carnitine that they need from their diet.",
        "And so what's the problem about getting a little bit extra?",
        "Well, what our studies show is that in our digestive tract, we have many, many bugs, microbes.",
        "They can digest carnitine; we can't.",
        "We get no calories from carnitine, but the bugs do.",
        "A byproduct that the microbes make gets released and converted in our bodies and then detected in the blood into a compound that actually helps promote clogging of the arteries or cholesterol deposition in the artery wall.",
        "It does this by actually changing our metabolism of cholesterol.",
        "So this is not independent of cholesterol.",
        "It actually works through cholesterol.",
        "It changes how our body senses cholesterol and metabolizes cholesterol at the artery wall, in the liver and in the intestines.",
        "So let me see if I get this - have this straight.",
        "So we eat red meat, it has carnitine it.",
        "Microbes in our body break it down, produce another compound, and that's TMAO, is that right?",
        "That's TMA.",
        "That then is actually a gas, believe it or not, at body temperature.",
        "It smells like rotting fish, but we don't smell like rotting fish when we eat meat.",
        "That's because it goes straight to the liver through the portal circulation, and there's a cluster of enzymes in the liver that get rid of that compound and turn it into something called TMAO."

        "If you gave them antibiotics to suppress their intestinal flora, they no longer made the TMAO, they no longer got accelerate atherosclerosis.",
        "If you give the downstream metabolite, TMAO, you get accelerated atherosclerosis.",
        "And then in humans, we went ahead and measured this metabolite of the carnitine, TMAO, and were able to show that blood levels of this metabolite very strongly predict future risks for heart attack, stroke and death.",
        "And - but not everybody produces this same amount when they're given the same meal, right?",
        "That was actually some of the more surprising finding of the study.",
        "When we look at the metabolism of carnitine, and we compared omnivores as compared to vegetarian or vegans, we saw strikingly different results.",
        "The omnivore, that is the individual who eats both animal products, meat, as well as vegetables, they actually metabolized carnitine very readily and formed TMAO that was detected in the blood.",
        "In contrast, the longstanding vegetarian or vegan, and to be enrolled in our study, the subjects had to claim that they had had no animal or no meat product within the last year.",
        "So they were longstanding vegetarian or vegan.",
        "When they ingested carnitine, they made virtually no TMAO.",
        "And we then subsequently analyzed the microbes in the feces, in the stool, and could show that the composition of the microbes in the - from the gut in the omnivore were very different from what we found in the vegetarian or vegan, and the types of microbes that actually were involved in breaking down carnitine were not found as much in the vegetarian or vegan and were abundant in the omnivore.",
        "So you think that if you eat a lot of meat, you've sort of grown a different microbial community that's better adapted or different species that will actually break down the carnitine more efficiently than the other - than if you just eat vegetables?",
        "How you said it is exactly correct.",
        "And in fact to test that, what we actually looked at was we took animals we were on a normal chow diet, which is rather vegetarian, and then added carnitine to it and then compared the capacity to make TMAO in the normal chow versus carnitine-supplemented animals, as well as looked at the microbial composition.",
        "And what we - in their stool or in their secum, that's a portion of their gut.",
        "And what we found is that the animals that were on the chronic carnitine-containing diet, they made over 10- to 100-fold more TMAO from a carnitine bolus that was given into their stomach compared to the animals that were on the normal chow diet.",
        "So they made more of the compound that tracks with cardiovascular risk if they'd been eating meat?"

        "So carnitine was discovered over 100 years ago, and the chemists who discovered it called it carnitine because it was found in animal products, things made of flesh.",

        "Our studies showed that if you cut out all red meat, all meat, and became vegetarian or vegan, after a long time you would actually - that's a sure-fire way to be able to make virtually no TMAO from carnitine because every longstanding vegetarian or vegan who we looked at, who was not on any kind of supplements or anything and was just a longstanding vegetarian, they did not generate TMAO.",
        "Now on the other hand, what we don't know is if you are an omnivore, and you switch to a vegetarian diet, how long before you start seeing this change occur.",
        "We know that it's going to be longer than a week, but we don't know if it's actually going to be - it's somewhere between a week and a year.",
