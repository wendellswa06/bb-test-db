        "Well, you know, that's the far-end projection.",
        "Where we are today already is quite stunning.",
        "You mentioned Watson.",
        "What people don't often realize is that Watson didn't get its knowledge by being programmed fact by fact in some computer language, like LISP.",
        "It actually read Wikipedia and several other encyclopedias and is able to deal with the ambiguities and subtleties and vagaries of human language.",
        "And very soon, search engines will be able to read for content and meaning, all these billions of webpages and other documents, and they're going to get more and more intelligent.",

        "Technology is getting smaller and smaller.",
        "That's another exponential trend.",
        "They will ultimately be small enough to go on our bloodstream, and we'll be able to noninvasively introduce computation augmenting our immune system to make us healthier and going into our brain and providing gateways from the brain to the cloud, just as your phone is actually a gateway to the cloud, and we'll be able to do that directly from our brains.",
        "To access the information that's in our brains - and you're right, there is information there.",
        "Our memories, our skills, our personality is represented by these patterns in each of these 300 million modules, by the connections between them that we create with our own thoughts.",
        "And that information is not backed up today, and it's real information.",
        "It's not just a metaphor.",
        "We will be able to capture that.",
        "That's more like a 2040s scenario, so that's not very soon, but that is where we're headed.",
        "Well, what are we going to take - what kind of breakthrough in technology will we need by 2040 to be able to make that happen?",
        "Well, we'll need the ongoing shrinking of technology.",
        "So this computer I'm holding in my hand, which is my cellphone, is 100,000 times smaller than the computer I used as a student.",
        "We're shrinking technology at a rate of 100 in 3-D volume per decade.",
        "So go out to the 2030s, certainly by the 2040s, these very powerful computerized devices will be the size of blood cells, and there will be many applications, as I said, to augment your immune system and to go inside the brain.",

        "It's pea size.",
        "It's pretty small, but it does require surgery.",
        "So we need a shrinking of technology, and we also need better models and better emulation of how the brain works.",
        "And I talk about where we're - the current status of that, which is actually much further along than people realize.",

        "There's about 300 million of them.",
        "They're about 100 neurons each.",
        "And the connections and the structure within each module doesn't change, but the connection between the modules is completely plastic, and we create that with our own thoughts.",
        "Now, each of these modules can recognize a pattern, and it gets its input from other modules so they're organizing the hierarchy.",
        "So, for example, I have a bunch of pattern recognizers that recognize the crossbar in a capital A.",
        "And they've learned to do that.",
        "I wasn't born with that, but I learned that in my life.",

        "In the region of my auditory cortex, pattern recognizer might go, oh, somebody just said the word apple.",
        "Go up another 10 levels and it's getting - it's now at a high level of the hierarchy to get input from different senses and might see a certain fabric, smell a certain perfume, hear certain voice and go, aha, my wife just entered the room.",
        "Go up to the highest level, and you have pattern recognizers that go that's funny.",
        "You know, that's ironic.",

        "I talk about on the book this surgery with a girl, brain surgery, and she was conscious, which you can be because there's no pain receptors in the brain.",
        "And whenever the surgeons triggered a particular spot, she would laugh.",
        "And they thought they were triggering some laugh reflex, but they quickly realize they're actually triggering the perception of humor.",
        "She just found everything hilarious whenever they triggered this spot.",
        "You guys are so funny just standing there, was a typical comment, and they weren't funny.",
        "So they had found a spot, and she obviously has more than one.",
        "But they found one that, you know, represented the perception of humor.",
        "And these pattern - you might think that those pattern recognizers must be much more sophisticated than the one that recognizes, let's say, a crossbar in a capital A.",
        "They're actually the same, except that these high-level ones exist at the top of this hierarchy.",
        "And we build that hierarchy ourselves, and we build one level of it at a time.",
        "So I've got a one-year-old grandson and he has successfully laid down several levels of this hierarchy.",
        "And we can see babies and children and adults learning, well, sort of, one conceptual level at a time.",
        "One thing is that we fill that up, those 300 million pattern recognizers by the time we're 20.",
        "And so to learn new things, we have to actually learn the art of forgetting.",
        "Part of that is just to get rid of redundancy.",
        "I mean, I - you start out with thousands of recognizers that might recognize a crossbar on a capital A.",
        "You don't need that many, so you can give up some of the redundancy to learn new material.",

        "I just wonder if there's anything beyond that explanation because it seems like that's just kind of a label and, you know, how - as far as our science, you know, there doesn't seem to be any real explanation on how consciousness (unintelligible)...",
