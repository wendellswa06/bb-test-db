        "And I sat down, and I described in the column, sitting down with a cup of tea at my elbow and just being ready, ready to plunge in, and I found my attention kind of wandering.",
        "And it just didn't seem quite as crisp and on target as some of her earlier work had been.",

        "Less a matter of length maybe than in our willingness to capitulate to a narrative, to give ourselves over to the story, and sometimes that's not the book's fault.",
        "Sometimes it's where we are.",
        "I think a lot of people told tales about where they were in their life when they tried to read a certain book and it was as much a function of who we are as what the book is.",
