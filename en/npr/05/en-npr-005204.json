        "But a week ago after his victories in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri, Rick Santorum had opened up a lead in Michigan as well and so a lot of people were saying here we go again.",

        "A win, win?",
        "A win is a win is a win, although if the name of the game is 1,144 delegates, Mitt Romney may not have gotten the most delegates out of Michigan.",
        "Right now they allocate delegates in Michigan by congressional district.",
        "Right now, of the delegates that have been counted, Rick Santorum has 13 delegates, Mitt Romney has 13 delegates, but in the two congressional districts that haven't submitted their totals yet, Rick Santorum is leading in both of them.",
        "So Rick Santorum could come out of Michigan with the lead in delegates but, again, the headline is that Romney wins both.",

        "What's with Santorum urging Democrats to vote in Michigan?",
        "Well, both parties have done it before.",
        "I remember, I think it was Karl Rove who talked about it – and this didn't begin with Karl Rove, but in 2000 he was saying that maybe Republicans could cause some mischief by voting in the Democratic primary and either trying to sabotage Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama or whatever.",

        "He was the first Catholic elected in 1960.",
        "Al Smith had run as a Catholic in 1928.",
        "But being a Catholic is almost like what being a Mormon is in 2012.",
        "They were looked on suspiciously.",
        "And Kennedy basically gave that speech, not to say that people of faith should not be involved in the public discourse, but that, you know, there should be no preference of religion, and, you know, religion should not be the defining part of a candidate."
