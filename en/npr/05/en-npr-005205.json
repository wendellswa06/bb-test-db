        "But, you know, I think that one thing that happens is as you're watching debates, if you see candidates who are not being responsive or who are so obviously evasive that that backfires, because people are waiting for the answer.",

        "You know, I question whether it does backfire, and I'll say why in a moment.",

        "I wonder if they do because they do it again and again and again.",

        "So for him, that was actually pretty responsive.",
        "But yeah, you know, look, politicians are almost - you know, that's their sort of reflex position is to try to bob and weave and evade the question.",

        "Kennedy and Richard Nixon, there was not a single reference to Vietnam in any of those debates, and of course that became kind of the defining issue of the 1960s.",
        "Similarly in 2000, when Bush and Gore debated, nobody was talking about terrorist attacks or threats from the Middle East or that sort of thing.",
        "What debates do tell you is a little bit about the character and the personalities of the people running for office.",
        "They're pretty good indicators of that sort of - those sorts of personal characteristics, better indicators of that, I think, than policy positions.",
        "Ken Rudin, do you agree with that, that debates actually do tell us something about who the guys are?",
        "I do, and I think that that was part of the reason why a lot of people felt that for all - if you take a look at the debates in 2000 between Al Gore, Vice President Al Gore and George W.",
        "Bush, people felt that George W.",
        "Bush was more likable, the kind of guy you wanted to have a beer with.",

        "Does that bother you as somebody who follows this?",

        "That's a pretty unusual tactic for any politician to take in a live debate, though.",
        "When you talk of out of the mainstream or a kind of different kind of candidate, I always think of Herman Cain, and for the longest time, he was getting away with - in my view, he was getting away with that, to me, simplistic 9-9-9 economic plan.",

        "So, you know, it's nice to have tag lines, it's nice to have comfortable things you can fall back on, but you realize that the candidates don't really know what they're talking about.",
        "That comes through in debates, as well.",
        "Matthew, thank you...",
        "I think that's right, Ken, and I think that Herman Cain is a classic example of one of the dangers of debates, which is that the format, you know, involves such short little parcels of time, especially when you - early on when you've got the eight or nine people on the stage, that you can get away with soundbites, and you can get away with real cursory, superficial answers simply by virtue of the clock.",
