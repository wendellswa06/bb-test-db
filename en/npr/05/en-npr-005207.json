        "...I finally listened to the whole thing on CD, borrowed from the library while driving in the car.",
        "And I finished it.",
        "And I was so pleased that I did, because, you know, I always had, actually, wanted to read, you know, finish it in some way, and that book, actually, works on CD maybe because it's kind of written in a sort of a vernacular kind of American language to begin with.",
        "Yeah.",

        "But for some reason, \"\"East of Eden\"\" was the one for me.",
        "Well, her point about listening to the book instead of reading it is also an interesting one, because I happen to listen to a lot of books on tape and I was on a kick of, sort of, American classics I had never made it to for a while, and I actually turned off \"\"The Last of the Mohicans.\"\" It's the only time I've turned off an audio book.",
