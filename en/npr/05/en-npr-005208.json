        "So what are you proposing?",
        "Because the government would argue that the court is a secret because the information it is dealing with is highly sensitive, highly classified information.",

        "Well, I think there are ways that we can work around that.",

        "She may technically be in breach.",

        "And the problem here for the National Restaurant Association or Herman Cain is there are going to be no damages.",
        "He's already been out there talking about it.",
        "So I think the restaurant association is going to be hard pressed to show that there's any damage from any of these women coming out and talking about it at this point.",

        "All right.",
        "Stepping outside these cases, if someone, just out of the blue, violated their confidentiality agreement and said the details of whatever it was that was involved, what recourse does the company have?",
        "Well, the company - there are a couple of things.",
        "It's essentially a breach of contract.",
        "So the company can come after the person for a breach of contract.",

        "And some of these agreements contain what is called the liquidated damages provision whereby the parties agree ahead of time what the damage might be.",
        "So if somebody is paid a year's salary walking out the door and they breach, there may be something in the agreement that says you have to pay back all of that money if you breach.",
        "We're agreeing ahead of time that that is our monetary damage.",

        "But in order to get the money that we were owed, we had to sign a confidentiality agreement, which I really didn't think was fair.",

        "And if you didn't think it was fair, Teri, why did you sign it?",
