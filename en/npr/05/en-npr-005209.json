        "Right.",
        "And probably, the important part to the company was the release of claims.",
        "And oftentimes, these confidentiality agreements come within a larger legal agreement that includes a release of claims, the confidentiality agreement, non-disparagement, things of that nature.",

        "But it's going to cost you a bundle.",
        "Sure.",
        "And, you know, that goes both ways, however.",
        "There's always a risk for a company going forward because they have to pay a lot of money to defend a claim, and they're always at risk for a larger judgment down the road.",
        "So there's risk on both sides.",
        "And one of the reasons or the primary that people will settle early is to avoid that risk and to come to an agreement where everybody takes a little less or pays a little bit more than they wanted to.",

        "But I was surprised at how in-depth the confidentiality agreement went in, asked some questions about their experiences of eating disorders.",
        "And this was before HIPAA.",
        "So I think they were trying to cover as many legal things that the university will want to since it was asking about medical conditions and such.",
        "But weren't those individuals identified just by initials or number code or something so you wouldn't know who they were?",
        "The concern was with that, and we kind of set up a novel way of handing out the measures, was that if a student signed up for it and then maybe they were in a class with me and they saw me, the fact that they knew that I might be measuring these later on, even though it's an anonymous number, might affect their results.",
        "I see.",
        "I see.",
        "All right.",
        "So I basically sat in a room and through like a little - like a window thing, they would just come up and I would give them the measurements.",
        "So they didn't really know who I was except somebody behind a, you know, a shaded, painted of glass.",
        "And they would drop them off in a drop box in the room, all confidential, but it was interesting.",
        "Before HIPAA, there were lots of things about the medical information and how I couldn't just discuss it, you know, in any context except with my research with the PhD student.",
        "All right.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, that could happen even while you're an employee.",
        "And he raises a good point in the sense that it's akin to a trade secret agreement or a confidentiality agreement that you sign when you're a existing employee to protect sensitive information or trade secrets.",
        "So those types of agreements can be part of an employment agreement that you sign when you start a job and follow you throughout your employment.",
        "And we've been talking pragmatics, a philosophical question to end with.",

        "Well, I think that, you know, many would argue that we shouldn't be able to have confidentiality, that people should be able to talk about these issues.",

        "That's right.",
        "When Mexican law enforcement officials stumbled upon this huge, staggering amount of cash, $207 million that they assembled into what looked like a bed - it was actually a stunning image - his reaction was to say that this was money that Mexican politicians had asked him to store under threat and that it was money that may have been used to alter the outcome of last year's contested political race.",
        "And Ernesto, you write that he is actually now kind of launched this PR campaign here in the U.S.",
        "Tell us a bit about that.",

        "He has done so frequently.",

        "Earlier this month he sat down with the Associated Press in New York for an interview and his lawyers held a press conference in Washington, D.C., at the National Press Club, during which they outlined his defense.",
        "It's not the most logical explanation I've heard, but you know, what's striking is it's a pretty detailed and thorough defense that comes even before he was charged here.",
        "So you know, a lot of thought went into this.",
        "What's remarkable about this story is it starts off almost like this Hollywood movie, like \"\"Scarface\"\" or something, and then it comes to an ending at a Chinese restaurant in a mall in Maryland.",
