        "And I think that this kind of cacophony of dietary advice has really thrown us off our game, and add to that the fact that in America, we've never had a very strong food culture, the way the French or the Italians do, that really steadies people's eating habits."

        "And, in fact, working with a biologist on campus, we did some experiments.",
        "And if you take a little clip of your hair or fingernail and run it through a mass spectrometer, corn has a very distinctive signature.",
