        "It's a hell of a lot of corn.",
        "So we're paying for the overproduction of corn.",

        "And so there's a real push on to subsidize the production of ethanol.",
        "The problem with ethanol that people don't notice, ethanol made from corn, is that it takes a lot of fossil fuel to distil the corn into the ethanol.",

        "Yeah, well, you know, growing corn with all this fossil fuel fertilizer, farmers use way too much of it, more than their fields can absorb because it's fairly cheap.",

        "Half of the nitrogen now in circulation was fixed by this new technology.",
        "And so we're fertilizing some species, corn being one, algae being another, and all that nitrogen runs into the Gulf and you get these algae blooms that starves the water of oxygen and you end up with, you know, what is essentially a Bermuda triangle within the Gulf of Mexico where fish cannot live anymore, a dead zone the size of New Jersey."

        "And if the price of corn were higher, and it could be that if we changed our agricultural policies, it would make sense to keep the animals around.",
