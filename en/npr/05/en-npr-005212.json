        "And I think the happiest thing I learned in the course of doing this book, which goes way beyond the food system to our whole understanding of the human relationship to nature.",
        "Is, I went to this farm called Polyphus Farm in Virginia, in Swope, Virginia.",
        "And it's a very subtle, complicated farm were six different animals were grown in a very careful rotation, such that the waste of one becomes the food of another.",
        "And they keep taking turns in these pastures.",
        "And basically, to give you a very quick illustration of what he does, the cattle are intensively grazed and they're moved every day.",
        "Then he waits three days and he brings in something called the chicken mobile, which is a portable henhouse.",
        "And the chickens fan out and what they do is they eat the grubs, the larvae in the manure, which is their favorite source of protein.",
        "And in the process of digging those grubs out, they spread the manure around the farm, and they also, the reason he waits three days to move them is so that the grubs can grow large and fat --",
        "Juicy.",
        "Really juicy.",
        "But if he waited five days they'd hatch, you see, and he'd have a fly problem.",
        "So he's actually growing larvae to feed his chickens.",
        "And because they eat the larvae, there's no fly problem, so he doesn't need chemicals to keep the flies off his cows.",
        "They also, the chickens copiously fertilize this pasture with their manure.",
        "At the end of a year, and then the pigs come in, and there's a whole, kind of rotation of other animals, but at the end of a year, this pasture has more topsoil than it did at the beginning of the year, more fertility and more biodiversity in the soil.",
        "At the same time, we have taken off this immense amount of food, of chickens and eggs, and pork and beef.",
        "You know, we usually think that for us to get what we want from nature, nature is diminished.",
        "It's a zero sum game and we subtract.",
        "Well, what this shows you is there really is a free lunch in nature.",
        "And, because, if you're getting all this food and you're actually improving the land at the same time, that's a whole new paradigm to think about your relationship to nature, and it's the most hopeful thing I've seen in the whole environmental area for a long time.",
        "There is a way --",
        "He can make a living at this?",
        "Yeah, and he makes a terrific living.",
        "He does a lot better than the corn farmers who are depending on government subsidies to survive or the job of their wives in town.",
        "This farm produces, it's on only 500 acres, just 100 of which are open, the rest is forest.",
        "It supports two white collar salaries and the salaries of two helpers as well.",
        "He's one of the most successful farmers in the country.",
        "Because I guess, I understand from the time that you spent with these farmers who were on their tractors plowing fields of corn all day that they're not very happy about it either."

        "They used to have 14 crops, now they only have these two.",
        "And those corn and soybeans are not edible.",

        "I think on the subject of nutrition.",

        "The, you know, there was recently this women's health initiative that suggested that, oh, low-fat diets may not help with cancer and cardiovascular disease, and suddenly, certain people saw that headline, and I have to say it was really overplayed, the headlines and the studies didn't actually go together that well, and suddenly people were like, oh, it doesn't even matter.",
        "I might as well go back to my high-fat diet.",
        "You know, if you looked more closely, you realize the women in that study were actually not telling the truth about what they were eating, because they claimed to be eating 1500 calories a day, and to weigh 180 pounds, and I have to tell you, if they were really eating that little, they would not be weighing 180 pounds.",
        "So a lot of these nutrition studies are just faulty to begin with."
