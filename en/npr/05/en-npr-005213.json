        "But historians at Smithsonian Magazine say this simple puzzle was administered to immigrants on Ellis Island in the early 1900s, and the goal was to weed out the feeble-minded and make sure a better class of foreign-born people were ushered into citizenship.",

        "Can you describe what it looks like?",
        "Sure.",
        "It's kind of like a smushed up Mr. Potato Head made out of thin wood, seven pieces - an eye, a nose, a mouth and then an ear that's broken up into four separate pieces.",
        "And you have to assemble all these different parts.",
        "And you said it wasn't so easy, but you even were able to do it without having just come across the ocean in steerage.",
        "You speak English.",
        "So you can imagine for somewhat traumatized immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island what this puzzle might have meant.",
        "And you write that this sprung out of an idealistic policy that was supposed to be fair.",
        "How did the inventor of this puzzle, a doctor named Howard Knox, believe it would work?",
        "There were good aspects to this and bad.",
        "Yet the good aspects were that prior to this, they had actually been doing IQ tests of immigrants and that was difficult because it required some facility either with English or with literacy in general, familiarity with answering direct questions and so forth.",
        "So yeah, this was, in some ways, a progressive reform - the idea that this would be a puzzle that no matter where you were born in the world, where you came from, people generally had the idea of what a face looked like.",
        "So it had a kind of democratic impulse behind it.",
        "Meanwhile, the context for all of this is the eugenics movement, right?",
        "You talk about how this actually informed American immigration policy at that time - in what ways?",
        "Well, so eugenics was the idea - eu genes a, from the Greek, a good birth - trying to use birth and selection of who reproduced to make a better human race.",
        "This was really the rage in the 1910s and 1920s.",
        "It was in magazines and newspapers.",
        "And states around the country were passing eugenic sterilization laws - forcible sterilization of people who were deemed to be unfit."
