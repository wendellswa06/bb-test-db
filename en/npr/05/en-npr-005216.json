        "Yeah.",
        "They look like these big, cushioned rubber and plastic orthopedic Birkenstocks with Velcro straps, and you strap them on top of your existing shoes.",

        "Yeah.",

        "Well, the shoe sandals will sell for about $335 when they go on the market.",
        "That's in August.",
        "And you can walk totally normal in them, and it gives you an extra kind of layer of protection and then also height.",
        "Right, height - no, thank you - pass.",
