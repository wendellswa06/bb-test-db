        "The builders of the Moscow subway had help at the beginning from engineers who'd worked on the London subway, but Stalin worried that they were learning too much about the layout of the city, so he had them tried for spying and deported.",
        "The construction of the metro was a major priority for Stalin, who saw it as a way to demonstrate the superiority of socialism over the capitalist world which was deep in the Great Depression.",
        "He put one of his best managers in charge of the project, Lazar Kaganovich, known for his ruthlessness as the Iron Commissar.",
        "It's one of the highest-profile showcased constructions of the forced industrialization of Stalin's five-year plan.",
        "Stephen Kotkin is a historian at Princeton and a fellow at the Hoover Institution.",
        "And Kaganovich has a high profile in this because it's got to get done, and they need it to be a success; that is, the metro's got to work.",
        "The thousands of workers who dug the first subway and the tens of thousands who built massive steel plants and tractor factories needed to be fit, and the Soviets needed hard currency to buy foreign-built machinery for their new industries.",
        "That meant taking the Soviet Union's grain harvest from the farming regions and leaving the people on the farms to starve.",
        "Kaganovich, like Stalin, bears direct responsibility for the famine.",
        "Probably five to seven million people died from the famine across the Soviet Union.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOSCOW METRO)",
        "That first section of the metro ran about seven miles and had 13 stations.",
        "Today, it's a little over 200 miles with almost 200 stops.",
        "The system is justly famous for the elaborate decoration of its stations, many of them designed by the leading Soviet architects.",
        "Again, Airat Bagautdinov.",
        "So there's a story that one of the architects brought his designs to Kaganovich, and Kaganovich said that this station looks too similar to one of the Egyptian palaces.",
        "And then the architect, his name was Lushkin, he said that they used to build palaces for pharaohs; we are going to build palaces for the people.",
        "Talk me through that because campaigns are grueling for everyone..."
