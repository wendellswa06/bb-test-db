        "We sort of knew where the trend was going.",
        "In fact, we have the AIDS Southern Coalition and we've, you know, have been fighting for more funding because of the numbers of cases we have in the South.",
        "And because of that lack of funding - and I assume access to health care is also a factor?",
        "It is.",
        "We have some things in place, but it's never enough.",
        "And one of our biggest challenges is transportation.",
        "In the rural, and I'm talking about really rural areas of the state where in - we are located in southeast Alabama, but it's the same except for in larger cities such as Birmingham, Mobile and Montgomery.",
        "There is no public transportation for people to, you know, call a cab or catch a bus to their appointment.",
        "And that obviously - all of that seems to then, well, snowball.",
        "I mean, one factor leads to another leads to another.",
        "That's correct.",

        "As far as appointments, if they can get in, if they can afford to see a private physician, then that helps because when you're at a private doctor's office, nobody is going to know why you are there.",
