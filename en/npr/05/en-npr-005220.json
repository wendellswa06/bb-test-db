        "One of the things that was a perception that we had years ago was that it had a lot to do with how much sex you had.",
        "It's really much more who you have sex with.",
        "Because if you have a lot of unprotected sex with people who are not HIV-infected, you'll never get HIV.",

        "And so - and we know that it's really important to learn about your HIV status as early as possible.",

        "It's not how much sex you have, it's who you have sex with.",
        "And in the United States, the epidemic is primarily spread sexually through men who have sex with men, and either from those men to women or from those men to other men.",
        "And a small - and a decreasing amount of the disease is spread by intravenous drug use, although it's still a very important route of spread.",

        "We don't want to let - tell people that they don't need to be tested, they don't need to worry about this disease or any other disease.",
        "They need to worry about HIV as well as all the other sexually transmitted infections.",
        "But they don't need to have the fear that's associated with it.",
        "I think that in addition to stigma, the reluctance to test is also fear, and that's what I find in most of the young people I see because the question is what happens if I do have it?",
        "Then I'm going to die and I don't want to know I'm going to die.",
        "That's a very important message we haven't really gotten out there because the treatment of HIV today is very different than it was even five years ago.",
