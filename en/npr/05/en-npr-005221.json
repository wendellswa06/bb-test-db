        "The three fishermen wrote their names on a piece of paper, and that paper was faxed from the ship - from the tuna ship to the home base of the ship on the Marshall Islands in the port of Majuro.",
        "And that was the way in which the world sort of learned the identify of these men, and the word eventually got back to Mexico that they were alive.",
