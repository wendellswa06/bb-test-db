        "One of their grandparents said that they had taken a supply of lemons with them on board, which I guess helped them fight off scurvy, among other things.",

        "Yes, and they apparently had all the equipment that, you know -their boat almost sank a couple of times, but otherwise the ship was fine.",
        "Well speaking of equipment, why didn't they have any equipment that would signal where they were back home or anything, any modern equipment that could help them out?",
        "Well, many of the fishermen now have cell phones - and cell phones are so cheap to get - and they can call, you know, within 20 or 30 miles of the coastline if they have a problem.",
        "But these guys apparently are all in their early 20s, without much money, trying to make a little bit extra.",
        "They just really didn't have any equipment whatsoever other than their two outboard motors and their sort of guile, which allowed them to survive.",
        "Many of the stations have representations of idealized Soviet people - soldiers, sailors, brawny industrial workers and, ironically, muscular collective farm women holding heavy sheaves of grain.",

        "That's been the subject of a long-running lawsuit brought by House Republicans.",
