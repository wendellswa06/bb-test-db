        "And you write the best poems, like the best meals, are made from scratch.",
        "Yeah, I think so.",

        "And so there's this common link, I think.",
        "There's also this desire in the poem to understand the common table, the place where we all share and are all equal before.",
        "And I think that is very much central to, both the book, but also this thinking about food and its meaning and its pleasures.",

        "So, he ate the day, which almost seems what a poet does.",
        "Yeah, every day is another meal.",
        "And there's a part in the introduction where I talk about how poets certainly love to eat, and some would say drink.",
        "And one of the things I think they enjoy about a great meal is that it goes away.",
        "You make a terrific meal for friends or family, and if you succeed it's gone.",
        "And there's this pleasure in that, because it's exactly the opposite of writing a poem or writing anything.",
        "You are struggling and struggling and finishing means it's permanent or at least feels that way.",
        "And, of course, there's the almost opposite, which is the quality of just a quick hit, like a pop in the mouth.",

        "And what they want to do is kind of turn the screws a little bit more on the economy.",
        "But it is also true that some of those sanctions and some of those penalties that they've put on the Iranian economy have not been in effect for so long.",
        "When they pulled out - when they reinstated the sanctions, that has been only about a year.",

        "ORDOÑEZ: Absolutely.",
        "It has been just a few days, and that is why the president cannot not do anything.",
        "And not only are some leaders, some members of Congress, some officials saying that you cannot not do anything because it could embolden Iran to take action, to put not only U.S.",
