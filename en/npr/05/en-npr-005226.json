        "Yeah.",
        "You guys laid it out pretty well.",
        "You know, this limits greenhouse gas emissions and begins charging polluters for every ton they emit.",
        "But what Republicans are arguing is that it's going to be very detrimental to their rural districts, so they cite things like rising fuel costs or a rise just in the cost of doing business by virtue of paying for greenhouse gas emissions as things that are going to, you know, force companies to leave, force layoffs, really create problems for these more rural places.",
        "So they have been trying to do anything they can to keep this bill from passing.",
        "And that last week resulted in the very dramatic instance of them walking off.",

        "The governor here, Kate Brown, has already begun taking steps to call a special session of the legislature on July 2.",
        "So that would mean, you know, budget bills and policy bills that have not passed would essentially have to be reset and they would have to start pushing them through afresh.",
        "We should note, though, that there's nothing that says Republicans will show up to that special session either.",
        "So the sides are going to have to come to an agreement here, and right now that seems pretty hard to find.",
        "How is the public watching all this?",
        "I mean, are people tracking this closely?",
        "Very closely.",
