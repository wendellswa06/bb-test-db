        "The last time Europe's central bank did this, at the end of last year, banks borrowed more than $650 billion.",
        "That loan program helped stabilize markets and bought some time for Greece and its creditors to try and work things out.",

        "It was normal for a while for the market to drop by hundreds of points, only to rise by hundreds the next day.",
        "As we near the end of this year, though, the market is up modestly from the start of the year, around 500 points.",
        "And it turns out that even with the nauseating turns in this market, many technology firms raised a lot of money when they went public.",
        "NPR's Aarti Shahani reports.",
        "About the same number of technology companies went public this year as last year.",
        "The difference is they managed to raise over $6 billion - a whopping 85 percent increase over 2010.",
