        "Beg your pardon?",

        "I'm sorry, Reid, you were trying to get in there?",

        "Absolutely.",

        "I'm often read that way, as a dyke.",

        "And he said, well, I think I know what it is, and it's okay.",

        "Okay, well, I would say the biggest maybe advantage that I gained, if that's part of what of you mean is I experienced in the workplace especially, male privilege, I guess I would say, and a certain entitlement, a bearing more than anything else.",
        "I don't mean privilege so much in getting more financially or politically, but really just that people expect you to be more confident.",
        "They accept a kind of arrogance from you and a bluster, and I sort of responded to that to the point where, you know, I think women spend a lot of time, we spend a lot of time apologizing for everything we do.",
        "So you know when you ask for water in a restaurant, for example, I often will say, oh, I'm sorry to bother you, could we get some water when you have a chance?",

        "And it was just, it wasn't interpreted as rude.",
        "And so...",
        "Mm hmm, they use fewer words.",
        "Yeah, they use fewer words, and there isn't that sense of needing to make an excuse for asking for something.",
        "You just sort of demand it, or you just say it outright.",
        "And there's no, there are no qualifiers.",
        "Yeah.",
