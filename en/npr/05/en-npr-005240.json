        "Now let's get some more callers on the line and this is Teresa(ph), Teresa calling from Philadelphia.",
        "Hi, Ned, Nora, actually.",
        "This is Teresa calling from Philadelphia.",
        "I was really interested in what you were talking about, men being more direct or, you know, being less apologetic in the workplace or in restaurants.",
        "And my question for you is do these qualities that men have, in terms of their communication and social interaction, that leads do you think to, you know, more success in the workplace for men or better, you know, practical results, which means that women need to adopt those traits more in order to achieve (unintelligible) types of results.",
        "I would say, yes, I think I found that one of the remaining male advantages is, as Hamlet would say, thinking makes it so.",
        "And I think that yes, women could really learn to, the, just the mere fact of assertion and assumption gets you farther, generally speaking.",
        "And I think that women could use that in the workplace and elsewhere to get more of what they want.",
        "I remember speaking to someone who was in human resources and said, you know, women ask for less money.",
        "I'm willing to pay them.",
        "I in fact tell them ask for more.",
        "So I think there is that aspect of it.",
        "It's not so much an inequality of opportunity sometimes as it is so much an inequality of assertiveness.",
        "You also come to the conclusion that if this once was, as James Brown famously said, a man's world, maybe not so much anymore.",
        "Yeah, I mean, that was one of the big questions in my mind is, is it still a man's world?",
        "And I suppose there are many arguments you could get into politically and socioeconomically about that.",
        "I think there's still a lot of disagreement on that level, but in terms of, I suppose, liberation, emotional and cultural liberation, my feeling is that the notion of what we consider a woman has expanded dramatically in the last 25 years.",
        "And I think in many ways, I experienced it as a much larger concept.",
        "In other words, I can incorporate things that I learned from Ned into Nora.",
        "They can, they easily flow that way.",
        "But the other, they did not flow well in the other direction.",
        "That the notion of manhood, what's acceptable in especially heterosexual manhood, is much more narrow.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Here's an e-mail from Emily in Oakland.",
        "I'm wondering whether you kept up your normal persona during the 18 months with people at home.",
        "This would have added to the difficulty of, as you mentioned, keeping your psychological balance.",
        "I did hear you say you did date a little as a woman but did you have a sibling or a mate you could talk to on the side or did you completely drop out from regular life from the time of research?",
        "I was living with my wife at the time, so I did have someone to decompress with, which was really invaluable and she deserves a gold medal for all the things she went through with me.",
        "But, I did and I did have times where I was writing.",
        "I had downtime during the whole period and that did make it a little bit harder because I did, although it did heighten the contrast, again, because I was on, sometimes on any given day, the same day I would go out in public as a man, both a man and a woman.",
        "And I might go to the same store and find, you know, see what the difference was in how I was treated.",
        "So that was an interesting thing but, yes, I think it did help to accelerate the breakdown.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now, here's a caller, Tom, in Columbus, Ohio.",
        "Yeah, I was, as a, thank you for taking my call.",

        "As a gay man, I was wondering, a lot of your interaction was with straight men and I was wondering if you spent any time around gay men and if you did, if they reacted any differently to you?",
        "If they thought you were gay or thought you were just a really strange straight man.",
        "I did interact with gay men and I had some very interesting experiences, one of which I didn't write up in the book.",
        "But I went on my three dates with a gay man.",
        "And interestingly, in contrast to what happened with some of the women, three of whom wanted to continue the relationship even after they knew I was a woman, and these were heterosexual women, he wasn't angry with me once I told him.",
        "But he lost interest entirely, because I didn't have the equipment.",
        "And I found that very interesting.",
        "And I also found that my forays into the gay world were circumscribed, because it became sexual much more quickly and it would be, and it became clearer much more quickly that the anatomy wasn't there.",
        "So I found that I wasn't able to pursue that as much as I might have, although of course the monastery chapter did, in many ways, end up being \"\"the gay chapter.",
        "Hmm.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "Tom, are you done?",
        "I think Tom's gone away.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And that the whole situation there was sort of designed to scrub that out of everybody.",
        "Yeah, and that really brought about a little bit of a train wreck.",

        "(soundbite of laughter)",
        "I really got the punishment.",
        "Yeah, I think it also showed me, again, the difference between male and female friendships and how they begin and of course how they develop over time.",
        "I think women tend to fly into new friendships.",
        "If you meet someone you like, there's no, there aren't those same barriers of communication and touch and expression.",
        "So, you know, I was treating this friendship the way I would as a woman.",
        "And he of course was seeing me as a man and that signal, I was not giving him the appropriate signals, and he just cut me off after a couple of days, he just, he wouldn't talk to me anymore.",
        "And...",
        "And it became very clear that he just said, this is not appropriate.",
        "And of course I discussed it with him later and I think he thought that I was gay and that I was falling in love with him when in fact I just had a sort of a girlish friend crush on him."

        "Hmm.",

        "Well, I would agree with you that I think unfortunately the limitations on men were their inability culturally to show feminine qualities.",
