        "In the transition, everything like that, but there was no doubting that in much of the inauguration address was given to pointing out the differences with what the 44th president will be from what the 43rd president wasn't, and that is on language, on an actions, on consulting with others, things like that.",
        "And on what he called the false choice between security and ideals.",
        "Exactly that.",
        "I mean, obviously that's not a choice - that's a choice that George W.",
        "Bush made very clear.",
        "Barack Obama says the choice doesn't have to be made between that.",
        "And as the president - former president now - George Bush was introduced on stage, a smattering of boos yesterday; a bigger round of boos for Vice President Cheney.",
        "Yeah, you know, you'd like to think that the day of inauguration, partisan politics goes away, but as our NPR correspondents who were out on the Mall and throughout the city, whenever President - when then President George W.",
        "Bush- it's kind of odd to say that after eight years...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's like signing your checks '08.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "When his picture would show on the JumboTron there were boos wherever they saw them.",
        "So, that was, you know, obviously - look, he's been a controversial president.",
        "His numbers are very low.",
        "There's no question his election in 2000 was controversial.",
        "A lot of people feel - and this is not just Democrats talking; there's Republicans, too - that after eight years, it's a new tone and we'll see what happens.",
        "You know, we saw President Bush on September 10, 2001 with a 50-percent president and on September 11, he became an 80-percent president.",
        "Things could change the opposite way.",
        "President Obama's numbers are very high right now.",
        "Up in the upper 70s at the moment, so...",
        "Possible chance of showers."

        "If you leave his administration, want to become a lobbyist, you're going to have to wait 'til he leaves office, and also a freeze on White House salaries anybody making over $100,000.",
        "Right.",
        "And regarding the lobbying, no lobbying at all.",
        "If you're working for the Obama White House, no lobbying at all at the Obama White House while exactly - while President Barack Obama is in the White House.",
        "And now many members of the Obama cabinet have been approved: Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Education Secretary Arne Duncan, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag, Veterans Affair Secretary Eric Shinseki and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, but not the secretary of State.",
        "Right, or the secretary of Treasury.",
        "Right now secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, could have - there was a motion yesterday in the Senate to have a unanimous voice vote.",
        "John Cornyn, the Republican senator from Texas, said, no, I still have questions regarding the Bill Clinton Foundation, potential conflicts of interest with Hillary Clinton.",

        "A lot of support from Hillary Clinton coming from Republican John McCain, said absolutely, I support the Hillary Clinton...",
        "And call for Republicans, enough of this partisanship; so if we've got a popular president, give him his secretary, he says.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And I suspect that before this show - this program is over, there may very well be a vote, and I suspect an overwhelming vote of support for Hillary Clinton.",
        "It's a little different on the Treasury secretary front, and Tim Geithner's still being questioned about his failure to pay taxes when he worked for the International Monetary Fund, and those questions have kept - keep coming up.",
        "Again, it should not - it is expected to do derail his nomination, given the severity of the economic news, but there are some embarrassing questions for Geithner.",
        "And Eric Holder, another one, the attorney general ,still on hold.",
        "Right, and there's going to be a hearing today.",
        "There is suppose to be a vote at 2:30 eastern time today in the Senate Judiciary Committee.",
        "Let's get some callers on the line on our trivia question.",
        "Again, if you know the identity of the president sworn in by somebody he'd known for 40 years..."
