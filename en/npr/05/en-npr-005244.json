        "And it was clear that Obama realized that faithfully had come too soon, and he stopped.",
        "But unfortunately, it wasn't rectified.",
        "He gave the oath in a fashion that is different from that in the Constitution, and the problem with the Constitution is that it has these words in quotes."
