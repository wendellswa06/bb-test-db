        "Well, this is one of the great trivia questions of beer night with law professors, and that is, you have Article II Section 1 that states clearly, you must give these words to be sworn-in as president.",
        "But then the 20th Amendment in Section 1 says, at 12, the presidency of your predecessor ends and your presidency begins.",
        "But the general assumption is that you still must take the oath.",
        "Now, does that mean that we are now living in the Biden administration?",
        "I would bet against it.",
        "We had exactly those points raised in emails from - by Andrea in Oklahoma City and Michael, who sent us something from area code 314, wherever that happens to be, and if Mr. Obama became president at noon, why was an oath needed at all?",
        "Because it's in the Constitution.",
        "(Soundbite of congressional debate, January 21, 2009)",
        "Since they're having trouble with this oil containment box, are there any other ideas to try and stop the spread of oil?",
        "It is in the Constitution, and the assumption is you do need the oath.",
        "The question is to get a sense of whether the 20th Amendment could be viewed as superseding something in Article 2.",
        "But the general view is, you've got to get them both right, and the wiser thing would be for a do-over.",
        "Now, it would be incredibly demeaning for Chief Justice Roberts if not only was there a do-over, but they went to some immigration judge to get it right.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "I think the assumption is he'd like, if it has to be done, to do it himself."

        "And of course, President Barack Obama has pledged to withdraw troops from Iraq in 16 months, which should be completely different than his predecessor.",
