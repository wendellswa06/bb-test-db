        "And what were the results?",
        "A lot of shootings and a lot of murders, unfortunately.",
        "McCarthy says Thursday, Friday and Saturday were busy but manageable days, but Sunday was a day full of shootings and murders.",
        "Chicago police shot people including a 16-year-old who ran when approached.",
        "What he had under his shirt was what you can best refer to as a \"\"Dirty Harry\"\" gun.",

        "It is almost impossible to imagine that somebody could have been in the room with so many world leaders talking with so many Soviet leaders all those times and be nothing but a human tape recorder.",
        "Did he know a lot of what was going on and did he talk at all?",
        "I think that he was one of the smartest guys I had ever met among the Soviet leaders.",
        "Khrushchev, whom I had some dealings with, I put at the very top but Sukhodrev was there interpreting Khrushchev for the world and Khrushchev used very earthy Russian when he spoke.",
        "And Sukhodrev would try very hard to smooth out the edges and to make Khrushchev seem a bit more sophisticated than perhaps he was.",

        "That struck me as particularly interesting because normally Sukhodrev would never say anything like that.",

        "Sukhodrev managed, as you say, Nikita Khrushchev, kind of an earthy character, come out sounding like Lawrence Olivier when he was translated into English.",
        "The same for Leonid Brezhnev, who wasn't the most lively speaker, and Mikhail Gorbachev whom I gather sounded to lots of Russians like a very windy bureaucrat.",
        "They all came out sounding pretty good though the words of Mr. Sukhodrev.",
        "Well, you know, it's terribly important what kind interpreter you have.",
        "Sukhodrev was capable of not just translating the words of the Soviet leader, but conveying the personality of the Soviet leader.",
