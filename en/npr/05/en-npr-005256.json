        "At the Rock Rapids event, 34-year-old small-business owner Josh Bakker, who also doubles as the local county GOP chair, says he doesn't think people are dwelling on Perry's famous oops.",

        "Alice, can we really call this a truce, or is a partial truce more accurate?",

        "People in opposition-held areas told us it was quieter than it had been in months or even in years.",
        "There's a big volunteer group called Syria Civil Defense which does a lot of the rescue work, especially after air strikes.",
        "They reported a dramatic drop in attacks.",
        "But a lot of people have been very skeptical, and they were surprised that the cease-fire happened at all.",
        "And today, it doesn't look so good.",
        "There are more reports of air strikes on opposition-held areas.",
        "Rebel forces are also telling us there have been some clashes with regime forces north of the city of Aleppo.",
        "And regime media also say there have been attacks on their forces, which would also constitute a violation of the cease-fire.",
        "So it's all looking very tentative.",
        "But the U.N.'s envoy to Syria, when he discussed the cease-fire before it happened, insisted they were expecting violations, that there were mechanisms to deal with them, and that they hoped to continue with the efforts even if there are problems along the way.",

        "Twenty-two people were able to leave the town, although it came too late for one child who died of starvation over the course of the weekend.",

        "Well, we got through to a couple of people today in opposition-held areas which, as you say, had just been under bombardment air strikes pretty much constantly for a very long time.",
        "It was quite poignant to talk to them.",
        "It sounded like it was almost disorientating for things to be quiet, and that people are taking the opportunity to go out a little more than they usually would.",

        "But there was a big attack on the city called Tel Abyad by ISIS forces yesterday, which was repelled with the help of air strikes by those Kurdish forces.",
        "So that's something that is ongoing and probably unchanged, really, by the truce.",
        "Alice, briefly - if this cease-fire does take hold, would more substantive peace talks come about?",
        "Well, if it does hold, then I think it would certainly be a significant gesture of faith by all sides that would create a good basis, possibly, for further talks that are due to happen a week - tomorrow.",
        "There are concerns by rebel fighters that in recent weeks, the forces of President Bashar al-Assad have made significant gains and that actually, this truce and subsequent peace talks could allow him to consolidate those gains.",
