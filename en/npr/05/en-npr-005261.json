        "Unfortunately, it really hasn't changed, at least on the surface, very much.",
        "It's still--huge swaths of the city are still completely destroyed, literally, you know, block after block after block just rubble.",
        "The reconstruction has been slow, a lot of it invisible because it's things like, you know, redoing the water mains, unemployment is incredibly high.",
        "And even though US officials have called this a strategic city that is important to show what can be done if it cooperates, the Marines and civilian officials seen don't really seem to have much of a plan on how to do real reconstruction.",

        "Basically they just said, listen, we asked is anyone cheating?",

        "Secretary James said there was a loss of confidence in their leadership, and they basically failed to oversee the airmen under their command.",
