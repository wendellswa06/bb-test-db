        "What was that?",

        "And Sessions' proposal was defeated by a vote of 12 to 6.",
        "And what about the other part of this that we mentioned, the more merit-based legal immigration system?",
        "What's the debate been on that today?",
        "Well, it's been all about numbers, how many foreigners should be allowed to enter the country each year and what should be the criteria for letting them in.",
        "The bill proposes shifting from what's now primarily a family-based chain migration system, in which an immigrant is allowed to bring in relatives over the years, to a more merit-based point system, where potential immigrants would be assessed mostly in terms of how they meet the demands of the U.S.",
        "labor market, whether it's for high skilled jobs or low skilled labor.",
        "South Carolina Republican Lindsay Graham, who's a member of the gang of eight, assured colleagues that before any immigrant labor is brought in, the jobs they'd be filling would first be posted for job seekers here.",
        "That's to ensure that Americans don't lose their job because of cheap labor.",
        "But here's the dilemma.",
        "Once the company advertises and they can't find a native-born worker, it's better to bring people into our country that can add value to our businesses than that business have to close or leave.",
        "And, David, where does the bill seem to be headed at this point?",
        "The Defense Department has held these career fairs for several years, but in an economy where jobs are few, the events are a lifeline for recovering vets looking for work."
