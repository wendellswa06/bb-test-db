        "The Obama administration and the European Union have been rolling these sanctions out kind of in stages.",

        "Why wouldn't he make the Putin top 20?",
        "This is Alexey Miller you're talking about and then Igor Sechin, who runs Rosneft, the big oil company, who's also not on the list.",
        "And people have been wondering about that.",
        "One possible explanation is that the U.S.",

        "U.S.",
        "trade with Russia is not that large.",
        "And Russian investments in the United States are not particularly large at all, except for the real estate penthouses that various oligarchs bought in New York and in Miami.",
        "So Russia has to look for what they call an asymmetric response and we'll have to see what that might be.",
        "When you look at the names on Russia's little list, does that tell you anything about what they're thinking?",
        "Well, it looks like they're going after the people who have made the most noise, for the most part.",
        "I was interested that the Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana is on the list because her main interest in Russia has been trying to get the ban on adoptions by American couples overturned.",
        "She's been quite strong on that.",
        "So it looks like they're just trying to strike out at anybody for almost any reason.",
        "Mary Landrieu is, of course, one of the most endangered Democrats in the United States Senate.",
        "I wonder, this might actually help her.",
