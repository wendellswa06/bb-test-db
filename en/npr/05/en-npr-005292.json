        "In 2002, Denise Djokic seemed poised for an important recording career.",
        "Her first album had been released on a major label to great reviews, but then something odd happened.",
        "The label told Djokic that her next recording should turn away from classical music to a crossover style decidedly more popular.",
        "A style so popular, in fact, that she would be performing with contemporary drumbeats.",
        "Now this went completely against the young cellist's sensibility, so she and the recording company parted ways.",
        "Djokic then took her talent to a smaller label and here's the result.",

        "Walking away from a major label was a difficult move, but listening to her new CD, called FOLKLORE, it's clear that Djokic did the right thing.",
        "She's chosen works that show how classical music can let its hair down a bit without dying it purple.",
        "All the pieces here are by classical composers, but inspired in some way by folk material, like this Tarantella, an Italian folk dance from Igor Stravinsky's SUITE ITALIENNE.",

        "She took a risk leaving a big label, but the risk paid off.",

        "Well, the FAA has some 3,000 safety inspectors throughout the country and all over the world actually, and their job is to ensure that the airlines are meeting the FAA safety standards.",
        "And what that entails now is a lot of data management, less of the so-called kicking-the-tires approach where inspectors used to just show up and check on, `Hey, did you, you know, fix that tire correctly or not?",
        "and more of the making sure that they're following the procedures, they're checking off all the items on the checklist, that they are not compromising safety, for example, when they outsource maintenance, to make sure that they're following their own procedures.",
        "Well, how many inspections that the FAA has scheduled are actually not being done?",
        "It's 26 percent in the most recent year that we have figures for, and that's based on the FAA's own projections of--based on the number of inspections that they plan to do.",
        "Part of it is that they've been constrained by their budget.",
        "They have 300 inspectors that they're going to be losing this year, mostly through attrition.",
        "And the other problem is that you just simply can't keep up with all the major changes going on in the airline industry."

        "One, you've got a number of major network carriers that are either in bankruptcy or near bankruptcy or really losing record amounts of money.",
        "And on the other hand, we have these new carriers, some of them we never heard about until just recently of last year or so, sprouting up and expanding at a rapid clip.",
        "And both of those trends require really careful management to make sure that those safety risks that are inherent in those trends are watched.",
        "You mean because there's simply more planes up in the air conducting more flights in new places?",
        "Right.",
        "Not only that, but in one example, they had one low-fare carrier--that was not named in the report--had expanded the number of airplanes that it had in its fleet by 50 percent and expanded the number of cities they served by 50 percent in a matter of months.",
        "And at the same time they were cutting back on the number of maintenance employees by 14 percent.",
        "In that case, the FAA didn't identify that necessarily as a safety risk.",
