        "Yes, he whom the Heisman trophy is named for, an award that honors that college player who best exemplifies excellence and integrity.",
        "As it happens, Cumberland was on the verge of bankruptcy and had to give up football.",

        "Thirteen noble fraternity brothers volunteered to suit up and get clobbered, in effect, saving Cumberland from bankruptcy.",
        "But hail to the victors.",
        "The next year, 1917, Tech was declared national champion, the first time a team from Dixie was unanimously awarded that honor.",
        "And the South was on its way to preeminence in college football, as indeed coach Heisman would be immortalized with the most famous American athletic trophy to bear a person's name.",
