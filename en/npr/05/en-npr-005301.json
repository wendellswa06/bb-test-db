        "So, we have to be thinking that his words choose hope over fear demonstrated with more than a million people staying together and no crime being committed, you know, is a story for the future of hopefulness.",
        "But I think that speaks to another element of why we're fascinated with crime, Tony, and that's the sense of compassion.",
        "Either you believe people are good or believe people are bad, I believe people are good.",
        "But I think that one reason that we are interested in crime is because it allows us to feel our compassion, not only a compassion for the victim but sometimes compassions for the perpetrator.",
        "Well, let me ask you this as we have to bring our conversation to a close.",
        "Is there that the danger that we are becoming desensitized to crime?",
        "Because it's - we see it on the streets for real on the news for real and then we read about it and go to the movies and watch it?",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "Crime and conflict is an aspect to the human condition that's been with us from the beginning.",
        "It will always be with us.",

        "I think our interest is always there and will always be there.",
        "Last thing is this.",
        "Do you find a difference gender wise in terms of the interest that we had in either victims or perpetrators of crime?",
        "And I know I only have unfortunately 30 seconds for you to respond.",
        "The quick answer is I do not believe there's a difference in gender.",
        "I think that the kinds of crimes that men are interested in maybe different than the kinds of crimes women are and the way we expressed our interest but we're always have our ears, you know, bent towards the news.",
        "Our eyes are looking at it.",
        "I think it's the same for men and women.",
        "This is a fascinating topic and I really appreciate Michael, your coming on.",

        "One sort of legal, one tactical.",
        "The legal reason is simply that the Bush administration made the decision, shortly after 9/11, they just were not going to use any existing legal system to try these folks.",
        "So they opted out of the sort of civilian system that we're used to.",
        "They opted out of the traditional military court-martial system and invented this whole new system of military commissions that's taken years and years and years to bang into shape.",
        "More or less we've been bogged own in appeals and fits and starts, trips back and forth to the Supreme Court that have really precluded trials from happening at all.",
        "The tactical reason is that the Bush administration made a strategic choice after 9/11, to go and interrogate these high value detainees - as they were called - for years and year, rather than try them.",
        "That was a decision at the time that maybe made some sense.",
        "They wanted to fend off any future attacks.",
        "But what it meant was these folks were simply not ready to be tried until right now."

        "It's also worth saying it's recently come up that part of that interrogation may have involved waterboarding, which is certain to become a legal issue if the trials ever take place.",
        "So these charges, how do they compare with the charges filed against the other detainees?",
        "Well, certainly some of the detainees are facing very serious charges, Madeleine.",

        "Will that talk continue as these proceedings continue or will that be put on hold?",
        "Well, I think one of the reasons for the timing of these proceedings is to say, look, this is why we needed Guantanamo.",
        "All that stuff you've been watching for the past couple of years - shucking and jiving about possibly creating some system - now we know why we need a system.",
        "It's for this.",

        "If these men are found guilty and they are sentenced to death, there is no death chamber at Guantanamo, so how would the executions be carried out?",

        "And so presumably that's not the immediate concern.",
        "For what it's worth, military justice provides for death by lethal injection.",
        "Although, it's also worth throwing out that the Supreme Court is looking at that question this term.",
        "Dahlia, you mentioned the case of waterboarding, and just recently the United Nations has found that it is indeed a form of torture.",
