        "TSC won't say how big the watchlist is, but most unofficial estimates put the total at several hundred thousand people, and the number of hits from it is growing.",
        "In 2004, the year the TSC opened its doors, it had some 5,400 hits.",
        "This year, the FBI expects more than 22,000.",
        "That concerns the senior counsel with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, David Sobel.",
        "The bottom-line problem is the government since 9/11 has gotten into the business of making lists of suspicious people without much discussion of what the criteria are for putting people's names on these list or how affected people might get some recourse and get their names off if they have been mistakenly put on such a list.",
        "Theoretically, the names go on the watch list based on rigorous - but classified - criteria.",
        "Boyle says the TSC won't tell anyone whether they are actually on the list, but they have set up a redress unit to help people who say they have been mistakenly included.",
        "What we can do for people is if in fact they are being misidentified, we can provide them information to help them to try to avoid or minimize the amount of inconvenience that they face.",
        "Boyle says the TSC will go further later this month.",
        "Specific high-ranking officials in various agencies will be given responsibility for taking care of these cases.",

        "Well, it's not something he's talking about on the stump.",
        "As he was interviewed earlier today by FOX News Sunday, he was asked if Obama was trying to buy the election, and he said that he wouldn't let that happen.",
        "Campaigning outside Columbus this morning, he really stuck to his standard stump speech, celebrating Joe the Plumber, his new campaign mascot and a symbol of people who are concerned about tax increases under Barack Obama.",
        "And now we're in Toledo, close to the home of the real Joe the Plumber, Joe Wurzelbacher.",
        "Wurzelbacher himself is not here, though.",
        "He's in New York doing some talk show interviews.",
        "So, Scott, also on FOX News today, Senator McCain talked about Colin Powell's endorsement of Obama.",
        "Is he addressing that at his campaign events today?",
        "Senator McCain has not been talking about Colin Powell's endorsement on the campaign trail.",
        "He did say during that interview that he was not surprised by it, but some of the people in his audience today were surprised by it.",
        "I talked to a couple of veterans outside Columbus who were attending a McCain rally who had not yet heard that Colin Powell endorsed Barack Obama.",
        "They were quite surprised by the news.",
        "They said that they admired Colin Powell, that they thought that this would change some people's minds, but it wasn't changing their minds."

        "So they're almost giddy today with this announcement.",

        "Frankly, I can tell you they're very happy to have such a large fundraising cash advantage at this stage of the game.",
        "They can really buy up advertising and radio time like crazy, and overwhelm the McCain campaign in terms of the on-air battle.",
