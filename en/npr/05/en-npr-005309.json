        "We're really talking about an immense change to our knowledge about the Milky Way.",
        "And the Gaia team was going to release all of this to the public all at once.",
        "So Hogg invited dozens of colleagues to join him at the Flatiron Institute in Manhattan.",

        "So they outlawed the use of coal within the Third Ring Road, they put in much more stringent vehicle standards, they shut down a lot of heavy industry.",
        "But what they started to realize was as they were pushing dirty industries out of Beijing, they were all moving into the neighboring provinces.",
        "And so a few years ago, the State Environmental Protection Agency, SEPA, started working on what they call the Regional Air Quality Management, and Beijing is now involved with five of its neighboring provinces and regional air quality planning for the Olympics.",
        "And I think part of the reason air quality has been better for the last week is that last week they said they'd started the shutdown of some power plants and some heavy-polluting industries in the neighboring provinces.",
        "There have been stories about athletes who've come to China to train, to get used to, you know, pushing their bodies under these conditions and some of those stories have not been great.",
        "Athletes have really struggled in this air quality.",
        "How has the central government responded to those stories?",
        "I think they're quite concerned.",
        "I mean, I think they realize they have to be much more public about the steps they are doing and they need to really focus on getting all the provinces in line, but I don't think they've been ignoring it from the beginning.",
        "I think they realize the air quality matters.",
        "And, you know, this is the proudest moment for China.",
