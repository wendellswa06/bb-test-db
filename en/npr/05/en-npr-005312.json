        "Our first topic today is Jeanine Pirro, New York's state Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.",
        "Does she have a chance, Donna?",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "Look, Mrs. Clinton is very popular in New York state.",
        "Ms. Pirro is trying to make this about 2008.",
        "New Yorkers will make this about 2006 and who can deliver results for them at home.",
        "But, Donna, two quick points here.",
        "One is that I see Mrs. Clinton is now saying that she's opposed to late-term abortion.",
        "She seems to be constantly moving to the center, and secondly, New York voters who give her high approval ratings also say they want her to pledge to fill out a second Senate term and not use New York state as simply a launching pad for a presidential race.",
        "Could those issues complicate Mrs. Clinton's what seems now to be an easy run for re-election?",
        "Well, again, Mrs. Clinton's opponent is also a big fan of abortion rights and gay rights, and I don't believe that that's going to be a major issue for Hillary.",
        "Hillary is a centrist.",
        "She's a mainstream Democrat who's delivered for New York voters over and over again.",
        "So I don't think this election will turn on Mrs. Clinton's views or positioning for 2008.",
        "Instead, I think voters will look at her record and judge from there whether or not she deserves to be re-elected.",
        "New Yorkers are literally standing at the rooftops by saying that they want a full-time senator that's going to focus on their interests as opposed to someone that's going to use a Senate seat as a springboard to national politics.",
        "But is that enough, Robert Traynham, to stop Hillary Clinton?",
        "Well, listen, I mean, Senator Clinton is her own person.",
        "She's going to make up her own mind as to whether or not she's going to run for the presidency or not.",
        "And so I don't think anything's going to stop her except perhaps I think her husband...",
        "Well, wait a second.",
        "What do you mean her husband?",
        "How would Bill Clinton, the former president, stop her?",
        "Well, you'd like to think that couples listen to each other, and I think President Clinton is someone that is the absolute genius when it comes to presidential politics.",
        "And I think if he takes a look at the polls, takes a look at the political landscape and says, `You know, Hillary, I don't think this is something that you may want to do,' I think Senator Clinton will listen to her husband and say, `You know what?",
        "I will serve out my full term in the Senate and perhaps the presidency is something that I should aspire to in 2012 or 2016.'",
        "Donna, I wonder if you think that at the moment Hillary Clinton should be recognized as the leading contender for the nomination."
