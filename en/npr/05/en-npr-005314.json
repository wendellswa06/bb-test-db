        "The young and powerful crown prince was hailed as a reformer in Western capitals, but his pursuit of a war in Yemen that's become a humanitarian disaster has been called reckless, as has his crackdown on dissent, including Khashoggi.",
        "It's made him a pariah in the West, says Wittes.",
        "You know, from the moment Mohammed bin Salman was appointed defense minister at his tender age, I have heard voices from around the gulf expressing a desire to see more experienced foreign policy hands advising him.",

        "Still a nation running against strong negative winds, huge inflation.",
        "What's causing it and what's the impact?",
        "Well, let's first of all talk about what happened in December, because the inflation increased to 1,281 percent, which is the highest in the world.",
        "In so many ways, we're in a different business.",
        "And it seems very much like those stores are trying to replicate the online experience.",

        "It's good to be here.",
        "Well, news reports say the White House is calling for a retraction.",
        "Do you intend to do that?",
        "Well, what we've said in our issue this week at great length is that based on the denials we've received from the Pentagon and the uncertainty of the source that you mentioned, we are no longer certain about what we originally published, which is that evidence of this sort of desecration and disrespect for the Koran had turned up in a specific military investigation run by the Southern Command.",
        "And that is what we said in our original story, that we had a US official who said that it had turned up in that investigation.",
        "That is what the Pentagon on Friday denied to us.",
        "They did not make a blanket denial that no, mistreatment of the Koran had ever happened by US guards.",
        "They came to us with this denial 11 days after the item ran.",
        "As we explained in the story, not only did we approach them for comment and actually separately run the entire item by a Pentagon official and asking whether we had gotten anything wrong, but after the fact, after it was in print, nobody at the Pentagon or anywhere else in the administration reached us for 11 days to say there was any problem with it.",
        "They finally did a day before our deadline.",
        "In that day, we did as much as we could to find out what we might have gotten wrong, and that's what we published in the magazine this week.",
        "We are continuing to look into it, and if, after further reporting and review, it's clear that everything that we wrote is clearly wrong, we are prepared to print a retraction.",
        "Well, Mark, I can hear listeners saying if--why do all of that investigation now after your article has been in print?",
        "Isn't that what you're supposed to do before it's printed?",
        "This was a 10-sentence item.",
        "It was not a full-scale Newsweek investigation.",
        "The reference to the Koran is roughly eight words in those 10 sentences.",
        "We realized that the item was sensitive enough that we needed to run it by the Pentagon for comment and took the extra measure of showing them the entire item.",
        "On the other hand, we could not have anticipated the effect that this would have in the Islamic world, and neither did they.",
        "Clearly, the Pentagon official who saw the entire item didn't anticipate it or, presumably, he would have asked us to hold the story or not to print it, and even after it appeared in print, nobody in the government saw the potential inflammatory effect.",
        "Well, Mark, I have to...",
        "And the fact is that numerous other news organizations, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, the BBC, and several others, had printed allegations coming directly from detainees about mistreatment of the Koran by US guards before.",
        "Right.",
        "So we try at great length in our magazine this week to explain why our particular report at this particular time may have played a role in this unrest.",
        "But it's not the first time that major news organizations have printed the possibility that this might have happened."

        "Well, Mark, as an editor, you make a decision about the go--to go with the story or not based on its accuracy, not on its presumed impact.",
        "Is that right?",
        "I mean, you're telling...",
        "Well, no, that is right, and the reason we thought this story at the time was accurate was that it came from a source who was not totally anonymous.",
        "Obviously, we have to deal with confidential sources on many stories, but we push as hard as possible to identify them.",
        "In this case, we were at least able to identify the source as a US official.",
        "It is a source that we had dealt with, that Michael Isikoff, the investigative reporter, had dealt with extensively in the past, who had always given us good information, who we believed to be credible, and who we also believed and knew to be in a position where he might have seen these internal documents.",
        "And when you say `we,' you mean Michael Isikoff and you, the editor--you, as editor, know the identity of the source, right?",
        "Yes.",
        "So y...",

        "There's an anonymous source.",

        "You also take into account the credibility of the reporter.",
        "In this case, Mike Isikoff is a veteran experienced investigative reporter, who has a lot of experience in general, doing investigative work, and had a lot of experience specifically reporting on prisoner abuses in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo and elsewhere, and has broken a number of significant stories for Newsweek in the last year on this general issue.",
        "Then you want to know, once you have the item, what does the Pentagon or the subject that you're writing about have to say about it?",
        "So in this case, we approached the Southern Command for comment.",
        "They got back to us saying, `We cannot comment on an ongoing investigation.'",
        "And then, because we were concerned and wanted to make extra sure that we weren't getting things wrong, we--John Barry, our Pentagon reporter, sends the entire story to a top official in the Pentagon, who he deals with on a regular basis, with the question, `Is this correct?",
        "That Pentagon official got back to us with specific objections to other elements of the story, which we then corrected or took out based on that feedback, but never mentioned a problem with the Koran detail.",
        "And as you say, it took how long, 11 days..."

        "What about your--are you satisfied with the process that this story went through and will it mean revising the process the next time forward?",
        "Well, that's a very good question, and obviously, we are going to have to look into that and take that very seriously.",
        "You know, I think there are a couple of issues.",
        "One is how many sources do you need and at what level?",
        "And again, you know, although there--you know, the common sort of wisdom is that you should have two or three sources on every story, the fact is that every major news organization often goes with stories on the basis of one source, if they believe the source to be particularly credible.",
        "But I think we'll obviously have to review that, as is The New York Times and other news organizations.",
        "We, I think, are going to in the future push as hard as we can to get as much--to be as specific as we can about who our sources are.",
        "Sometimes that means that you can't give a name and you can't give a position, but you can give some sense of what kind of job they hold and why they might be in a position to know.",
        "On the other hand, there are many, many stories of national importance and public interest that would never come to light if journalists were required to always name every source in a story.",
