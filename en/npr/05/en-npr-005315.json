        "Thanks for joining us.",
        "Thank you.",
        "From what you know about the Newsweek story, do you think Newsweek did anything wrong?",
        "Well, it's been a tough time dealing with anonymous sources.",
        "Ever since 9/11, the stakes are much higher.",
        "And I think probably this is a lesson that you need at least two or three anonymous sources who don't talk to each other.",
        "I think if there's any lesson to be learned, probably Newsweek will come out of this with something like that.",
        "Well, do we need anonymous sources at all?",
        "It's kind of a dangerous proposition, isn't it?",
        "We hate to use them.",
        "As journalists, we really hate to use them, but there are times you need to use them, because the information's so important or because the people--and because the people telling you could lose their jobs or, in some cases, their lives or could come under threats or be injured.",
        "And...",
        "And there are some things that are that important, but you really have to measure them.",
        "And let's talk about the dangers.",
        "On the one hand, anonymous sources could have an ax to grind, and if we don't know who they are, we can't tell whether or not they might have another agenda.",

        "That's a possibility.",
        "It is a possibility.",
        "I think it's more of a possibility these days, simply because of the era in which we're in now.",

        "Oh, I think that caution has been going on for a couple of years.",

        "The New York Times just came out with a report from its Credibility Committee, and everyone's doing everything they can to restrict the use of anonymous sources as much as possible.",
        "One thing that we teach and that everyone is pushing for now is to get documents after sources have told you something, so you don't have to rely on them, that you can really get a document state of mind; that is when someone says something, look for the document that either backs them up or contradicts them.",
        "In some of these stories, there's no way to do that, but as often as possible, that's what we're pushing people to do, get them on the record and get the documents.",
        "Well, let's get a perspective from the ground now, a reporter who is trying to get a scoop under tight deadline, and it can be a tricky job trying to decide whether to go with an anonymous source, take the time to find someone on the record, and sometimes that can't be done at all.",
        "Jack Nelson is a former Washington bureau chief and investigative reporter for the LA Times and joins us by phone from his home in Bethesda, Maryland.",
        "Welcome, Jack.",
        "Thank you very much.",
        "As a Washington reporter, you've had to use anonymous sources.",
        "What are some examples of stories that you've covered that you feel wouldn't have gotten covered any other way?",
        "Well, actually, I've used anonymous sources for more than 50 years as a reporter, both in Mississippi, with the Atlanta Constitution later, and my 36 years in Washington.",
        "And if you want to know about some of the ones I've used--either I've used or reporters in my bureau have used, I would say that they would involve such things as--and involved abuses in at least six administrations.",
        "And examples, I guess, would be aspects of the Watergate scandal, abuses of power of the FBI and other federal agencies in the Nixon administrations; questions that surrounded President Ford's pardon of Nixon; scandals in the Carter administration involving OMB director Burt Lance; President Carter's brother Billy Carter's representing Libya; illegal and inappropriate payments and cover-up attempts in the Iran-Contra scandal and the Ronald Reagan administration; President George H.W.",
        "Bush's role in the Iran-Contra scandal, other wrongdoing in his administration; lies told by President Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.",
        "I mean, those are just some of the examples.",
        "Fairly long list.",
        "Do you feel at any point that you--or had you rejected stories because you knew that, one way or the other, you were being manipulated?",
        "Either you were trying--they were trying to discredit you or somebody had another agenda.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "There's no question about it that many times, we'd been told things anonymously by people, and if we couldn't otherwise confirm it, we never would run the stories, and sometimes we knew that somebody had an ax to grind, and it was--and what they--and, of course, many times, you get information from people who have axes to grind, but the information itself is accurate.",
        "But, you know, it requires you to go the extra step in trying to confirm it.",
        "If you do know they have an ax to grind, then, of course, the best thing to do is to identify the source the best you can, at least say it was someone who opposed the administration, if it involved some allegation concerning a particular administration.",

        "I think it was unconscionable.",
        "You know, to come out with an article like that and know what the ramifications could be, without thoroughly checking it out, it's just irresponsible journalism.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, let's get a response for that.",
        "Thank you, Tom.",
        "Brandt, there it is: irresponsible, not thoroughly checked out.",
        "We have only one source, and that source won't use his or her name.",
        "That's been my experience.",

        "In many states, finding adoptive parents for foster kids is the easy part.",

        "I think it does show the peril of having the one source and then getting what we sometimes call the non-denial denial.",
        "You're always in danger of hearing what you want to hear, or the person confirming or not confirming something is not giving you the full story.",
        "I do think that Mark Whitaker said they did not think that this story would have the ramifications it did, since the information had been out, and it was a brief item.",
        "Nonetheless, he did say that they're going to review how they go about their business at this point, and again, I think Jack would agree you feel very edgy if you've only got one absolute positive source on a story.",
        "It better be really, really good.",
        "Well, I certainly agree with that, but I must say I'm a little bit puzzled by the whole Newsweek story, and I agree with something you said earlier about there need to be now a--go back and do a recapitulation on this whole thing, how it happened and what the exact facts are.",
        "Because as I read it and all I know about is what I have read, both in The New York Times and in The Washington Post and what Newsweek has said, and as I read it, they have still not said definitely that they were wrong.",
        "I mean, they've, in one sense, said they've made an error, but they say they're still investigating.",
        "And by the way, the national security adviser, Stephen Hadley of the White House, also says they're still investigating.",
        "There was a lot of information out there concerning this sort of activity before, and so I just don't quite understand why Newsweek came out at this time and said, you know, `We apologize for it.",
        "I just--to me, it's a puzzle, and I think we need to know more about it.",
        "Well, that is an interesting question, and I'll put it to both of you.",
        "There are a lot of stories that reporters do that end up being denied by those who are stakeholders.",
        "We don't retract the story.",
        "We don't apologize the story because somebody who the story's about denied it.",
        "Oh, I think that's exactly right.",
