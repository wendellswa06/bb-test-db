        "I think you want you want everything airtight.",
        "It's got to be airtight when you base it on sources.",
        "I admire Jack's long work, and he stayed in business so long because he was so certain and the stories based on sources were so airtight, and they've got to be because your credibility's at stake.",
        "The source's credibility isn't at stake as much as the media's credibility.",
        "Jack, how do you cultivate a relationship with a source?",
        "Well, you know, you stay in touch with them.",
        "You test what they've told you before.",
        "You become--you know, if it's a longtime source or a source that you use a lot, you get to really know them and you find out whether or not they can be trusted or whether or not they may be trying to use you.",
        "And when you find that somebody is trying to use you, of course, you don't do much business with them.",
        "But I've got to say that you have to continue to use anonymous sources.",
        "I mean, obviously, as Steve mentioned earlier, there's a lot of--been re-examination going on by The New York Times, the LA Times, The Washington Post, all the other publications, on whether they should use as many anonymous sources as they do.",
        "Ad I do think that in recent years, it's sort of gotten out of hand.",
        "I think the one thing ever since Watergate, a lot of reporters began to think that if they added anonymous sources, it would make the story sound even more important, and we know, for example, that some reporters have told somebody, `I don't need to use your name.",
        "Just tell me this, and I'll just say you're a government official.'",
        "Well, I think that's the wrong way to approach it.",
        "I think you ought to always use a name to back it up if you can, and I don't think using an anonymous source necessarily strengthens the story.",
        "But I think that's what's happened, and I think that over the years, you know, we've just gotten much too loose in using anonymous sources.",
        "We have an e-mail here that asks the question about the relationship between the consolidation of media and the use of anonymous sources.",
        "Is there a connection?",
        "Let me start with you, Brandt.",
        "I don't really think so.",
        "I think I go with what Jack says, that we've just gotten too loose on giving up the right to use the person's name.",
        "I would say, if anything, corporations really dislike anonymous sources.",
        "I agree with that.",
        "And then when they wonder why they can't get certain jobs, they'll understand.",
        "We are talking today about the use of anonymous stories.",
        "The conversation comes in the wake of Newsweek's not quite retraction but an apology for a story that appeared in its Periscope section last week that talked about the flushing and the otherwise desecration of the Koran by guards at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "Newsweek reported that that was in a report by the Pentagon into the abuses at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "That part of the report appears not to be true.",

        "But, you know, I saw such a huge discrepancy between the consequences, say, that the reporters having to do with the Dan Rather case suffered and the lack of consequences that Judith Miller has suffered for her inaccurate reporting leading up prior to the invasion of Iraq.",
        "I know--I think there was--What?--a supposedly independent committee appointed to review what happened to Dan Rather's case, and I'm wondering why there isn't such a committee, like, say, for instance in regard to Judith Miller, an independent committee for all reporters, for all news sources to review, in fact, maybe if a reporter has a pattern of inaccurately reporting, and what kind of consequences they do suffer.",
        "Brandt?",
        "Well, I think there have been a number of committees out there that have looked at how reporters carry out their mission.",
        "I think you're getting reaction company by company to whether a reporter's accurate or inaccurate, and it's really a question you'd have to ask The New York Times.",
        "Certainly the Dan Rather case and CBS was much more public and received a lot more attention at the moment that came out.",
        "But I do think there is constant scrutiny now of how reporters are performing.",

        "Would it help the industry at all if there was some kind of ombudsman, some kind of national organization, an independent organization that took a look at these things as they arise?",
        "Well, I'm not sure whether that would help or not.",
        "I wouldn't see anything--I wouldn't have any reason to say we shouldn't have something like that.",
        "I'm not sure how much good it would do.",
        "But I do say that a lot of this, you know, self-examination is going on already in the news media about the whole situation of using anonymous sources, and I think if you look at what's happened, you've had a number of reporters who've been dismissed from various publications for having either used anonymous sources and then they couldn't tell who they were, or who wound up using erroneous information in their articles."

        "Thanks, Frank.",

        "Can you give us some examples of stories that you were the anonymous source?",
        "Yes, I can.",
        "And I think it's important--excuse me--to look to the motive of the source, and when I was US attorney, we had a case in which there was a racially motivated fire bombing, a family of five Puerto Ricans were killed, and the Philadelphia police got a confession out of a mentally impaired person in the neighborhood, and he was convicted and sent away for life.",
        "It turns out he was not the guy that did it, and we came to have that suspicion.",
        "The people in the neighborhood knew he was not the guy that did it.",
        "And the Philadelphia Inquirer took a very active interest in the case and assigned some very good reporters to cover it.",
        "So working with the ATF, we were able to develop a case, but as we developed the case, it was absolutely critical that the press coverage from the Inquirer make the neighbors aware that this case was serious and it was going forward, so I shared some information with reporters and reporters shared some information with us."

        "And why would you go unnamed?",

        "I can tell you that over the years, I've shared information with federal agencies, local, state agencies, and they've shared information with me, all on a confidential basis.",
        "But is that a question of being used for some other purpose?",

        "Somebody talks.",
        "And I think the anonymous source situation is similar to the situation between a police officer and his confidential informant.",
        "There has to be trust on both sides, there has to be a record of a credible exchange of information, and each side is taking a chance when you do one of these relationships.",
