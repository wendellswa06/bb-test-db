        "It was quite gruesome, to say the least.",
        "I just called to say that I think it's absolutely important that reporters have the opportunity to use anonymous sources, but what I think is missing in the press is responsibility.",
        "The press hides neatly behind legislation which says that if they did not intend to get it wrong, then they aren't liable.",
        "Where, in fact, every other person in every other industry in the country is indeed liable for getting it wrong, and within due course, before publishing a story, the press should hold its responsibility for verifying the story completely as sacred as their trust to use anonymous sources.",
        "All right.",
        "They should prove their story before they print their story.",
        "Well, let's get the first part of that--and thank you for calling, Warren.",
        "Brandt, do we get special treatment, and should the press have that kind of treatment?",
        "Well, you'd think we get some special treatment because the fact is in pursuing the truth you may not have all of it at that time.",

        "Democrats and Republicans are pursuing job providers constantly and trying to lure them or keep them in their states through the only tool they have really, which is state tax credits.",
        "And so to have the president chime in in some way is pretty interesting.",

        "One moral is that governors bring a knife to a gunfight in terms of global competition.",
        "On my own, I did not have the tools to be able to save Electrolux, and nor does any governor or any mayor in the country when you are going against the lowest-wage countries.",
