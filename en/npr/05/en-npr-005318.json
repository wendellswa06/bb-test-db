        "And, Farai, it's also going to cause journalists to also--so when he begins to say that `We have 50, 100,000 people who are on our e-mail database list and we attracted 20,000 people at a various rally,' again, you're not going to necessarily take those at face value.",
        "You shouldn't anyway, but again, it's going to cause people, I think, to be sure to double check to make sure that that is an accurate statement on his part.",
        "And remember, some of these numbers actually started to come out during court cases, and that's always the case.",
