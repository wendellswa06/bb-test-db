        "For a lot of black students with exotic names, apparently, your ability to do well in school goes down.",
        "Teachers don't take you seriously.",
        "The studied showed that a boy named Duquan(ph) was much more likely to score badly on reading and math tests than his sister, his biological sister, who would be named something like Debra.",
        "So how did you make a choice about your kids, and what do you think of studies like this?",
        "Well, look, they can...",
        "Well, I think studies like this are crucially important.",
        "In these days where racism is much more subtle and much more easily denied and classism as well, having this kind of study, like the study with the resumes--the fake resumes with the black names and the white names, exactly the same except for black-sounding names and the white-sounding names--and the black-sounding names were 50 percent less likely to be called in for the jobs, that sort of thing.",
        "So it's crucial that we be able to specify exactly what's going on in the classroom.",
        "But what's the solution is--our ability to affect the kind of low-income mothers who are giving their children these names is pretty low--our ability to do that.",
        "And also, should we?",
        "I mean, shouldn't we be able to call our children whatever we want to?",
        "So the work has got to be done in the classroom, and those of us who are our--because it doesn't say here.",
        "It may be that black teachers as well expect less from Duquan.",
        "I'm sorry, Debra, but...",
        "...(Unintelligible)",

        "Kids with Asian names actually ranked higher, not, you know, just based on ability, but...",
        "Right, than their own siblings with non-Asian names.",
        "So you could name your next child, you know, Bai Ling(ph) Dickerson and, you know, see if there's any differential in the test scores.",
