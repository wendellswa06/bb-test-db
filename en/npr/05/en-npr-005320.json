        "Now if the government is held accountable for upgrading to serve disabled prisoners, is it just going to hurt taxpayers, or is this a much needed reform that's really going to help everyone in the prison system?",
        "I think it's going to hit the taxpayers, but I think just in the context of the body of law, as the ADA has expanded--I mean, in fact, there's already a Supreme Court decision saying that the ADA does affect prisoners in other circumstances.",
        "I think it's going to expand in there as well, which is, quite frankly, a lot of why many people have problems with the ADA when it was first put together some--well, nearly 20 years ago now, I guess.",
        "Well, I hope it does force us to look at the cost, because maybe--first of all, a lot more states are examining the amount of dollars they're spending on prisons anyway and saying this whole 1980s, you know, decade attitude of law and order, throw everyone in the prison--they're realizing that when you have these kinds of decisions, if, indeed, they rule in favor of the disabled prisoners, it is going to have a huge financial impact.",
        "Maybe it should cause us to examine why we build so many prisons at such a high cost.",
        "And should a lot of these folks actually be in prison vs. being in other kinds of programs?",

        "Well, Debra, let me ask you, do you think that this--you know, if the prison costs spiral completely out of control--they're already quite high--do you think it will call for more reform?",
        "If you mean more reform of our criminal justice policies--is lock up as many people as is humanly possible--I certainly do hope that we reform that and actually dispense justice as opposed to locking up, you know, a certain segment of the public that we deem basically criminal.",
        "But whatever our policy, once somebody ends up in jail, how can it--why do we have to have a discussion about whether or not they need to be able to move around, whether or not they need to be able to go to the bathroom under their own power, to bathe themselves, to be able to turn their wheelchairs around in their cells?",

        "Well, I think there's a possibility of that, but I think the irony here is that--I'm not necessarily sure that this is going to be completely a partisan issue, because something that's been sort of--been just kind of flown under the radar of late is that there is a growing segment coming actually from the Christian right to start reforming some prisons, because their interpretation of the Bible is the feeling that they need help their fellow man there.",
