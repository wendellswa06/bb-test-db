        "Well, the original point of this mission was to go on a reconnaissance patrol out to this village with...",

        "Exactly - with dozens of Nigerian troops.",
        "But there are some reports that perhaps they saw some suspected terrorists on motorbikes and maybe pursued them.",
        "So that's a question we don't know.",
        "General Dunford was asked that.",
        "He said, I have no indications at this point that the mission changed from its original intent.",
        "So that's one more question here.",
        "So the early indication is they weren't lured off by some kind of possible target of opportunity.",
        "But the next question is did they have adequate intelligence, which is perhaps a way of asking, were they lured into an ambush?",
        "Right.",
        "Well, they said it was a low-risk mission.",
        "So the question is how did they know it was low-risk?",
        "Did they sort of have surveillance of this area prior to going out?",
        "They've been on patrol with the Nigerian forces many times before.",
        "Did they just assume it would be OK?",
        "Now, if they did have a drone covering them while they were on the mission or before, you're clearly going to be able to pick up 50 armed fighters in vehicles.",
        "Now...",
        "I've seen many drone feeds over the years, and they are very exact.",
        "It's - you can see everything from the drones.",
        "So then you've got to ask, how could they have been surprised?",
        "Which leads to a bigger question - when a dozen Special Forces troops are out there, small unit, do they have the kind of massive backup that they can call on if they get in trouble?",
        "Well, you want to have that quickly as possible.",
        "But in some countries, let's say Afghanistan, where there are a lot of American aircraft, helicopters and so forth, you would have help coming very quickly.",
        "In this case, they call for help an hour into the firefight.",
        "They've got a drone heading their way, an American drone.",
        "And then it took an hour for French aircraft and helicopters to come to their rescue.",

        "Blacks are much more willing than whites in Virginia to say that they accept the governor's apology.",
        "Well, to your point, I mean, shortly after the photo became public, national figures quickly put out statements saying things like Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately.",
        "That was from the former vice president, Joe Biden.",
        "New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who is running for president, of course, said the photo eroded all confidence in Governor Northam's ability to lead.",
        "But what you're telling us is that Virginia voters, particularly African-American voters and Democratic voters in Virginia, don't accept that.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "And I think one of the most interesting if not the most interesting finding in this poll is that there is a huge chasm between the Democratic Party elites and their rank-and-file party identifiers in the public.",
        "And we cannot know for sure, of course, in every case whether this was a sincere conviction or if it was based on some judgment that it was politically necessary to jump on this bandwagon and demand that the governor step down.",

        "I do want to ask you about Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax.",
        "As we know, he has been accused of sexual assault by two different women.",
        "Was there data on what people - what did people say about that - whether he should stay or he should go?",

        "So we did have the polling data that reflected the first accusation against Lieutenant Governor Justin Fairfax.",
        "And most people in the survey said at that point, they were willing to withhold judgment on the particular issue, on the accusation.",
        "So it was not a very strong endorsement for him.",
        "But again, that's sort of the midway point of these two accusations.",
        "The public largely was saying they wanted to take a wait and see attitude and - you know, before they made any particular judgment one way or the other.",
        "So finally, though, digging back into kind of the history here, you also ask people if they had worn blackface or knew someone who had.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Tell us what you found.",
        "And what do you make of the answer?",
        "Right.",
        "Eleven percent of Virginians said that either they themselves had done so or they knew someone who has done so in the past.",
        "Now, in my network, that's surprising.",
        "I don't know anybody who's done that.",
        "But I've heard other people say maybe 11 percent is even too less.",
        "You know, that - they think that many more people at least know somebody else.",
        "But this is always a problem with surveys, and we all know this, right?",
        "That when you have an uncomfortable question like that - have you ever worn blackface or know somebody who has done so?",
        "- I am sure that there are a good many people who are just not willing to admit to that to a pollster.",
        "And we can all understand why."
