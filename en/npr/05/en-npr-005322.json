        "We have been tracking this, of course.",
        "But when I spoke with Ken Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, he pointed to a second trend going on at the same time and that is authoritarian leaders harshly cracking down on both their political opponents and civil society groups that are trying to make governments more accountable.",
        "Here's how he put it.",
        "A series of authoritarian governments are increasingly afraid of their societies.",
        "And in particular, they're afraid of the possibility of civic groups using social media to mobilize significant numbers in the streets to protest against misrule or corruption by the authoritarian leaders.",
        "Wow, so a chain of cause and effect here, there's more social media, more free communication.",
        "Authoritarian governments feel more threatened, so they crack down more.",

        "There's the Ukraine revolution, the occupy movement in Hong Kong.",
        "And he says these social media-fueled uprisings really have grabbed attention in other capitals.",
        "Here's how he describes it.",
        "Each of these started by a group of NGOs, civic groups, but they were able to magnify their voices and really rally many to the streets by using social media.",
        "And that is a combination that autocrats are terrified of.",
        "So they have taken the offensive and have tried to shut down the ability of these groups to organize.",
        "OK, they have taken the offensive.",
        "Who's they?",
        "Who's doing this?",
        "Well, the way he puts it is just as the activists were learning from other uprisings that some of these authoritarian leaders are watching each other and learning new techniques, finding out what works, who's doing it, Russia and China, very familiar names, are high on the list.",
        "He says they've been cracking down on dissent even more now as their economies stumble.",
        "Anti-terror laws are popular, but so is prosecution of civil society groups or academics as is happening here in Turkey, for example.",

        "Ethiopia has a rule.",
        "You can only have 10 percent foreign funding if you're an NGO.",
        "And in a country that poor, that basically cripples civil society there.",
        "So it's a lot of countries on the list - Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, Vietnam.",
        "And I'm leaving a lot out.",
        "It's a long list.",
        "I think some people might even be surprised by some of those names.",

        "Neruda got to meet Soviet cosmonauts, and he wrote this untitled poem about space travel.",

        "Among astral bodies polished and glistening like grass at dawn, something new came from the earth.",
        "One of the things that made Neruda so beloved was that he wrote exquisite poems about grandiose themes like the cosmos and human nature, but he also found wonder in the mundane.",
        "He penned odes to a tomato, wine, a pair of socks.",
        "Gander says Neruda was deeply influenced by the accessible poetry of Walt Whitman."
