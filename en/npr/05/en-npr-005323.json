        "And they said, Miss Jones, you can nix the part about marriage.",
        "We're just interested in the part about being good dads, and that's when one student said, marriage is for white people.",
        "Now, your essay suggests that what may have been considered a crisis during the era of the Moynihan Report is now kind of a norm in black families.",
        "Single, female-headed households predominate.",
        "What kind of hit you in your heart when you heard that kid say that?",
        "Well, I was stunned that he had that particular viewpoint.",
        "And I want to say I did bring in that panel anyway--of married people--all of whom are still married, among those couples that I brought in for that discussion.",
        "I was encouraged that there was such an interest in wanting to know what are the parameters that define good fatherhood, because they were very seriously considering, what do I need to do to be there for my children in the event the I have them?",
        "The girls were a little bit more traditional in their expectations in terms of falling in love and getting married, but it did concern me that none of the boys seemed to think marriage was such a great idea.",
        "Their reasoning was that marriage seemed to be so fraught with drama that most of the couples that they did know seemed to be arguing or divorcing, and it caused so much turmoil in the family that it seemed simpler, in their minds, not to even go through the charade and just focus on raising their children.",
        "The ironic twist is, at that time, I was fully expecting to become married myself, and although that was ten years ago--ten plus years ago--I am a single woman, myself.",
        "Jeff, let me turn to you.",
        "Do you buy into the thesis of the Moynihan Report that black families are crumbling because of the lack of marriage or the lack of stable marriage?"
