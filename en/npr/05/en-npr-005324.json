        "Good morning, Steve.",
        "What have you seen?",
        "Well, you know, like most structures on the island, I mean, some have been heavily damaged, some schools have been heavily damaged, and some are in really great shape.",
        "I mean, we've seen schools with classrooms that caved in because of toppled trees, classrooms that were flooded with water levels reaching, you know, higher than the chalkboards.",
        "And then we've seen schools that have suffered minimal damage.",
        "And is this only a eastern United States-Caribbean phenomenon, or do dust storms happen all over?",
        "At some of these schools, teachers have been out since a few days since the storm clearing away debris, scraping away damaged paint, replacing desks and scraping away mold in classrooms, basically just trying to get schools ready for kids to come back as soon as officials give them the green light to do that.",
        "OK, so some schools just needed a cleaning.",
        "But it sounds like other schools are devastated.",
        "What's the plan for the schools that are devastated?",
        "If you're going to build a new building, that could take a year.",
        "Yeah, so, I mean, officials are having to figure out all sorts of different sort of solutions to these problems, right?",
        "So they're sending out inspectors to each school.",
        "And there are 1,100 across the island - 1,100 public schools across the island.",
        "So what they're needing to do is essentially figure out if they need to send kids to alternate schools for the time being while they reconstruct some schools.",
        "Some schools are, unfortunately, going to have to be shut down.",
        "But basically, what's happening is the engineers are going - beginning first in the least-affected regions of the island and giving the green light for those schools to reopen and they're moving on to more damaged regions.",
        "And what the secretary of education told me was that the goal is to have schools online on every part of the island by mid to late November.",
        "I'm thinking about the vital role of schools here on the mainland.",
        "I'm sure it can't be any different in Puerto Rico.",
        "Is it - I mean, you want kids to go to school just so they go to school.",
        "But also, if kids aren't in school, their parents can't work because somebody has to look after the kids.",
        "And with poor kids, they may be depending on schools to provide them with the school lunch.",
        "This has got to be pretty vital to a lot of communities.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "I mean, communities and especially in a lot of rural areas and in urban areas too are just vital community centers, right?",
        "And you're right, a lot of parents, not only can they not work but a lot of people are still making - are still standing in line every day just to get water, to get cash out of the ATM, to buy milk, to get gasoline.",
        "And these are the sorts of things that become a lot more difficult when you have kids that you can't drop off at school because those kids are needing to be entertained and essentially taken care of."

        "And so what a lot of teachers at schools that I've visited have told me is they feel like they aren't being able - allowed to do their part - being able to do their part right now because kids can't come back to school and they just want to basically assume that role again of being not only teachers but also these sort of pillars of the community where people can come and feel like they have a place where the kids will feel safe and they can resume their daily lives and try to get back to normal as quickly as possible.",

        "A decade later, print is outselling digital.",
        "And Amazon is opening brick-and-mortar stores, seven so far.",

        "Make no mistake.",
        "This is no fusty old shop where a customer can get lost in the stacks.",
        "There are no stacks.",
        "Instead, books are shelved with the covers facing out.",
        "And Cast says the store is organized around features familiar to anyone who has ever bought a book on Amazon, features like, if you like this, you'll love this.",
        "These features are based on data collected on the website or on Kindles.",
        "And data, Cast says, is at the heart of the store."
