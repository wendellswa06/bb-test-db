        "And they have to race the clock to save victims from otherwise certain death.",
        "The place is the subject of a new documentary called \"\"Code Black.\"\" Ryan McGarry directed the film.",
        "He's an ER doc himself and trained at County Hospital.",

        "It's in.",

        "This hurt here?",
        "This hurt here on your leg?",
        "When McGarry started filming, the hospital was in a facility built in the 1930s.",
        "And at the center of the emergency room was a tiny and chaotic area reserved for the most critical patients.",
        "It was called C-booth.",
        "As one doctor says in the film, more people have died in that small square footage than anywhere else in the country.",
        "But more people have also been saved there than anywhere else.",
        "McGarry explained what made C-booth so legendary.",
        "L.A.",
        "County Hospital's one of the first places that emergency medicine was formed as a specialty.",
        "And it's important to recognize that emergency medicine, as is 911, are actually fairly young.",
        "I mean, these are 1960s and 1970s developments in this country.",
        "And so this is where it's thought the specialty was born.",
        "And C-booth, which - it's been lost to history - but we think that means either critical booth or cardiac booth.",
        "It's kind of where the sickest patients would come.",
        "And as a training physician, it's where you would oversee up to six or seven or even more of these critically ill patients.",
        "And the types of cases that you're seeing at County Hospital, you know, aside from like the trauma cases - there's a type of patient that comes there because you don't turn anyone away.",
        "That's right.",
        "So even post-Obamacare, we're seeing throughout the country emergency room visits go up.",
        "And that might be counterintuitive, but what we're finding is that yes, more people have access - more people are getting insurance cards.",
        "But those cards aren't always premium.",
        "And we're already in a system where a lot of specialists won't take a sub-premium insurance card because you're not seen as profitable enough.",
        "So many people end up coming to public hospital emergency departments just to see an orthopedist or endocrinologist or someone who won't take their probably decent insurance, but it's not good enough.",
        "Now, you are there to film a major shift.",
        "L.A.",
        "County Hospital underwent a renovation in 2008 and they moved to a new earthquake-resistant building.",
        "You wouldn't think it would be so dramatic a change because they're basically moving almost across the street to a new facility.",
        "It's the same people, but things changed dramatically.",
        "Can you explain what happened?",
        "It's hard to quantify, but you know for a fact if you look at the numbers that, you know, men's incomes have been shrinking while women's and other groups' have been growing.",
        "That means price raises in basic things like rent, bread, fuel.",
        "I mean gasoline is beyond the capacity of most people to pay.",
        "The lines are very long for people are trying to get buses, I'm told.",
        "The public hospitals in Zimbabwe are just jammed to the seams.",
        "The doctors are on strike because they're not getting enough pay.",
        "So you can imagine what's happening to the poor people.",
        "What's causing it is the inflation, of course, is leading to wildcat strikes and things like that.",
        "Now, President Mugabe says that this is not mismanagement.",
        "That this is government sabotage by the West, particularly Great Britain which he still regards as the archenemy.",
        "But I think you'd get a strong argument for most economic analysts and of course the political analysts blamed all of this on the government, which is why they continue to strike as the country goes deeper into poverty.",
        "And there is the expectation that there will be more and more protests."

        "He's invited them back, only a handful have answered that call.",

        "The ruling African National Congress just celebrated its 95th year - that's not 95 years of ruling but 95 years of existing - making it the oldest liberation movement on the continent.",
        "And though has been the ruling party in South Africa since the end of apartheid, the celebration comes at a time when it's facing a tough challenge, you know, the issue is something called WHAM 2.",

        "The last time there were Inkatha-Zulu clashes was in the run up to the '94 election when thousands of people were murdered, injured, maimed, all kinds of violence, and nobody wants to see this young Democratic country go back to that.",
        "Now there are those, however, who say that this is just a sign of a young democracy moving into becoming a mature democracy.",

        "So of necessity, all the things that held the ANC together, the single mindedness of its original caucus, those have been achieved.",
        "And there are lots of other issues on the table now, you know, the vast discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots, economic policy that has benefited a few people here in South Africa but not the vast majority.",
        "So these things are going to play out even as the debate between the Zuma people and the Mbeki people continues.",
        "Most people do think, however, that even though it's a young democracy, there are institutions in place that will see it through this time of turmoil.",
