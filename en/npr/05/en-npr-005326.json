        "How far will the compact go in protecting this resource for the people in the region?",
        "We're also going to check in on the health of the lake: from falling lake levels to invasive species, residues of drugs and personal care products, to polluted runoff from agricultural, residential, and urban areas, the lakes are suffering stresses that could threaten their long-term liability.",

        "Kavanaugh said no. Later, it came out that he had had some of those conversations.",
        "Durbin's certainly going to focus on that today.",
        "He feels like he was lied to in that 2006 hearing.",
        "And Democrats say that's a perfect example of why they need to see everything Kavanaugh was doing in the White House.",

        "I think you're going to hear a lot about policies like like abortion rights.",

        "You're going to also hear a lot about executive power.",
        "Kavanaugh has written in some legal journals that he thinks that a sitting president shouldn't have to deal with subpoenas, criminal investigations - which is quite the view for someone who worked on Ken Starr's investigation of President Bill Clinton.",
        "But Kavanaugh said his mind had changed.",
        "That's certainly a very relevant topic right now as President Trump and the White House are being investigated by Robert Mueller.",
        "Which is what Dick Durbin also pointed out.",
        "It was almost - as Durbin was painting it, didn't matter who was sitting there as the nominee.",
        "The fact that this person has been tapped by this president, who is currently under investigation - it creates some baggage for this particular Supreme Court nominee."

        "And it seems to really corroborate what we've been hearing all along about the Trump White House.",

        "Well, for example, top White House officials removed paper - Gary Cohn, top economic adviser, removed a piece of paper off of Trump's desk because he thought that if Trump signed it and removed the United States from an agreement with South Korea, it would be bad for national security.",
        "There's also another anecdote of Trump's lawyers running kind of a mock Q&A with him to imitate what a Mueller investigation interview would be like and those lawyers then saying the president essentially failed that experiment.",
        "Right.",
        "And it quotes John Dowd, the president's former lawyer, as telling the president that he should not testify - he should not be interviewed by Robert Mueller because \"\"it's either that or an orange jumpsuit.",

        "The secretary of defense, Mattis, said that he never uttered the words that were attributed to him in the book.",
        "The president denied having any papers taken off his desk.",
        "But what really struck me about the White House response was how it seemed less intense than the way they responded to Michael Wolff who wrote \"\"Fire And Fury\"\" or Omarosa Manigault Newman.",
        "It's harder for the White House to undermine the credibility of Bob Woodward, someone who's won two Pulitzer Prizes and has never had his reporting debunked."
