        "One more thing to get to with you, Mara - the New York Times reported last night that special counsel Mueller has informed the president's legal team that he would accept some answers in writing from the president on whether or not his campaign conspired with Russia in the 2016 election.",
        "What can you tell us there?",
        "Could you please discuss the importance of preserving prime agricultural farmland that has a sustainable supply of ground water to produce food, so we can feed the people as well as have water to drink?",
        "Well, several news organizations are reporting that Bob Mueller has said, yes, he would accept written answers about possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.",
        "What we don't know are the conditions under which Mueller would accept answers relating to questions of obstruction of justice.",
        "And we know this big tension about whether the president should sit down with Mueller figured in the Woodward book.",
        "And we don't know...",
        "Whether or not that's been decided.",

        "They have come to Washington to address how their companies have responded to the threat of hacking and foreign influence campaigns ahead of the all-important midterm elections - and whether their response has evolved over time.",

        "So Tim, as David said, these people have answered these questions before.",

        "I mean, what are the questions lawmakers still have to put forward?",
        "Yeah.",
        "They're going to be answering questions on how seriously they're actually taking the threat of foreign influence operations on social media.",
        "And there is an increasing sense of seriousness amongst a lot of big tech firms about how their platform could actually be used against American democracy.",
        "Facebook, for example, is going to emphasize how they're doubling the number of people that they're hiring and employing to work on safety and security issues.",
        "But there's one big firm that won't be there at all.",
        "And that's Google, which has declined to send founder Larry Page or its CEO to appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
        "And there's a bipartisan consensus from Republican Chairman Richard Burr and Democratic Co-chairman Mark Warner that Google's offer to send its chief legal officer was actually insufficient.",
        "So during today's hearing, we're actually expecting an empty chair to be placed in the room to represent Google's absence.",
        "Oh, wow - a little theater there.",
        "So I mean, do you get the sense that these companies are taking this threat more seriously.",
        "I mean, it requires admitting a vulnerability - right?",
        "- or requires them admitting, oh, we weren't doing it all right before.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Facebook in particular is trying to make a good faith effort towards transparency in addressing some of these concerns.",
        "And some of this is driven by the nature of the threat.",
        "There's no sign it's actually diminishing.",
        "This past month, we had Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter - all announced they discovered new foreign influence operations.",
        "Iran was revealed to have created a worldwide disinformation campaign.",
        "And on top of that, we saw new Russian disinformation campaigns and apparent hacking attempts.",
        "People are on red alert.",
        "So what is Congress's role here?",
        "I mean, they have suggested that there might be some kind of regulation they could put in place to help these companies, to hold them account.",
        "Is that really in the offing?",
        "They're considering everything from new online ad disclosures or tougher automatic sanctions on foreign actors like Russia.",
        "But the big question is whether or not this is the kind of thing that could be solved by legislation.",
        "The threat is super multidimensional, everything from hacking to bot networks to disinformation campaigns to election infrastructure security.",
        "And some of this can be solved by people using things like multifactor security on their emails and being just more judicious about what they read online and what they believe.",
        "Right.",
        "The onus is on us, the users...",
        "Absolutely."
