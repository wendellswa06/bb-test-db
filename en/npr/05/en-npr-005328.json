        "I see a lake so deep, more than 1300 feet, that her steepest underwater canyon is the lowest spot on the North American continent.",
        "I see a lake so large that she could swallow all four of the other Great Lakes and still have room to spare.",
        "I see the mother of all lakes, the headwaters of a great basin that holds one-fifth of all the fresh surface water on the planet.",
        "I see a five-lake ecosystem that contains enough water to cover the Lower 48 - every American acre south of the Canadian border - with 9.5 feet of crystal clear Great Lakes water.",
        "I see an ecosystem that quenches the thirst of billions of creatures and some 40 million people in the U.S.",
        "and two Canadian provinces.",
        "Today, I stand on the shores of Lake Superior and I see a naive innocent, a voluptuous bounty on the verge of violation.",
        "I see millions of angry, parched people from far-flung venues who view undeveloped water as a wasted opportunity.",
        "I see dry-land farmers clamoring with sharp spigots, claiming they can't feed the world without more irrigation.",

        "I see international entrepreneurs rubbing their hands with the thought of getting rich from something that comes out of the ground for free.",
        "I see wasteful water practices throughout the Great Lakes Basin that historians will look back upon with scorn.",
        "I see water - clear, cold, luscious water - that most see the value in taking, and few see the value in leaving.",
        "I see millions upon millions of Great Lakes residents who underestimate the struggle that awaits them.",
        "Today, when I stand on the shores of Lake Superior, I don't see a lake.",
        "I see a sprawling, deep blue battleground that stretches from Duluth, Minnesota, to Trois Rivieres, Quebec, and I wonder, who will win the war?",
        "So you foresee it, and you talk about it in your book, all these stresses on the lake, all the people who want the water here, and the people who are very precious, feel that the water is very precious to them, don't they, Rebecca?",
        "Yes, they do.",

        "And so, they - so, to all of you, this compact is intended to take care of those fears, would that be correct?",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's kind of a visionary document, that's being passed by, hopefully all of the Great Lakes states, and two provinces in Canada that border the states, that will ultimately protect the waters by limiting who can take water out of those Great Lakes to those that are within the watershed of the Great Lakes.",
        "And the Canadians feel they fit in with this?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are - the Canadian provinces actually, were some of the first to protest some of the major withdrawals that were proposed by some of the Asian companies, for taking water out of the Great Lakes and shipping it overseas.",
        "Uh-huh.",

        "Peter, what do you think?",
        "Well, what Congress is saying is, if you're going to get us the compact, try and get it to us before 2010, because the Great Lakes region lost nine seats in the eight Great Lakes states from Minnesota to New York in the last census.",
        "And it's anticipated that the region will lose many more seats in the next census in 2010.",
        "So, they're saying if you're going to get it to us, get it to us before 2010.",
        "Because those new seats may be in the southwest, with the Sun Belt, and they say, hey, we may want some of that water.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "That's the fear anyway.",

        "There have been a lot of comments.",
        "The most recent one that really rattled the region was when Governor Richardson of New Mexico was a presidential candidate.",
        "And he said, during a meeting with the editorial board at the Las Vegas Sun, that states like Wisconsin are \"\"awash in water,\"\" quote, unquote, and that the nation should embark upon a national water plan that might examine ways to share this water with other parts of the country.",
        "So, that got the editorial writers hopping up around here.",
        "How much of the water - and I ask all of you - how much of the water is replaced every year?",
        "You lose it to evaporation, people using it.",
        "Val, how much...",
        "It's about one percent.",
        "And that's part of the difficulty with the Great Lakes, is that I think we've oversold the vastness of it.",
        "It - despite its size, it's a surprisingly fragile system.",
        "So, for example, the water residence time in Lake Michigan is a hundred years.",
        "So, anything we toss, leak, or let get into the system - I always say, if you let it go in today, there's a good chance you'll drink it tomorrow.",
        "And these are also - so these are closed basins, so that's one issue.",
        "Another issue is that they're relatively young, in terms of evolutionary time.",
        "They have very simple food chains, and they're very susceptible to perturbation by species which come from outside.",
        "There are some 200 exotic species have invaded these lakes and dramatically changed the food web.",
        "We'll get to all these issues, and come back, and talk more, and take your questions about the Great Lakes, and why they're so valuable, and why people want to get their water from there.",

        "Do they feel like they're left out?",
        "Well, it's been a topic of much conversation lately, and we're in the process of working on a water supply plan for our entire region, not just the city of Waukesha, but the entire region and, you know, that subcontinental divide is as close as three miles, or even a little less to Lake Michigan in the southern part of our region, but is as much as 20 miles away in the northern; however, all those communities on the west side cannot readily get access to Lake Michigan water.",
        "The purpose of our plan is to look at a sustainable way of developing the water resources and the water supply for communities such as Waukesha, and others as well.",
        "Waukesha being a community outside of the Great Lake space but in a straddling county, under the compact there is a provision where they could obtain Lake Michigan water.",
        "One of the main provisions there is that it be returned back to the lake, and that's one of the options that's being looked at under our plan, but there are many other options that would not even look at extending water supply from Lake Michigan across that divide.",
        "Let me see if I can get a quick call in from Ed Kramer in Chicago.",
        "Hi Ed.",
        "Yes, the compact is essentially a ban on diversion of Great Lakes water outside of the Great Lakes basin, the soup bowl rim that surrounds the five Great Lakes, with limited exceptions.",
        "That's the bottom line.",
        "It's a ban on diversions outside the Great Lakes basin, with limited exceptions.",
        "Those two key exceptions are straddling communities, a community that sits right on top of the soup bowl rim, and a straddling county.",

        "A community can apply for water from their local governor under the compact and get permission to divert water outside the basin, as Mike said, as long as they return the water after it's used: treat it to Clean Water Act standards and return the water after its use.",
        "A straddling county has a higher bar.",
        "They also have to agree to return the water, and to practice conservation, but they have to receive the approval of all eight Great Lakes governors, not just their home governors, so it's a - it's because it's farther away from the soup bowl rim, that they have a higher bar.",

        "Well, it's - there's a few things.",
        "First of all, as I mentioned earlier, we are defined by water here.",
        "People in the west are defined by their mountains, or their old growth forests that are left, or coastal areas are defined by their oceans, etc. We are defined here by the Great Lakes in particular, and so, these are the talismans, the ecological, the industrial, the sociological talismans that we hang on to very tightly here, and so yes, we feel very protective of it, but we also look in horror, around the country and the world, at other watersheds that have been abused and thrashed by public policy in the past.",
