        "Val Klump, let's talk about the science of the Great Lakes.",
        "We've been talking a bit about the politics here.",
        "Is the compact based on good sound science?",
        "Well, I mean, in essence, the compact allows us to manage this system as a system for the first time ever, in other words it's - would look at the system as a whole system, rather than as divided up in various political boundaries.",
        "That allows us to apply science when we come to manage this system.",
        "Such as?",
        "Well, for example, with respect to issues on down the road, with respect to like, climate change, for example.",
        "I mean, global climate changing and warming, the two - one of the two major outputs of those models are increases in temperature, or changes in temperature, and changes in precipitation, and those are the two things, which probably impact Great Lakes and hydrologic systems worldwide more than anything else.",
        "And so there, these lakes are very susceptible to changes in climate.",
        "..TEXT: It's supposed to get a little bit wetter, it's supposed to get warmer.",
        "Right now, it looks like warm is going to trump wet, and in the long run, we may actually see lower Great - lower levels in the Great Lakes.",
        "That's still an open question, but you know, it's - you can - it's easy to figure out what the water is worth at the other end of the pipeline, to a farmer in Kansas or wherever.",
        "It's difficult to answer what's the value to the ecosystem on our end of the pipeline, and that's something that needs to - that science needs to be there.",
        "Do the lakes all have to be treated as a unit?",
        "As one, you know, you can't look at one lake versus the other lake, and the health and the science of it.",
        "Right, because they are connected hydrologically.",
        "When water flows, lake levels in Lake Superior are low, I mean, that has repercussions throughout the whole system.",
        "These are - and climatically, they're linked.",
        "They act like a big air conditioner for the East Coast.",
        "It's estimated that Philadelphia is a couple of degrees cooler in the summertime because of the Great Lakes.",

        "One of the key issues with global warming and the water supply is the cost of fuel, obviously, and the water required to grow food in the region, so local production of food is very important.",
        "The next place to expand the sewer and water from Lake Michigan is a prime square mile of prime agricultural farmland.",
        "Sure.",
        "I'm not familiar with the specific location that you're speaking of, but certainly maintaining open lands of an agricultural nature or of a natural resources value is very important to maintaining ground water recharge.",
        "And I might also mention, under the study that we're doing right now, one of the major efforts of that study is to identify, through some very detailed modeling that's being done, along with the state geological and natural history survey and the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the U.S.",
        "Geological Survey, is identifying ground water recharge areas.",
        "Those areas that should be preserved, and considered when development decisions are made, in terms of creating a sustainable ground water resource.",
        "Rebecca Klaper?",
        "It brings up...",
        "Yeah, go ahead.",
        "It brings up a couple of points, too, that, you know, we talk about the surface water of the Great Lakes being this huge water resource, but there's also a huge ground water resource that almost trumps the amount that we see on our surface water resource, that also needs to really be managed.",
        "An aquifer?"

        "Yeah.",
        "So the water that's found underground, and there are many, many communities in the United States that depend on their ground water resources for their water, and that's somewhat dealt with in this compact agreement, but, you know, it needs to be dealt with along with surface water issues, because they're very connected to each other.",
        "The ground water feeds the surface water in most cases, so both of them need to be considered.",
        "And the other point that was brought up by the gentleman about agriculture being an issue with our water resources, that's a - it's a huge consumer of water, and with - along with power as another one, generating our power can be a consumptive, and also use where we just use it for cooling water towers, let's say, and putting it back in the environment.",
        "But with the new biodiesel programs coming up, where we're depending on our agricultural land to develop our fuel, water seldom comes up in that discussion, and it's a huge water consumptive use, and needs to be considered in those discussions about how much we invest in biodiesel, let's say, as a power resource.",

        "Yes, hi.",
        "I don't really have a question, but I have a comment that the Great Lakes were instrumental to the Industrial Revolution.",
        "And it was that industry that defeated the Nazi Germany's campaign of world domination.",
        "Now, it seems that we've been left behind, and we're referred to as a Rust Belt.",

        "Do you want to - Val?",
        "Well, the caller's got a good point, and the fact is our region in Wisconsin, the seven counties here in the southeastern region, have identified four or five areas of focus for economic development, because we have lost manufacturing jobs and one of those is freshwater science and technology development.",
        "It turns out in this area there are over 120 different companies that are involved in developing water technology, water research, products that use water, and products that are used in dealing with water.",
        "So, it is an opportunity for our community, and for this region in general to use this asset.",

        "It may be sunny there, but you may have serious water problems on down the line.",
        "Businessmen hate uncertainty.",
        "One of the things, if you need water, it will not be uncertain here in the Great Lakes, as you will have a supply of clean, good quality water on into the indefinite future."

        "And that was one of the challenges in drafting the compact, is that there was a keen desire to create a sustainable water management agreement that would allow industry here to continue to thrive as much as possible, because of the bountiful water supply source and to attract industry here.",
        "So, it's a sustainable business model, as well as a sustainable ecological model.",

        "Why don't we plug the bathtub there?",
        "Peter, do you want to...",
        "Yes, this is a - it's hard to answer this in a quick way, but so we are talking about the St. Clair River.",
        "The St. Clair River is the outlet of Lake Huron.",
        "And over the last century, the Corps of Engineers and sand mining companies dredged out the bottom of the St. Clair River, and if you think of it like the drain in the Lake Huron bathtub, it widened the bathtub and more water rushed through, lowering water levels on Lakes Michigan and Huron, which are hydrologically one lake, by 14 inches.",

        "So, again, it's not just an environmental issue, an economic issue.",
        "So, as this water rushes through this widened drain in the bathtub, over time studies now suggest that it has eroded away this area even wider, possibly lowering water levels by perhaps an additional foot.",
        "So, we are talking 26 inches now over the last 100 years, between the manmade intentional and the inadvertent potential erosion.",
        "Well, they are now studying how much of this potential water fall - water drop in levels is, because of this, how much may be due to climate changes Val was mentioning earlier.",
        "There is a lot of complexity in trying to figure out exactly what all the different water level drops are from, before they can go in with a solution.",
        "And so they hope to release a study early next year with potential solutions to this problem.",
        "Nevertheless, when you are out there running aground, you kind of do want them to hurry up a little bit.",

        "These are - the Great Lakes are not very diverse.",
        "They are very simple food webs, very simple food chains.",

        "And there are some very notorious ones, the lamprey eel, which basically wiped out the lake trout in the '50s - '40s and '50s, the alewife, and more recently the zebra mussel and its sister, the quagga mussel, have dramatically changed this ecosystem.",
        "So, it is a very non-steady state system.",
        "The past in not a key to the future, and it can have significant impacts on the system.",
        "We have for example, extremely good water clarity now, as a result of the zebra mussels on the site of impacts.",
        "And that is that there's vast meadows now of algae, which grow on the bottom, because light penetrates much deeper than it used to."
