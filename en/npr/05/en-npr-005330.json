        "When algae breaks off or senesces and dies, and washes up on the beach, it stinks like a hog farm.",

        "So, it's invasive species.",
        "They are estimated, at least 200 have made it into this system.",
        "More are on their way, more coming in every day, I suspect.",
        "Some make it, some don't.",
        "We've heard also about the record fall of the lake levels here.",
        "Back east we see pictures of dry areas, is this a natural occurring cycle or is it a symptom of something else?",
        "It is a naturally occurring cycle in part, but it is also maybe a symptom of the future.",
        "Lake Michigan, for example, fluctuated normally about two meters, six feet.",
        "Right now, we're just a few inches above the all-time low, which was in '64, but the all-time recorded high was in '87.",
        "So it fluctuates dramatically.",
        "Lake Superior is at an 80-year low.",
        "Where does the water go?",
        "Well, there are two - I mean the basic control on the water level is the amount of rainfall we get, that comes in directly to the lake surface, which is about a third of the basin, the amount of runoff that goes into the lake as a result of rainfall, and the amount of evaporation.",
        "And of course, there's some outflow.",
        "And those two terms, input from precipitation and loss through evaporation, are controlled by climate.",
        "..TEXT: So if it gets wetter, we get more water coming in.",
        "On the other hand, if it gets warmer, we get more evaporation.",
        "And right now, as I said earlier, the warmer seems to be - going to be trumping the wetter.",
        "We are going to take a short break and come back, and talk lots more about the Great Lakes.",

        "Good afternoon, Ira, and hello, panel.",
        "I'm Boyd from Milwaukee.",
        "We had a record-breaking snowfall this past winter, lots of snow, and I know you mentioned before, Mr. Klump, that a lot of precipitation might help with the levels even - do you think if we have more winters like this, do you think this actually might benefit the Great Lakes over the long term or won't it really make much of a difference?",
        "The - you're right.",
        "We did have a good lot of snow pack this winter, and it is going to help the Great Lakes levels, but it doesn't respond very quickly.",
        "So, it's going to - may - it'll help.",
        "In the long run, predictions are that our winters will be warmer and wetter, that's good.",
        "But our summers will be warmer and drier, and that is not so good.",
        "So, the long-term prediction is for generally lower lake levels.",
        "And so - and it's because we have, you know, less precipitation balancing the amount of evaporation."

        "I see Mike Hahn wants to jump in there?",
        "Yes.",
        "Just another consideration related to our very severe winter and our heavy snowfalls is the fact that the distribution of that snowfall throughout the area that drains to the Great Lakes is a real factor in how much it can replenish the lakes.",
        "And even though we had all that heavy snowfall here, I mentioned before, the divide is only three to 20 miles away.",
        "So, in terms of the overall volume on the lake, it has a benefit when that snowfall melts, but it doesn't replenish enough, and certainly it's not going to be reversing that cycle that we are seeing right now - the downward trend.",
        "Peter?",
        "Well, there's a couple of things just to keep in mind with snow.",
        "If it's lake effect snow, its precipitation is coming from the lake and flowing right back into the lake.",
        "So, we have to - so part of it is how much of the snowfall this last year was lake effect snow.",
        "That's just a continual issue.",
        "And then there's research, a lot of research has been done in the climate change vein about ice cover.",
        "So, if you have - because a lot of the evaporation that occurs in the Great Lakes is actually in the winter, when there's not a lot of ice and we have dry air.",
        "And so, a lot of times water levels is not only just an issue of precipitation, but how much ice did we happen to have during the last winter.",

        "What about the contaminants we hear about in fresh water these days?",
        "Well, there are traditional contaminants, which people have heard about for a long time.",
        "PCBs and mercury being precipitated into the lake, or dumped into the lake.",
        "And now we have these classes that we've termed emerging contaminants, which can mean a couple of different things.",
        "It can mean contaminants that are truly new, that haven't been produced before, and might be released out into the environment, not only to lakes, but also to the land.",
        "And then we also have compounds that have been around for a long time, including things like our pharmaceuticals, our drugs that we take for various diseases, that obviously we've been taking for a very long time, but we have only been able to measure these things in the environment for a much shorter period of time.",
        "We've, just in the latest decade, come up with technologies to measure the very low levels that occur in the environment.",
        "Can you see that in the fish in the lakes, the evidence of the contaminants?"

        "Collectively, big picture wise, would that have a big impact?",
        "Mike Hahn, any comment?",
        "Yeah, I think we've done some work recently that would indicate that that could have a very significant impact, and one thing that we've looked at over the past five years in doing water quality planning is the possibility of converting a lot of the more marginal agricultural land for example into riparian buffers.",
        "We're very fortunate here in much of Southeastern Wisconsin, particularly in Milwaukee County, along the river system that drains to Lake Michigan, we have a series of parkways that were developed over 80 years ago.",
        "And those themselves serve as a buffer and an environmental corridor that helps to protect that resource, as the runoff is either infiltrated or filtered as it passes through there.",
        "So yes, that could have a very significant impact if done properly and in a systematic way.",
        "And it would require some widespread installation of riparian-type buffers."

        "And there's another source that might not be as apparent and that's from water softeners that may discharge to septic systems on private lands and then that in turn drains into the ground water which forms a base flow of the streams.",
