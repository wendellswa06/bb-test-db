        "With respect to things like zebra mussels, we're past the tipping point.",
        "We now have to live with these organisms in the lake as Rebecca said.",
        "The good thing about the Great Lakes is they are, their volume is huge and so a lot of contamination gets quickly diluted.",
        "But that doesn't mean we haven't contaminated the system to a significant extent there.",
        "Some 43 areas around the Great Lakes were identified as being contaminated to the extent that they may impact human or wildlife health.",
        "So it is an issue.",
        "We've passed the tipping point in that respect, with respect to a lot of things.",
        "Mike, did you want to say something?",
        "I might just be able to offer you a little bit of a ray of hope.",
        "We've been looking at, as I may have mentioned before, trends over time, and we have seen some real positive developments too, in terms of water quality.",
        "When the original, regional quality plan was done in the late 1970s, there were a lot of point sources that needed to be controlled, as well as non-point sources.",
        "And a great effort was made and many billions of dollars were spent in the interim.",
        "And so there has been a real improvement.",
        "The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District deep tunnel going online made a measurable improvement in reduction of fecal coliform bacteria.",
        "So we are seeing some improvements too.",
        "This is Talk of the Nation, Science Friday from NPR News, broadcasting today from Milwaukee.",
        "And, yes, did you want to jump in there, Peter?",
        "Yes, I just wanted to, just to further Sara's point here.",
        "It's important that it is easy to kind of get down, because the lakes seem to be under siege from all sides at times.",
        "But turning back the clock, they do have a remarkable ability to recover and to hang in there, and sometimes thrive.",
        "Go back to the 1950s, '60s and '70s.",
        "You know, we have the Cuyahoga River catching on fire in Ohio and we have just extraordinary pollution.",
        "Lake Erie was declared biologically dead, et cetera.",
        "And the reason that we didn't have exotic species as an issue at that time is because the ballast water was dumped into harbors that were so polluted that the critters died.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So we actually have an exotic species problem because we cleaned up our harbors.",
        "So these are the sort of unanticipated you know, non-benefits of this kind of thing.",
        "But there has been progress that has been made, and what has really changed is that people have come back to the lakes.",
        "And they are embracing the lakes like never before, and they care.",
        "And so, in many ways, it's in the hands of the people now.",
        "Hi.",

        "I volunteer at Chicago Public Radio, and we have a problem here every summer with polluted water coming down from Milwaukee every time there's a rainstorm.",
        "Your sewage system dumps its water right into Lake Michigan, untreated sewage water, and it comes up on our beaches here and closes down the summer swimming.",

        "It's a good question.",
        "Mike, did you want to answer that?",
        "Sure, I'd take a stab at it at least.",
        "I'd like to respectfully disagree on that point.",
        "That was the case in Chicago around the turn of the century, and the Chicago River was reversed to deal with that issue.",
        "We can talk about the wisdom of that perhaps in another forum.",
        "But, in Milwaukee, we at one time, prior to that deep tunnel that I mentioned, had maybe 50 combined sewer overflows a year.",
        "Now, this is not totally raw, untreated sewage; it's a combination of sewage and a large volume of storm water run off, which has its own pollution issues.",
        "But it's not totally sewage.",
        "Since that deep tunnel went on line, those overflows are reduced to somewhere on the order of two to maybe three times a year, and the volume has been reduced greatly.",
        "We've even been able to show through some very sophisticated modeling that was done for the water quality plan, that the effect of the pollution plume that may enter the lake at certain times during large runoff events really doesn't even extend to our beaches, with the possible exception of a little bit to South Shore Beach.",
        "But there are many other issues that are causing the problems that I think that you're noticing, and that we're noticing here.",
        "And they're not all related to that issue at all.",
        "So the situation there has improved quite a bit.",

        "I think you'd have a lot of popularity with that.",

        "It's touch and go, but it could happen.",
        "There's a will there.",
        "It's just a matter of whether or not they can get it through their legislative schedule.",
        "And Ohio is the big wild card.",
        "Now there's been some publicity today in some of the Ohio newspapers that there's been some movement there.",
        "But it has been laggard and it has not been in a rush.",
        "It was actually one of the first states to step forward and pass it through one chamber, but then has backed off and really taken over the last place here.",
        "So it'll be an interesting thing to watch.",
        "And then of course as you mentioned, would go on to Congress from there.",
