        "One of them is actually increase your bottom line.",
        "Studies show that, not only do white families have a higher net worth than black families, but the lack of black marriage is actually eroding the kind of bottom line of the black family.",
        "How do you react to that, and then bringing in some of the issues of intimacy that you talk about in your book?",
        "Let me just sort of reset some of this, because I think there's an important perspective that we need to bring in here.",

        "Men have common concerns.",

        "So, to get to your actual question, that happens to be what I did my dissertation on was the whole idea of mate selection, how people select mates, why they select mates.",
        "And this whole idea about-basically, what we're getting into is this exchange theory orientation, where marriage becomes this quid pro quo thing.",
        "And that's good, but at a certain point, marriage has to be about a lot more than that.",
        "And you see these declining rates of marriage throughout society, not just in the African-American community.",
        "As Jeff alluded to, there are some particular issues and circumstances within the black community that might exacerbate these numbers, but this is not a black male pathology.",
        "This is an overall social issue we're looking at, and I think we do a great disservice to African-Americans if we tend to make things a black issue and pathologize ourselves.",

        "You know, the numbers in this article are shocking, but at the same time, these issues are not just us.",

        "Well, I think for too long, we have tried to push this myth that the only way to be happy is through marriage, and for those of us--I don't know about William, but I know for me certainly--for those of us who are married, that may not be particularly true.",
        "Marriage is one of the hardest things that you can ever do in life.",

        "I think there's some very basic things that we need to look at with regard to marriage.",
        "Certainly, the first thing is, it must be about love.",
        "Marriages that, where people get together for convenience, or simply, and I think William alluded to this, simply just for the money doesn't really work.",
        "You have to be friends, you have to be in love, and you have to keep that going.",
        "I think that each and every one of us as couples have to have a conversation as to what our marriages are about, and how they change in our lifetimes.",
        "How they change during the lifespan of that particular marriage, and how we need to adjust in order for each of us to still have some sort of happiness as we meld into, sometimes into one person, or one unit.",
        "That's a conversation that we don't have often enough and why I think we see a 50 percent divorce rate.",

        "White women perhaps make it more of a choice that they may not want to marry, because they want to pursue their professional agendas, where as I hear many black women don't marry because they haven't been able to find the right person, or the black men have not been available to them.",
        "It's a multi-dimensional issue.",
