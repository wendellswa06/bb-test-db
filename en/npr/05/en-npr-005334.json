        "So if you try and project 10, 15, 20 years down the road, it's not just a matter of what the recession did or didn't do, it's a question of the recession having opened up the window on something that economists would have seen coming for some time.",

        "The number of children born to single women is skyrocketing.",
        "And so you have a situation where it's not necessarily a pretty picture for women or a straight female empowerment, but it is that women are dominant and running households, and the men are kind of disappearing.",
        "And then in the upper classes you have a slightly different picture, where you have a lot more marriages where women are out-earning men, but there is more equality."

        "The country is trying to force men to take these longer and longer paternity leaves, essentially to change the notion of masculinity, as the Time magazine cover showed, to make men feel more connected and responsible to their children, the idea being that once it's an inherent part of masculinity, people will naturally trade roles rather than having it be forced from above."
