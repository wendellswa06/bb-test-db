        "It was debated a lot in churches and sort of on online Christian sites, essentially trying to defend the traditional role of masculinity.",

        "But I actually find it very difficult to be a stay-at-home dad because I feel like a lot of the modern, like, periodicals kind of treat us like we're not equals in the parenting partnership.",
        "Parenting magazine actually comes to mind.",
        "They had articles about what's wrong with dad and the problem with dad.",
        "And I just find it kind of offensive, and I feel like society needs to accept fully that children have two parents, and then we can move more towards an equality in the workplace, outside of the home too.",
        "So, Matthew, you seem to have identified a marketing niche for a magazine.",
        "I think so.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "There's a job opportunity for you.",
        "Exactly.",

        "And I would say even schools haven't.",
        "We still have schools which will send the emails only to the moms or only, you know, expect that the moms do something, and really families don't really work that way anymore."

        "They'd say, well, what's the problem?",
        "And the problem is that when you have a whole generation of men who are losing their way or losing their initiative, you know, these are their brothers, their sons, their daughters, future husbands, if they're going to get married at all, so that, you know - and I was delighted, actually, when I saw Ms. Rosin's piece because I was attacked for being - for writing a book that was anti-feminist just by the concept of it.",
        "So when I saw the article in The Atlantic, I was like, well, great -now, you know, now it's validated in the sense that people might realize that everybody - both genders have something at stake here.",
        "There's even, you know, evidence that males who feel threatened, disenfranchised, powerless, economically feckless, can become very dangerous.",
        "And if you look at the profiles of even the al-Qaida terrorists, it's eerily similar.",
        "Meanwhile, in Japan you have a whole generation of men who have just dropped out of society, who no longer buy things, are not interested in raising families or building a career.",

        "Dads are usually made fun of by their own kids.",

        "She does have a point.",
