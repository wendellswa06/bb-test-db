        "I mean the newspapers there are burning up with all kinds of news about how Gadhafi has homes and properties, mansions and farms, and about his relationship with Mugabe.",
        "Well, lets start out for a second, about why Saudi Arabia isn't a good fit.",
        "There is very, very good information that Moammar Gadhafi was involved in supporting an effort to assassinate the then crown prince and now king of Saudi Arabia, Abdullah, so there is absolutely no way the Saudis would harbor him.",
        "On the other hand, Zimbabwe really, I think, most people who have looked at the situation consider Zimbabwe to be the most likely country to offer refuge, and the reason is it has effectively been a client state of Libyas for many years now.",
        "Gadhafi sought a place on the world stage by assuming the leadership of the Organization of African Unity and Zimbabwe was a major ally and supporter of his in this process.",
        "And I think what made that possible, there's no question about it, it wasn't the magnetic personality of Moammar Gadhafi, it was Libyan money flowing into Mugabes coffers.",
        "But with international sanctions in place, and with his assets being freezed all around the world, it's likely that were going to those gestures of hospitality recede.",
        "So youre saying Gadhafi cannot look forward to the comfortable retirement of deposed dictators that have happened before.",
        "Precisely.",
        "I mean I think Gadhafi is making what we call a bloody exit, and that's always been viewed as the sort of scenario in which a deposed dictator is unlikely to achieve lasting and effective asylum.",
        "He's going to be pursued by claims in the international arena.",
        "He's likely to be a head of state dragged up to the Hague and put on trial.",
        "There were early rumors that he might flee to Venezuela.",
        "Is that still on the table?",
        "It really does.",
        "Corruption is just one of the barriers.",
        "Also there are some policy barriers.",
        "For instance, if you talk to a lot of builders, they'll tell you in many cases it costs them about 35 to $40,000 to clear regulatory barriers before they can break ground on one house.",
        "And, therefore, it makes it too expensive to build moderate- to low-income housing, so we really need some regulatory relief without sacrificing personal safety, but we really need to bring people together to talk about remedies based upon the actual experiences of civic and neighborhood leaders from around the country and the qualities that make them effective and innovative also renders them invisible because they're not out protesting or whining, and they don't have books out or on talk shows.",

        "After all, we should look at the low-income residents as part of a work force.",
        "New Orleans is now a tourist city which means that it's a service economy.",
        "We should look at low-income people as a very important part of a service economy's work force and ask ourselves, `How could we insinuate into that community, those communities, training, technical assistance so they can become owners of homes, they can be trained to participate in the reconstruction, apprenticeship jobs so that they have a sense of being a part of the economy?",
