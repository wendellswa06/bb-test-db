        "Romney's bind was apparent in the GOP primaries, when conservatives questioned his ability to attack the president on a plan so similar to his own.",
        "But now, with the nomination in hand, Romney is making health care the heart of his argument against the president.",
        "What was once a common bond is now a deep divide.",
        "You know, what is significant here is that he is asking the White House and the FBI to corroborate the timeline of events, and this White House has tried very hard to say that their timeline doesn't conflict with the FBI's.",
        "Unlike us in the press - we've been asking for a week now who knew what and when, and we can't get a straight answer - the Oversight Committee has subpoena power, and it could use it.",
        "As I mentioned, the president today made a public statement condemning domestic violence.",
        "That's not generally thought of as a difficult statement to make, and yet it took a week.",
        "Why?",
        "It's a good question and one we don't entirely have an answer to.",
        "White House aides and the vice president have said for days that there is no tolerance for domestic violence.",
        "And also they've said that the Trump White House could have handled this case better.",
        "Yet as for the president, he doesn't usually have trouble speaking his mind when he's on the attack.",
        "He is perfectly happy to tweet or respond to reporters' questions that are being shouted at him.",
        "But this was different.",
        "And until today, we - all we had seen him say was how great Rob Porter was as an employee.",
        "He wished him well.",
        "And, you know, the president's instinct in a lot of cases is, when he's being criticized, to dig in and hunker down.",
        "And especially if there's a media firestorm and everyone is telling him to say something, that's when he really digs in.",

        "Yesterday brought some unexpectedly positive news on the job front - a report.",
        "The U.S.",
        "Labor Department said 151,000 jobs were added to the economy in October.",
        "The unemployment rate, which some had projected to climb, held steady, at 9.6 percent.",
        "NPR's Yuki Noguchi has more on what this means.",
        "Heidi Shierholz is one of those economists who seldom, especially in the last two years, has had anything good to say.",
        "But here's what she said about Friday's employment numbers.",
        "The employment report was good in the sense that not only did we have job growth, we had job growth that was actually more than what we need just to tread water.",
        "We need around 100,000 jobs every month just to hold steady, just to keep up with normal population growth.",
        "We got 151,000 jobs.",
        "That was largely because businesses finally started hiring in large numbers.",
        "Workers were hired in mining, service and health care-related jobs.",
        "Moreover, the report said September wasn't actually as bad as initially thought.",
        "Fewer jobs were lost than the department previously reported.",
        "But there is a darker side to this report.",
        "Again, Heidi Shierholz, the economist at the Economic Policy Institute.",
        "The so-called underemployment rate moved a little but it's essentially flat at around 17 percent.",
        "A bunch of these measures, they're just holding steady, and at this point that's actually terrible news because they are holding steady at very, very high levels.",
        "She says the recession left a hole about 11 million jobs deep.",
        "And even at last month's hiring levels, it would take a very, very long time to fill that gap.",
        "So then the question is, what will accelerate business hiring?",
        "I believe that scientists have an obligation to share what they know in ways that are relevant and understandable to decisions that people are making.",
        "They can talk and should be communicating more effectively about what we know, what we don't know, how certain of it are we and what the likely consequences of different policy choices might be.",
        "So, all of that is in the guise of science informing policy.",
        "Science should be at the table, and that's part of the role of scientists, regardless of what hat they wear.",
        "In the administration, obviously, we have an obligation to do more than just share the science, but to make policy and management decisions based on that science.",

        "Dr.",
        "Lubchenco, you know, over the last several months, we keep seeing new reporters suggesting that the sea level's going to be rising, slated to happen, rise much faster than the IPCC predicted.",
        "We hear scientists telling us that things are - the glaciers are melting faster.",
        "Are we underestimating some of the effects of climate change here?",
        "I think that it's been very challenging to understand all of the ways in which climate change will affect sea-level rise.",
        "We know for sure that over the 20th century, sea-level rise rose approximately six inches.",
        "The challenge comes in predicting exactly how much more is in stock for us.",
        "There are a couple things about sea level rise that - where the physical processes are well understood and there are other areas where it's less well-understood.",
        "On the well-understood part of it, we know that when seawater is warm, it expands and that thermal expansion helps contribute to a rise in sea level.",
        "That's pretty easy to understand and predict.",
        "We also know that many of the small glaciers on land are melting because of warmer air temperatures.",
        "And that is also contributing to sea level rise and is a fairly well-characterized physical process.",
        "So those two parts of it are pretty easy to understand.",
        "And the predictions that were in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report were a reflection of those processes.",
        "The biggest uncertainty comes in the third area, and that is exactly how climate change will affect the great, big, huge ice sheets on Greenland and in the Antarctic."
