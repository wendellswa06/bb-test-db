        "And those dynamics are not well-understood, are very, very difficult to make precise predictions about, and many of the different projections that we are seeing about possible sea level rise in the future, those uncertainties are due in large part to the challenges in understanding exactly how these great ice sheets are behaving.",
        "They've been changing a lot faster than people thought they would.",
        "And they're melting.",
        "There is so much water that could possibly be released if they melted and went into oceans that it has huge potential.",
        "And so we see fairly considerable ranges in terms of projections.",
        "And I think what all of this really brings to the fore is the extent to which there are some parts of climate change that we know and understand fairly well.",
        "There are others about which there is greater uncertainty, and it's quite likely that we will continue to be uncertain for a period of time.",
        "And yet we need to move ahead and set in motion plans to adapt, that will be based on reasonable estimates, understanding that they're going to be somewhat uncertain for years to come.",
        "Well, we have a weather service.",
        "You know, when farmers want to know when to plant, or what they think the weather's going to be, or people want vacation or whatever.",
        "We have a weather service that predicts the rainfall and the heat and temperature of the day.",
        "I understand you're saying we need something like a climate service now that would tell cities - if cities are going to prepare for rising sea levels and things like that, they need to know what the climate's going to be.",
        "That's absolutely the case.",
        "I think, you know, climate change is now threatening so many aspects of our lives that affect economic prosperity, human health, national security, ecosystems and environment.",
        "And I really believe the nation needs to develop and communicate authoritative, regular and useful information to guide decisions about adaptation.",
        "This National Climate Service would provide just those types of services, and we are envisioning it as analogous to the National Weather Service.",
        "I believe it's an idea whose time has come.",
        "We have climate-scale models - or climate models at the continental scale that are able to make reasonable forecasts for climate-scale phenomena, i.e., 20 to 30 years.",
        "We are working very hard in moving toward improving the ability to do regional-scale forecasts.",
        "And our plans with our new supercomputers will put us on a track to be able to do that in the not-too-distant future.",
        "So it's our hope that we can utilize that regional scale information to provide businesses, governments, citizens with information about sea level rise, inundation predictions, but also drought warnings.",
        "I will not go back to the days when insurance companies had unchecked power to cancel your policy, or deny your coverage, or charge women differently from men.",
        "We're not going back there.",
        "We're going forward.",
        "Warnings for ocean acidification, where, for example, to cite a renewable energy facility - if you're building a wind farm, you would want to know not just where the winds have been good for the past 100 years, but where they're likely to be good the next 100 years.",
        "So there are a number of new ways that climate is affecting our lives that if we had some reasonable forecasts for 20 to 30-year horizons, we could be doing a much better job of making decisions about land use, about water management, about crops, about a whole suite of different things."

        "Interesting.",
        "Is there money allocated for this already, or do you have to go - to set up the National Climate Service - do you have to create some new budgetary line for this?",
        "We are in the early stages of designing what this would look like, talking to other agencies and it's an idea whose time has come, as I said, and we will undoubtedly, to do it justice, need significantly greater resources than we have at hand.",
        "Now, it seems almost like the lines are blurring between environmental protection, and oceans, and atmosphere and things like that, that it's hard to work as, I would think, just in your own little bailiwick without affecting something else.",
        "I think we are beginning to appreciate the extent to which humans depend on nature and are affecting changes in nature that in turn have consequences to us.",
        "We've heard that loud and clear from scientific studies from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but also the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.",
        "And I think that we're beginning to see that, in fact, that is playing out in the real world.",
        "When I had the opportunity to serve on the Pew Oceans Commission a number of years ago, we spent a fair amount of time going around the United States talking to citizens who live on the coastal areas.",
        "We also spoke to folks in the interior and simply said to them, among other things, what do you want from oceans?",
        "What do you get from oceans?",
        "And what I heard back was essentially five basic things.",
        "We want clean beaches, we want safe healthy seafood, we want stable fisheries, we want abundant wildlife and vibrant coastal communities.",
        "And when you think about the fact that half of Americans live in the coastal areas and the other half often goes there to play, we begin to appreciate the connectedness between the land and the ocean, and our lives and livelihoods and the environmental changes that are affecting the oceans and the land.",
        "You've always been a very strong proactive supporter of the oceans.",
        "Will you be that strong and proactive in your new job?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "But I, also, as an ecologist, appreciate the connections between the oceans, and the atmosphere and the land.",
        "And part of my responsibility as administrator is to focus on both the land, and the ocean and the atmosphere, all three of those.",
        "And NOAA has responsibilities to conduct science, to provide services and to be a good steward in managing marine resources.",
        "the science, the services and the stewardship, all involve interactions and integration of the land, and the oceans and the air.",
        "Here's a question from Second Life from CTYankee(ph) writes, does NOAA have a position on deep ocean CO2 sequestration?",
        "There is talk about that that might be a place to permanently sequester carbon dioxide."

        "Well, there's a lot that I'm still coming up to speed on.",
        "Yeah.",

        "We talk a lot about managing on an ecosystem basis, but we don't really have the fundamental understanding of ecosystem-based science to really underpin those decisions.",
        "There is a huge amount that we don't know about oceans that is desperately needed to inform the kinds of management decisions, especially in light of climate change and ocean acidification.",

        "We can't think of those individual decisions in a vacuum.",
        "They need to be - or they should be understood in a more holistic fashion relative to how they impact the ecosystem, and how they interact with one another.",
        "So, historically, you know, we have made different decisions or made decisions about drilling for gas or oil separately from aquaculture, separately from the desire to protect marine mammals, separately from the desire to stop overfishing and recover depleted fisheries.",
        "Those collective activities need to be thought of in a more comprehensive, holistic fashion.",

        "Let me just jump in and remind everybody that this is SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "So one of our goals is to create a mechanism for having more comprehensive ecosystem-based planning that will take stalk of the range of activities that can coexist with one another to minimize conflicts, but also ensure that the ecosystem that many of whom depend on remains healthy or can be recovered.",
        "So you have a lot of research to do is basically what you're saying, and restoring funding for that research.",
        "That's correct, but we also have significant responsibilities to make immediate management decisions that are based on our current knowledge, and put us on a path, for example, to be recovering many of the fisheries that are indeed in serious trouble.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And what kind of - and immediately, do you have a decision about our fisheries or any path that you would like to tell us about?",
        "Well, I think one of the most exciting opportunities that we will have will be to think differently about fishery management.",
        "The problem is that fisheries globally are, in general, not doing particularly well.",
        "Fewer fish mean fewer jobs.",
        "The challenge is to rebuild healthy oceans and the communities and ecosystems and economies that depend on them.",
        "And I hope that we can reframe the debate and move from traditional fishery management that controls efforts in days at sea, types of gear, to more incentive-based management that gives fishermen a stake in the future."
