        "The concept of catch shares is that there is a total limit set on the amount of fish or a particular type of seafood that can be caught in a particular year, in a particular season.",
        "But the - each of the players, be they individual fishermen or communities, has a guaranteed fraction of that catch.",
        "And that fraction is guaranteed for, not only this year, but for years down the road.",
        "So that's called catch and share.",

        "Over time, we have seen significant depletion and disruption of oceans.",
        "It is time to restore them to a healthy, productive state so that we can continue to benefit from their bounty.",
        "And I have suggested that having a mutiny for the bounty is an idea whose time has come.",
        "That involves being more aware of changes in oceans and making decisions that will help protect oceans because they will bring economic and social benefit by doing so.",
        "That plays out a lot of different ways.",
        "We were talking about managing fisheries…",
        "Right.",
        "…and some of the exciting developments in that arena by aligning economic and conservation objectives, and allowing fishermen to have a stake in the future of - an economic stake in the future and therefore be champions for good management practices and healthy ecosystems.",
        "I think it's just really true that healthy ecosystems and healthy communities and jobs go hand in hand, and that's true in the oceans, as well as on land.",
        "There was a very interesting study done last - that was released last year about these catch-share programs, which suggested that of the ll,000 fisheries globally that were analyzed, those who are operated with some kind of catch-share program are actually thriving and doing well.",
        "Those who were operated or managed under more traditional management were, by and large, not doing well, were failing.",
        "And I think there is renewed interest on the part of many fishermen in these catch-share programs.",
        "The United States now has 12 such programs in place and we expect to add four more by 2010.",
        "These are things like Pacific halibut and sablefish in Alaska, or red snapper in the Gulf, Georges Bank Cod Hook Sector is managed with catch shares, and there are others.",
        "But I think that this is a revolutionary new concept that has a strong potential to help recover lost bounty in oceans and thereby also recover many of the fishing jobs that have been lost because of past practices.",
        "If the oceans are under threat from such things as acidification from CO2, runoff from farming, does NOAA have the power to cross those lines into, you know, the - where the EPA might have jurisdiction over CO2 regulations, or the Agriculture Department may have something over the runoff.",
        "Do you understand the point I'm getting at?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Most of these issues are much larger than any single agency or department.",
        "And they will - their solution will absolutely require good collaboration and cooperation and a strong commitment and leadership at the highest levels.",
        "To really address the issues in oceans will require multiple agencies working together in concert.",
        "Obviously, NOAA is a key player in that, is a lead, but we will be working closely with other agencies to find that common ground and to align our policies and practices for the benefit of Americans."
