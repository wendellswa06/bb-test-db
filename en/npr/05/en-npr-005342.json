        "Well, in Europe, it's slightly different.",
        "Banks lent money to European countries like Greece, countries that are now unable to pay back those loans.",
        "And many in Europe don't want to bail out those banks or those countries.",

        "And here are some of the big - major issues they hope to come to an agreement on by this Wednesday.",
        "The biggest one, by far, is really, how to best use and leverage the power of the eurozone's rescue fund, how to get the most out of this 440 billion euro fund.",
        "So if the debt contagion spreads to bigger European economies - such as Italy and Spain - European countries will, in theory, be ready.",
        "We've already seen during this debt debacle, you know, an ineffectual bailout of Greece - at least, so far, it's been ineffectual - as well bailouts of Portugal and Ireland that have, by all accounts, worked a little better to shore up those two economies.",
        "But the fear is, Guy, that the cost of borrowing will become too high for these much larger economies of Italy and Spain.",
        "Major European banks then could be undermined.",
        "And what started as a Greek debt problem, you know, quickly mushrooms into another global financial crisis.",
        "Well, what are the potential consequences if European leaders don't get this right - both for Europe and for the U.S.?"

        "The stakes are very high, certainly because the financial system is, of course, so interconnected.",
        "And a deeper European debt and banking crisis, you know, would have a huge ripple effect and could further undermine America's still-fragile economic state, and would certainly reverberate across global markets even more.",

        "For some answers to those questions, we called retired Admiral David Simpson.",
        "He's the former chief of the FCC's Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, and he told us these kinds of alerts date to the 1950s when the country was seriously worried about a nuclear threat.",
        "We needed an ability to communicate rapidly that an attack was inbound.",
        "We knew we'd have 10 minutes or more.",
        "So the system was set up for the president to be able to make that voice communication and then have it relayed through broadcast - both television and radio.",
        "As time went on, it became clear that that mechanism had significant utility at the state and local level as well, particularly for natural disasters.",
        "So the system evolved to have multiple alert originators in addition to the president, DOD and FEMA.",
        "And since the beginning, now it's not just broadcast.",
        "As cable came on, cable operators are part of the system.",
        "And now wireless companies are a part.",

        "I believe FEMA has the specific responsibility to communicate with DOD, get DOD's attack assessment.",
        "Is this a real attack or not?",

        "So that is why the all-clear should come from the higher-level governmental entity.",
        "Should it be harder to send out an alert like this?",
        "You know, Hawaii says it has put in place a two-person verification rule.",
        "Is that a good idea, but - or should there be more restrictions?",
        "It should be harder.",
        "In fact I think - and I'm hopeful that in addition to the FCC's investigation, that there is a DOD-DHS-led investigation on exactly who should have the ability to communicate a ballistic missile launch warning.",

        "One other thing people have criticized about this alert was that it didn't provide any instructions about where to go or what to do.",
        "Should the alerts be longer and, you know - or should they include links to more information?",
        "They should.",
        "And at the FCC, it became very clear to us that 90 characters, which is what the wireless system was constrained to, didn't make any sense at all in a day where even tweets are longer than 90 characters.",
        "So we passed a rule that outlined a timeline by which the wireless carriers needed to be able to support 360 characters and support the inclusion of embedded hyperlinks so that a warning can go out with a link to more specific instructions on what to do, maybe a picture of an evacuation route.",
        "So that was passed, but then the wireless carriers immediately issued a petition for reconsideration and essentially delayed action on it until the FCC took it up again in November of last year and denied the petition for reconsideration, essentially putting the rule into effect that will expand the character limit and include hyperlinks.",
