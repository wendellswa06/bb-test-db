        "This past week, Goldman Sachs announced a quarterly loss.",
        "It's just the second time since 1999 that the company's posted a loss, and yet Goldman has still set aside more than $10 billion for year-end bonuses.",
        "And former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer says that shows just how little things have changed on Wall Street since the crisis of 2008.",
        "Well, see, that's the thing people need to understand - the fact that there was a loss there on paper should not be interpreted by people as meaning suddenly, the executives and shareholders of Goldman Sachs and the partners of Goldman are not going to be getting their enormous salaries.",
        "They still are getting very, very outsized compensation.",
        "OK.",
        "Eliot Spitzer, many ordinary people, as you know, who don't work on Wall Street, have lost so much trust in our financial institutions that they are unwilling to invest in the stock market today.",
        "There's this idea that somehow the system is rigged.",
        "I think that small investors do not get a fair shake.",
        "Small investors are sold stuff that they should not be sold, while the insiders are given advantages both in terms of the information, access to stocks, access to IPOs, access to all of the games that can be played - most recently, the settlement by Citibank.",
        "They paid $285 million; sounds like a big sum of money, but it's not in the context of Citibank's profit last quarter, I think - the 2.8 billion - because they have sold a product to the public and then bet against it.",
        "They have designed it to fail.",
        "Now, how can you do that?",
        "How can any self-respecting person in business do that?",
        "Now, that is not, I'm saying, that is always what happens, but I spent many years as attorney general trying to root out the inherent conflicts of interest that exist between the interests of many - of the people at Goldman and Citi and Bank of America, who put together these products, who may have one thing in mind that may not be the best interests of the individual who was sold that product.",
        "Let's move on to the Occupy Wall Street movement.",
        "You have written recently in Slate that this has shaken up American politics.",
        "How so?",
        "The defining issue in the political arena over the last year had been almost exclusively, how do we cut the debt?",
        "Issues of equity, issues of jobs, issues of growth had fallen off the agenda.",
        "And somehow, what the Occupy Wall Street folks have done is re-inject the issue of equity into our discussion.",
        "And that is critically important because we are distributing wealth in a way that is long-term corrosive and more importantly, we're generating the wealth in a way that may not be good for the country in the long run.",
        "The Occupy Wall Street folks are the ones who, I think, have to be given a fair bit of credit for putting it back on the agenda.",
        "Couldn't you make the case, though, that Wall Street is an easy target?",
        "I mean, as a former governor of New York, you know that Wall Street - their argument is they count for 14 percent of all tax revenues in New York state."

        "Wall Street is an easy target, and that doesn't mean that's why they're the target.",

        "I thought it was necessary.",
        "So yes, they're an easy target at times because they've made themselves an easy target, and I don't say that to sort of paint with too broad a brush.",
        "But structurally, we've got a significant problem.",
        "And that's why putting structural reforms in place to deal with not only equity issues but growth issues, is critically important.",

        "There are going to be some examples of it.",
