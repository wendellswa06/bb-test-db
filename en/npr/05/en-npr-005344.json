        "And if there is something, you know, if there is a new cultural idea, a new kind of music, a new kind of design, usually, marketers or a major company will jump on that so fast that it doesn't really have time to develop into what it could've been had it had time to really germinate and develop.",
        "So by grabbing it and then mass marketing it, you sort of frozen it in time and it will grow from there.",
        "Right.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "And is it possible that these sleek marketing machines can sell us almost anything?",
        "Well, yes and no. I mean I think it works about half the time, you know, which probably means that they're not really any better at selling anything than anybody else.",
        "But, you know, sometimes, I would argue, sometimes things do catch on that may not have caught on were they, you know, had they not capitalized on something else.",

        "Right.",
        "What they're calling viral marketing is not really viral so much.",
        "It's as just really diffusion marketing, getting cool kids to do things in the hopes that it's going to diffuse down to other kids.",

        "What does it mean to be, you know, to be watching television where really every decision of every character, whether they're in a fiction show or in a so-called reality show, is really based on who is paid for that decision to be made.",
