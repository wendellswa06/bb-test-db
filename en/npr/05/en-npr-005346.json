        "Well, that's right.",
        "And, in fact, these rounds of plant closings, they're not going to have that much immediate effect at GM because several of the plants aren't closing until 2008, and the vast majority of that 30,000 job loss will be natural attrition.",
        "And even the workers that are laid off, like the person you interviewed, they go into something called a GM jobs bank, where they continue to draw something like 90 percent of their salary until they get rehired by GM or perhaps hit retirement age.",
        "So there's a cost savings to these plant closings, but it isn't as big a cost savings as you might expect, and that's because of the union contracts.",
        "GM is the world's largest automaker.",
        "So what does this say about the malaise of American automakers?",
        "American automakers at this point have real trouble competing on the car side of the business.",
        "All of the American automakers got a reprieve in the '90s when the market shifted towards pickups and SUVs because the American carmakers had these vehicles already, and they were ideally positioned to take advantage of this change.",
        "And I think all of the carmakers took their eye off the ball on cars a little bit because it was so easy to make money in trucks.",
        "And now a couple of things have happened.",
        "The rest of the world has looked at the truck market and the good money and good profits to be made there, and they've jumped in.",
        "You have everyone from Lexus to Porsche building SUVs today, and the easy money is gone.",
        "And, also, you know, fuel prices have gone up; they're starting to relax a little bit now.",
        "But the fact is you can't rely on these SUVs and pickups to make a lot of money anymore.",
        "You've got to make money on every product including cars.",
        "And in the car area, the domestics are definitely having trouble competing with the imports.",
        "All these aging American industries--automakers, steel, etc.--are saddled with these enormous employee costs, pensions and health-care costs, mainly for their retirees.",
        "So what is it going to take in the grand scheme, maybe action in Washington, to help out these industries?",
        "Well, it might require something like that because in the case of GM, it is estimated that there's about a $1,500 to $1,800 cost per vehicle sold to take care of retirees and health care, and it's a huge amount of money.",
        "If GM didn't have that expense, it would probably be profitable this year.",
        "So something needs to be done in this regard, but the companies can't be totally absolved from this.",
        "The companies that don't lose market share to a huge degree have much less of a legacy cost problem like this.",
        "That's where part of it goes right back to the company.",
        "If you do well, that problem is much smaller and probably manageable.",
