        "But the Galleria is one of the ritziest malls in the country.",

        "How does the dust get to Miami?",
        "Well, during the summer months, Miami and--well, much of the tropical Atlantic and the Caribbean lies in the trade wind belt.",
        "So in Africa, you generate dust and it gets lifted up in the atmosphere and it gets caught up in the trade wind circulation, and the dust goes where the trade wind goes.",
        "So we get dust here in Miami.",
        "So even though it's riding the winds, it doesn't necessarily get put out, if you will, or moistened by the clouds?"

        "Well, when the dust-laden air interacts with a tropical storm or a random cloud in the trade winds, it will be removed by precipitation processes.",
        "It will rain out and be deposited on the ocean surface or on islands.",
        "And, in fact, much of the soils in the Caribbean islands is derived from African dust, so it does contribute something to the islands.",
        "So, yes, there is the removal of dust during the transport process, but a lot of it remains in the atmosphere because a large part of the Atlantic doesn't experience much rain at this time of year, particularly the eastern Atlantic.",
        "So it travels quite far.",
        "So what does it look like?",
        "Does it look simply like a hazy day?",

        "Instead of seeing deep, blue skies, you see a sort of, you know, a milky sort of sky.",
        "And around the sun, there'll be a very large aureole.",
        "That is, light is scattered by the dust and it forms this large, lit, brilliant area around the sun, and it extends out quite a distance.",
        "So it's quite apparent.",
        "And I suppose down on the ground things get dusty.",
        "Yes, yes.",
        "But actually, most of the dust is carried at higher altitudes.",
        "The dust typically in the Miami area will extend, oh, to 10, 12,000 feet.",
        "And most of it is below that level; some will get higher.",
        "But you may very well have the highest concentrations aloft within this what we call the Saharan air layer, which has very characteristic properties.",

        "If Charlie Crist does run as an Independent, give us a sense of what he would face.",
        "Well, it's now Joe Lieberman.",
        "Really, Lieberman and Lamont were the only two credible candidates.",
        "This is the case where you've got a very credible Democrat - Kendrick Meek - and a very credible Republican - Marco Rubio.",
        "And usually in Florida, both sides have a solid 40 percent.",
        "So, Charlie Crist is going to really have to peel a lot of voters off from both sides, and he's going to have probably a very significant financial disadvantage because he won't be able to raise money from the normal partisan groups.",
        "Now, what happens to Crist should he run as an independent and lose?",
        "Would the Republicans ever have him back or do you think that is the end of his relationship with the Republican Party?"

        "Do you expect that evangelical voters will turn out in huge numbers on Tuesday?",

        "Despite the problems of certain Republicans, there really is no alternative from the point of view of the agenda of Christian conservatives.",

        "Christian conservatives look a whole lot like the rest of the country.",
        "In other words, they look like they're going to vote at about the same rate as other Americans, and in fact, some surveys suggest, maybe vote at a little bit higher level.",
        "And then if we look at the support for Republican candidates, such as in generic ballots and things, it looks a lot like 2002.",
