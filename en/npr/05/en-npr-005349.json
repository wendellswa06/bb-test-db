        "Bill Peters saw an article about that in The New York Times and called me the following year and asked me whether I intended to do it again.",

        "PETERS (Documentary Filmmaker): The first day, we encouraged them to ask questions about the camera and how it worked, and I think every child went home with a piece of film or something.",
        "The second day, they were, sort of, used to us.",
        "And when this exercise began, they were riveted.",
        "When I looked at all the film after we had filmed for the next two days, I expected to see children looking at the camera because this is what everybody does occasionally.",
        "There are only two instances in which children looked at the camera during the two-day exercise.",
        "So it was - it was as though we weren't there.",
        "Ms.",
        "Elliott, were you surprised that your children were so focused on this lesson that they totally forgot about the cameras?",
        "No, and when I do this with adults in front of cameras, they forget about the cameras, too, because they are so engrossed in what's happening."
