        "But supporters of the ruling say religious freedom is their foremost concern--that is, freedom from state-sponsored religion.",
        "Ken Falk of the Indiana Civil Liberties Union argued the case on behalf of four Indiana residents.",
        "When someone leaves the street, leaves the sidewalk, leaves their home and leaves their church and enters the House chamber and ascends to the speaker's stand, they are the state of Indiana, and the state of Indiana must be neutral when it comes to religion and therefore the prayers must be non-sectarian and it must be inclusive of Hoosiers as opposed to being exclusive.",
        "The judge's ruling found that a substantial majority of the prayers offered in the House this year were explicitly Christian, and some could be described as proselytizing.",
        "It also noted one instance when a minister led lawmakers in singing the gospel tune \"\"Just a Little Talk with Jesus.\"\" Even Speaker Bosma concedes the sing-along might not have been the best idea.",
        "Still, he says, he's never heard a prayer in the House that he felt was overreaching.",
        "Both sides vow to take the case all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Trish Anderton in Bloomington.",
        "Let's get up to date on that deadly attack in London yesterday.",
        "Scotland Yard has now identified the person believed to be responsible for this attack near Parliament.",
        "He is Khalid Masood.",
        "He's 52 years old and is said to be known by a number of aliases.",
        "He is not believed to be part of any current investigation.",
        "Four people died yesterday, including the attacker.",
        "ISIS has claimed responsibility for this, though that has not been confirmed.",
        "Meanwhile, there have been eight arrests made as part of this investigation, a lot to cover here.",
        "And let's talk it through with NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre.",
        "Greg, good morning.",
        "Hi, David.",
        "So what do we know about about this man?",
        "We've just been given his name.",
        "Well, he's been - had a criminal record dating back to the 1980s.",
        "But it was for garden-variety-type crimes.",
        "He was apparently investigated a few years back - possible links to extremism.",
        "But that didn't pan out, so he was considered a peripheral figure and was not on the radar at this moment.",
        "And that's what we've got so far.",
        "And the authorities in London have been saying all morning that he was inspired by international terrorism.",
        "Do we know anything beyond that at this point?",
        "Not a lot, but what that's suggesting is the kind of attacks we've seen recently, which are these sort of one-man attacks by a lone wolf kind of attacker who may have read something, the online propaganda of the Islamic State, and acted on his own.",
        "And then the Islamic State will claim responsibility or credit for this attack after the effect, even though they may not have any knowledge of it beforehand.",
        "And this is something we often see in these attacks, right?",
        "I mean, we get early indications of ISIS claiming responsibility.",
        "But we want to be very, very careful because we're not sure who is making that claim, who in that organization - if it's part of ISIS at all.",
        "And we really need to take some time there."

        "That's true, David.",
        "In this case, it's a news agency that's been affiliated with the Islamic State.",

        "And ultimately, we may never know.",
        "The attacker is dead.",
        "The Islamic State has said, carry out attacks; we will - we will embrace you afterwards.",
        "So we may not get much more than this.",
        "But you're right.",
        "There's not any sort of clear confirmation at this point.",
        "And a low-tech attack like this, carried out by one person - I mean, this is the kind of thing that ISIS has been - has been telling people to do in their messaging.",
        "Right.",
        "They've got an online magazine, Rumiyah.",
        "And it gives very explicit instructions about not only how to carry out a vehicle attack but what kind of truck to use.",
        "They suggest also taking a knife.",
        "You - I went back and looked at some of these instructions, and it was very similar to what happened yesterday and what's happened recently in Berlin, at the Christmas market attack in last July, in Nice, France, at the Bastille Day attack.",
        "So we've been seeing a series of these now.",
        "You know, we've had, you know, international terrorism - you know, experts on the program who were sort of predicting something like this, you know, if indeed this turns out to be ISIS - that as they lose ground in places like Syria and Iraq, they might turn even more frequently to lone-wolf attacks like this.",
        "You think that might be what we're seeing?",
        "I'm at the dog pound, so it's a little loud, but my whole extended family, eight siblings, or seven siblings, went to New York City with all of our kids.",
        "And we went to Central Park and we saw a dancer called Thoth, T-H-O-T-H.",
        "He was wearing an ankh.",
        "He had beautiful dreadlocks.",
        "He was a very small and muscular man, did a fantastic dance, and he - anytime - and he did a whirling dervish spin.",
        "And when he spun, I think he was going commando, and all the kids went ahhh!.",
        "We just had a great time watching Thoth.",
        "That was the highlight.",
        "We were sad because our mom was no longer alive, and she missed the show.",
        "I'm really intrigued that there is this dancer, which I've never seen in Central Park, who has named himself for a very, very powerful Egyptian god.",
        "Absolutely, and he was wearing a headdress and a lot of gold that, you know, was reminiscent of Thoth.",
        "Those of us who knew about Thoth knew that he was - he had the ankh, he had a lot of different things on.",
        "It was totally fascinating.",
        "I mean he was amazing.",
        "Dinner and a show on every corner, somebody once described New York City.",
        "Absolutely, absolutely."

        "Or maybe not crazy, maybe not crazy, but like the one, you actually mentioned a very old story of mine where there was this guy who was completely illiterate.",
        "He came down from the South, African-American, and he was this urban cowboy parking people's cars.",
        "And he had these keys that, I still remember this, that he - because he couldn't read or write.",
        "He had different colored nail polishes on each of the keys of these like maybe 30 people who he moved the cars twice a day.",

        "I think a lot of this happens by word of mouth.",
        "Like you have a building, and in the building someone somehow finds him, and then he talks to a neighbor, and then he talks to another neighbor, and that's probably how it happened.",

        "And so then he started to warm up a little.",
        "He said, well, it makes me think of the song \"\"Green, Green Grass of Home.\"\" And he said, well, you'd think that song was about coming home, but it's really not.",
        "It's really about someone coming home to be buried, at which point he broke into the song and sang through the song \"\"Green, Green Grass of Home.\"\" And when I complimented him on his voice and indicated, gee, even with my Irish heritage I didn't realize and didn't know the words to the song, he went through two more Irish ballads and then said to me, well, is there anything you know?",

        "No, no, no, he said sing with me.",

        "And at that point we had pulled up in front of my hotel.",
        "He parked the cab and he shut the meter off and sang the third verse of \"\"Sweet Molly Malone\"\" and then made me sit there and learn the third verse of \"\"Sweet Molly Malone\"\" with him until I could then sing the entire song through from beginning to end.",
        "It's a cab drive I will - a cab ride I will never forget, and that man just - I mean I just - he's a character that I'll never know his name, and but yet I'll absolutely never forget him, best thing I ever did in New York.",
