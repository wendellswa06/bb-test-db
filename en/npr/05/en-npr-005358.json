        "And so that's where it started.",
        "But where it went was a completely different place because at some point I started saying all right, OK, I'm meditating on mortality, that's very interesting, but that doesn't explain why Hollywood is spending $7 billion in two years on vampire films and television shows.",
        "So something else is happening.",
        "Everybody said oh, it's sex, it's sex, and I said it doesn't feel like it's sex because I actually read this fascinating book called \"\"The Liquid Dreams of Vampires\"\" that analyzed, like, fantasies of people about vampires, and most people didn't want to have sex with vampires, they wanted to be them.",
        "And I realized that was sort of true of me, too, that way down deep.",
        "And so then I started looking at issues of power and identity, and at a certain point, I came across - I could go on for hours - but Nina Auerbach has a book called \"\"Our Vampires Ourselves.\"\" And she has a line in it that says every vampire - every society creates the vampire it needs.",
        "And that idea resonated really deeply with me.",
        "Well, the most obvious, OK, take, you know, Dracula, 1897, England has the largest ports in the world, fear of immigration, fear of disease.",

        "Well, what are our vampires about?",
        "What do we need in this society that we are creating a particular kind of vampire?",

        "And I say, OK, these are all the vampires that have been popular over the last 15 years.",
