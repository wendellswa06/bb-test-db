        "That's important to them.",
        "So yes, it does seem that as they lose ground at home, they are looking to also attack abroad.",
        "OK, Greg, thanks so much, as always.",
        "Tarver is one of about 450 juvenile lifers in the U.S.",
        "who have left prison since the 2016 Supreme Court decision.",
        "He says government programs meant to facilitate the group's reentry into society have done little to help him.",
        "Upon his release, Tarver wanted to pursue a career in law, having worked for seven years in the prison law library.",
        "But the 68-year-old man says reentry caseworkers didn't take his ambition seriously.",
        "I'm at that age most people are retired.",
        "That's how society deals with you, right?",
        "As you get to a certain age, they begin to, like, phase you out.",

        "Many juvenile lifers, however, end up underemployed doing menial labor, says Abd'Allah Lateef of the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth.",
        "A juvenile lifer himself, Lateef says reentrants are especially dependent on the support of family and members of the community.",
        "And he says this is especially problematic for juvenile lifers.",
        "ABD'ALLAH LATEEF: Children who have been disappeared from society as such the young and tender age have really been deprived from that process of socialization and social network development.",
        "Lateef, who lives in Philadelphia, says government programs don't meet this need.",
        "But Pennsylvania Corrections Secretary John Wetzel defends his state's approach, saying his department offers a range of reentry services specifically for juvenile lifers.",
        "In any case, he notes that in Pennsylvania, which incarcerates the most juvenile lifers in the country, only about 1% of that population has returned to prison following release.",
        "Primarily, men and women who got out were prepared to get out and were prepared to be good citizens.",
        "But I think that the numbers would suggest that our approach was successful thus far."

        "It was that policeman who introduced Tarver to the landlord that rents to him and the law firm that hired him.",
        "And before that, another juvenile lifer in the group helped Tarver enroll in community college.",

        "So these are the people that understand exactly what you need.",

        "Most of my family members were not born when I went away, so they don't have this emotional - like, I was a picture on a wall, not a real person.",
