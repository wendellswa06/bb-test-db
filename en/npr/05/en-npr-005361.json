        "But he says the law did nothing to protect appraisers from undue influence from the mortgage industry.",
        "Appraisers are supposed to provide an independent opinion of a home's value without interference from lenders or real estate agents, but some appraisers complain they are pressured to inflate a property's value to seal the deal.",
        "Clearly, appraisers who have succumbed to that pressure are also culpable to some extent, but most residential real estate appraisers are mom-and-pop operations.",
        "They depend on the kind of business that they often get from mortgage lenders and others, and so there's a very uncomfortable but real-world temptation to meet the expectations of the folks who hire you.",
        "Earlier this month, a major agreement was signed that could dramatically change the way consumers and the mortgage industry obtain property appraisals.",

        "Can you give us an example of what you would consider to be a flawed appraisal?",
        "Well, oftentimes, especially in the market we just went through in the last two or three years when house prices were inflating very rapidly, an appraiser would have pressure from a lender to make the prices higher so that they could make a bigger loan, if you will, to the people.",
        "And it was sort of a frenzy, if you will, for a time, and there was a lot of pressure on some appraisers to, you know, sort of keep increasing the prices more than the market was.",

        "Some appraisers actually blame the lenders and the realtors for the problem.",
        "Yes they do, and we've heard that, and that's one of the reasons that Fannie and Freddie have revised their code.",
        "And it's really designed to prevent undue pressure on appraisers.",
