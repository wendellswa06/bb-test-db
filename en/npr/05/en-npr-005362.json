        "Mr.",
        "C.",
        "RENAUD: Well, you know, when you're in high school at Central High School, you're certainly aware of the legacy of the school, but at the same time, I think there's a lot of things that are going on around you that as a high school student, you're not necessarily processing.",
        "And coming back as an adult, you know, made me realize a lot of things that were apparent when I was in school there but I wasn't noticing, you know?",
        "And I think the scene with Minniejean at the end of the film, when she is speaking to the students in the classroom and is disturbed because the class is segregated with white students on one side of the classroom and African-American students on the other side, and realizing that the students in that class just feel like that's the way it is and not recognizing the connection to our history and why our society is that way.",
        "And I think going back there as an adult and having your life experiences as adult and going back, you see those type of things by coming back to the school.",
        "So Brent, you and Craig followed several different kids around the school - white, black, rich, poor.",
        "Segregation still exists per that previous example, but how is it different now than it was?",
        "You know, it's different because, you know, black and white students go to the school together, you know?",
        "We certainly don't want to imply that things are not better.",
        "There's also a lot of very committed people.",
        "As you see, there's teachers and white students who, basically, they all want the same thing.",
        "Theoretically, the hatred that existed there where you're going to spit on the people and you don't even want to be in the same classroom with them.",
        "Thankfully that is over.",
        "But there is a risk of just concentrating on how far we've come and not looking at how far we still have to go.",
        "And we're not experts on education.",
        "So, really, what we decided to do was to go on to the school, pick a nice cross-section of kids - very different life experiences, very different backgrounds - and let them tell the story of what Central is like for them today.",
        "Let's take a look at one student, Brandon.",
        "He is black.",
        "He's the new student body president, but he also lives in a wealthy, white neighborhood, has mainly white friends.",
        "Does that really speak to racial segregation or is some of the segregation at the school economic?"
