        "At the moment, his job is really more like cheerleader in chief, or you could call him the Flying Dutchman, as he travels the world trying to forge a climate deal that would replace the current ineffective climate treaty, which was negotiated in Kyoto.",
        "About the only thing that I'm absolutely sure of is that 2009 will go down in history as the year of climate change, either because we failed to seek what I really see as a unique opportunity, or because we took a decision to ride a wave of change.",

        "My next guest thinks so - he certainly does, or more accurately he says we must work together.",

        "It's not unusual that the cry should be in that direction out of science.",
        "I think the usual approach of secular science is to marginalize religion or even disapprove of it publicly and not expect anything from religious believers or at least religious thinkers.",
        "But I've taken precisely the opposite approach and that is to recognize that there is a powerful moral energy and purpose among religious believers - well, as there is among dedicated secular humans as well.",
        "But also that numbers count, too; they cannot be ignored even if you are on the secular side and wish to not pay attention to their particular metaphysical belief.",
        "So what I've done that I think is new is to extend - and I am so presumptuous as to do it on behalf of science and secular science, secular based science -is to extend the hand of friendship and to say, may we forget for a while our metaphysical differences and the culture war, put them aside, and meet on this common ground of saving the creation - that is saving biodiversity which is in such peril worldwide.",
        "Have you gotten any response so far from the theological side?",
        "Even though the book was officially released only last week, the response has already been remarkable and very encouraging.",
        "A lot of it coming from evangelicals to whom this is apostrophically(ph) that is, you know, representational directed.",
        "And most of them favorable they've been directed to me personally.",
        "Some of them are enthusiastic.",
        "Well, we've heard recently at sort of a turning of the tide among evangelicals saying, the Old Testament says we have to be, you know, protectors of the earth.",
        "I think that's always been the dominant interpretation, that it's to take possession of the earth, to be in dominion over it, which is in the Old Testament.",

        "It Comes out at a time where the wave is just beginning to develop - a new wave from all across the Judeo-Christian denominational stretch of beliefs and is becoming more conspicuous.",

        "And each one of those has dropped biodiversity to a level that took somewhere between five and ten million years for evolution to restore.",
        "We're not that far along yet, but we are definitely in the early stages of it.",
        "You say that humanity must make a decision and make it now, right now.",

        "And the age of mammals, sometimes called the Cenozoic - if we wipe out, as many serious projections have it without abatement of the current human activities that are removing ecosystems and extinguishing species, if we continue to the end of the century, we could have lost or have right on the edge of losing about half of the known species of plants and animals.",
        "Very interesting.",

        "You write many people seem content to live entirely in the synthetic ecosystems.",
        "This, in my mind, is a perversion.",
        "It's not the nature of human beings to be cattle in glorified feedlots.",
        "Right.",
        "It's not enough to look at the animals that we raise in feedlots and take note that they seem to be contented.",
        "They're not complaining very much.",
        "But the animals that are being raised in feedlots are very far from the full animal.",
        "They are not behaving.",
        "They are not working out their life cycle in the manners programmed into their brains and into the course of their developing physiology.",
        "And I think there is abundant evidence that human beings need nature.",
        "They need wild environments.",
        "They need at least pastoral environments duplicating the early habitats of human beings in order to develop fully as people."

        "Yeah, well that's based on personal experience, 41 years of teaching at Harvard.",
        "And during that entire time, almost every year, I taught beginning courses.",
        "And I made it by choice for non scientists.",
        "I felt that the greatest effect an educator could have at a place like Harvard would be to be passing biology over to our future legislators, our future writers, business leaders, and not the least, talk show hosts.",
        "And so in taking that series of taking that approach, I learned a few things about teaching.",
        "One of them was to teach top down.",
        "And that means to select topics that really matter to people and to which students already have some familiarity, such as why must we die at all.",
        "Why do we die of old age?",
        "What is the purpose of sex?",
        "I can always count on their dropping the Harvard crimson and starting to take notes again when I did that.",

        "And you have their attention.",
        "And so that's one principle of teaching that I proposed.",
        "But certainly another one was to come at biology with a heavy emphasis on biological diversity: what's out there, how much we know about it, how little we know about it, and how it got there and what's happening to it.",

        "Yeah, I do discuss math phobia.",

        "But as I like to point out to my students, another broad high - and to educators, generally.",
        "That's one reason I wrote the book was this book is for educators, college and high school educators.",
        "That one broad avenue into understanding science but also careers in science is through the study of higher-level biology.",
        "That is the great ranges of diversity, how organisms adapt.",
        "And this route then takes the student to a place where they now wish to cut more deeply into the mechanisms of physiology and brain action and so forth that underlie the phenomena of adaptation and biodiversity.",
        "But then you've got them set up; you've set them up for learning mathematics.",
        "And you can actually teach them, as I did countless mathophobes(ph) at Harvard, enough probability theory, a little statistics, and you can actually get them, as I made sure I did every year, doing something like deriving the binomial equation in order to solve the distribution of frequencies of genes in a population.",
