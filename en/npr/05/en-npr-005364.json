        "They don't know it.",
        "Yeah, it's natural I think to human beings to care about it.",
        "Now we tend, particularly in this country, to put caring about the environment in terms of the simple process of reducing toxic pollution and making sure that we don't get melanoma from too much sunlight.",
        "And now climate warming, we understand that's a big problem.",
        "But we really haven't gotten our minds much around the rest of life and the existence of natural ecosystems around the world that are disappearing rapidly.",
        "I like always to try to get people's attention by pointing out that estimates by biologists and economists together - the last one made in 1997 but I don't think it's changed an awful lot - of the value of the services that ecosystems give us.",
        "That is, you know, the assemblages of natural living plants, animals, and microorganisms, and in service - the services are those that include purification of water, the management of water reserves and the way it's passed to us, pollination, and the renewal of the soil and the very air we breathe, purification of the air we breathe.",
        "(Through interpreter) It was May, so the hill was covered with grass.",
        "Those services amount very, very roughly to the gross world product - that is all the combined national products, domestic, national domestic products of the world.",
        "And that's in the vicinity of $30 trillion.",
        "And we get that scot-free.",
        "So that ought to be a reason for not, you know, for not disposing of that facility and trying to substitute at high expense the human contrivances that probably don't do it as well.",
        "But there are many, many other reasons why we should start getting our minds around the need for conservation, not the least that the biodiversity of the world, the creation is disappearing so quickly.",
        "And that is why, as a scientist feeling some sense of urgency, I then started thinking a little bit differently and a little more deeply about the role of religion.",
        "And it occurred to me that the solution really may be political solution, as well as whatever comes out of the will and the hands and the hearts of people could be best recruited if we could get people on both sides of this culture war, the religion and science differences, to collaborate.",

        "You don't seem to say you're going to change anybody's mind.",
        "You just lay out your issue and say, we can agree to disagree but it's in our both interest to do something.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's why I speak throughout the book - when I bring up the issues of science and religion disputes - that this is not the time, this is not the place in history, in my opinion, to fight out these differences because you're not going to solve them.",
        "The chasm cannot be closed.",
        "There's too much at stake on both sides.",
        "And we just have to evolve toward solutions in the future of a site unseen and nature unknown, but that we do have the power between us to get together and solve one of the great problems of humanity.",
        "What do you say to people who say, well, look, you know - and you address this in the book a bit - it's natural, you know, for these, for species who get wiped out all the time, you know, the world has grown up over billions of years with - species come, species go, animals die off, they don't die off.",
        "What's so different about this now?",
        "Thank you for setting me up there, Ira, or at least setting up a very important point.",
        "Because this probably is the single most common objection I get in talking with people of all kinds and different professions and so on about conservation.",
        "They say why care about it?",
        "Don't worry, evolution - if we believe in evolution - will and always has replaced the lost diversity, and that is true.",
        "It's true that some 99 percent of species, maybe more, have disappeared in the course of history of life on earth, but that covers, mind you, hundreds of millions of years.",
        "And the figure to keep in mind is not that 99 percent figure, but it is the rate of turnover and the rate of extinction and the rate of birth of new species.",
        "And that is, for both those figures - extinction and birth outside of the period of human activity was by fossil evidence mainly, about one species extinct per million species per year being replaced by one species being born per million species per year.",
        "That's a very slow turnover.",
        "Now I think virtually all students who work on this whole issue of biodiversity and extinction rates and so on agree that most conservatively, that rate has increased due to our influence by an order of 100 times, and very likely 1,000 times if not yet on the order of 1,000 times, soon to be there, with the potential of going faster and faster as we wipe out more and more entire ecosystems.",
        "So you can now put that in terms of your bank account, in which there may be a very slow turnover.",
        "You've got a very low interest rate, but then you only make a rare withdrawal to replace what you put in.",
        "Now increase your withdrawal 100 or 1,000 times while reducing your income, because we're reducing the birth-rate of species by removing their cradles.",
        "You know, when I took Ecology 101 in college in the ‘60s, the professor threw out one question I have yet to actually answered myself.",
        "I'm going to ask you this question, because I've never fully answered it.",
        "And he said every animal, every plant, whatever, has a niche in the ecosystem and the environment.",
        "What is the human role in the environment?",
        "What is our niche?",
        "It seems now to be to destroy everything else.",
        "What happened there, I can give you my perception of this.",
        "But I would've answered - maybe I couldn't have answered it when you were in college, but I think I can give a reasonable answer now.",
        "The human niche, the thing that our brains were built for, was to live primarily on the African savannah as highly social primates, even more so than our closest cousins among the monkeys and apes, and to be vegetarian in part, but also more than other species closer related to us, including most of those monkeys and apes, to be turning to meat."

        "So that's our niche.",
        "Open terrain, scattered trees, copses and so on, and that's where we fit in, and it was all we could do, those ancient hominids of which there probably were not more than a few hundred thousand at any given time, maybe even less in periods of time.",
        "They fit in very well and they weren't really upsetting any of the balance of anything.",
        "But then somehow, somewhere, which is all a matter of dispute among the evolutionary biologists and the anthropologists, we began this runaway development of the cerebrum, intelligence, technology, and pretty soon without losing our appetite for meat and for breeding and producing more of ourselves and the ability to turn a large part of the natural world that was not savannah into savannah - we call it farms and yards and lawns - soon we are sweeping over the world, and we're simply trying to make the whole world our niche.",
        "And that in a nutshell is the problem.",
        "We neglected almost all of those other species, which have been keeping things in harmony and balance for us, and we're doing it in a way that we're taking away their services, we're taking away the many opportunities at understanding these species offer us, and we are generally messing up big time.",

        "I understand them.",
        "I understand, you know, the great and powerful virtues of Evangelical movement, and so they come to represent the Judeo Christian communities as a whole.",
        "Looking over the activities of Judeo Christian societies in both the new world and the old world, they have really begun to make important strides in awareness and conservation activities.",
        "But at the present time, I have to say Islam and the peoples under the - who are practicing Eastern religions have not moved significantly in that direction.",

        "Yes I agree in large part, and I think Jared, as he usually does with quite clarity, has put his finger on an important propensity of human behavior.",
        "As we were just discussing earlier, maybe the causes of it, you know, how it unfolded it in history - he doesn't deal with much.",
