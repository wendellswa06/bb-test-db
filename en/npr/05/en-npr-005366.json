        "Wait a minute, drunk driving goes down?",
        "So people are at home busy eating after they got the food stamps?",
        "Well, I think I should first say that this is just an empirical finding.",
        "They're finding a correlation between the effects of when the food stamp benefits are given out and drunk driving.",
        "Now, there's lots of speculation on why this could be the case.",
        "Ozturk thinks this is happening because for many families the food stamp payment is coming after a period of food scarcity.",
        "Many recipients of the program use their benefits within a few days of receiving it, meaning the family has less to eat in the following weeks of the month.",
        "So once they get the benefit, Ozturk thinks what often happens is you have a meal that's almost a celebration.",
        "Family members who might not be a regular part of the household, friends and neighbors all come home.",

        "They're not at liquor stores.",
        "They're not driving.",
        "And so what are the implications of this?",
        "Well, one implication, Steve, is that if indeed the food stamp program is reducing drunk driving fatalities, can you give out the food stamp benefit more than once a month?",
        "Can you give it out twice a month, maybe three times a month?",
        "Save lives.",
        "And by spreading out the benefit, could you save lives?",
        "Now, this is, again, something that would have to be tested.",
        "It's possible that by diminishing the size of the benefit each time, you're not going to have the same effect.",
        "But it's at least worth testing.",
        "Could you just issue enough food stamps that people could get through the whole month and not be out of food near the end of the month?"
