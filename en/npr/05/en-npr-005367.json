        "Why did Google do this?",
        "Well, I think the focus has been on patents, and Google missed out on the Nortel patents a few weeks ago, where Apple, RIM and Microsoft formed a consortium and sort of snatched them away from them.",
        "And I think Motorola is the other low-hanging fruit from the patent side.",
        "They need a defensive portfolio of patents because otherwise, they're not doomed, but they're in a position where they have to have some strength to defend themselves.",
        "This is all kind of, you know, people sitting around at a table, and you look at the stacks of paper and say whose stack is bigger.",
        "Motorola has 24,500 patents underway or given to them, already assigned, and that's a big portfolio to help leverage what Microsoft, Apple, RIM and all the other companies, Nokia, Qualcomm, everyone else in this space has.",
        "What strength do all these patents give you in practical terms?",
        "It's defensive really.",
        "I mean, these companies, you know, you can see cases in which one firm wants to prevent another from going to market with something, like Apple trying to keep Samsung tablets off the market in Europe.",
        "But really, the companies don't benefit from trying to keep products off the market.",
        "They need to compete in the market.",
        "You know, there's a competitive advantage there, but then they can be the victim of this same approach.",
        "So this is kind of a nuclear war.",
        "You don't really want to do a first strike because if you do, you know that there's all this other retaliation, including from other member-states, not the first worlds.",
        "But it's hard to deny the idea now that, you know, Google has an Android operating system, and now it has access to all these patents.",

        "No one else can gainsay what they want to do.",
        "Does that mean that they're going to clamp down on this open-source Android platform?",
        "It's very tricky.",
        "Once you let the open-source cat out of the bag, you can't put it back in.",
        "The nature of the - I mean, people think about open source as being free and unlicensed, but it's not.",
        "There's very stringently defended licenses beneath most open source code, as distinct from free software that is licensed free.",
        "So Android, once it's been released, you know, there are discussions that Amazon might come out with its own tablet.",
        "Amazon could take everything that is Android up until some moment and say, well, we're going to take this and modify it and not call it Android.",
        "We'll use all the same code and call it the, you know, the Amazoid tablet operating system.",
        "And they'd be perfectly within their rights to do so.",
        "So there is still the potential for competition from companies taking the Android source code and making their own versions going forward.",
        "So we might see a battle of all these cell-phone makers and tablet makers boiling down to the big three.",
        "That's what it feels like right now.",
        "We've got Apple.",
        "We have Microsoft.",
        "We have Google.",
        "And, you know, HP just took itself out of the running yesterday, which is - you know, it's baffling because they haven't lost that much money in relative terms to what they could gain if they actually got a foothold in the tablet or smartphone world.",
        "But yeah, three big companies, and they're enormous, and no one could really reach the scale to compete against them now because they're so entrenched in the marketplace."

        "Christian is in Barcelona, and Patrick is in Prague.",
        "Especially when we were Ph.D. students, of course, the cost of the flight had a big impact on our decision to collaborate and spend time together.",
        "Graduate students don't have all that much money.",
        "And so if they could get cheap flights, they could actually spend more time face to face and doing research together.",

        "And previous research has shown that even though there are all kinds of ways for scientists to collaborate online and via technologies like Skype, it's really useful for them to be able to meet face to face and spend time together.",
        "So if one barrier to meetings among these far-flung teams is the cost of travel, lowering the cost of travel should increase collaboration."

        "universities studying chemistry.",
        "They eventually focused on a sample of 10,000 scientists, which included hundreds of pairs of collaborators.",
        "They measured what happens to collaboration between pairs of scientists before and after Southwest Airlines enters a region and starts flying routes between the two metro areas where the scientists are located.",
        "Oh, wow.",
        "Now usually when Southwest enters a market, what happens is other airlines compete on these routes and fares drop dramatically.",
        "Here's Catalini again.",
        "We do see a substantial spike in collaboration when these cheaper fares become available.",
        "It's about a 50 percent spike.",
        "And what's interesting is that it's actually stronger when we control for quality.",
        "So the collaboration that were somewhat enabled by the cheaper fares doesn't seem to be lower quality collaborations.",
        "So it doesn't seem to be lower quality collaboration when we have these cheaper fares.",
        "But you actually came in and talked, at one point, to us about when there's more geographic diversity, when people from different parts of the country are able to come together and collaborate, actually increases the quality of the science.",
        "Right?",
        "That's right.",
        "So this is research by Richard Freeman we talked about a few months ago, David.",
        "He found the greater the ethnic and geographic diversity of collaborators on scientific papers, the more likely the papers were to be cited by other scientists, which is one metric of the quality of the work.",
