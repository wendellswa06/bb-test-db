        "You know what the irony here is, as someone who's watched this business for 40 years, is that Apple used to get killed by people, these competitors saying why are you in the hardware business, right?",
        "And they even went out of the - they even actually licensed their hardware for a little bit, it didn't work out very well but kept, you know, saying when you buy a Mac or an Apple, you're buying the hardware as well as the software.",
