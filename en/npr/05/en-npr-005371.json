        "And, you know, certainly, for the last 200-plus years of our republic, we have, our public and our political discourse has been serious, it has been deeply contested, and more often than not, you will find large streaks of rudeness, disrespect, and so on.",

        "I also think that there is a certain kind of vulgarity in our popular culture that gives the impression that today, incivility, the lack of respect, a rudeness, a coarseness in our culture, is far greater today than it was in the past.",
        "Let me bring Judith Martin in on this discussion.",
        "What is your take on this?",
        "Is there a greater lack of civility in America today?",
        "I also give that decisive answer, yes and no. But, on the yes, on the no side, I would like to point out that there have been enormous advances in civility, also, in public discourse.",
        "It was not that long ago that politicians, with impunity, would make bigoted jokes and remarks.",

        "Jefferson, who was just mentioned, Jefferson also wrote a book of legislative civility for the Virginia legislature, calling again for, why can't we just behave.",
        "Now, the answer here, I think, has to do with a number of things, since everybody is calling for civility, which I'm very grateful for, the President's calling for it, Governor Cain called for it in his response, and indeed, politicians in both parties have been calling for it for a long time.",
        "But, why aren't they civil, then?",
        "And, I think, first of all, they mistake it for giving up their positions, for social manners, where you kind of sweep your differences under the rug.",
        "And this is quite the opposite.",
        "The rules of civility for government, for legislative bodies and for other branches of government, are precisely so that you can air your differences in a meaningful way, instead of doing the natural open etiquette free thing, which is calling other people stupid and worse.",

        "And so, in election debates, that is usually what wins.",
        "Now, at the Presidential level, it's usually a little higher toned, but at lower political levels in particular, the person who listens politely to the other person and deals with his argument, instead of, you know, spitting when he talks, getting all excited and attacking the other person, is not elected, because he's seen as somebody who doesn't feel strongly enough about his positions.",

        "And I think his point about it being easier to call the other person stupid than to actually deal with an argument that you disagreement with is an extremely important one.",
        "And Professor Hunter, with just about a minute and a half to go, I want to ask you, do the politics of today, is that, in part, the political divide that we have in this nation now, is that, in part, leading to this incivility that we're talking about?",
        "I think that the political culture tends to be polarized by certain factors that are present today that weren't in the past.",
