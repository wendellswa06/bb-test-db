        "And what normally happens is that they look at it on a case-by-case basis.",
        "But what we saw, once the Department of Defense study began and once this policy statement that Kristin mentioned came out, what we saw was the FAA started issuing letters to projects saying, until this study is completed we cannot allow you - we won't give you this determination of no hazard, as they call it, to allow you to move forward.",
        "What was curious, and one of the reasons that the wind industry is concerned about this, is just the uncertainty.",

        "We're only seeing these FAA letters in a few states in the upper Midwest.",
        "Meanwhile, other projects are moving forward and being approved by FAA.",
        "So I think this has caused an incredible amount of uncertainty in the industry and, you know, I think that these developers are working on schedules.",
