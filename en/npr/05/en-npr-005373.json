        "Then Annexco decided to go out a little farther and they got about 20,000 acres in one block.",
        "And then the tax credits, which is 1.7 cents, they ran out in December 2003, so that kind of put a hold on it for a year.",
        "And then they reinstated those.",
        "And in the meantime, they put a met(ph) tower on my ground, which measured the wind for the last almost four years.",

        "I'll take the turbines.",

        "But to me it's minimal.",

        "To some of the ones that are closer to some of the communities, what we've been finding is that the governor pushed through a tax change bill last year to allow the cities and counties to take some of the tax revenue from these projects.",
        "And you'd be amazed at what happens to the opposition when it becomes time to fund schools and fire districts and local hospitals with the revenue from these projects.",

        "I think that what's important to know is that outside of the Altamont Pass, which is the first commercial project that was installed in the United States, that the effects to birds are really minimal, and especially when they're put into context with all of the other things.",
        "Even if we got 100 percent of our power from wind power, which we, you know -which is probably not realistic - but even if we had 100 percent of our power from wind, the bird impacts would be very minimal, compared to things like buildings, cats, vehicles, pesticides and all of the other things that affect birds.",
        "With regard to bats, there was something that was unexpectedly discovered in 2003.",
        "There was a project here in the Eastern United States that they were looking to make sure that there weren't a whole lot of impacts.",
        "They were looking for birds and they didn't find a lot of birds, but they did find a lot of bats."
