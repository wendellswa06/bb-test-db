        "Yes.",
        "I just recently retired after 24 years in the utility industry.",
        "And my point is I'd like to tell everyone just exactly about the costs of wind energy.",
        "In a typical coal-fired power plant, it talks about $25 a megawatt to produce power.",
        "But the quoted figures for wind energy is closer to $75 a megawatt.",
        "This may be green power, and it may be non-polluting power, but the public needs to understand there is a very definite cost.",
        "I mean when you start seeing your utility bills go up, part of it is the utilization of wind power.",
        "And I think everyone should understand that.",
        "You know, what makes wind power socially acceptable in a lot of areas is the tax breaks and the money that's going to the individuals who have units sited on their property.",
        "But to the taxpayer or to the rate-payers as a whole, wind power is a relatively expensive situation.",
        "And if you take here in Wisconsin, wind power is typically only available about 30 percent of the time.",
        "And so the other 70 percent of the time, when these generators are down and not running, they are actually consuming power off of a coal-fired generation system here in Wisconsin.",
        "There's relays, protected relays and heaters and various other electrical entities in these machines that consume power.",
        "So the 30 percent of the time when they are actively running is, you know, offset somewhat by the 70 percent of the time when they are idle.",
        "And they are actually a load on the inherent system.",
        "So I think, you know, a lot of people talk about wind power but you need to understand that these are not all that they're supposed to be when it comes to providing a good source of power for the public.",
        "Laurie Jodziewicz?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that there's a couple of things there.",
        "Wind energy is actually competitive with other sources of electricity, fossil fuel sources of electricity, right now.",
        "It's in a competitive range.",
        "It depends on the site, but it's about three to seven cents per kilowatt hour, which is I don't think is quite what the gentleman mentioned.",
        "And I think the other thing to be aware of is - he mentioned this 30 percent.",
        "I think the - that's somewhat of a misunderstanding.",
        "Wind turbines have a rated power, which is if the wind was ideal, that's the amount of power that they would produce under the best circumstances.",
        "What happens at wind sites is that the wind might not blow at that ideal rate but those turbines are still producing at somewhat of a lower level.",
        "And because of the way that utilities deal with power, this is a little bit different for them, but they certainly indicated that they can handle it."

        "He's going to have to change a lot of things about himself and about his inner circle and about his style that I'm extremely skeptical that he's going to be able or willing to do.",
        "There was a study that was recently done by some of the major power associations - the Edison Electric Institute, the American Public Power Association and the National Rural Electric Cooperatives Association - that said that they can handle wind on their system.",
        "It's something that they are interested in doing.",
        "And I think that that's, it's something we're seeing more and more.",
        "But it certainly is competitive with other forms of electricity.",
        "And it really does, in these days of high costs for especially things like natural gas, wind energy is actually brining down the costs of electricity to some consumers by offsetting that need for more natural gas use.",
        "Thanks for calling, Mike.",
        "Sure.",
        "Is wind power going to be local then?",
        "I mean we see states, you know, putting them in different places around the states.",
        "They're not feeding a national grid, are they?",
        "Or we're keeping them local at this point?",
        "They are treated as other power plants.",
        "So what happens when a developer puts in and installs the turbines, they make a deal with the local utility and they feed into that local utility grid just like any other power plant, and then that utility sells the power to its various consumers.",
        "There are cases where there are people who put a wind turbine up.",
        "There are residential-sized wind turbines that people use to power their homes, and we also see wind turbines at things like schools, offsetting the power use for a municipal solid waste-processing facility.",
        "But they're generally, in most cases, treated similar to other power plants.",
        "Kermit, in Spearville where you live, is there room for more turbines on more farms and more acreage?",
        "The transmission lines is probably going to be the factor that hinders.",
        "I think they have enough.",
        "We put in 100 megawatts as of now.",
        "Thirty of them - half of them are up this morning.",
        "So - but as far - we're not in the grid, I guess.",
        "I'm not an electrician, but we have power lines that need more transmission lines to make this farm expand.",
        "I think they could double it and still get the electricity towards the Woodston-Kansas City area.",
        "Kansas City Power and Light bought this first 100 megawatts as soon as it gets built.",
        "But after that I think they could double it.",
        "But then after that there's going to have to be more transmission lines, basically to get it in the grid, so to speak."

        "That's why people had talked about an integrated approach where you would take the electricity and turn it into hydrogen by, you know, by water.",

        "All the crews came in to start building in April.",
        "I think they poured the first concrete April 20.",
        "They're done with all the pads now, and probably a little over halfway up with all the towers.",

        "They just - they put up three or four a day, so they're at the final phases now, the construction, but the electrical work takes a lot of - they propose by the 1st of October it'll be, everything will be up and running.",
