        "Fine.",
        "I joined late, and I heard a couple callers ago is where I sort of where I tuned in.",
        "And something that struck me in connection with assessing the economic viability of alternative energy sources is the fact that our models - and the caller was focused on, you know, the today-cost to the consumer as opposed to looking at an economic model that assesses, includes, you know, the long-term costs of environmental damage of impact, health impact, etc. And I would love to hear that addressed in the mix of, you know, the economic viability.",
        "Let me just remind everybody that I'm Ira Flatow and this is TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "Because that is a good question.",

        "Right, and health issues associated with fossil fuels.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Ira, our utilities out in Washington actually do that when they do their planning.",
        "And they come up with figures?",
        "They actually - you know, you have to pick a figure for what you think carbon is going to cost or what you think some of those other externalities are worth, but when you do that and then you run the model looking for the least-cost resources, what's coming out of the models right now is wind.",

        "Well if it's only four to seven cents a kilowatt-hour, that's cheaper than what I'm paying in my house for my electric bill.",
        "Well, and I think that that's, you know, utilities buy power probably cheaper than they sell it to us, but I think that that's true.",
        "Today's costs, you know, for wind, there's no fuel required, there's no drilling, there's no mining, there's no emissions, there's no hazardous waste to clean up.",
        "So I think that that's why it's such an attractive option in many places where it can really compete.",
        "But Kermit has a good point.",
        "What's the sense of putting all these wind turbines up if you can't hook them to anything?",
        "If you can't the power out of it, it's not in the grid, you know?",
        "How do we get to that, or jump over that hurdle?",
        "Where does that leadership come from?",
        "Well, maybe Matt can talk a little bit about what is going on in the Northwest, but there's definitely a need for more transmission, not just for wind but there's a need for more electric transmission lines all over the country.",
        "And there's a lot of planning and discussions going on.",
        "I'm not a transmission expert, but I know that that's a big part of the discussion, and transmission is really something that in the longer term I think the wind industry really needs.",
        "It's a big priority for us.",
        "Matt?",
        "We are doing a lot of work on that out here.",
        "Just this last week, the Power and Planning Conservation Council plus the Bonneville Power Administration, which owns 70 percent of the transmission in the region, announced that they were going to kick off a study to look specifically at the thing that Kermit's asked.",
        "You know, how much wind can we put in the system, and how will it work?",
        "We have a huge advantage over a lot of places in the country because we have a hydro system that acts as a big battery so that when the wind isn't blowing, we can run the battery of the hydro system, and when the wind picks up, we can store more water."

        "So they're a very nice mechanism.",
        "Iris, are you a wind aficionado?",
        "Well, someday I would like to be, but I'm just doing some preliminary research.",
        "I can't afford to go and get anything set up at my house at this point, but they sure - the vertical-axis looks like it's going to be the way to go for the small person, for individual units.",

        "Any advice, Kermit, you can give to Iris?",
