        "And what happened?",
        "Well, it was actually pretty amazing.",
        "They had 29 mice who were not treated with RU-486.",

        "And Syd, could this also be another example of the link that many researchers have suspected between progesterone and breast cancer?",
        "Yes, I think that that's the most likely explanation for why RU-486 was so successful with these mice.",
        "The little mouse breast cancer was very strong in its number of receptors for progesterone, and in human beings it's well known that if you have post menopausal women and you use - you give them hormone replacement therapy using pills that contain both estrogen and progesterone, they have a increased risk of breast cancer.",
