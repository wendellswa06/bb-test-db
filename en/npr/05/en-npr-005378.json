        "Does it say that this is about atmospherics and a broad sense of optimism, or does it say that there are real indicators about the real economy of the country, which suggests perhaps the markets were undervaluing them?",
        "Well, I think we have to - we don't have to, but I tend to view the markets as irrational no matter where we are, and there is absolutely no such thing as a rationally priced stock market or, for that matter, a rationally priced stock, and the reason for that is that the equation is so influenced by human emotion.",

        "January and February were particularly bad months, after closing out the year on a slight rally but still down about 35 or 38 percent from the highs.",

        "It does count very heavily on the tuition students pay, so a big question is, how are the finances of the middle class families whose sons and daughters apply?",
