        "Now is part of the challenge here that you have these two groups that have claimed responsibility, but there's a whole list of groups that may be based in Egypt and some of them may be fictitious, some of them may be the same group by multiple names?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And, in fact, what the attacks do since last year, since October 2004, in fact, raise serious question about whether Ayman Zawahiri's Tonzeen al-Jihad still has an infrastructure in Egypt or whether al-Qaeda has been able to build local affiliates in the country.",
        "But, in fact, the--it seems to me regardless of whether a local affiliate carried out the attacks or al-Qaeda itself, it seems to me that Ayman Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden do have a base, either a structure or a base or a local affiliate in Egypt.",

        "Aside from being a white supremacist of the first order, he was also the author of the Tillman Act, which prohibits corporate money going to candidates for federal office, possibly the most important law on the books today in campaign finance.",
        "Now, here's what happened.",
        "In the 1880s, 1890s, going to the turn of the century, there was a series of scandals involving corporate money just pouring into presidential campaigns and other elections.",
        "There was a particular scandal in 1904, Teddy Roosevelt's election.",
        "A lot of corporate money was kept secret.",
        "This came out after the election.",
        "Roosevelt was caught in a bind here and he wanted some sort of reform legislation.",
        "There was a senator from New Hampshire who introduced a bill to ban corporate money.",
        "One of the corporations took him out in the next election and Pitchfork Ben Tillman stepped into the breach, which was not that uncomfortable a fit for him.",
        "There was a tradition at the time in the South of the white supremacists politicians also running on populist issues.",
        "So Tillman sponsored the bill, Roosevelt endorsed it, and it passed.",
        "And whether you think it's a good law or a bad law, it's been on the books for over 100 years and it sets one of the basic dividing lines in campaign finance law today, and it's called the Tillman Act.",
