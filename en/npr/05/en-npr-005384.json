        "There are all these sandboxes that I don't usually get to play in - you know, the National Symphony Orchestra or jazz with Jason Moran or various other forms.",
        "And so for me, it's kind of like going to second grade.",
        "Like, I have some basic literacy skills in what I do, but I really don't know what I'm doing.",
        "And I get to be in all of these rooms - these collaborative rooms with people who understand their mediums.",
        "And I think I understand my characters, and we get to just sort of make new stuff.",
        "Thanks so much for being with us.",
        "Of course.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Today we take the occasion to talk with John Miller who's been on both sides of the fence, first as a TV reporter and anchor, best known for his work at ABC News.",
        "You might remember a 1998 interview with Osama bin Laden.",
        "He's since worked for the police departments in New York City and Los Angeles.",
        "He's now assistant director of public affairs for the FBI and he joins us here at the Newseum.",
        "Thanks very much for coming in.",
        "Good to be here, Neal.",
        "We'll also talk with NPR FBI correspondent Dina Temple-Raston about covering the FBI, also here at the Newseum, and thank you for joining us.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "And we want to talk with you as well.",
        "Is the relationship between the media and the FBI too close, too confrontational?",
        "We'd especially like to hear from those of you with experience on either side of that fence.",
        "800-989-8255 is the phone number.",
        "Our email address, talk@npr.org.",
        "You can also tell us your story on our blog at npr.org/blogofthenation.",
        "Later on in the hour, we'll hear from the Unabomber's brother and from one of his victims about their unlikely friendship.",
        "But first the relationship between the media and the FBI.",
        "John Miller, let me start with you.",
        "I know the tour of the FBI building here in Washington used to be one of the most popular things for people to do.",
        "The building has been closed for obvious reasons since 9/11.",
        "Is this new exhibit at the Newseum a way to share the FBI's artifacts with the public?",
        "It very much is.",
        "The FBI tour meant an awful lot to the bureau.",
        "It was the second most popular tour in Washington, behind the White House, when it was open.",
        "It had a tradition for years, and there are many people in the FBI, and I've met them myself, and they've told me the stories, who either started as tour guides and became FBI agents and executives, or who went on the tour as kids and joined the FBI because of that."

        "Because of the post-9/11 security concerns about letting the general public into the building on a first-come-first-serve-basis, by the hundreds, we weren't able to continue that.",
        "And we felt that this opportunity to do the exhibit at the Newseum here, tracking, kind of, a hundred years of the FBI and its biggest stories, had a nexus to journalism, a nexus to the FBI.",
        "But also just being two blocks from FBI headquarters served as kind of a temporary replacement for that tour.",
        "Those of us who took the old tour will remember that the FBI was not exactly shy about extolling its virtues on that tour.",
        "I wonder, now that it's, the exhibit is here at the Newseum, do you make materials available that might illustrate some of the FBI's less stellar moments.",
        "The Robert Hanssen case or Waco or COINTELPRO, things like that?",
        "We do.",
        "I think, it's my personal view, but also the view of Dr. John Fox, our historian, and the senior management at the FBI, that if you're going to tell your history, you've got to tell the whole history, and that's the good and the bad.",
        "We made a film for internal consumption, for our own employees, that kind of tracks the 100-year history with a lot of great old pictures and films.",
        "And we talked about the allegations of abuses of power, some of the difficult times, some of the lessons learned from difficult incidents, and there was a discussion.",
        "Do we really need to include all that stuff, and go through the whole bloodletting again in our film?",
        "Can't we just tell the good parts?",
        "It's for our own people.",
        "And there's a saying, those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it.",
        "And we factored that in and we put the material in, too.",
        "We didn't dwell on it but we made sure we covered it.",
        "And were the materials selected by the FBI, or were they selected by curators here at the Newseum?",
        "Well, the Newseum, this is their house, and it's their exhibit.",
        "They have editorial control, if you will.",
        "They consider these artifacts.",
        "We call it evidence.",
        "At the end of this, we're going to want our stuff back, but that said, it was their story to tell and we certainly helped it to the extent that when they had questions we answered them, but we also realized, you know, we were at the intersection of a museum and journalists, a museum run by journalists, and that we would have to treat this like a story.",
        "One other question.",
        "You mentioned there's a historian at the FBI.",
        "It's not a position a lot of people would immediately think of at the FBI.",
        "Does that person go around thinking about, oh the evidence in this case, we need to preserve it for historical purposes?",
        "Well, first of all, we preserve evidence almost indefinitely, almost about everything.",
        "So we don't need any lessons in being packrats, it's in our nature.",
        "You don't really throw away evidence, because you don't know how a case is going to come back.",
        "But we did go through a process of identifying the kinds of things we have and when you look at us in terms of an agency with evidence, with artifacts, with things that are through the judicial process now, there is a moment in time when they go from being evidence, to actually a piece of history, a very tangible piece.",
        "So when you say, you know, what is booked into evidence?",
        "The Unabomber's cabin.",
        "You can actually come here to the Newseum and you can see the cabin that the Unabomber built with his own hands, lived in, where he constructed his bombs and hid them under the bed.",
        "Where he eluded authorities for a couple of decades.",
        "You can also see some of those other things like the hollow nickels or the cufflinks that spies hid coded messages in back in World War II.",
        "So, it is evidence, but it's also history.",
        "By the way, if you'd like to see what the inside of Ted Kaczynski's rural Montana cabin looked like when it was raided by the FBI, you can see that in the photo gallery at our website at npr.org.",
        "It's extraordinary.",
        "Of course, later in the program we will be speaking with Ted Kaczynski's brother, Dave, but that's another subject.",
        "Let me bring in our other guest in now, and that's of course, Dina Temple-Raston, NPR's FBI correspondent.",
        "Dina, nice to have you on the program."

        "That's a difficult area for us because, you know, I come from a career before this as a story teller, but when you're in the FBI, your storytelling ability is regulated by a lot of things, by the rules of the FBI, by the Department of Justice guidelines, by the law.",
        "And what Dina is talking about here is the same kind of thing I used to ask for as a reporter which is take me behind the story, tell me everything that happened that led up to it.",

        "attorney, the prosecutor.",
        "So after the arrest the statements, by and large, and this is the way the rule book has it, are supposed to be made by the prosecutor, because anything that is said is something that could reasonably prejudice the trial in some way, and they like to manage that.",
        "So that really takes us out of the conversation even though you know we probably have a great story to tell, it makes it very difficult for us to tell it.",
        "But frankly, there have been other cases where the FBI has provided that material to reporters in the past.",
        "There have been other cases where people within the FBI, people referred to as the mysterious law enforcement source, whether they're in the FBI or some associated agency or some prosecutor's office, you never quite know who provide that information.",
        "It will be a rare time when you see FBI officials speaking on the record about something of that nature.",

        "If you'd like to join us, 800-989-8255.",

        "We don't lack for oversight.",
        "We have congressional committees who have oversight over us.",
        "We have the Department of Justice who has oversight over us.",
        "We have the Office of Inspector General, which is an independent body in the Department of Justice that has oversight over us.",
        "And as the caller indicated, if you go to get a wiretap, you go before a federal judge and you have to make your case that you've exhausted all other investigative means to do that before they'll grant that."
