        "That's what I've found.",
        "What I do do to be fair to the FBI is whenever I have any of these tough stories I do eventually get round to John and give them an opportunity to actually, you know, give a comment about it.",

        "And if you don't then there are problems with that.",
        "Well, essentially, I went to other people who were having problems with that particular management issue before I went to John.",

        "And he could have quashed the story a great deal if he hadn't let me talk to the agent.",

        "And one of the reasons in Dina's case, we didn't hide from that story, and you know, she wanted to talk to an agent who was affected by this, who was going to tell the other side of the story, not the management side, but his view of it.",
        "And I said, you know, there's no reason not to have a spirited debate here.",
        "Let's not keep him - because we can order him as an employee not to talk - let's not keep him from telling his side.",
        "Let's just make sure we get to tell ours.",
        "And the agent actually, he talked to me, he says I have to go and talk to headquarters and get permission.",
        "I said, that's never going to happen.",
        "And he called headquarters and then he called me back and he says, you'll never believe it.",
        "They'll actually let me talk.",
        "So he was just as surprised as I was."
