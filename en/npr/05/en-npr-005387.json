        "If the Taliban don't behave, if they don't deliver on the commitments that they've made to us now for weeks and, in some cases, months, president of the United States is not going to reduce the pressure.",
        "We're not going to reduce our support for the Afghan security forces that have fought so hard there in Afghanistan.",
        "He's essentially saying there that the ends would've justified the means.",
        "How do you expect that that will go over with the different players in Afghanistan now?",
        "Well, from what we've been hearing, the American military will likely increase strikes and attacks on Taliban locations, including leaders.",
        "And the Taliban could very well respond in kind, going after, let's say, soft targets, civilian targets and so forth.",
        "So that's going to be a real concern going forward.",
        "And what we've been hearing for months now is that the Taliban - the political leadership is not unified.",
        "There are differences of opinion on negotiating table that some Taliban or more, let's say, conservative and not really willing to have a deal - you also have the military commanders in Afghanistan - the Taliban military commanders who may not agree to a deal.",
        "So they could continue fighting.",
        "That's been the problem all along.",
        "The Taliban is a fragmented organization.",
        "So we'll likely see more Taliban attacks and more American attacks on the Taliban.",
        "That's the way ahead, I think.",
        "Over the past few months, as you mentioned, the Taliban has been launching multiple suicide attacks, including an especially horrific one on a wedding.",
        "They have used this as leverage throughout the negotiating process.",
        "So I guess the question is, was there something different about this attack that might've prompted this response from the president?",
        "I think a couple of things, Lulu.",
        "I think, first of all, they expected a few days after this horrific attack - this attack that killed 12 people, including an American soldier from Puerto Rico - that, you know, they expected to have talks.",
        "And the American soldier was killed.",
        "I think that was part of it.",
        "And that's what the - President Trump mentioned in his tweet.",
        "So that was a big part of this, I think - that the American soldier was killed.",

        "He is at the top of his game, but even Mo Willems can suffer a touch of irrational imposter syndrome.",
        "When the Kennedy Center came calling and asked if he'd like to be their first-ever education artist in residence, he said, yes, of course, but he was also a bit freaked out.",
        "What it means is I get to be really, really terrified in all kinds of new, different ways.",
        "One of the challenges was to take one of his most beloved characters, Pigeon, from the page to the stage in the form of a musical.",

        "Mo Willems is a creative mind in the truest sense.",

        "More concept cars and more performance cars and more sexy cars are representative of the booming economy.",
        "Building and moving concept cars from show to show isn't cheap, so when the economy is bad, they're the first thing that gets cut.",

        "Six million - that's how many children are considered disabled in the U.S.",
        "today, a nearly 16 percent increase from a decade ago.",
        "And what accounts for that rise is explained in a new study out this week in the Journal of Pediatrics.",
        "The research shows that while physical disabilities are down, neurodevelopmental or mental health conditions are up, especially among children from more affluent families.",

        "So you mine this data from the National Health Interview Survey, and I understand this is a survey where parents are reporting, right, the disabilities of their kids?",
        "How do they define disability?",
        "In this study, disability is defined as activity limitations.",
        "So that's relatively broad.",
        "It can be anything that the parent identified that their child isn't able to do in the same way other children are able to do.",
        "So for example, being able to take care of themselves, walk around without a device to help them, needing special education services or early intervention, or anything else that the parent could pinpoint where their child was limited in their activities compared to other children.",
        "So help us understand the most recent data here.",
        "What disabilities are we seeing less of, and what disabilities are we seeing more of?",
        "In this study over the ten-year period, we actually saw a decrease in disability related to physical health conditions, such as asthma or having an injury.",
        "We saw an increase in disability related to neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions.",
        "Those conditions are things like ADHD or learning disabilities or any developmental problem that could be a cause of neurodevelopmental disabilities.",
        "Now here's the thing, you note in the research that it's more affluent families who account for a greater increase in the cases of those disorders in particular.",
        "Talk a little bit about what those numbers actually looked like.",
        "Where did you see it?",
        "Where did it stand out?",
        "Well, the first point is that we know the experience of disability, it's just much more common among children in less-advantaged households.",
        "But the children who lived in more advantaged households had a greater relative increase of 28 percent compared to children who live in poverty, for example.",
        "They had a rate increase of 10.7 percent.",
        "But still, the absolute numbers of children who have disabilities is much higher among those who live in poverty."

        "This study can't tell us exactly why these trends are occurring.",
        "We hypothesize that perhaps the rates of autism are increasing and the rates of other neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions are rising, and therefore disability related to those conditions is also on the rise.",
        "I also think there might be some shifts in terms of how society feels about talking about disability, being more open and seeking out a diagnosis.",
        "And this brings to light something else - something about health care access.",
        "So we know children who live in poverty have less ability to access the health care system, and so therefore maybe children who are in more affluent families have better access to getting a diagnosis and therefore getting treatment.",
        "You also write that doctors may be contributing to this as a result of undetected bias.",
        "In what way and what's your basis for that assessment?",
        "There's quite a bit of literature that supports the idea that the way physicians and health care providers approach families differs in terms of what the family brings to the table and the encounter.",
        "So a family from a more affluent background is able to articulate their concerns and their needs in a different way.",
        "That might raise the suspicion of the doctor to look for the condition, to make a diagnosis and recommend treatment.",
        "On the flipside, a family who is less affluent might not bring to the attention of the provider in the same way, nor may the provider ask the questions that would lead them down the path of making a diagnosis of a developmental problem or mental health problem.",

        "What the Democrats are hoping in the future is the demographic changes in the South - so whether it's blacks coming back to the South from having lived in the North and the West or whether it's large numbers of Asian-Americans and the Latinos who would now be settling in the South, as opposed to the southwest or the West Coast - that that would actually help to create this large, multiracial coalition that would eventually outnumber whites in the South and that would actually help the Democratic Party.",
        "I think the lesson that we're learning from both last month's elections and from yesterday's elections is that whites have to be an important part of that Democratic coalition.",
        "And so the Democratic Party is going to have to find a way to reach out to white voters both nationally, but particularly in the South because these Democratic candidates we're losing, in part, because they were getting significantly less than 30 percent of the white vote.",
