        "Piketty's book has been widely praised by economists for breaking new ground in the area of economic inequality.",
        "At the heart of the book is his assertion that inequality is not an accident, but inherent to capitalism.",
        "He says over the long-term, higher returns to capital than to labor are giving the richest people in the world a growing share of global wealth.",
        "As evidence of this, Piketty points to rising concentrations of wealth in the U.S.",
        "and Europe since the 1970s.",
        "But the Financial Times discovered some flaws in Piketty's work.",
        "It found errors in the data he used, suggested he had cherry-picked the data to support his conclusions and even constructed some data out of thin air.",

        "And it seems that, on a lot of those, we're probably better off saying we simply don't know.",
        "Piketty has defended himself saying the FT is being ridiculous.",
        "But he, too, has acknowledged that the available data on wealth are imperfect.",
        "However, Piketty told the French news agency AFP that, quote, \"\"more recent studies only support my conclusions by using different sources.\"\" But Cowen thinks Piketty simply doesn't make a strong case that high returns on capital are a bad thing.",
        "If we're really in a world where capital just keeps on accumulating and earning 5 percent, I think, in the long run, that will turn into higher wages and a lot of innovation.",
