        "It's unsettled science, in our opinion, and that's our - that's our position, and we've been clear about that.",
        "At the meeting, the TCEQ offered a compromise - the agency would publish \"\"State of the Bay\"\" without Anderson's chapter, and dissident scientists could publish the unedited chapter on their own.",
        "But that didn't placate the Galveston Bay Council that held the meeting.",
