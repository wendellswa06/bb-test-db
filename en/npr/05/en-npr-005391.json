        "RAFAEL FERNÃNDEZ DE CASTRO: Thank you for having me in your program.",
        "And tell me, Professor Fernandez, what do you see as the biggest factors behind that zero net migration?",
        "I would say that the number one reason behind this is the U.S.",
        "economy.",
        "It's the lack of jobs in the U.S., it's the high unemployment rate.",
        "The construction industry has been very low.",
        "So that is the number one factor, no doubt about it.",
        "But also, we have to say that there is this siege against the migrant population in places like Alabama, in places like in Arizona.",
        "I mean, there is local laws that they're basically profiling the Latino migrants.",
        "And that is not helping.",
        "And you're saying that is deterring Mexicans from coming to the U.S., people who might otherwise come?",
        "Or its sending people back home who are here?",
        "There is nothing new about the Congress coming to a hostile halt at a critical moment - fussing and fuming, holding impromptu news conferences at the Ohio Clock - that's a nearly 200-year-old timepiece that counts the hours outside the Senate Chamber - or representatives stopping to chat in the beautiful Rayburn reception room outside the House with George Washington looking disapprovingly down from his portrait.",
        "I remember many Christmas weeks spent with my colleagues covering the House and Senate instead of with my own family at my own house.",
        "More than once, my friend Cokie Roberts and I brought wrapping paper and ribbons to the Senate radio and television gallery, trying to get all our gifts wrapped and sent in time.",
        "At least there were lots of post offices open around Capitol Hill, and no lines.",
        "But no matter how irritating it was to wait around and waste time, there was a strong expectation that the waiting would end with an agreement on whatever the contentious issue was - a tax bill, a budget resolution, maybe a resolution to continue doing whatever they were doing until the details could be settled.",
        "And maybe that will happen.",
        "Maybe the cautious optimism will blossom into agreement.",
        "But these days there is an expectation that under the beautiful white dome of the Capitol, there is a little sandbox inhabited by stubborn little kids who've been very badly brought up, never learned to share, never learned to use their words or most especially, never learned to mind their manners, their mothers or in this case, their voters, who clearly don't like what's going on.",
        "The biggest battles I recall in Congress, then as now, were over taxes, but the arguments sounded different.",
        "One of my favorite chairmen of the Senate tax-writing committee, Senator Russell Long of Louisiana - no longer with us, alas - once brought up a sticky proposition holding up a tax bill.",
        "I don't say I'm for it, he said, rocking back in his big leather chair, I don't say I'm against it.",
        "I just say who gets it?",
        "Now, that is not an expression of a philosophy; that is the basis for a decision.",
        "And it appears that as the president and the present Congress tussle over taxes, that is still what remains to be settled.",
        "How hard is that?"

        "It was not a lot of differences happened except that I remember the groupings, students were grouped according to ability - ability grouping in those days, and pretty much like it is today, though the basic groups were predominantly black and the advanced groups were predominantly white.",
        "And I was one of those students who happened to be in the predominantly white - the advanced group - and I never understood why I could not be in the classrooms with students who look like me.",
        "So that was one of the things that really stood out.",
        "Jonathan, we just heard a little bit about desegregation in the South versus the North.",
        "Now, when you first got into teaching, the country was just beginning to deal with desegregation.",
        "If you walked into a Northern classroom in the early days of desegregation, would you have actually seen black and white students together?"

        "Well, yes.",
        "Not in the cities themselves, but - because those very little - there was very little integration in the cities, but a lot of the Northern cities developed voluntary integration programs with the suburbs that surrounded them.",
        "In Massachusetts, for example, 34 of the top suburbs surrounding Boston began a tremendous pressure from the civil rights group who do each other's working, began a voluntary integration program.",
        "And it still exists, by the way.",

        "For example, in the city, I had 35 children in my class.",
        "Now, suddenly out in the suburbs, I had only 19.",
        "And those black students - without exception - did very, very well academically.",
        "Yes, there was a little social discomfort at the first, but it disappeared pretty quickly.",
        "They made - because we started when they were young, they made friends with their classmates.",
        "And anyway, over the course of 40 years, 90 percent of the black and Hispanic kids who have been in this program have gone on - have not only graduated from high school with their class, but gone on to four-year colleges, typically very, very good ones.",
        "In fact, 95 percent of them go on to college compared with something like, you know, 30 to 40 percent survival rate for inner-city kids these days.",
