        "We have a major white flight, but I call it more of a middle class and middle-economic flight because we are losing just yearly, annually, about 100 to 150 students moving to the suburban areas that are predominantly white.",
        "Seeing a significant decline as far as test scores are concerned, too, we have several schools who are underperforming now based on the No Child Left Behind and the Mississippi Accountability status - just a major difference in the perception - the community's perception of our school district.",
        "We are often fighting the negative perceptions compared to our local suburban district.",

        "Now, Jonathan, the issue isn't just who's in schools but how they're taught.",
        "In your new book, \"\"Letters to a Young Teacher,\"\" you actually recount a time many years ago when you were fired for reading Langston Hughes to your students.",
        "Why don't you tell us about that?",
        "Well, this was back in the 1960s, really, before the civil rights movement had set in in the North.",
        "And I was teaching fourth grade in an all-black school in Boston.",
        "It was - I brought in some Langston Hughes poetry because there was no black literature in the curriculum, and the kids loved it.",
        "And for the first time, they really seemed excited that year.",
        "But I was fired for that because it was not in the approved curriculum."

        "Now, some may argue it's not as bad as that today, but I would argue that in many ways, we swung back so that it's - in certain ways, even worse because in the all-black and all-Hispanic inner-city schools that I visit, and these schools - I mean, they're as close to perfect apartheid as they could be.",
        "Out of 4,000 high school kids, typically I might meet five white children.",
        "In these schools, there is now a new regimented curriculum with the same kind of rigid rules that we faced before, and this has been imposed by No Child Left Behind bill.",
        "Well, Annie - I want to turn to Annie and ask about No Child Left Behind.",
        "So how do you think it's - you know, Jonathan was just talking about what can be rigid curriculum rules.",
        "How do you think that plays out?",
        "I do think they're extremely rigid curriculum rules.",
        "I'm not sure if I agree that bringing in Langston Hughes or something of that nature would be forbidden as it may have been in those days.",
        "I do think the rigid rules, of course, limits the curriculum to the - the how and what you can teach simply because of the mandates of curriculum right now, but…",
        "That's what I meant.",

        "Okay.",

        "Now, Annie, you know, I want to ask you about unitary school districts.",
        "So on a practical level, the federal government sees no need to continue desegregation enforcement if there is a declaration that the district is unitary.",
        "What does that mean and how does that play out in your district?",
        "Well, of course, that unitary status means that the schools should represent the demographics of the districts.",
        "And if the schools represent the demographics of the district, then you receive that unitary status.",
        "In my case, because my district is predominantly minority anyway, the unitary status still doesn't change or happen as far as integration is concerned.",
        "We are - as you have indicated earlier, we are 92 percent African-American students at my district.",
        "And no matter how we drew the lines, I mean, every school pretty much represent that.",
        "Well, Jonathan, what do you think is practical at this point?",
        "If there is an area that is mostly black, is it practical to still try to do bussing, to still try to do, you know, programs that try to exchange students between districts?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "First of all, you know, apart from the inequalities that are historically been inevitable when we had segregated schools, the kids - the worse thing is that these kids grow up in total isolation of the - all the reference points…",

        "Again, as far as the best thing, that would not make any difference at all with us.",

        "Over the weekend, one of the biggest shareholders at Bear Stearns, UK billionaire Joseph Lewis, was quoted in a British newspaper saying, that he was ready to hold up this deal.",
        "He told the Sunday Telegraph that there are two ways to block the deal.",
        "First, by a shareholder no-vote, second, by litigation, and that he was prepared to do that.",

        "There was an awful lot of trading in Bear Stearns last week.",
        "Some of it was by bondholders, who wanted to vote in favor of the deal, but even the bondholders wouldn't mind a slightly higher price.",
        "And for the government, the ultimate threat was, they would let the company go into bankruptcy, and they would remove their support.",
        "And that would bring us back to where we were last week, with the problem of whether or not this would have any implications for other investment banks, as well.",
        "So what the Fed is hoping, and what JPMorgan is hoping now, is that this removes any doubt about the deal.",
        "And there was initial criticism, Bob, last week about the federal government's role, that is was essentially bailing out Bear Stearns, because it agreed to buy part of it, at least, the least desirable part, I guess.",
        "So, does this mean the government will now have to pay more if the share price is higher?",
        "Good question here because this is one of those, on the one hand, on the other hand, financial stories.",
        "It is JPMorgan that is raising the share offer up to 10 dollars, and there were reports that the central bankers were resisting this move.",
        "We can assume that they were against it for political appearances, that is, the more shareholders get out of this deal, the bigger the Federal bail out appears to be.",
        "On the one hand, the Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke apparently negotiated to reduce the federal government's liability down by a billion dollars.",
        "If you've been following this deal, you'll recall that when the Fed helped engineer this takeover weekend before last, it agreed to provide 30 billion dollars of what it called \"\"special financing.\"\" Well, today, the Fed adjusted that down to 29 billion, and JPMorgan is going to assume the responsibility for the first billion of any losses that might result from this.",
        "So, you can say that it is not as big a bail out, but on the other hand, the shareholders are getting more.",
        "So it wasn't a done deal before this weekend.",

        "Maybe.",
