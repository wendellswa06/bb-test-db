        "And thanks very much for coming in.",
        "Thanks, Neal.",
        "Now, you were a firefighter for 22 years.",
        "When something like this happens, you think about the culture of a firehouse.",
        "You would spend a long time in there.",
        "Tell us a little bit about it and how the people in a team can develop bonds.",
        "Well, of course, the culture is one where you're spending a great deal of your life together in a fairly intimate environment.",
        "Most firefighters today work at least 24 hours together at a time.",
        "And you're literally over the course of a year running thousands of calls, some of them, most of them we consider to be routine, but many of them have an element of danger.",
        "The only way to successfully fight a fire is to do it in a team environment.",
        "So you wind up developing very close personal bonds with people built around the fact that you find yourself in tight situations, and you depend on one another, and almost always, you prevail in the environment and you go home.",
        "And I think the result of that is that you wind up building these extraordinary work relationships and friendships that last a lifetime.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "You're still friends with some of the people you served with?",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And the way you're describing it, is combat the closest analogy?",
        "It is.",
        "I think there's no question that structural firefighting, wildland firefighting has many of the aspects of combat about it, both in terms of how you live, but the kind of work that you're doing where in the moments before you're engaging, you're under tremendous pressure to be prepared and to take action.",
        "So I think combat is an excellent parallel for what men and women firefighters do every day.",
        "Let's see if we can get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Larry, Larry with us from Charleston, South Carolina."

        "Yeah.",

        "So this could have really been an apocalyptic incident.",
        "So whatever they did, they really did a great job, a commendable job in containing this.",

        "It could have spread to the gas station.",
        "It really could have been a million times worse than the tragedy it already is.",
        "And I also want to say real quickly that, you know, the loss of one or, you know, two people in a tragedy like this would just be horrible.",
        "It is just mind blowing - mind boggling to the people here that we've lost nine.",
        "It is just unbelievable.",

        "That's how well they did at containing it as far as my perception of it was, was that, oh, okay, you know, the Sofa Super Store burned down, you know, a warehouse kind of building.",

        "Certainly.",
        "Bye-bye.",

        "You don't look at the building and, say, it's a warehouse.",
        "Just let it burn.",
        "Well, no. We're trained obviously to save savable lives and at every incident that we respond to, there is going to be an assumption when we arrive that there are people in the building.",
        "Our job is to rule that out.",
        "Typically, that's done by a fast, aggressive search.",
        "And it's clear that yesterday, at that event, some part of that - the initial phase of the incident - was about rescuing people that were in the building.",
        "We've heard of at least two people who were rescued from the building.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And then hopefully at some point when it's appropriate, we turn to what we call an interior attack.",
        "And that's where our firefighters are in the building, hopefully in a safe environment, trying to extinguish the fire as rapidly and effectively as they can."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And that's why for a fire of that magnitude, I think we can be fairly certain that there were multiple alarms.",
        "There were dozens of firefighters there not only to control the fire in the building, but also to be able to take care of what we refer to as exposures.",
        "And those would be either the buildings immediately adjacent or, as the gentleman said, woodland that was around the building.",
        "And hard enough to imagine the effect on a department of, what, 250 or so people, the firehouse, the individual unit involved, that's going be - how could that - how would you deal with that?",

        "Hi.",
        "My comment is from my own experience, most people is that they take - not only firefighters, but all first responders - way too much for granted.",
        "They just expect that they're going to be there and that they just don't really think about what goes in to the preparation.",
        "And in fact, these people are putting their lives on the line day in day out for very little compensation, and that - and often very little thanks except when they're absolutely needed.",
