        "Professor, welcome to the program.",
        "Can you tell us just how dependent we are here in America on nuclear energy?",
        "Well, 20 percent of our electricity is generated by nuclear power plants.",
        "We have 104 nuclear power plants and they're all very similar in design to the one that are in trouble in Japan, 40 percent are boiling water reactors of that type or similar in design to that.",
        "And the others are pressurized water reactors.",
        "But they all are very similar in the way they produce electricity.",
        "Are they similar also in terms of their safety structure, in case something catastrophic should happen?",
        "Yes, there are some differences in the containment designs for pressurized water reactors versus boiling water reactors, but they provide a comparable level of safety.",
        "People in this country are probably very concerned right now about earthquake safety.",
        "And I'm wondering what plants in this country might be most vulnerable to an earthquake.",
        "Should we presume that we're talking about the ones in California?",
        "Well, the ones in California are certainly more likely to have an earthquake and a larger earthquake than we would have throughout the country.",
        "But every nuclear power plant in the United States is protected against a certain level of earthquake that's appropriate to the region in which they are built.",
        "So although the ones in California would have larger earthquakes, they're designed basis is more robust, so that you would not expect to have a higher likelihood of a core meltdown accident, as a result of an earthquake that exceeded the design basis for California.",
        "Now, you said something interesting there, though.",
        "They are designed appropriate to the region where they're built.",
        "The Fukushima plant was reportedly built to withstand a quake of 7.9 magnitude.",
        "The quake in Japan was much large larger than that; more than 10 times the strength.",
        "So what does that say about the standard in the States and whether that standard is appropriate?",
        "Well, I think that - of course, this is obviously was an exceptional earthquake that occurred in Japan.",
        "Could there be an exceptional earthquake at some low probability in the United States, relative to what the design basis is?",
        "I think that it certainly is possible that that's true."

        "But I think you also have to look and see that - it certainly appears that despite the very large earthquake there, and relative to its design basis, as far as the shaking element of is concerned, it certainly appears that the plants had enough margin beyond what we call a Safe Shutdown Earthquake, that they really accommodated that.",
        "And the thing that got them was the size of the tsunami.",
        "And so I would think that if anybody is going to be looking at anything closely, as a result of this, it will be the question of for those plants that are on oceans: Has there been adequate design margin been provided for tsunamis?",
        "That seems to be at this point, seems to be the big question of...",
        "And one other big question and we can try to get to it quickly before I let you go.",
        "The nuclear industry always takes lessons from big disasters.",
        "Are there lessons that are already being taken and perhaps applied here in the States from what's going on now in Japan?",
        "Well, it's a little early to say.",
        "For sure there are - I happen to be at a conference right now, we're on risk assessment.",
        "And, of course, the key issue right now is seismic.",
        "It was really planned that it would be a key issue would be seismic.",
        "But everybody here is now trying to look and see are there lessons learned from this that we would go back and apply to either the plants that we have now or future plans.",

        "Thank you.",

        "We've had several polls on the Web site, and it's very difficult to find any African-Americans that support this war in any way.",
        "That's having a tremendous influence on the number of young African-Americans looking at the military as a career.",
        "I think one of the things that's important, and I think one of the things that's well understood, is that African-Americans and whites generally join the military for different reasons.",
        "Of course, African-Americans have always looked at the military as a source of opportunity, economic growth and personal growth.",
        "And the military has always been there for that in cases where young people weren't in position to go to college.",
        "But because of the war and the images that they see of the war, they're just choosing to bow out of it and say that it's not worth the risk serving in the military and getting a military career.",
        "Guy, let's take a little flashback to the 1970s.",
        "And there was an advertisement that the Navy put out towards the end of the Vietnam War and they enlisted the help of a celebrity that everybody knew."

        "Lou Rawls himself was actually an Army paratrooper.",
        "He was in the 82nd Airborne.",
        "And after the Vietnam War, when the military, all the armed services, went to all-volunteer force, you know, they had to come up with ways to attract people to the military.",

        "These kinds of campaigns were widespread and successful to the point where today about a quarter of all the services are made up of African-Americans.",
        "This is the backbone of the U.S.",

        "But if you don't have the resources, if you don't have the wherewithal, then a second tremendous option for them would be to look at the military, because they could get an education through the military.",
        "They get job training and then they get an opportunity to mature and grow with the military's training program.",
        "And Gregory, as well, I'm not sure when exactly you enlisted, but how do you see enthusiasm for viewing military life as a career changing?"

        "I would say that overall the feeling for the military among the African-American population has definitely changed since the start of the Iraq war.",
        "It's basically because African-Americans generally don't have a lot of trust in the government, particularly when it comes to foreign policy and things like that as a result of Vietnam and some of the other things that we have experienced.",
        "The choice of the military as a career for African-Americans is something that's beginning to diminish.",
        "And I think that overall, if things clear up and the war is over, then I think things will generally go back to normal and African-Americans will once again be looking at the military as the source of opportunity.",

        "Can I just pipe in for a moment?",
        "One of the points that Gregory makes is about the future and about this downward trend, and we're talking about a quarter of the services today made up of African-Americans.",
        "What will happen in 10, 15 years when that number declines to 10 or 11 percent.",
        "One of the interesting things points the Pentagon makes is that for most of the period after the Vietnam War, African-Americans were overrepresented in the military, 25 percent, compared to the overall population.",
        "And so what they will say today, it's true - somewhat disingenuous - but it's true.",
        "They'll say, well, the numbers are going down to 10, 11 percent of new enlistees are African-Americans.",
        "That's actually a closer reflection of the total African-American population in the United States.",
        "So Guy first and then Gregory.",
        "Tell me how this is important for America, not just for the military, given that the military affects neighborhoods, communities, economies and everything.",

        "What I can say - and I don't think that this is a particularly controversial thing to say - is that the war has had an immeasurably immense impact on all of these services.",
        "Even enlisted folks will tell you that.",
        "Because the war has created now a process whereby the same people are going back and back and back, deployment after deployment after deployment, fighting on the behalf of the broader American public.",
        "Most Americans have a very, very small stake in the war and the outcome of the war, and the country has essentially hired professional soldiers to fight wars for them.",
        "As long as the war continues to decline in popularity, there is no question it's going to have an impact on the numbers and the types of people who are attracted to the armed forces.",
