        "It's an unfortunate family story.",
        "The mother eventually died from the cancer.",
        "But an extremely rare occurrence, the first reported case of a mother passing cancer to her baby, was way back in 1866.",
        "And since then there have been fewer than two dozen suspected cases, all based on circumstantial evidence.",
        "And now for the first time we have genetic proof that such a thing is possible, but probably not something any mothers out there who are pregnant should be worrying about.",

        "Well, this case was started when an 11-month-old girl was admitted to a clinic in Japan with a large tumor on her cheek.",
        "And initially the clinicians there thought that this was going to be a solid sarcoma that often occurs in young children.",
        "And it turned out that when she was being biopsied, the father said that just a few months earlier his wife had died from leukemia.",
        "And initially the guys in Japan thought that this would be just maybe a cancer-prone family, which does happen from time to time.",
        "But after they had done a biopsy on the cheek, they realized that it wasn't a solid sarcoma, it was, in fact, a lymphoma.",
        "And then the guys, of course, thought that this could well be a secondary sort of tumor that may have arisen from the mother's cancer, which was very similar.",
        "Right."
