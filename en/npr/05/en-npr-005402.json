        "And in our lab in London we have a, sort of a longstanding reputation for looking at the in utero origins of leukemia.",
        "And so they approached us to try and sort of tie up the loose ends and then see whether this was the passage of a leukemia clone from the mother to the baby through the placenta.",
        "And that's where we came in into the story.",
        "And you confirmed that?",
        "Yes.",
        "You know, in our work we've been able to show that the initiating event in these leukemias is a chromosome translocation where two chromosomes break apart and then fuse together.",
        "So in this case it was chromosome nine that was broken and fused to chromosome 22 in the mother.",
        "So that gives us a good marker for following these events.",
        "And we've been able to show in previous work that each patient, each patient with leukemia, has a patient-specific break in fusion, so we can always tell whether it's a sort of a single clone or not.",
        "And by a first analysis, we could show that the cancer cell in the mom's leukemia was identical…",
        "Right.",
        "…at least at the initial stages to that that we found in the child.",
        "Now, everybody, every mother, pregnant woman is going to worry about this.",
        "Exactly, yeah.",
        "That's been something we've thought of at the time, that this may be some sort of common transition.",
        "As you said in your introduction, it's very rare.",
        "We've only had a few, 10, 20, or 30 cases in over a hundred years.",
        "And that was our first thought, that this might well tell us that these events could be more common.",
        "But the story that we've been able to confirm from this baby was that there was an extra step that meant this is exactly a rare occurrence.",
        "And the way that was done was that a lot of these leukemias have a chromosome translocation as a starting event, if you like.",
        "But that's not enough to give you leukemia.",
        "And there are often or usually secondary losses of gene or DNA material.",
        "And in this case, the reason of DNA that was lost in the mother's cancer cells was the (unintelligible) compatibility locus.",
        "OK.",

        "Critics say that Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin has been ineffectual and Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy provocative, which is important because those two are early favorites to replace Chirac in the next French presidential election in 2007."

        "And why?",
        "Well, the police throughout this have been a target for the gangs of young men who last night in Toulouse, for instance, the problems didn't start until the first group of police came into one neighborhood.",
        "The young men who are perpetrating some of the violence are, in fact, trying to taunt the police and the other problem is many of these cities just simply don't have enough police forces to enforce a significant curfew.",
        "Let me ask, first, about the state of emergency that's been declared.",
        "As you said, curfews have been set in place in several cities and towns.",

        "Hundreds of Tibetan exiles have gathered in Dharamsala, India, for meetings called by the Dalai Lama to discuss a new China strategy.",

        "Good morning, Renee.",
        "Now, how big of a blow is this that the Dalai Lama says his longtime approach, autonomy rather than independence, is not working?",
        "Well, it's a very significant moment in modern Tibetan history, really, for the leader to say this after 30 years of having given up independence and tried really hard to talk to the Chinese to get this autonomy deal.",
        "But he doesn't, interestingly, lose status because he has this peculiarly strong position as a charismatic leader where his ability to acknowledge a failure somehow adds to his stature - makes him seem, you know, open, more democratic, more flexible than the Chinese and than most political leaders we have.",
        "So he's still gaining as an individual leader, but he is taking the Tibetans into having to face a crisis in terms of their path and their policy.",
        "Well, this path, which is known as the middle way, if his approach isn't working, what are the options that Tibetan exiles are discussing this week?",
        "Well, the way it's been presented by the most politically active exiles and by the press is as a choice between continuing the Dalai Lama's middle way - that's asking just for an increase in the level of autonomy within China - or the other extreme, going for independence, which Tibetans say they enjoyed before the Chinese moved in 1950.",
        "But actually there's some really quite interesting ideas beginning to percolate.",
        "Some people are talking about serious attempts at civil disobedience, really non-violent, non-cooperation inside Tibet.",
        "They haven't been very good at that, the Tibetans, so far.",
        "It would take a lot of discipline to do that.",
        "And it might be impossible in a Chinese regime.",
        "But there's an interesting move to talk about going around the Chinese government and appealing to the Chinese people, presumably through PR and perhaps through Buddhist teachings, to see whether Chinese people themselves wouldn't be able to take a position on Tibet and push their government themselves.",
        "And that has a real possibility because more and more Chinese in the last 10 years have become very interested in the Dalai Lama.",
        "Although, from the evidence of the protests last spring, the evidence of what seemed to be the Chinese people on the Web and in different forms were saying, they did not seem to have a great deal of sympathy for the Tibetan cause.",
        "And rather the opposite, that they seemed to see that cause as making China look bad in the world and a misunderstanding of Chinese history.",
        "Well, yes, that's true.",
        "But there's probably a very substantial number of people who are not part of the new nationalism, in fact maybe even find it slightly distasteful, rather aggressive.",
        "And we don't hear from those people.",
