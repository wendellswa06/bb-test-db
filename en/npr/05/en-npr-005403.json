        "So the baby didn't recognize it as being foreign?",
        "But the - exactly, as you say.",
        "The baby didn't recognize it as being foreign and it was able to get up into the cheek where the lymph nodes are and sit there and just gradually reproduce and build up into a lymphoma.",

        "Absolutely not.",
        "I think, you know, maybe cells do get across to the center every now and again, but in 99.9 percent of cases, the baby's immune system can deal with them, whether they're normal cells or whether they're cancer cells.",
