        "We leave Europe now and return to the United States to look at Muslims in America and how their conditions here differ from those of Muslims in Western Europe.",
        "Dawud Walid is executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations for the state of Michigan.",
        "He's also assistant imam at the Masjid Wali Muhammad in Detroit and he joins us by phone from Detroit.",
        "Good to have you on the program today.",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, the situation is a little more complex than that.",
        "I mean, it's true that the French tradition is ignorance of cultural differences in public space.",
        "But to--this immigration is not the same as any kind we got in the 19th century or early 20th century.",
        "We are talking about post-Colonial immigration.",
        "This immigration--the fathers or grandfathers of these young people today have always been treated differently because they come from--they came from the former Colonial space.",
        "And, you know, there's always been in the public discourse a sort of discrimination and particular qualification for them.",
        "You know, in France when you are second- or third-generation, nobody reminds you your origin theocratically and historically.",
        "This has not been the case for this particular group and there is a reason here.",
        "To say it differently, there is a shared conflictual memory on both sides, on the side of the family of immigrants and their children and on the side of the dominant French society.",
        "And, of course, there has been discrimination and discrimination in housing, in employment, in education and so on.",
        "But this is--this kind of particular qualification, always negative, always despising or condescendant, has been very deeply harmful on this group, the young people now, that say `That's enough.",
        "We are'--what they are saying because they don't have words anymore is their rage to still be out there.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And these are external situation, it's plain.",
        "This is a symbolic alienation, and the French government over the last five years has tried to counter discrimination, racial discrimination, in housing, employment, public administration--didn't go very far, because, you know, we are--hear about the cumulative memory starting, let's say, with the end of the colonization until now.",
        "Here's an e-mail we got from Scott Jackson in Fairfax, Virginia.",
        "`I lived in France in the summer of 2003,' he writes, `in Marseilles and was surprised that even not-so-young Muslim men in Marseilles felt that though they had exceptional academic qualifications, they were in a way confined to the city.",
        "They were not welcome outside of Marseilles; were not free to work elsewhere.",
        "And in that light, I wanted to ask you, Jocelyne Cesari, that if this rioting is not about religion, is the discrimination, is that about religion?",
        "Is that about race?",
        "No.",
        "The discrimin--I mean, once again, for French and--religion, race and culture and ethnicity are all together because they are all concentrated, crystallized in this particular group.",
        "The French don't make the difference that most Americans do between race, ethnicity and religion.",
        "And when it comes to Islam, because we are here facing immigration, never forget that in Europe most migrants are Muslim, and this is the case in France; it is the case in other European countries.",
        "They are of a particular ethnicity in France.",
        "Most Muslims are north African and they are from immigration waves, and they are post-Colonial.",
        "So all this make the situation very difficult because they have this kind of continuous correlation between Islam, ethnicity, race and socioeconomic exclusion.",
        "And in my book on Europe--on Muslims in Europe, I show this clearly.",
        "And for me to see the sign that there is something wrong here and we going to--we are paying the political cost of this very dangerous discourse.",
        "Here's another e-mail.",
        "We got this from Mike Alexander in Palo Alto, California.",
        "`I can't help but compare current events in France to the Watts riots of the 1960s.",
        "As was true in Watts,' he writes, the French unrest seems to be driven by the frustrations of a marginalized and impoverished minority railing against symbols of the master.",
        "However, restraint on the part of French authorities has minimized loss of life and property.",
        "Rather than being criticized for their lack of forcefulness, I believe the gendarmes ought to be praised for their sensibility.'"

        "Yeah.",

        "It does have a part of--you can make the comparison, yes.",
        "Because in--I mean, when you have this conjunction between racial exclusion and socioeconomic exclusion, this is the kind of situation you can compare with France.",
        "The particular addition to that is that, for Muslims and for this particular young population, and for non-Muslims as well, politicians, particularly the Islamic dimension is also present in the way--not now, not in the riots right now, but in the way that this population has been depicted and described.",
        "And just to give you an example of that, you know, why the law prohibiting religious signs has been voted in France after this huge debate is because some people coming from the outskirts of Paris have made it clear that women with a scarf were oppressed by this particular male population and so on in the banlieue in the outskirts of Paris.",
        "So the discourse of the banlieue and socioeconomic exclusion came as a justification in some ways of the law, you know, concerning secularization and seculary--so there is something...",
        "This is the law that covered head scarves in--girls wearing head scarves in schools.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Not only a scarf but all kinds of religious signs now are prohibited in French public schools.",
        "So this is something that came as an argument, so once again it is this kind of mixing different levels of reasons and justification.",
        "And I think that this--and it's not the coincidence in my mind that young male are now revolting.",
        "You know, there's also a huge discourse on what these people are doing and how they treat the women and the young women in the banlieue, and so no male really--there's no particular voices for male in this area, you know, talking and expressing themselves.",
        "So we are--hear about mythical voices talking about the banlieue, the outskirts of Paris, and not automatically making room for their voices, multiple, diverse and so on.",
        "Yes, demographically, in comparison to France, the mixture, also the level of education and the accessibilities, the opportunities in general differ greatly here from France.",
        "But before I go into that, I would like to make the statement that it is our view and the view of many Muslim American leaders that the point that the rioters--the majority of the youth happen to be Muslim is not a direct consequence of their religion or even the riots themselves aren't being done in the name of religion.",
        "As we heard from the people who we've been talking to from France."

        "Yes, as we've heard before.",
        "But one thing is that the immigrants that have come to America from South Asia, the Arab world, also Subsaharan Africa and Iran and Southeast Asia--their annual income in comparison to the American society in general is higher, and it's said that 50 percent of Muslims--their household income is more than $50,000 per year, and this is one thing which is a stark contrast to France, which in France, the average income for a Muslim household is lower than the national average of France.",
        "Also, here in the United States of America, which is a very big difference, I would say, from America than France or for western Europe, for that matter, is that within the United States of America's Muslim population, we have an extremely large indigenous population of Muslims which France and western Europe don't have.",
        "And particularly the African-American population, which are Muslims, their families have been here since the construction of this society.",
        "African Muslims came to America before Columbus even landed here and, for that matter, the majority of countries which the slaves were brought from from West Africa were actually lands of Muslim populations.",
        "So there have been African-Americans here for a very long time and many of their ancestors were Muslims, so this is something that is very different than in France.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And you're talking about different conditions.",
        "Yet, certainly there can be situations of anger that develop in a lot of minority communities in this country as well, including the Muslim community.",
        "Yes, but as far as the minority situation here in the United States of America and Muslims, there haven't been an outright isolation that we see in France.",
        "But for that matter, I would say that--and I was listening to your last speaker--the majority of immigrants that are in France do come from colonialized lands where the French had colonialized the area that just happen to be Muslim, but as we have seen in the media--and I saw on BBC myself last night, they were speaking to a young man named Peter, I believe, with some Senegalese background, and there are Muslims who are--excuse me, there are also people who are involved in the social unrest who are non-Muslims, but their isolation and their being placed into these ghettos have more so to do of where they come from, their national origin or the national origin of their parents, and that although they may be considered by law French citizens, they have been excluded because of their national origin or skin color.",
        "I did want to ask you--we just a minute or so left with you, but what's been the reaction in the Islamic community in Detroit there to the situation in France?",
        "It's been twofold.",
        "First of all, looking at the American media, we are somewhat disappointed that so much emphasis is being placed on the rioters as being Muslim when, in fact, they're not saying this in the name of Islam and, of course, Islam does not condone riotous behavior or any type of anarchy or lawlessness.",
        "And secondly, we are also somewhat apprehensive.",
        "Directly after the London bombings of July the 7th, there was somewhat of a backlash over the next with--like two months after the bombings, and there were a number of houses of worship which were vandalized and desecrated, and our concern is is that there's--through the connection between the rioters and some of the rioters or a percentage of the rioters being of Muslim background, that there may be some possible backlash by some extremists or some fringe groups of individuals against our houses of worship or Muslims in general.",
        "Dawud Walid, thank you very much for speaking with us today.",
        "Thank you.",
