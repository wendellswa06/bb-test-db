        "Beth Fertig of member station WNYC reports.",
        "The margin was razor thin.",
        "The contract was rejected by just seven votes out of a total of more than 22,000 cast.",
        "The close vote reflected deep divisions within the transit union over the proposed agreement.",
        "The contract included a wage increase of almost 11 percent over three years, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed to pull its controversial plan requiring new employees to pay more for their pensions, but in exchange, the union agreed to pay more for healthcare much to the chagrin of its members.",
        "Yesterday, Roger Toussaint, president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, accused his opponents of waging a campaign of interference.",
        "A number of them were engaged in intense campaigning, putting out purposeful disinformation and downright lies.",
        "But Toussaint's opponents accused him of trying to stifle dissent.",
        "Union vice president Ainsley Stewart, said members were right to reject a contract that would have had them pay 1.5 percent of their salaries for healthcare.",
        "Like most government workers, they're currently paying nothing.",
        "If they had gotten away with us having to pay for our healthcare premium, certainly that would have been a gun being pointed at the rest of the municipal labor force in New York City.",
        "Toussaint said he and his officers would discuss the vote and reach out to the MTA in the near future.",
        "The two sides could resume talking, they could bring in state mediators again as they did last month, or they could go to binding arbitration.",
        "Governor George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged both sides to go back to the bargaining table, but it's not clear how much strength Toussaint will have.",
        "His notoriously militant union is deeply divided, and his members are already facing fines from last month's illegal strike.",
        "That's why it's hard to predict if they'll get a better deal says Joshua Freeman, a labor history professor at City University of New York's graduate center.",
        "Sure, it's possible that through negotiations there will be relatively minor modifications in the pact, and it could be sent up for ratification again, and conceivably the outcome could be different, particularly if it was so much sweetened from the current version.",
        "But, you know, it's very unpredictable now what's gonna happen at the bargaining table.",
        "The last time the transit union rejected a contract was in 1992, and a deal was eventually reached a couple of months later.",
        "But there was no strike that year, and the atmosphere now is clearly more politicized.",
        "Governor Pataki, who controls the MTA, was highly critical of a side agreement to the proposed contract that would have given thousands of members a refund on their pension payments so previous concessions could be taken off the table.",
        "Meanwhile, the union is still facing up to three million dollars in fines for its first strike in 25 years, and Toussaint could be sent to jail.",
        "A court appearance scheduled for yesterday was put off pending the outcome of the contract vote.",
        "For NPR News, I'm Beth Fertig in New York."

        "Iran is not on the ballot for an election that American Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad says will shape the future of the world.",

        "Iran hasn't waited for the election that could result in a Shiite-dominated government side by side with a Shiite Iran.",
        "The former foes have quietly signed a military cooperation agreement that includes Iranian help in training Iraq's security forces.",

        "Iraq's deputy prime minister, Ahmed Chalabi, has visited Tehran and says that it played a positive role in the formation of the Iraqi interim government.",
        "That presumably means that the Tehran regime encouraged fellow Shiites in Iraq to cooperate with the election process.",
        "And the United States, perhaps fearing to be left at the starting gate in the creation of a new order in the Gulf, has made its own approach to Tehran.",
        "According to Newsweek, Ambassador Khalilzad says he received explicit permission from President Bush to open a dialogue with Iran, and he recently engaged Iranian diplomats on a visit to Afghanistan.",
        "This is quite remarkable considering that the United States has no official relations with Iran, which faces possible sanctions for refusing to give up its nuclear program.",
        "And the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has shocked the international community by proposing that Israel be wiped off the map and calling the Holocaust a myth.",
        "It appears that whatever the outcome of tomorrow's election, Iran will be a part of the process of creating a regional new order.",
