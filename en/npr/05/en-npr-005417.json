        "What does he have, though, in common with other mass murderers: the shooting rampage of Charles Whitman in Texas in 1966 or Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing or Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, the Columbine shooters that the Virginia Tech shooter mentioned by name.",
        "What, if anything, can we learn from these killings from those killers that might help prevent this type of thing from happening again?",
        "Is it even possible to prevent these sorts of things from happening?",

        "The paper was a series of four papers that we did looking at both adult and adolescent mass murderers over the past 50 years.",
        "And there are a number of striking characteristics that have been identified in Mr. Cho that appeared in our paper.",
        "Two that I want to highlight is, one, that we know that virtually all mass murders are planned, purposeful, they're carried out in an organized way over a period of time, and secondly, that the majority of adult mass murderers typically are individuals who have a psychiatric history and typically a majority are psychotic at the time that they're actually carrying out the killing.",

        "But our survey shows that at least 10,000 inmates last year came straight out of solitary.",

        "A few states in the federal prison system have started doing that.",
        "But inmates in solitary are considered the most dangerous and violent of prisoners.",
        "They're more likely to serve all or most of their sentence.",
        "And that means when they leave prison, they're not on parole, so they don't get the help with reentry.",
