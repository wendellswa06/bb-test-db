        "Joan Alker is a senior researcher with the Georgetown Center for Children and Families.",
        "One of the ways to think about these new proposals is that the Medicaid beneficiary, instead of being guaranteed a certain set of medically necessary health-care services, are now just entitled to a certain amount of money, regardless of what that money will buy.",
        "That could be particularly problematic under Florida's scheme, she says, where patients could see benefits reduced dramatically.",
        "Because when you have an HMO that's in it to make a profit, and the state is in it because they want to control their costs, something's going to get squeezed.",

        "South Carolina's plan would give each individual an amount equal to the average spent by those in similar groups, like all children.",
        "But Solomon says because most people use very little health care, 85 percent of patients would actually get more than they need, which she calls a questionable use of scarce resources.",
