        "Incidentally, I agree with everything that Dr. Meloy has said.",
        "But I think in the case of Harris and Klebold, we had a rare deadly duo.",
        "I don't believe that either one of them would have had the will and the capacity to do what they did alone.",
        "And it appears to me that Harris was moving along the career of a psychopath.",
        "This is an area that Dr. Meloy has great expertise in.",
        "And he may want to say more about that.",
        "A psychopath is not the same thing as a psychotic.",
        "A psychopath lacks a conscience and it doesn't have the capacity to feel guilt or remorse or to truly identify with a role model.",
        "And when you have a mind that doesn't have a conscience, it goes in a certain direction, not necessarily sadistic.",
        "But again - and it appears to me that Dylan Klebold had a very different personality, persona, set of issues, probably more depressed and angry, probably not psychotic.",
        "All right - Dr. Ochberg, hold on to that thought because we have to take a break.",
        "We'll come back and talk about it some more.",

        "We're talking this hour about the shootings at Virginia Tech, and are there any similarities to other mass murderers, to other shootings around the country?",
        "Our number is 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Talking with J.",
        "Reid Meloy, forensic psychologist and clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of California San Diego, Frank Ochberg, clinical professor of psychiatry at Michigan State University in East Lansing, when I rudely interrupted Dr. Ochberg, who was trying to make a point.",
        "Do you want to try that again?",
        "Well, we don't know enough about Mr. Cho to say what his diagnosis and mental state is.",
        "But by now it looks as though Harris and Klebold together had what it took to do what they did."

        "But individually didn't.",
        "And one was a cold, calculating, glib psychopath to be, and the other was hot-headed, hot-tempered, and not psychotic, and probably not psychopathic.",
        "Purely statistically speaking, Drs.",
        "Meloy and Ochberg, is there any way we could say these things will never happen?",

        "And you never want to come up with new and potentially difficult -even dangerous - ideas in the shadow of a provocative rare event.",
        "But there certainly are people who present a lot of concern to those around them and to experts who have a chance to evaluate them.",
        "And yet they don't pass the threshold for civilly denying them their liberty.",
        "They come before probate judges.",
        "There is an evaluation and sometimes a battle of experts.",
        "But ultimately they get their freedom.",
        "What we don't have is a way of compelling these people to check in with somebody who is part therapist, part probation officer, part protective service worker, and also to allow some exchange of information about these people."

        "If we could narrow the scope so that it wasn't applied broadly but it was applied where we have the kind of concerns that arise with these cases, perhaps we could prevent something.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I would agree with Frank.",
        "One of the things that I think is very important to recognize is that sometimes focusing on threat assessment and threat management rather than attempting to predict is a much more realistic approach in these cases.",
        "And I think from a social policy perspective, two things are important to consider here.",
        "One is that high quality mental health care and services be available quickly and efficiently to anybody that wants them, whether they're in high school or whether they're on campuses throughout the country.",
        "And that secondly, that schools and colleges consider having a threat assessment team that's there on campus.",
        "Typically it's multi-disciplinary.",
        "It's composed of educators from the campus, a mental health professional, law enforcement - local law enforcement.",
        "And this group of people know who they are as a member of the team.",
        "And they can actually consult with each other via telephone on a moment's notice.",
        "They perhaps have regular meetings.",
        "And through this process, the kind of individuals that Frank has referred to begin to, in a sense, come on the radar as individuals of serious concern on the campus.",
        "And then mechanisms can be set up without interfering with their civil liberties to pursue a route of provision of mental health care perhaps as an involuntary outpatient.",
        "There's actually an excellent program in California called a conditional lease program - which is a judicial commitment program for insanity acquittees that's I think a very good model for this.",
        "But that you use these kind of mechanisms that don't institutionalize people but in a sense provide some level of monitoring and coercion, particularly if it's - if you're facing somebody who is increasingly paranoid, because paranoid individuals - just by definition - are going to be very suspect of anybody offering any kind of care.",
        "And yet Cho was able to go out, legally purchase a handgun with a background check, and none of this background was influential in denying him buying a gun.",
        "Ira, I've gotten 40 calls from around the world about this in the last 36 hours, and the ones from overseas make that point over and over.",
        "How can this happen?",
        "It doesn't happen in our country.",
        "I don't want to use this as a platform for talking about gun control, but it is clear that this kind of personality should not have access to a lethal weapon."

        "How we prevent this in a practical way in America is a big problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I again would just want to echo that, that I am a firm believer in the right of individuals to bear arms in this country, but secondly, I'm also a firm believer that individuals that do bear arms have the skill and the competence in their use, that they're licensed to be able to do that and that also they have the stability to do that.",
        "Now, I'm not sure how that actually translates into public policy, but you know, the parallel that's been raised a number of times just in the past few days is the whole notion that we don't give out drivers licenses just by, you know, signing a form and then being handed a license because we recognize the lethality risk of driving a car, and I think that needs to be recognized too with any kind of possession of a firearm.",
        "Ira, could I come back an endorse Reid's notion of having the interdisciplinary team on every college campus, every high school.",
        "That would be a boon, but I was consulted by one of these interdisciplinary teams a few years back about somebody who resembled Mr. Cho, and there really was very little we could do.",
        "We don't have mechanisms in place in most parts of America to allow the kind of continual contact that we need to provide a person like this, regardless of whether they want it or not.",
        "And you both point out that our mental health system is so weak that just from the get-go we're at a disadvantage.",
        "Yeah, the system is such that - you know, the whole direction of the system, and I've been watching this since the, since the late 1960s, has been in briefer care and short-term care and shifting people from an institutional setting back out into the community.",
        "It is.",
        "It's very nice to do that.",
        "You can definitely get some stress out of your system.",

        "The reality is that the outpatient services have not kept up with the deinstitutionalization.",
        "So now we have the mentally ill either in custody around the country or walking the streets.",
        "In a sense, one has a right to be psychotic and free in this country, unless one poses and imminent threat to another, and that has also contributed to this notion of very, very brief care, where persons are then committed but then released very quickly back into the community."

        "We didn't have the political support for the funding for the program as planned.",
        "The community mental health services model, if all the elements are there, can work, but nowhere is it working the way it was intended.",

        "I mean he basically did the same thing, did he not?",
        "Very different, very, very different.",
        "Because what we know about suicide bombers is normalcy in the functions of their mind, extreme belief, and a participation in family life.",
        "They are not deluded.",
        "We may not agree at all with their martyrdom, but these are not people who have schizophrenia or (unintelligible).",
        "Yeah, another important difference is that typically in that kind of political social context of suicide bombing, you have some kind of command and control mechanism.",
        "The person is being directed to go do this, to go blow himself up, whereas in this particular case, as in other mass murder cases we've seen in the U.S., we have an individual who has become increasingly isolated, increasingly resentful and alienated from other people, and then in the course of that has also deteriorated mentally and oftentimes has become quite paranoid.",
        "With the adult mass murderers, virtually all the cases, these individuals act by themselves; they're not directed by anybody to do this.",
        "And even with the adolescents, about three-quarters of the adolescent mass murderers act alone.",
        "But to sort of bounce off a point that Frank made earlier, about 25 percent, and this would include the Columbine killers, about 25 percent of adolescent mass murders do act as a pair when they commit their offenses, and that's something that emerged from our research.",
        "Let me ask you this question.",
        "We're watching the terrible healing process that's trying to take place at Virginia Tech.",
        "We're seeing the effects on families and getting some idea of what it's like when you have a massacre like this, and it makes one feel about what people in Baghdad must be going through every day.",
        "This happens every day on a larger scale.",
        "They must be going through some sort of hell there.",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "I mean, the traumatic effect of this on a population is just enormous, and also I - you know, I want to note that yesterday was the anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing case too, which was a different scenario but also had an enormous impact on all of us in the U.S., particularly the citizens of Oklahoma."
