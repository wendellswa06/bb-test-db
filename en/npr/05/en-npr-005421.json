        "Ira, while we can assume and believe that the impact in Baghdad is similar to the ones here, I don't think that the American empathy is the same.",
        "Right.",
        "I think there's something about an event that takes place with our children in our schools, and we bleed, and we rage, and we identify strongly, but when it takes place in another culture, in another climate, and there are a different set of victims, we don't have the same national identification.",
        "Correct.",

        "Reed Meloy and Frank Ochberg.",
        "I notice - I know, Dr. Ochberg, that you were the founder of the Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma, and I noticed yesterday that one of the CNN anchors broke down on the air, and he cried when he described how the cell phones of some of the dead students were ringing with, obviously, people who knew them, wanting to know their, you know, their whereabouts.",
        "This must be taking a terrible toll on some of those reporters.",
        "Absolutely, Ira, and when I see that, actually, rather than feel that this is a disgrace to the profession or there's some weakness here, I think good, this is human, and there is nothing wrong with being moved to tears.",
        "What I worry about is when some of your colleagues reach the point where they're depressed, alcoholic, where through vicarious exposure they have post-traumatic stress disorder.",
        "And let me tell you, the research shows that the war correspondents have the same rates of mental and emotional difficulty as the combat soldiers.",
        "There's also, there's another side to this, too, that I just want to point out, and that is the, you know, the saturation coverage by the media of these events, that you know, when we do this, you know, there's an emotional immediacy that's brought to each viewer and each perceiver of these events around the country.",
        "And then there's also the risk with the pain, the kind of detailed attention to this act, particularly the visual display of the photographs of Mr. Cho that he produced, perhaps as a way to make himself notorious after death, that the risk there is this may also energize other - typically young males to engage in similar acts, and that's a pattern that many of us have observed, that you'll see a clustering of these events as a young man who perhaps shares similar characteristics with Mr. Cho will not identify with the victims but will instead identify with the shooter and see the kind of notoriety that he's getting and want to be like him.",
        "Do you think then it was a mistake to show that tape?"

        "Now it seems there are going to be more robust choices.",
        "There was no signs, no nothing there that would give us an indication that somebody had built there or had done some work.",
        "I'm of two minds about it.",
        "I think that this - the saturation and repetitive nature of the display of these images I think was in error, but I think also it's important for people to see an individual in this kind of state of mind who can still carry out such an organized act of mass murder, because one of the misunderstandings - well, actually two among the public regarding cases such as this - is one, is these individuals snap.",
        "There's no such thing as snapping.",
        "That's not a diagnostic term.",
        "These acts are planned.",
        "They're purposeful.",
        "They're carried out over time.",
        "These are not impulsive acts, and we see that displayed graphically in this self-created media that this young man has done, and that we also see an individual who is carrying out these behaviors and planning and in a sense - our term is decompensating, that you see him devolve into this kind of very, very disturbed mental state, and for people to see that actually and to recognize that this can happen to people I think is important.",
        "Ira, can I make a quick comment on that?",
        "Yes, quickly, please.",
        "I don't think we should contemplate denying the public newsworthy images, newsworthy but terrible, horrible facts that have occurred before us.",
        "I mean, the newscasters are our eyes and ears, and we've got to know.",
        "But as Reid is saying, we have to warn consumers, don't overdose on this.",
        "We have to tell parents of vulnerable kids, kids who can become aggressive adolescent boys and play with these ideas, limit the exposure.",

        "I'll add this just to show you what I mean.",
        "When he was down there, 150 feet down in the earth, he saw this huge gray horse, which is pulling a sled full of coal.",
        "So he says to one the miners, he said, How on earth do you get those horses in and out of here every day?",
        "And they started laughing, and he said, Well, what's so funny?",
