        "So, the godmother of the cocaine trade - and in some ways, I feel like this woman was the most notorious drug lord that many of us, including me, knew very little about.",
        "Where did she come from?",
        "Well, she's from Colombia.",
        "She was born into and grew up in the poverty-stricken mountains of Medellin, Colombia, childhood friends, in fact, with Pablo Escobar, a relationship that would serve her well later when she got into the cocaine trade, first in Colombia, then in Queens, New York and eventually in Miami, where her business really blew up.",
        "She smuggled in at least six kilos of cocaine on the tall ship Gloria, which the Colombian government had sent to Miami eventually to participate in a race to New York Harbor to celebrate America's Bicentennial.",
        "Wait a minute: Colombia was sending a boat to help celebrate the American Bicentennial, and this woman was able to get six kilos of cocaine onboard?",
        "At least six kilos, because the boat was stopping in Miami first, en route to this boat race.",
        "Unbelievable.",
        "And how did Griselda Blanco, this woman, become such a force?",
        "I'd say she was ambitious.",
        "And I'd say to be a woman in that era in the cocaine trade, the definition of the word ambitious would include a level of brutality that would have to far surpass even the men who are involved in the trade."
