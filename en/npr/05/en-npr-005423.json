        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, I feel that it's been irrelevant for at least 11,000.",
        "The reason I pick 11,000, I'll tell you: I'm arguing that as soon as the human beast acquired speech, it was like a nuclear weapon.",
        "It utterly changed life on earth.",
        "It was speech and only speech that enables human beings to reason, that enables them to have memory of any complexity at all.",

        "Now you take your seeds and you've got to put them in the ground where I tell you, put them in a straight line and if you don't do that, you're not going to have any ears of corn this summer.",
        "Well, you just can't farm without being able to tell somebody what to do.",
        "It's a prime example of why I feel that humans should not be called Homo Sapiens, which means, man reasoning or rational man, but Homo Loquax, man talking.",
        "In fact, Loquax can also mean talkative or garrulous.",
        "They all apply.",

        "You also conjecture the idea that religion can trace itself back to the power of speech.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I am saying that as soon as humans acquired speech, one of the first questions, undoubtedly, was why.",
        "Meaning why am I here?",
        "How did I get here?",
        "And what is this agonizing struggle called life all about?",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And for so long in human history it has been explained by religion, by a belief in God.",
        "By a belief that He sets -- this Almighty Force sets the standards.",
        "But the human beast doesn't even require hope.",
        "He needs to be convinced.",
        "And that's why Charles Darwin is one of the greatest figures in human history.",
        "It's got nothing to do with his theory.",
        "It's due to the fact that the theory changed history.",
        "It is the single, the one thing that more than anything else put an end to religion among most educated people in Europe and the United States.",
        "Darwinism offers no hope at all.",
        "Christianity, for example -- well, Jesus offered a lot of hope.",
        "The meek shall inherit the Earth.",
        "The last shall be first.",
        "It's a great, great message.",
        "John Calvin, the leading Protestant offered a little less hope.",
        "Mohammed offered more and less hope.",
        "Marx offered enormous hope, much influenced by Jesus, though I don't think he ever realized it, because he said the meek shall inherit the earth now."
