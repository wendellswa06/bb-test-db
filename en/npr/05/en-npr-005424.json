        "What's going on there?",
        "That is something Brazilians call gentileza, or gentility.",
        "To get anything done in the city, you have to have relationships with people, and so you quickly refer to people extra-affectionately soon after you meet them.",

        "You say beijos - kisses, maybe throw in a via com Deus - go with God; or if it's more professional, you leave it at abracos - hugs.",
        "And this goes all the way up to a more casual use of first names for politicians, like Lula and Dilma for the last two presidents, who are referred to that way even in newspapers, TV, everywhere.",
        "And Catherine, is this just here in Rio, or is it all over Brazil?",
        "In Sao Paulo, it's one kiss on the cheek when you greet someone; Rio, it's two; Minas Gerais, it's three.",
        "So of course, this leads to a lot of stereotyping about how much more polite you are than people from other states.",
        "One time I was riding the bus, and an elderly woman was standing, and a young kid wouldn't give up his seat for the elderly woman.",
        "And a passenger got very angry at the bus driver and said, you think you're acting like a bus driver from Rio right now because you're acting like a bus driver from Sao Paulo."

        "(Laughter) So some regional rivalry over kindness there.",
        "I'm reminded, Catherine, of something we heard earlier on this trip from a pair of traffic clowns, and it was the phrase gentileza gera gentileza - kindness breeds kindness.",
        "But you do wonder whether this is just the language that's used and actually, actions are very different.",
        "Yeah, I mean, some of the reporting this week has been about how people do not have fair and compassionate treatment all the time by people, by organizations.",
        "And so then you have this other vocabulary of words for somebody who has taken advantage of somebody else, which isn't quite appropriate for the radio.",
        "But at the end of the day, in everyday life and especially when things are difficult, I would much rather have people refer to each other with gentility, and it's fun to hear what people come up with.",
        "If you're ever having a tough spot, you can throw in a por gentileza - for the sake of gentility.",

        "I think the other thing that would strike you would be the relative security of the streets.",
        "It's certainly not a totally safe place now, but overall, security has improved.",
        "So far I think things have gone very well.",
        "Well then, what do you say to reporting that some of the people in Marjah say when night falls, many of the streets go back to belonging to the Taliban?",

        "So many of these workers are heading back to school to retool their skill set.",

        "Tell me a little bit more about that.",
        "Yes, Michigan - the industrial states like Michigan and Ohio are being hit pretty hard, but so are the states that were subject to the housing boom, California, Florida, Arizona, Nevada, the states are in very difficult positions.",
        "People are unemployed and going back to college to pick up these skills.",
        "This is a general trend that we see in any economic downturn when the economy changes and people are laid off or underemployed and seek to gain skills.",
        "So they come back to our colleges.",
        "Now, when someone comes to you and says, you know, or comes to a community college president and says, I need training for a career of the future.",
        "I need something that's going to last, not just training that's going to be obsolete.",
        "What kinds of training would you recommend?",
        "Well, the hottest programs right now are in allied health or health care.",
        "In fact, nursing is the top choice among students today, and that's a pretty secure profession.",
        "All of the allied health careers, radiology, dental hygiene, nursing assistant, medical assistant, all of those programs are just booming at our colleges, as are the first-responder programs - law enforcement, firefighting, EMT, paramedic - those programs are exceedingly popular.",
        "Then, of course, we have the emerging science, technology, engineering and math fields and particularly in green technologies.",
        "Those are becoming very popular and, of course, the incoming federal administration is going to be placing an emphasis on those kinds of programs.",
        "When you think about the fact that so many people are going to have to make financial decisions about whether to work at a job that may pay less than what they've been making before versus whether or not to go to school and incur the cost of going to school or try to do the work to find money.",
        "Would you make a case that going to school is a good option, even if it might put you behind in the short-term?",
        "Yes, Farai.",
        "There's a lot of research that indicates that the more education the person gets, the better lifetime earnings would be - higher quality of life will be for that person.",
        "Of course, it does depend a bit upon what the students chooses to major in or to take at college.",
        "So we would encourage the students to find that career information, to speak with counselors before they decide upon an option for the future."

        "Other than Mexico's - back to Mexico - he got a big no on that one.",
