        "Since then he's lost about 60 more.",
        "Oh, my God.",
        "Yeah, a total of 100 pounds, so yes, in the end, he did end up getting this $1,500 check.",
        "But it was not easy.",
        "At one point, he told me about midway through, his weight had plateaued, he wasn't anywhere near his goal weight, and he was really, really frustrated.",
        "My wife, actually, at one point called me out.",
        "You know, I was feeling sorry for myself.",
        "I hadn't lost any weight for like a three or four-week span, and I was like, this is stupid.",
        "It's a waste of time, I'm not going to meet my goal, and I'm going to go have a burger and some fries.",
        "And she kind of yelled at me and said, we're paying way too much money for you to just bail on this now.",
        "That's the thing about diets.",
        "I mean, one thing is you sometimes do plateau, and you start to get frustrated, and frustration not seeing the results change can lead you to say, forget it, it's not worth it, I'm going to have a burger.",
        "I mean, that's really the struggle with it.",
        "That's right.",
        "And I think what's interesting here is losing that money was the thing that freaked him out.",
        "I mean...",
        "And his wife.",
        "Right, his wife, right.",
        "Now it would be nice to think that willpower is enough, right?",
        "But it's not.",
        "I mean, I've got this cake sitting here that I just told you about.",
        "I mean, look at this.",
        "My daughter on the way out this morning took her finger and just ran a big smudge through it.",
        "She's like, why are you holding on to me, mom?",
        "That's adorable.",
        "It just shows this sort of temptation, right?",
        "So I think when it comes to resistance, a lot of people just need more strategies.",
        "And that's what Ben's story really shows, that in the end, the big motivator for him was not the prize money.",
        "It was what he heard from his wife, that fear of losing the money.",
        "And it really turns out that Ben's story is not so unique.",
        "Scientists who study financial incentives for a behavior change or weight loss say most of us operate this way without really ever knowing it.",
        "We're highly risk-averse.",
        "I spoke to this one researcher, Mitesh Patel, at the University of Pennsylvania, and he put it this way, that the fear of loss can be more powerful than the reward of winning."

        "And so if you have some skin in the game, that really tends to drive behavior change.",
        "And people tend to not want to lose something they feel like they already have.",
        "But, you know, I have to say, as compelling as this is, a lot of workplaces are having these kind of weight loss challenges, and they don't always work.",
        "For instance, there was a study published just this month in the journal Health Affairs, and it looked at this workplace wellness program where they basically discounted people's health insurance premiums if they lost weight.",
        "And it was not successful at all because the payoff isn't significant enough.",
        "I mean, who's going to notice at the end of three or four months that you had a few more dollars in your pay stub?",
        "Some people might notice, but it's not the same as thinking about $1,500 you could literally hold in your hands and go buy something.",
        "Exactly.",
        "It's really important to you.",
        "The immediacy of that, right, so the more successful formula here seems to be this blending of skin in the game, this sort of wager approach, with plenty of social support.",
        "What would skeptics say?",
        "I mean, among other things, I can imagine you might have someone who just doesn't have $50 to put up.",
        "I mean, the budget is that tight.",
        "Sure.",
        "But are there other reasons that skeptics say, come on, this is just not the best idea?",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean, I can think of two right off the bat.",
        "If someone needs to lose a huge amount of weight, they might need more oversight, and they might need a lot more instruction about what they should be eating, how they should be exercising.",
        "Another thing to think about is how well will someone like Ben be able to keep it off.",
        "What is it about this wagering approach that might help someone keep it off in the long term?",
        "And that we don't really know."
