        "But as to why a particular year is particularly bad, they don't really know.",
        "One factor probably is an unusually mild winter, which a lot of areas had, including Dallas, which is the real hotspot for West Nile right now.",
        "And probably an unusually hot spring and summer, an early or hot summer, because this amplifies the amount of virus that are in mosquitoes, and also it amplifies the number of mosquitoes.",
        "It speeds up their life cycle, so they're able to reproduce faster.",
        "Why Texas?",
        "You mentioned that's the hotspot.",
        "Again, not entirely clear.",
        "Yesterday, the state health commissioner in Texas said that they seem to have an unusually early spring, and their drought was worse last year than this year - worse last year.",
        "And so maybe that's why they're a little bit special.",
        "But again, the CDC says they don't really know.",
        "And as to why within Texas Dallas is a hotspot, they say often you'll find that it's a very local phenomenon - local mosquito population, local bird population - because that's where the mosquitoes get the virus from, along with climate factors.",
        "It's a complicated equation.",
        "An email question we have from Ernest: Has the virus reached Virginia?",
        "I'll answer that for you.",
        "You said yes.",
        "It's everywhere except Vermont.",
        "How would you know you're infected and what age bracket is more or less likely to become infected?",
        "I think that the likelihood of becoming infected is not particularly age-specific.",
        "The likelihood of getting really sick is higher among people over 50.",
        "Maybe one in every 150 people who gets infected with West Nile gets what is called a neuroinvasive form, which means that it gets into the brain and affects the brain or tissue surrounding the brain.",
        "That's a really grave disease.",
        "Nearly everybody gets hospitalized.",
        "Ten percent of people die.",
        "Two-thirds of people who get brain infections and paralysis will have lifelong effects.",
        "But in terms of everybody else, I mean, it's really mostly not going to cause you to become ill.",
        "Eighty percent of people who get infected with West Nile don't get sick.",
        "Another 20 percent, roughly, will get a flu-like illness, which can be pretty severe, lasting from days to weeks to even months, but then they recover fully.",
        "So - and you don't know who you, you know, whether you're more likely to get sick or not get sick before you get exposed.",
        "And the severe forms, as I understand, can manifest in different forms, as a form of meningitis or a form of polio.",
        "Well, I wouldn't call it polio, which is a very specific disease, but it's like polio in a sense that it can cause paralysis, which polio often did.",
        "And, you know, as I said, 10 percent mortality rate is pretty grave for that really severe form of West Nile.",
        "So it's a scary disease, but I think we should put in perspective that out of the 1,100 or so reported cases that the CDC knows about so far this year, you know, that's a tiny fraction of the number of Americans who've been infected, which probably approaches about 100,000 people.",
        "And most of them didn't know they had West Nile virus infection.",
        "Fortunately for them and for everybody who gets the virus and recovers, they're going to have life-long immunity to it.",
        "Let's get some callers in on the conversation.",
