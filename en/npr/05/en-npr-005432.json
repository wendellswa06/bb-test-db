        "Of course, it does depend a bit upon what the students chooses to major in or to take at college.",

        "So Clayton and her colleagues drew up a policy that applies to NIH-funded biomedical research from here on out involving animals.",
        "We're asking scientists to think about sex, to study both male and female animals in their preclinical research so that we can learn more about male biology and female biology.",
