        "There were also organic gardeners who didn't like it, and a few people who had fish ponds, because the kind of spray that they're using, the synthetic pyrethroid, is a - is known to kill these things.",
        "So - but we really haven't heard anything since we did all this spraying.",
        "So there had been no ill effects amongst the bee population or the fish population (unintelligible).",

        "It's been tested.",
        "It's the same stuff that we've been spraying from the ground from trucks for the last couple of months, and that the - you know, it's a slightly different version that they use from the planes.",

        "They're also testing - capturing and testing mosquitoes all the time to - and testing them for virus, which is another important signal about how much risk there is.",
