        "Oh, thank you very much.",
        "Appreciate it.",
        "And Steven Greenhouse, that's a situation that I think describes a lot of people in your story.",
        "Yes, Lawson it's great you have an employer who provides you with good benefits.",
        "That's unusual for an employer, a service-sector employer that has a lot of part-timers.",
        "But I'm surprised that your employer doesn't accommodate people when they want to go to school.",
        "I know a lot of employers, you know, if you could tell them two weeks or three weeks in advance, look, I have classes Tuesdays and Thursday mornings from 9 A.M. to 11 A.M., they can usually accommodate you.",
        "And the fact that they don't accommodate you on that is a problem.",
        "I should say, there - just to be clear, there are like 25 million part-time workers in the U.S.",
        "economy, nearly one out of - more than one out of six workers.",
        "About one-third of those part-time workers wish that they could work full-time.",
        "And the number of these so-called involuntary part-timers has doubled since 2006.",
        "So there are, like, four million more workers now than there were in 2006 who have been forced to work part time even though they would want to work full time.",
        "And I think the trend is a lot of employers, as Lawson said, you know, prefer to have lots of part-timers because you can pay them less.",
        "You generally provide them less benefits.",
        "A statistic I use in my story, Neal, is that in service-sector industries, the typical full-time worker gets $17.18 an hour, including the value of benefits, whereas the typical part-time worker gets $10.92 cents an hour.",
        "So the full-time worker gets 57 percent more an hour.",
        "I think that's a big reason, you know, more and more employers are saying, hey, let's hire part-time workers, it gives us more flexibility, and it saves us a bundle on wages and benefits."

        "So I had McDonald's franchises, two Pizza Hut franchises and at one time up to 10 other independent mom-and-pops.",
        "And I employed the exact opposite strategy.",
        "I employed mostly all full-time employees.",
        "I only offered - was only able to offer benefits to management, but I filled in my gaps in my staffing needs with part-timers, but I went with an all full-time employee workforce.",
        "I had virtually zero turnover in the seven and a half years I owned one of my franchises, where typically at McDonald's an annual turnover could be 300, 350 percent.",
        "Now, my turnover was probably less than 5 percent realistically.",
        "I had people for years.",
        "I saved on advertising costs.",
        "I didn't have to go through interviewing, hiring, you know, onboarding, exiting.",
        "And I just - I find that that works a lot better.",
        "Give a smaller group of people full-time employment works better economically for the franchise than trying to balance a whole handful of part-timers who didn't last anyway.",
        "Steven Greenhouse, he's right, there are costs associated with all that turnover and with training and other ancillary costs to those part-time employees.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You know, Mark has one vision that some employers embrace, really use - you know, hire part-timers, treat them well, give them good benefits, they'll be loyal to you, they'll work hard for you.",
        "And that's - some people call that the high-road strategy.",
        "Mark, I'm flattering you.",
        "I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "I was going to add one more thing I did also is I - typical of McDonald's franchise or Pizza Hut will give their workers maybe one shirt or two shirts and aprons.",
        "I gave my full-time employees four sets.",
        "I also installed washer and dryers in the back of each of my units, provided the laundry soap and allowed them to come in and wash their uniforms and aprons so that my employees always had a fresh, clean uniform, and that was on my dime.",
        "So I'm telling you, that formula works.",
        "You're going to reduce your turnover that way.",

        "However, on day 89, the worker is told not to return to work.",
        "Often they can reapply for the same job after a week and may be rehired on the spot again with no benefits.",
        "I am myself grossly underemployed in Iowa, I fear, because I'm 60 years old.",
        "It doesn't matter that I have lots of skills and energy to do the job, the ageism keeps me out of the full-time workforce.",
        "If that earlier caller, the former McDonald's and Pizza Hut franchiser, is the high road, maybe that's the low road.",
        "Yes, I was saying before the break, Neal, that, you know, there are high-road employers like Mark who treat their workers well, who give them lots of hours, who make them feel good about their job and themselves, and they're very loyal, and they work very hard.",
        "Then there's another group of employers that many economists call low-road employers, and they'll just give them 15, 12, 18 hours a week.",
        "They might not give benefits.",
        "And there's huge turnover with these workers.",
        "You know, with - their schedules often change week to week, and that makes it really hellish if you have, you know, college, or if you have to arrange child care or if you have to take care of, you know, an aging parent.",

        "Now what Dan just said about this - and it sounds almost as if employers are gaming the system.",
        "They say, you know, we're hiring you from a temp agency, after 90 days they'll make you a full-time regular worker, yet boom after 89 days, you're laid off.",
        "You know, employers are - it's perfectly legal.",
        "One might not say it's - one might say it's not usually ethical.",
        "You know, if you have a good worker who does a great job for 89 days, should you lay them off just so you could start with another temp and not provide them with benefits?",
        "And I'm sure employers will say I'm playing by the rules, I have up to 90 days to keep them, I'm in a very competitive business, I need to keep my costs down, other employers - my competitors - are doing the same thing.",
        "So I think what many employers say is perfectly and kosher, a lot of employees like in Dan's position will say I'm really getting the short end of the stick.",
        "And it's interesting, part of the reason you cite, obviously the bad times we've been having these past several years, but also the competition, and you point, particularly, to Wal-Mart.",
        "Well, you know, Wal-Mart is the 800-pound or, you know, $200-, $300-, $400-billion-a-year gorilla.",
        "You know, it is by far the - the nation's - by far the world's largest retailer.",
        "And in researching my story, Neal, I interviewed a retail analyst who said that it was really with the huge expansion of Wal-Mart in the 1990s, with its low-cost, you know, fiercely competitive brand and attitude that many employers said we have to do everything we possibly can to reduce our costs, to remain competitive with Wal-Mart.",
        "And one thing, one practice they really followed is hiring more and more part-time workers because it enables them to generally reduce their wages per hour, the benefits per hour, and it gives them more flexibility, as well.",
        "So instead of having one or two full-time people at the check-out line at the drug store, for example, you'd have one part-time worker helping people self-check-out at the drug store.",
        "Yes, something I wasn't able to work into my (unintelligible) is I interviewed the manager of a Target store.",
        "And he said, you know, imagine if you have 10 cash registers up front, and you have 12 full-time cash - 12 full-time workers to work the daytime shift.",
        "And he says, if three of those full-time workers call in sick one day, then you're in deep trouble.",
        "He says if you have 20 part-time workers to work those 10 registers, and three call in sick, well, you have 17 others to, you know, 17 others to try to call in.",
        "So I think a lot of store managers feel it's better for them, they look better to their employer, they're not going to have - you know, they'll always have enough workers on hand to plug in holes, if they have a huge number of part-time workers to draw from.",
        "And again, you know, those part-time workers often say I really need to work full-time, it's really hard for me to, you know, raise my family.",
        "You know, a lot of workers nowadays, of course, are single mothers, and it's really, really, you know, difficult for a single parent to try to raise a kid or two on, you know, 20 hours of work a week times $10 an hour, which is, you know, $200 a week or just $10,000 a year."
