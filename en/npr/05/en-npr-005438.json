        "Well, you can't say that, you know.",
        "There's differences.",
        "You should probably try and focus on having part-time workers who can work only part time and hire full-time workers that can only work full time.",
        "I think that would be a good solution.",
        "Nick, thanks very much for the call.",
        "I think what Nick says is true, Neal.",
        "You know, there are a lot of employers who have, you know, lunchtime surges and dinner surges, and they just want workers to work three or four hours.",
        "And there are a lot of, you know, high school students or college students who need extra spending money, and they're happy to work, you know, four hours a day, three or four days a week.",
        "And, you know, unfortunately, you know, there are a lot of unemployed people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who might like those jobs, especially if they offered more hours, but, you know, many of these employers really don't consider anyone but high school or college kids.",
        "I think someone like Mark, you know, who used to - who was the McDonald's franchisee, would say - he'd often be enthusiastic about hiring a good 30-, 40-year-old who would be willing to work full time and be dedicated to him, rather than a bunch of, you know, high school kids or college kids who you just plug in for three hours here and there.",
        "As we mentioned, part of what's driving this trend is powerful new software that helps companies streamline their staff scheduling.",
        "Kronos is one company that specializes in these sorts of workforce management technologies.",
        "Their CEO Aron Ain joins us now by phone from Chelmsford, Massachusetts.",
        "I should say NPR is among the many companies that uses Kronos products.",

        "Thank you, happy to be here.",
        "And what kind of software are we talking about?",
        "I guess people used to do this on, what, Excel spreadsheets.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So what the software does is it takes into account things like skills, cost, availability, preference, seniority, and uses a form of artificial intelligence to put the right person, the employee, in the right place at the right time.",
        "And this does it more or less automatically.",
        "A manager might have to work half an hour, two hours to do this properly.",
        "This does it much quicker."

        "Yeah, typically what would happen, depending on the size of a store, it might take two hours to as much as eight hours a week for a manager to do the schedule manually.",
        "Now it can be done in a matter of minutes, and it produces more effective schedule.",
        "And more effective, quarter hour by quarter hour.",
        "Some do it quarter of hour by quarter hour, some half hour by half hour, hour by hour.",
        "It depends on how the particular user of the product chooses to set up the system.",
        "What are the variables they can plug into this?",
        "They plug in things.",
        "As I said, you take into account the skill of the person.",
        "You want to make sure you have, you know, someone working in the shoe department who knows shoes.",
        "You want to plug in availability.",
        "You don't want to schedule someone when the employee told you, I can't work that time; I have to pick up my child from daycare, or I am a student; I have class.",
        "You can plug in what their preferences are.",
        "In some cases, where there's collective bargaining agreements or just company rules, you can plug in there the seniority where there might be a preference around that.",
        "There was - interesting.",
        "Steve Greenhouse, in his story, had one - I think it was a Jamba Juice outlet that was plugging in the temperature.",
        "When it gets hotter, people buy more juice.",
        "Yeah, it's very typical.",
        "So they'll actually take into account using the software to, say, all 52 weeks, and they'll look back for their previous five years, and they'll say what the demand was on the Friday before Memorial Day at a grocery store.",
        "And you want to make sure, in that really high-volume time, you have the right number of employees there so the customer experience is favorable and they'll want to come back and continue to shop at your particular location.",
        "And, similarly, if there's a 3 P.M. slump, just about every day, you don't want to have too many people you're paying.",
        "That's right.",
        "You move away from a model which I call - instead of a just-in-case scheduling method where you're just putting more than you need just in case you have a certain volume, it's really more focused on a more exact process to make sure you have the right people in the right place at the right time."

        "That's right.",
        "Well, the rush still happens around the holiday time.",
        "Customers, companies that use our product will go increase their volume of staff 20 to 50 percent around the holidays.",
        "It's just how you schedule those because the volume goes up during that period.",
        "And, Steve Greenhouse, as you said in your story, these kinds of streamlining operations can make a huge difference.",

        "He knows the stuff amazingly well.",
        "I'm very impressed with Kronos' software.",
        "You know, I interviewed one client of Kronos, Jamba Juice, who said that, you know, once they started using this, you know, highly sophisticated software, it enabled them to reduce their labor costs by 4 or 5 percent.",
        "They achieved, for instance, that - you know, think of Starbucks or Jamba Juice.",
        "They might see that, you know, there's a drop-off in business between 2:15 and 2:30.",
        "So instead of keeping employees to 2:30, they might, you know, cut their shift 15 minutes earlier, and that way they could save, you know, a significant bit on labor costs if you multiply that to times one week times a whole year times, you know, thousands of employees.",
        "And as Aron was saying, you know, it used to take some managers two, four, six, eight hours, you know, over their Excel spreadsheets, giving themselves huge headaches, getting brain teasers, figuring out how to schedule their 50 employees.",
        "Now, with this sophisticated software, they can do it in five minutes or 10 minutes or half an hour.",
        "And that saves lots of headaches, and it saves lots of money and time for the companies.",
        "Is there somewhere else to go with this, Aron Ain?",
        "Well, I would say that the part that I would add to that, while there's the issues that we talked about around the employee, one of the big advantages of this system is it enhances the customer experience.",
        "I really believe that deeply.",
        "Lucas Sampson has been facilitating the Achieving Change Through Values-Based Behavior Program - or ACTV - for about four years.",
        "He's using the ice to get the men to observe their feelings.",
        "If you can have the right number of employees there at the right place at the right time, you're going to make sure the customers are taken care of more effectively.",
        "You move away from that just-in-case formula, and you move away from the formula where you had too few people there.",
        "And so it just tries to achieve what those managers were trying to achieve manually anyway, and it does it more effectively."

        "Number two, I'll say quickly that I believe this benefits employees as well because they tell their managers that they don't want to work a certain time or they're not available.",
        "And the managers used to try to remember all that in their head or little sticky notes in their little, small office and the retailer.",

        "Yes.",
        "And I think the underlying point in my story about the growing use of part-time workers is that, you know, there's a - there are big, fundamental, underlying changes in the economy, and one of that is that we're moving more and more away from, you know, the good full-time jobs of yesterday that help people support a family to these more contention, precarious jobs, you know, part-time.",
