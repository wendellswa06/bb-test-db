        "So the bottom line is that most Americans favor legal abortion in some cases and not in others.",

        "Wade.",
        "Just 13% say it should be overturned.",
        "So where people differ is in the particulars.",

        "Nine percent said it should never be allowed, and another 9% said only to save a woman's life.",

        "Some people want more restrictions than Roe allows.",

        "I talked to Barbara Carvalho, the director of the Marist Poll, and she says politicians often talk about abortion as a polarizing issue, but that doesn't necessarily capture how Americans feel.",
        "I think they see it as advantageous to both, you know, fundraising, vote-getting, to echo these loudest voices.",
        "And so when we look at public opinion, public opinion isn't really at those points.",
        "Public opinion is in the middle.",
        "And this has been borne out by other polls - by Gallup and Pew, for example.",
        "Most Americans want some restrictions on abortion, but don't want to ban it altogether.",
        "So dig into that gray area for us.",
        "When people talk about the restrictions they would like to see, how did people respond in this poll?",

        "But he says that a Maduro government could have a more pragmatic relationship with Washington.",
        "Shifter says that's because Maduro has long been known as a negotiator.",
        "He's somebody who is open, who you can talk to, and I think the United States would be interested in pursuing a channel of communication with the Venezuelan government.",
        "And Maduro would be seen as somebody they could talk to.",
        "The big question observers are asking themselves, though, is if Maduro could replace the larger-than-life president.",
        "Could he hold the disparate factions of Chavismo together?",
        "Charles Shapiro is a former American ambassador here, and knows both Maduro and Chavez.",
        "And there's no one, as far as I'm aware, who can rival him at all, who has the same profile, and no one who has the same charisma or abilities to communicate with the base of support of Chavez."
