        "Another interesting thing about this poll is that it asked people to self-identify as pro-choice or pro-life.",
        "Those labels had - have limited usefulness because they're not very complex, but it does give us a feel for how people are feeling.",
        "This poll found a peak in the number of people who identify as pro-choice in recent years.",
        "Fifty-seven percent said pro-choice, 35% pro-life.",
        "Compare that, Ari, to just February when it was an even split between pro-choice and pro-life.",
        "Now, that poll took place right after New York passed an abortion law decriminalizing abortion later in pregnancy.",

        "Again, the nine prosecutors, they were let go for a variety of reasons, right?",
        "Right.",
        "There were seven let go all in one day.",
        "Two released - rather, dismissed before that.",
        "And as this unfolded, we had just a patchwork quilt of different reasons.",
        "You know, people were claiming this was performance-related, it was so that other people would have a chance to serve.",
        "And the question was, were people really being fired because they were not aggressive enough about prosecuting Democrats?",
        "Or they were too aggressive about prosecuting Republicans?",
        "And this report today comes to the conclusion that there is substantial evidence to indicate that people were fired for partisan political reasons.",
        "The problem is, not everybody would cooperate with this investigation.",
        "Members of Congress, people in the White House in some cases, refused to talk to investigators and that's why, as you mentioned, Attorney General Michael Mukasey is now appointing a special prosecutor to continue this investigation.",
        "So tell us, this is a lengthy report.",
        "What are the headlines?",
        "Well, the sort of biggest trouble spot is the firing of David Iglesias, who was the prosecutor in New Mexico.",
        "And the senator from New Mexico, Pete Domenici, Republican, had complained that Iglesias was not bringing voter fraud cases against Democratic activists just before the election.",
        "And there are real fingerprints on this report suggesting that Iglesias may have been fired because he would not indict those Democrats and that's potentially illegal.",
        "But Domenici would not cooperate with this investigation until the report stopped just short of saying that any crime was in fact committed.",
        "When you look at the big picture on this report, you get an image of the Justice Department as a place where there were frankly no adults at all.",
        "I mean, there's just stunning criticism in here of Alberto Gonzales, the attorney general, his deputy Paul McNulty, his chief of staff Kyle Sampson.",
        "Nobody emerges from this unscathed.",
        "Let me just review one quote here, Madeleine.",
        "It says we believe department leaders abdicated their responsibility to ensure the prosecutorial decisions would be based on the law, the evidence and department policy rather than political pressure related to the handling of specific cases.",
        "And Madeleine, this goes right to the heart of what the Justice Department is all about.",
        "Once people start to believe that federal prosecutors are bringing charges not based on the law and the evidence, but rather on political partisan considerations, then the reputation and the standing of the Justice Department across the country just starts to erode.",
        "And that's really what we saw over last year with more than dozen top officials leaving as this crisis unfolded.",
        "So Ari, if the report says that Gonzales - former attorney Alberto Gonzales abdicated his responsibility and wasn't really paying attention, who was paying attention and who did order that firings according to this report of the..."
