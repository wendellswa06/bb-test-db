        "It is not the government who are started the fighting.",
        "It is these armed groups who are attacking civilians, who are attacking villages and cities, and killing people.",
        "This is, of course, a different view of what's happening as being conveyed to the international community by certain powers and countries who are falsifying the reality about what's happening in Syria.",
        "When you talk about foreign countries, of course, the Syrian regime itself gets support from Russia, from Iran; there are Hezbollah fighters in Syria dying every week.",

        "But as I confirmed, the Syrian army is defending Syria against any interference and against any terrorist attacks being encouraged by Turkey, by the United States and others.",
        "Let me just follow-up on that, Faisal Mekdad, because our reporters in the region say it's very clear that Hezbollah fighters are fighting on Syrian soil, on behalf of the Syrian regime and are dying on Syrian soil."
