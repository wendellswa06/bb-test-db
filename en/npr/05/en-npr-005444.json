        "Thank you for making it OK to have periods in your career where you do rebalance in favor of family and for demonstrating that you can do that and still, over the arc of a career, continue to progress and continue to have opportunities to, you know, serve and contribute.",
        "So I was actually surprised by the reaction because I had worried about, you know, letting down the side, if you will.",

        "So I think if I were to go back in, you know, one of us would have to be out.",

        "It seems to me that that is a kind of a form of discrimination.",
        "I mean, if you have, as you write, many young women when they're at the point in their careers where they're really going to get to the next level, it's usually around the same time when they decide to have children.",
        "So I wonder, I mean, why can't institutions and the corporate sector and other parts of America adapt to that and accept that there may be periods of time when those promising women will be out of work for some time, will be with their children, or they're making scale back on their hours for a few years?",
        "Well, I think that the corporate America and certainly the public sector also is trying to do that and has been somewhat successful.",

        "But I think your question the way you - it really implies that there are no differences between men and women; they all want the same thing and want similar amounts of time with their children, similar things from the workplace."
