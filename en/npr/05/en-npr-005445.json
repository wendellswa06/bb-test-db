        "And we're continuing our cover story about working mothers and making it to the top.",

        "You're expected to give 100 percent on the home front and 100 percent at the work front and 100 percent to your friends and your community and you feel like a complete failure.",
        "But I think here, we haven't really adjusted to what I call the juggler family - the rise of the family where all adults are working.",
        "Either it's a single parent working or two parents working.",
        "We still have this idea in our head that the ideal worker is a breadwinner with no family responsibilities and the ideal parent is the homemaker with no workplace responsibilities.",
        "And we haven't changed our expectations enough.",
        "As we heard earlier from Kay Hymowitz, her argument is that many women make this choice.",
        "They choose to spend time with their kids over pay.",
        "That the opportunities are there, there's flextime, there are all these, you know, corporations have adapted and the workplace has adapted.",
        "And many women just make this choice.",
        "Do you think that that's the case?",
        "I wouldn't call it a choice in the classic sense because I don't think they have a lot of options.",
        "We don't have the option to work flexibly and not lose your health care, in many cases.",
        "We don't have the option to work and have your children in a safe, high-quality child care situation.",
        "Until we give families some real options, I don't want to blame or say there's no problem because women are making a choice, and they're making a choice and they don't have serious options.",
        "And I think we can look to other countries to see what serious options look like, whether it's a better child care system, paid maternity leave, flexibility.",
        "These things exist in other countries.",
        "We haven't really incorporated them here.",
        "The affordable housing program usually works in areas of economic blight.",

        "And if I could just say one other thing.",
        "What distresses me a little bit is when the conversation becomes only about the high-wage earner, the alpha women, as some people have called it, the person who might become CEO.",
        "I think that's really important.",
        "I don't want to diminish that.",
        "We want our leaders to be a diverse group.",
        "I think women have a lot to add in all of those areas, and our companies would be better off, our countries would be better off, if we had more women.",
        "But what I want to also pay attention to is the middle-class family, the lower-income family where the mother doesn't even have the choice of stepping out."
