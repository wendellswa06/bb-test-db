        "And that picture was broadcast across Virginia.",
        "And if you were a conservative Republican activist and saw that picture, a shiver went up your spine.",

        "So, I mean, I think on all accounts this was - whether you're a Republican or Democrat, this was a very, very poor performance by the Congress.",
        "Melissa, are you going to grade on the curve for these guys?",
        "What do you have for them?",
        "Oh, well, I mean on the curve they'd be even lower.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It struck me as a little bit of grade inflation there to call it a D.",
        "This is clearly an F.",
        "They failed to do maybe the single most basic thing, which is to reproduce itself for the next Congress.",
        "So, you know, after only 12 years of Republican control, and that may have seemed like a lot to people on the left, but compared to the length of time that the Democrats held the Congress, this was actually a pretty short ascendancy of the GOP.",
        "And in that time sort of the original headway that may have been made on a GOP agenda was quickly lost, and they didn't even do the fundamental responsibility to their party, which was to get re-elected.",
        "Robert, do you think that the Republicans were ever as unified as they were made to be in aspects of the media and public discussion?",
        "Well, I think that there's a certain amount of unity amongst the Republicans, I would say, coming out of the 2004 elections.",
        "And I think the unity started to fray over two issues closer to the end, obviously, over Iraq.",
        "But even early on I would actually point to something that actually the president did that I think began to sew some of the seeds of discontent amongst Republicans.",
        "And that was his attempt to reform Social Security, which, from my perspective as a conservative, I mean I thought was something of a valid attempt.",
        "But he didn't even seem to want to put down a marker as to what kind of a reform would look like, just sort of leaving it to the Congress."

        "And that allowed Democrats to poke at it and to sew divisions within the Republican Congress and within the administration.",
        "So things started there.",
        "By the end of the day, the Republicans were scurrying in 50 different directions.",
        "Now, Melissa, while the Republicans collapsed as the session went on, the Democrats unified.",
        "Did they learn a valuable lesson from being the minority party for so long?",
        "You now, that will remain to be seen when we bring on the 110th.",
        "You know, certainly the group of Democrats which helped the party to retake the House are substantially different from their senior colleagues who will be heading the committees.",
        "Older, safer, many African-American Congresspersons, who will now be taking on the leadership roles in the 110th Congress, whereas many of the kind of folks who were able to defeat Republicans in local House races were much more conservative new Democrats.",
        "And so whether or not across those kinds of ideological and generational divides the new Democratic majority can hold remains to be seen.",
        "That said, they have the one thing that does tend to keep Democrats in line on voting behavior, which is to say they have a Republican president.",
        "So that's the word, they have an outsider.",
        "They have an enemy.",
        "So that might certainly help to keep discipline in the 110th Congress.",

        "I think it did.",
        "And I think, interestingly enough, the two politicians that pushed this the most, Tom DeLay in the House and Bill Frist in the Senate, are both now no longer in Congress.",
        "Frist, of course, then majority leader, had decided that he was not going to run again.",
        "His plan had been to run for president, but I think he read the tea leaves correctly, given that they lost the majority and his leadership on a lot of issues was called into question, that he doesn't really have a chance and so he decided not even to run for president.",

        "I want to ask you, Melissa, is there anything that the Democrats did, individually or as a group, that had a similar effect, something they thought was a homerun but really turned out to be a very bad idea?",
        "You know, it's interesting on the Democratic side, the ways in which they, you know, some sort of individual ethics violations ended up not working against them, in part because of the huge failures on the part of the federal government that angered constituents.",
        "So the big example of this is Representative Jefferson in Louisiana, who is, you know, right now dealing with the questions of ethics violations, the huge sums of cash in marked bills that were found in his freezer, and who was returned to the U.S.",
        "Congress.",
        "And largely the press around this has been suggesting that voters so angry about the federal response to Hurricane Katrina felt that they wanted to return their Congressperson who they felt had stood up for them, had fought for them, even with some of these ethics violations hanging over their heads.",

        "I have to say the bankruptcy law was at the center of what will affect working people and poor people who are disproportionately people of color, although certainly not exclusively.",
        "And, you know, the attack on the bankruptcy law at the same time that the Congress held on to tax cuts for the wealthy helped to really expose the ways in which this was not a legislative policy or agenda setters meant to really help out the American family: When Americans are faced with massive overburdening of personal debt and they recognize that that is a result of the changing structure of the American economy and not just about poor spending choices that their Congress would step in to make life harder for them while simultaneously easing the burden on the very wealthy in terms of taxes.",
        "I think this was the sort of policy that really helped put in to stark relief for working people, for African-Americans, for people of color, just how much this Congress is not on their side.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's a fair point.",
        "And I also point to -well, I disagree with the particular prescription, but I think that the issue of the minimum wage, when you put it in connection with Congress happily raising its own pay, had that similar kind of out-of-touch resonance.",
        "I think it became particularly affective in communities of color where pocketbook issues are going to be most hardest felt.",

        "Exactly.",
        "Exactly.",
