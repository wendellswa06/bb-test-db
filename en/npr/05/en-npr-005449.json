        "And making that decision to say goodbye to someone that you love deeply and knowing that it's the best thing to do.",
        "And I know it took Eleanor a long time to decide that it was the best thing to do, but this is the kind of decision that we all have to make, whether it's with donating your organs or turning off a ventilator, these are decisions that we all need to face up to sooner rather than later.",

        "But I think there was a struggle around the time that medical technology was exploding and we could suddenly - the people who taught me could suddenly conceive of doing things that had never been doable before.",
        "And I think there was a need for medicine, the teachers, the practitioners to begin to understand that the ability to do something does not justify doing it and that, first and foremost, this remains a very human activity, flawed as every human activity is.",
        "And I appreciated the caller's sense of gratitude and I appreciated his use of love and I do think, as I've gotten older doing this work, it is very close to love, what happens in these relationships as we work through these decisions for which the heart ultimately must guide us.",
        "Here's an email we have from Mark in Fort Leavenworth in Kansas: When my wife entered hospice care after battling cancer for nine months, I had complete confidence in the organization's competence.",

        "When my wife asked to be admitted to the resident hospice facility, the nurse told us it was not time for that yet and she would be discharged as soon as a doctor examined her.",
        "Less than 24 hours later, after I pleaded tearfully with the hospice team leader to admit her, my wife died in the ambulance on the way to the facility.",
        "Again, all human efforts are open to frailties and mistakes, but Lee Gutkin, one of the lessons that we learn in reading this book is that alternatives, hospice care, palliative treatment - treating the symptoms rather than trying to cure the disease - that these are being presented as alternatives more often.",
        "They are being presented as alternatives more often, but I must say not often enough and Larry mentioned that it is important to say that some of these decisions and some of the actions of physicians are done through love and caring and emotion.",
        "But very often, physicians are also kind of acting out of defensiveness and fear at the same time and one would hope that our medical schools and the hospital teaching units would be able to introduce to the doctors.",
        "The doctors have more power than anybody else, perhaps, in a hospital atmosphere.",
        "Introduce to the doctors the idea that they need to, in fact, look at their patients in both ways.",
        "Everything that they can do that technology allows to save and everything they can do that technology and common sense and love allows to make the family and the patient feel better about what's going on and understand what's going on."
