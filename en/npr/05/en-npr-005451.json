        "The mayor's legal bills - see, the city has a law department.",
        "But in a case like this the mayor has chosen to use some private attorneys as well.",
        "Some of these guys are high-priced attorneys charging $350, $375 an hour.",
        "The mayor's legal tab is now at over $600,000, and it's still counting.",
        "Nine million dollars so far of taxpayer money have been spent on this whole, I guess, imbroglio, this fiasco, however you want to call it.",
        "And you know, in Detroit that goes a long way.",
        "This city typically runs $100 million deficits.",
        "Nine million dollars in Detroit will demolish 1,200 abandoned homes.",
        "It will hire over 130 firefighters and pay their benefits.",
        "It'll hire over 120 police officers and pay their benefits.",
        "That's sorely needed help in a city that has cut 1,000 police officers from its ranks in the past five years.",
        "Almost a third of the cops have been taken off the street because we don't have enough money.",
        "Now, since your story was published, the mayor has not made any public comments.",
        "Are people expecting him to say anything about this or to actually resign?",
        "We see the black gay community in New York City in alliance with some New York politicians to unveil new billboards, a billboard campaign which hits Harlem and some of the transit area in New York, which is reminding African-Americans that gays are a big part - a large part of the black population.",
        "And Bishop Harry Jackson is senior pastor at the 3,000-member Hope Christian Church.",
        "That church is based in College Park, Maryland, just outside of Washington D.C.",
        "Bishop Jackson told NPR's Tony Cox why the GOP has fallen out of favor with some conservative Christians.",
        "Many of us are feeling as though the evangelical community has been taken for granted and that the issues that matter to us such as marriage and family are being ignored.",
        "And those issues need to be addressed.",
        "So it's a sense of abandonment after many of us have risked the ire of our communities in standing with the GOP, now the GOP does not deliver.",
        "Are you of the same opinion, Bishop Gimenez?",
        "I certainly am.",
        "I was watching Congressman Ford yesterday, and it seems that the Democrats are beginning to come back to the center as he was declaring Jesus as the Lord of his life and there's no room for compromise on certain moral issues.",
        "And the more - or that we're hearing that - the more that we are saying, you know, if only all of them could come to the center, you know.",
        "Are the issues different with regard to the black evangelical clergy and the Latino evangelical clergy with regard to whether or not the GOP is stepping up to the plate in the way that you both feel that it should?"

        "They don't know why.",
        "And they have a skepticism about immigration, but there's not a clearly defined position.",
        "With regard to immigration, Bishop Gimenez, is that a - is that the primary and focal issue that concerns you?",
        "I think it's because we are so diverse in the Latino community, being from Venezuela, Uruguay to Cuba, Puerto Rico, and we tend to sort of go in different directions on that.",
        "For instance, those of us who were born here -I was born in Spanish Harlem - don't have a big problem as far as immigration.",
        "We understand law is law, and what is good for the goose is good for the gander.",
        "So while we may feel compassion and so forth, we still know that once you start breaking of any law, you either got to change it or it has no effect.",
        "One last thing is you've got more Catholics in the Latino ranks than you do within the African-American ranks.",
        "And they have been trained from the get-go, you know, in the Catholic doctrine of, you know, abortion, against abortion, against all those things.",
        "So they're more, in a sense, are more aligned in that area.",
        "Whereas in the black community, African-American community, they've been brought up more in the evangelical type of setting - which I am one - in this area in America and so forth.",

        "But when it comes down to the nitty-gritty, we're going to join together in what's basic in the rule of God's law.",

        "What is the answer to that question?",
        "I think there has to be a - as some people call it, come-to-Jesus meeting with the Republican Party.",
        "Meaning that if you have the Foley-type of situations and other disclosures that have come out, and on these issues of protecting the family and dealing with the rights that people are supposed to have concerning economics and even judicial justice, many blacks are saying to themselves, are we in a situation like we were when the Democrats were in charge of all black people, so to speak, and they promise, promise, promise but they never deliver.",
        "So there's going to have to be a realignment that says we are either going to be for your moral agenda and we're going to try to govern in a moral way, or there need to be a parting of ways.",
        "I believe that there will be a meeting of the minds with black, Hispanic and the broader evangelical community with the GOP, but I think it's time that we also start talking to the Democrats.",
        "As Bishop Gimenez said earlier, we really want to, as Christians first and Democrats or Republicans second, we want to see both parties come more toward the middle and build up our families, build up our communities and make America the great nation that it once was.",
        "Let me follow up with you, Bishop Jackson, on this point.",
        "Because much has been written about this, particularly in the book Testifying Faith by David Kuo, who, as you all know, was a former White House aide talking about reportedly that the president was critical of black evangelical support because, quote, the president allegedly said, \"all they want is money.\"\" How much of this is a quid pro quo, money for support?"

        "When I, for example, am out pushing these issues which I believe in, I always get a backlash; you're an Uncle Tom, you're an Oreo, blah blah blah, and I've got to deal with that in my own community.",
        "So if there's not a delivery of these moral values or some substantive policies, then I will diminish my own constituency, my church, my power base within our organization.",
