        "So he's come out of this trial and he's trying to jump back into the political fray.",

        "He's going to retake-he's going to regain his position in the African National Congress, the ruling party, and he's going to go back to those activities.",
        "So he's out there.",
        "He's an incredibly popular politician, and he also has a corruption trial starting in July.",
        "If he can beat that, he'll be back into the mainstream of the political scene here and very well could be a serious contender for president in 2009.",
        "Finally Jason, what of the victim?",
        "Well, the alleged victim has been in protective custody.",
        "This is another aspect that has really tainted Zuma, is his supporters have been hurling abusive language, were throwing things at her during the court, burning pictures of her, and so she's been in police custody.",
        "They're now talking about potentially sending her out of the country into exile somewhere off the African continent for her own safety at this point.",
        "It's unclear.",
        "The South African police are not disclosing exactly what's happening with her, but that has been what's been discussed, that she might have to completely leave the country.",
        "And women's groups are quite upset about that.",
        "They feel that a woman should be able to make charges and not have to flee the country afterwards.",
        "NPR's Jason Beaubien with the latest for the alleged victim, as well as Mr. Zuma.",
        "We thank you, Jason, and appreciate it.",

        "We are going to turn now to Turkey, where the Organization of Islamic Cooperation met this week.",
        "The summit followed the killings in Gaza, and the U.S.",

        "NPR's Peter Kenyon reports.",

        "Before convening an emergency summit with heads of state and top diplomats from the OIC, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan staged a campaign-style rally with an audience of thousands of supporters.",
        "Next month, Erdogan will seek another five years in office.",
        "He slammed what he called the crimes of Israel against the people of Gaza.",
        "While he said he was attacking Zionism and not the Jewish people, he fixed the beginning of what he referred to as Zionist tyranny as the birth of the state of Israel.",
        "He's heard through an interpreter.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "(Through an interpreter) Since 1947, Israel is free in this region, and they are tactless, and they are ruthless.",
        "The state of Israel was proclaimed 70 years ago this month in May of 1948.",
        "But Israel was not Erdogan's only target.",
        "Much of his speech showed frustration with what he considers a weak reaction by Arab and Muslim leaders.",
        "He castigated them for their failure to stand up to Israel in Washington.",
        "Jerusalem is a test, he said, and the Islamic world is failing."

        "Joining us to discuss these topics and more, from our New York bureau, Walter Fields, CEO and publisher of the NorthStarNetwork.com.",

        "That is the belief of many of these people polled.",
        "Bob Meadows, this is not surprising, but it begs the question whether or not we will ever return to what the president liked to call normalcy.",
        "You know, I did actually find it a little surprising, Ed, because I wonder what the other 25 percent of the people thought.",
        "What we just saw in London with the airplanes, that was probably an al-Qaida plot that happened to be thwarted.",
        "Bin Laden struck before September 11th, not necessarily in the United States but he was responsible for a lot of terrorists and bombings overseas.",
        "So this is something that they're not going to stop.",
        "What I know that authorities believe about al-Qaida is that they often have these slow developing plots that are going to, that want to be huge spectacles, as well as the smaller acts of terrorism.",
        "So, yeah, absolutely, they are going to strike again, and, no, we will not be returning.",
        "But really, you know, this world wasn't very safe before September 11th.",
        "I think that people are just more aware of it now.",
        "Walter, what we've seen too is the United States catching up with the rest of the world in terms of terrorism on our grounds.",
        "Well, I think that's the real issue.",
        "You know, in my mind, what September 11th really did was it unnerved the American public.",
        "You know, we finally realize just how vulnerable we are as a nation.",
        "Americans had pretty much settled into a comfort zone, thinking that they would never, ever see that type of terrorism on our soil.",
        "And I think people now realize - when you begin to think about how open this country is; and how much access you have in this nation; the fact that most of our borders, people just slip through without any problem - I think that's the real issue here.",
        "Whether or not bin Laden or some other factor actually attacks the United States, what's really happened is that we are now a less secure country in the minds of most Americans."

        "Here's what's interesting, too, in the numbers, Julianne, is that the percentage, albeit high, had dropped from the 2004 same question.",
        "Sixty-six percent of the poll respondents said it was likely at that point, and even higher, of course, closer to the actually event, the year of - was 76 percent.",
        "And you know, Ed, what's even more interesting than that to me is that African-American people have never experienced significant security in these United States.",
        "Even before September 11th, so many of us were always waiting for the other shoe to drop one way or another.",
        "In the wake of September 11th, Cornell West said to white America really, welcome to the world.",

        "And I can recall being in the barber shop talking about the attacks, and a brother saying, hey, you know, you didn't have to wait to worry about someone attacking you at your job or your home.",
        "Just think back to Philadelphia and the MOVE incident.",

        "Well, you know, historically we've always lived under the threat of violence.",
        "That's what supported White supremacy all of these decades and centuries, so I think Julianne is right.",
        "But I will say, I think that even for African-Americans, I think there was a shock value about 9/11.",
        "Particularly if you lived in a major urban center.",
        "Because the notion that in one fell swoop you could have that many people eliminated.",
        "And I think we felt it again with Katrina.",
        "I think there's something about these cataclysmic events that sort of sends a chill down your bone.",
        "Because in this country, even if you're African-American, I think was always this sense that it will never happen here in terms of the type of terrorism that Julianne described as happening around the world because we felt that we were impenetrable.",
        "Bob, if we can continue to break that down, though, it may be a question of shock, yes, surprise, no.",
        "No.",
        "I think everybody was surprised by September 11th.",
        "I think there was surprise to the government's reaction after Katrina, because people, you know, you thought that the government - you hoped that the government had its act together a bit better than it performed.",
        "A lot better, actually, than it performed after Katrina."

        "When you look at the data on who takes care of elderly parents or these, you know, what do they call them, boomerang children who come back home at age 25 to stay.",
        "It's women who are putting the resources into that.",
        "So so many women fear I'll give so much there'd be nothing left for me.",
        "Also rising life expectancy.",
        "And the fact that if you look at poverty rates among women over age 65, they're nearly double those of men.",
        "So these are reasonable - well, they're not reasonable fears - but they're fears that come out of fact.",
        "And what women have to do to combat those fears is really just to educate themselves about money, about investing, about saving.",

        "Yeah.",
        "You've got these uber-guys who are on Wall Street, and you've got these women who've got their money tucked away somewhere making one percent.",
        "Though, Bob, what we did see in this study is women have been listening to their mammas, grandmammas and aunties as they are twice as likely as men to have a secret stash on the side; just in case those men are not acting right.",

        "Well, yeah, I've heard about that.",
