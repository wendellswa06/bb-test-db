        "But, yeah, black women have - or women have a stash on the side so they don't -so that the husband doesn't find out what they're spending.",
        "And also so that if they want to go out and buy a handbag, some shoes, something like that for themselves, they don't have to explain where that money came from.",
        "It's their secret stash.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Walter...",
        "But I think what this poll also - I want to say what this poll also speaks to is just the uncertainty of the world today.",

        "People know that there's not going to be - there may not be anything left for them by the time they reach retirement age.",
        "And as Julianne pointed out, poverty rates among women are so high that this is a fear that is tangible.",
        "Walter, it was still very surprising to me to hear from women who were making $100,000 or more, which actually puts them into the top 2 or 3 percent of wage earners in this country, I believe, Julianne.",
        "And, Walter, that was so surprising to me.",
        "It really does speak to the insecurity that women in this country feel financially.",
        "Oh yeah, and I think it speaks to the larger issue of gender disparities.",
        "I mean I think part of it is when you see someone who has an annual income of, you know, $100,000 or more that feels that way, it suggests that there are some other things going on and not necessarily related to income, that it's a general sense of insecurity about their place in society.",
        "So I can completely understand sort of that response on the survey.",
        "But I think what's really interesting here - I think for our community this is critically important when you look at the role that women are playing in households today and that we need to understand this a little bit better.",
        "Because when you look at who's raising, you know, many of our children, when you look at who is leading households in our community, we need to understand that part of our civil rights struggle has to be this issue of tackling these gender disparities.",
        "If not, it's going to overwhelm our community.",
        "This on the heels of a special coming on on ABC this evening.",

        "I can't tell you how important this is.",
        "I mean I've lost three college friends and fraternity brothers to AIDS, my best friend 15 years ago.",
        "And I think part of the challenge in the black community is that we need to have an open conversation about this.",
        "Because if not, it will always be discussed in the backroom.",
        "So I applaud this effort, because I think, you know, it's a human rights issue in my mind.",
        "I think we've got to get to the point to understand that, you know, whatever your sense of what is natural may be, the fact of the matter is is that we have an incredible diversity of humanity in our ethnic group and that we need to embrace all of it and not make people feel as though they have to live in such a way that they can't be who they are and fulfill, you know, their promise."

        "Bob, there is this push by these groups to suggest that what they also want to do is get away from what has been tagged by the media as this down-low mentality - homosexuals trying to lead a heterosexual life and endangering not only themselves but their family members - as well as the denial that the larger community has - in particular many of, not all, but many of the black churches - that have fueled the fight against homosexuality and many people say have continued to cause the problems we're seeing in the community.",
        "You know, black people tend to be very socially conservative on a lot of issues, gay marriage probably being at the top of the list.",

        "It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve, is often the saying that you hear.",

        "It's not a black thing.",
        "It's a phenomenon, the stigma against gay people forces men into relationships with women to hide themselves.",
        "But that puts our communities at danger.",
        "And our community, the black community, is already in so much danger and we really can't afford that.",
        "Though black America really tagged it the down-low, Julianne.",
        "Well, yeah, but white folks - when the down-low gets the front page of The New York Times, Ed, you know, what else that black people do gets the front page of The New York Times.",
