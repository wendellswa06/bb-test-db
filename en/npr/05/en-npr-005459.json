        "In '98 they were alleged to have killed a girl; they were alleged to have confessed.",
        "A press conference was called and the public was of the opinion that these children did it.",
        "Four weeks later, it develops that charges were unfounded.",
        "We must reserve judgment and not rush to judgment this time based upon what the policeman said about this young boy, when it comes to whether or not he did what it is alleged he did and not come to judgment.",
        "The impact, of course, on a charge being filed against a young kid like that is indelible, and it does have its adverse effect on him.",
        "Mr.",
        "Bell, why have we turned into a country, quite frankly, that does rush to judgment?",
        "We don't necessarily believe in the rule, the adage, of innocent until proven guilty anymore.",

        "I mean it's very, very clear to me - and again, if you look at Thatcher's youth violence report that we worked on, 50 percent of all males under the age of 18 commit a felony-level offense.",
        "Now, what happens to the black youth is they go into corrections.",
        "The white youth go into counseling, or they go into community service.",
        "So it's clear to me that there is selective prosecution.",
        "If you look at drug use in this country, more whites use illegal drugs than blacks, but who's incarcerated for that drug use?",
        "The black kids are.",
        "So there is clearly - there has always been in this country a notion that black people were guilty until proven innocent.",

        "It was just presented so uncritically and without question, and I think that bears some scrutiny.",

        "I think that sports can definitely transcend sport and it could combat a general feeling of malaise.",
        "And certainly for the Bostonians who were two or three steps removed from victims, if they felt sympathy for the victims, or if they felt perhaps afraid in their lives, the Red Sox could provide something.",
        "Maybe it's just joy.",

        "But the other thing he does, his main job, is he works with soldiers and airmen and Marines who are dealing with PTSD.",
        "And he says, you know, the trap that we fall into is that we generalize about what happens with victims.",
        "So, to say that they are healed is not always true.",
        "And then there is another effect.",
        "It is quite likely that just as the news is done, many stories on the person who was a victim of the Boston bombing and maybe they're going through therapy now, and, man, they love the Red Sox and the Red Sox give them hope or inspiration.",
        "But, you know, it's really quite likely that there are many people out there who are not going to do a news story on who feel terrible and they're struggling through this as, of course, they are.",
        "And maybe they don't care about the Red Sox, you know.",
        "And when they hear things like this, it makes them feel why am I not in the process that I'm told I should be?",
        "Why am I a couple of steps behind this supposedly healed city?",
        "I would just think about the use of that word, as we media think about a lot of phrases, and really try not to overuse it and to prescribe magical qualities to a team that did great on the field and is a great team off the field too."
