        "He is not being allowed to run in this election.",
        "He's called for a boycott.",
        "He says the whole vote is rigged and that the only appropriate response is not to legitimize it, telling people to stay away.",
        "Why is he wrong?",

        "But still I say what I want.",
        "The thing that really matters is that for me, it's easier to say that than for people who do not have that much media coverage.",
