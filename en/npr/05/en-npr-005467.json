        "Well, I actually disagree with part of what you said.",
        "I think that Dolores is highly self-aware.",
        "At one point, she says she's - I can't remember the exact wording, but she feels like a person, a retarded person who's just smart enough to know she's retarded, or like one of those sea blobs that's heaved up on the shore, and their poorly developed flippers won't help them get back in the water.",

        "What is at work in \"\"Mirrorball\"\"?",
        "Well, sorry to disagree with you again, but I wouldn't say their souls are tormenting each other exclusively.",
        "His is barely aware of hers.",
        "He's somebody who's got a soul divided into two; and one of them is strong, and the other one is fragile and weak and locked up; and she's actually trying to help the locked-up one get out, and she succeeds in the end and does him a great service.",
        "Would you read a little bit from \"\"Mirrorball\"\"?",
        "(Reading) Between sleep and wakefulness, he remembered the soul of the girl he'd taken and thrown away.",
        "It was like you might suddenly remember something strange you'd done during a blackout drunk.",
        "There are a lot of black narratives on the stage that are not as risky as this one.",
        "He got up to look for it and, to his amazement, bumped into several others before he found it.",
        "It was clear what was called for.",
        "And yet as he looked at them, he realized he'd grown attached.",
        "He had to sit for some moments, just looking at them, but the intrepid soul attached to the brink of the girl who had knelt under the mirrorball that night didn't hang around.",
        "As soon as he released it, it made a beeline towards its proper owner, who was mercifully still asleep.",
        "The window of her heart was just opened enough for it to slip in.",
        "When you write, a lot of complexity arises when two people interact, and it makes the reader wonder what kind of impressions we leave on others that maybe we aren't aware of.",
        "I think that there's many layers of life happening at the same time; and to me this is just pure realism.",
        "There's a social reality, what's most apparent to us; the psychological reality, which is somewhat deeper but is also apparent to us; but I think there's mysterious forces at work through us that are going on all the time that we don't see or become aware of but that affect everything, and that story was an attempt to write about those unseen elements in life."

        "One is, the markets are very volatile at the moment, and the dollar is starting to decline, as many economists expected.",
        "And I think it's going to be important for the Bush administration to have a public figure who exudes confidence and competence at the Treasury.",
        "So managing the markets, managing the orderly decline of the dollar, that's an important job.",
        "Does the Treasury Secretary really have leverage to do that?",
        "Yes.",
        "For reasons that I've never been able to fully understand, the markets seem to care about what the Treasury Secretary says about the dollar, even though the Treasury Secretary rarely - at least these days - uses his power to buy and sell dollars on foreign exchange markets to influence its value."

        "But I think the second thing, and its related to the financial markets and the dollar, is will he manage to help both the White House and Congress come to a more sustainable budget policy?",
        "Neither Paul O'Neill nor John Snow seems to have had much influence on the Bush administration's fiscal policy.",
        "Both of them profess to worry about the deficit before they came to office, but were unable to do very much once they became Treasury Secretary.",
        "So it's, it'll be interesting to see if a Treasury Secretary from Wall Street -a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs - can help steer first the White House and then the Congress in the remaining years of the Bush term towards some kind of combination of tax increases and benefit cuts that puts the federal budget on a more sustainable course.",
        "So is the assumption on Wall Street that the White House needs to change course, and that Paulson might be the guy who could push them in a slightly different direction?",
        "I don't know what Wall Street is assuming, but its very hard for me to see any peaceful resolution of the budget wars in Washington without some change of course in the White House - at least an openness to talk about taxes in ways other than you just need to extend the president's tax cuts.",
        "I think that it does matter very much in the next six months what kind of relationship Mr. Paulson establishes inside the administration, because Congress isn't going to do anything of significance for the rest of this year before the election.",
        "This is all about what happens in the following two years.",
        "And it's very interesting to me that we now have Treasury Secretary from Goldman Sachs working with a new White House Chief of Staff, Josh Bolten, who was also a Goldman Sachs partner, and has also served as Budget Director.",
        "So I think there's a possibility that these two men may have had a conversation and talked about what strategy to go forward for the next couple of years.",

        "The vintage guitar market has been on a steady incline for the past 20 years and it is now to the point where only the wealthiest working musicians can afford to own and play these desirable instruments.",
