        "So I just educated myself and knew that I wanted better.",

        "Well, I had the opportunity to be released on a work release program, which actually gave me 30 days to find a job.",
        "But because I've had values that were instilled in me as a child, I had a few jobs.",
        "But a lot of people that are coming out of the system have never had employment, except the employment that they were given while incarcerated.",

        "That's correct.",

        "What's the worst or toughest thing that you've heard from someone you're working with in terms of giving up or being hostile to the whole idea that they can have a life after prison?",
        "From what their life has shown them, they don't really see how that's even possible.",
        "Like if you grew up in poor neighborhoods and all you've seen was negativity and your mother and father, their relationship didn't work and your relationship with your significant other isn't working, you really don't have a sense of hope.",
        "So in my position I can actually give them a sense of hope because I'm actually living the life that I want to live.",

        "They know me when I was a gang leader and a drug dealer, and they actually see my transformation and they seen how hard it was for me to actually live a good, successful life without any negativity.",

        "I just know that if I stay, you know, if I stay going down the path that I'm going, everything will be okay.",

        "Well, I think it was interesting in context.",
        "Of course the Japanese have for the last 18 months or so now been at the end of a number of missile tests by the North Koreans.",
        "None of them have gone over Japanese territory.",
        "Right.",
        "But many of them have fallen in Japanese - the exclusive economic zone in the waters just offshore.",
        "But I think the context is of course we've just had this rhetorical exchange between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, that has really elevated the anxieties in the region.",
        "And I think it looked for a moment like Kim Jong Un had stepped back from his threat to send missiles to Guam.",
        "But now he's back at it.",
        "And he's done it in a slightly different trajectory, but he's done it over and into Japanese airspace.",
        "How do you think Japan will respond?",
        "So the Japanese, as you know, have a defensive military posture.",
        "They have issued offensive weapons in the postwar period, largely a legacy of World War II.",
        "They have a constitution of course that says their military forces are only for self-defense.",
        "And the government has been pretty consistent in interpreting that document that way.",
        "Nonetheless, the ballistic missile threat from North Korea has prompted the Japanese to develop a fairly sophisticated ballistic missile defense system along with the United States.",
        "So we are deeply integrated with the Japanese military out there.",
        "And I think the question is, when would the Japanese use that system?",
        "And the prime minister has been very clear that if the security of the Japanese people or Japanese territory is threatened, then the Japanese will respond.",
        "So this morning, we're a little bit on the edge of that, right?",
        "There was no warhead on the missile.",
        "Right.",

        "I think there's going to be an enhancement of their ballistic missile defense system given the accelerated testing of these missiles.",
        "But I think there's also a debate that's about to emerge in Japan about - perhaps it's time for Japan to get its own missiles to have an offensive capability so that North Korea won't make a mistake and misjudge the Japanese willingness to respond to the use of force against them.",
