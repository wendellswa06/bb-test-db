        "So a lot of those dishes that are based on something that can be stored really well through winter like, for example, the dried peas for the split pea soup, they are actually dishes that you can find, if not in the whole region, at least in parts of it.",
        "You know, I can't delay asking you about the blood pancakes with smoked reindeer fat.",
        "So that particular recipe - it's one that comes from the semi-nomadic Sami culture, but blood used in food is quite common.",
        "Yeah.",

        "It's also really a document of food culture.",
        "And I think that out of those 700 or something recipes that are in the book, there are probably at least 50 of them that I doubt that anyone is actually going to cook.",
        "But they're still really important because they explain something about food culture, you know."

        "Yeah.",
        "And then if you go up to where I grew up, a sandwich there would probably be more of a, you know, a piece of flatbread with a layer of butter and a layer of cheese on it that you would eat standing up.",

        "You take those two things together - trade war and TPP - and what the calculation from China is, well, we should be substituting for the United States.",
