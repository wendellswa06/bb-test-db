        "Is the Pope infallible?",
        "As of 1870, the Catholic Church decreed that on certain matters the Pope was infallible, yes.",
        "And what are those matters?",
        "Faith and morals is the phrase that's used.",
        "And this has been invoked very, very rarely by the Pope.",
        "In fact, only in 1950 when he declared that Mary was taken up into heaven body and soul.",
        "So infallibility is something that popes do not invoke very often at all.",

        "Wayne wins the prize.",
        "She's absolutely correct.",
        "Where did this idea of papal infallibility come from?",
        "Certainly in the early centuries of the church, there was a concern that papal teaching be taken very seriously.",
        "And the question was how do you describe that level of teaching?",
        "No one ever raised the question of infallibility until the 19th century.",
        "And then the question was with a certain amount of centralization of the church, how could the church be very clear about its teaching and how could the Pope be its spokesperson?",
        "And as I say, that only occurred in 1870.",
        "And it was a matter of making sure that the certain things the Pope would say would be taken very seriously by the faithful.",
        "So it was sort of fairly a recent term and a recent phenomenon.",
        "So that explains the content.",
        "I mean it seems ridiculous on its face that a man who used to be just an ordinary fellow and can change his mind over what to order for breakfast is all of a sudden regarded as infallible."
