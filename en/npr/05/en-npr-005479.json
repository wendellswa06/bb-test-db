        "So Benjamin Netanyahu will be there at the United Nations tomorrow, and he has been blunt as is his wont.",
        "Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu has certainly stressed how dangerous he feels Iranian threat is and he's - from his perspective.",
        "He is in the Middle East.",

        "His proximity to Iran is much closer.",
        "He views the Iranian nuclear issue with a greater degree of urgency just by his circumstances, geographical situation and so forth.",
        "And he feels Iran, particularly the rhetoric that's coming out of Iran, married to an increased capability in terms of nuclear science as an existential threat to his country.",
        "And I think you can count on him to emphasize those points.",
        "I think, from everything that you see in terms of his declarations that are becoming more emphatic, he seems to feel that time is even less of a commodity than President Obama does.",
        "So that's essentially the disharmony between these three powers.",
        "They all think they have - Iranians certainly think they have time.",
        "The president think time is running out for a diplomatic arrangement, and President Netanyahu feels that time perhaps has already ran out for such diplomatic niceties.",
        "He said that Iranians would be 90 percent of the way to a bomb in six to eight months.",
        "Yes.",
        "I think he's talking about further developments in, particularly, the Fordow underground facility because based upon the level of work that is being done on that facility, it can essentially be completed within that timeframe.",
        "Although I think that's still an optimistic timeframe.",
        "But so I think he's looking at the development of the Iranian nuclear infrastructure and completion of various installations and plants as leading to his timeline running out.",

        "One group called for a shutdown of the city.",
        "Baltimore's Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has admitted that police officers made mistakes in how they handled the arrest of Freddie Gray.",
        "He said officers should've provided medical attention immediately to Mr. Gray, who had asthma, and whose legs were visibly limp as he was taken into a police van.",
        "The commissioner said that he was also not buckled in with a seatbelt and that's a violation of department policy.",

        "And so, going back to issues having to do with Galileo and even Martin Luther and apologizing to the Orthodox Church - he's done that about ecumenical problems.",
        "He certainly did that in the year 2000 - his famous apology with regard to the Crusades and Inquisition.",
        "John Paul II led the way on that precisely because his argument is: unless you apologize and ask for forgiveness, you can't move on.",
        "Islam is a religion that does not have a hierarchical structure, as Roman Catholicism does, and so an apology that might be accepted by some Muslim authorities is not necessarily going to be accepted by others.",

        "They want to heal this.",
