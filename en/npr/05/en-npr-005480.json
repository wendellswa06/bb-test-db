        "We've now had a couple of developments that have caused traders to move in the other direction.",
        "The price is back up over 134 dollars a barrel.",

        "An Israeli official suggested that an attack on Iran against nuclear sites looks unavoidable.",
        "And then there was an analysis out from Morgan Stanley predicting that oil could hit 150 dollars a barrel by July 4th.",
        "That may become a self-fulfilling prophecy, actually, because analysts are now saying that that report is one of the reasons that crude prices have been surging today.",
        "And how about this analysis that the assets Americans hold are shrinking?",
        "Well, this is a new report from the Federal Reserve, and it shows that the net household worth declined by 1.7 trillion dollars during the first quarter of the year.",
        "A big part of that, of course, was the steep erosion in home values, but we really got pounded by the slump in the stock market early in the year.",
        "The good news is that the stock market has turned around for the most part.",
        "Overall, assets of most Americans still far outbalance the liabilities that we have.",
        "And the overall savings rate is up, even though most of us aren't earning a whole lot right now.",
        "That net worth figure you gave, this is an average and overall number that applies to everyone, or rather it doesn't apply to everyone.",
        "There would be some people who weren't in that figure.",
        "That's right.",
        "In fact, if you'll think of this in terms of overall distribution of wealth, the biggest part of this is controlled by the richest Americans.",
        "So you can figure that there are a lot of us out there with a net worth that's actually negative, as the millions-plus people who've had their homes foreclosed could tell you.",

        "What is it - is it the fact that he was born there?",
        "Why does that make him different from humans born on earth?",
        "Well, as originally conceived in 1938 by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the two people who created Superman, Krypton had a larger gravity than that of earth.",
        "So someone coming from Krypton to Earth, finding themselves in a much weaker gravity, could lift objects that are much heavier than what we can do on Earth, because their muscles and skeleton structure are adapted to a much heavier gravity.",
        "Originally, he couldn't move planets.",
        "He could lift a car over his head.",
        "He couldn't fly.",
        "He could leap great distances.",
        "Again, all because his muscles were adapted to a much larger gravity.",
        "Okay, so he couldn't fly initially, but he was able to, what, leap tall buildings?",
        "Leap tall buildings in a single bound, yes.",
        "All right, does he have to get a running start?",
        "In the comics, frequently he wouldn't.",
        "He would crouch down, his steely muscles would press against the ground, and thanks to Newton's Third Law of Motion, that for every action there is a reaction, when he pushes against the ground, the ground pushes back against him, lifting him up, up and away.",
        "Well, how fast would you have to be going, lifting up off the ground, so that as you slow down due to gravity you would still clear a tall building, say 660 feet?",
        "Your liftoff velocity off the ground has to be nearly 140 miles per hour.",
        "Can you explain his hearing?",
        "He has super hearing.",
        "His hearing is beyond super.",

        "He can hear things.",
        "There have been scenes in the comics where he's on the other side of the planet and he hears the crack of a gun and he flies at super speed and manages to catch the bullet.",
        "But the problem is that the sound from the gun emitted at the same time that the bullet leaves the muzzle and the sound travels at only, say, 1,100 feet per second, whereas the bullet is traveling at many thousand feet per second, and so by the time the sound reaches his ears, the bullet has already reached whatever target it was aimed at."

        "Well, I figuring that's how he stopped, you know, he got there before the bullet.",
        "Well, or maybe he'd hear - yeah, that could be.",
        "If he could somehow do that or had some sort of telepathy or some other power or somehow the sound is also creating electromagnetic radiation in some means that we don't understand and he's detecting that.",
        "Why does Kryptonite cause him to lose his powers?",
        "Kryptonite in the comic books is described as a mineral, radioactive remnants of his home planet, and just as radioactive remnants of Earth are harmful to us, Kryptonite is harmful to Superman.",
        "And also as he became more and more powerful in the 1960s, you needed some mechanism by which crooks could slow him down somewhat so the story wouldn't be over in a single page.",
