        "For example, people look up the word debate itself at the very beginning of debates and the word moderator.",
        "And sometimes I get feedback on Twitter - for example, people will say, you know, boy, I really feel sorry for the American public if they don't know what debate means.",
        "But I say something else.",
        "I say that curiosity is not ignorance.",
        "And what I mean by that is most of us as adults, when we go to the dictionary, we're looking for something subtle.",
        "We're looking for something deeper.",
        "We're looking for some - it could be the etymology, the word history of debate.",
        "It could be a simple question - does a debate need to be between two people, or is a moderator always a neutral party?",
        "You know, that kind of thing.",
        "In other words, there are kind of encyclopedic questions that can be answered in the dictionary as well.",
        "And I don't register a sort of signal of ignorance when we see the curiosity of the public.",
        "So you're saying that it doesn't necessarily mean that someone doesn't understand what the word debate means, but they're searching for some kind of greater contextual understanding of the word."
