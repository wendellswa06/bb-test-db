        "I've written a book, and it's based on a style like Roald Dahl.",
        "He wrote a book called \"\"Nifty Nursery Rhymes,\"\" and he changed the story of the Cinderella and Snow White to different endings.",
        "But he would use four-letter words that you probably wouldn't want little children reading.",
        "But I loved the humor.",
        "So I ended up writing a number of stories that kids under 90 could enjoy because you don't have to shield it from children.",
        "There's nothing sleazy in it but enough adult humor that keeps it fun.",
        "And the book got published.",
        "I see it's still available on Amazon and barnesandnoble.com and things, and yet no local bookstore will put it in the children's section.",
        "They'll - it's not for little children particularly.",
        "Or then they'll put it in poetry because it rhymes.",
        "But it's not dark like typical poetry might be.",
        "So sometimes it seems they'll pigeonhole your book based on the title or cover or what they presume it to be and then maybe market it in an area you wouldn't expect.",
        "And I wondered perhaps if you've suffered that or if you just don't give that a thought.",
        "Well, let me just tell you when I either got \"\"It's Me, Margaret,\"\" came out, I proudly - I was with my two little children, and I was in a bookstore.",
