        "I am a young writer from St. Augustine, and I'm in college and just recently had a baby and getting married and everything.",
        "And I really, as a child, looked to your books and found inspiration, and that's why I'm a writer today.",
        "And I was just wondering what kept you motivated in the beginning without the success, without the encouragement of others telling you, you know, what a great writer you were.",
        "I was just wondering how you sparked motivation within yourself, because I'm, you know, needing something to push forward with, as far as my writing career is concerned?",
        "It's all about your determination, I think, as much as anything.",
        "There are a lot of people with talent, but it's that determination.",
        "I mean, you know, I would cry when the rejections came in - the first couple of times, anyway - and I would go to sleep feeling down, and I - but I would wake up in the morning optimistic and saying, well, maybe they didn't like that one, but wait till they see what I'm going to do next.",
        "And I think you just have to keep going.",

        "Describe what happened.",
        "Well, she went into the Barnes and Noble, which is very well-stocked with all sorts of books, of course, and was overwhelmed and disappointed by the number of books with dark themes that she encountered.",
        "And it made her feel frustrated because as a parent, there wasn't anything that she felt that she could see, that she would want to endorse by putting on her daughter's bed, you know, as a welcome home present.",
        "And I have of course, since the piece has come out, in all the kerfuffle about it, I've heard from a lot of people who've reported similar experiences.",
        "You know, it is - the argument from the librarian community, as it were, is that people need to talk to their librarians.",
        "But of course, bookstores are there to sell books, and people - you know, many parents think they ought to be able to just pop in and find something.",
        "And what some parents find is more than they expected to find.",
        "More than what they expected to find, and you suggest that indeed this has gone a lot further than - well, the example we used is Judy Blume.",
        "Well, yeah, I think it's very - it's been very interesting to sort of look at the development of the young adult literature world over the last 40 years.",
        "As I - I pointed in out the original piece because I write of course for a general audience, not for an audience of booksellers or librarians or authors, that 40 years ago, there really wasn't any such thing as young adult literature.",
        "And how sick is too sick to go to work?",

        "The cartoonists at the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo have become targets of this week's attack, apparently because of their depictions of the prophet Muhammad.",

        "Thanks for having me.",
        "I've seen and heard conflicting things when it comes to Muslim sensibilities about depictions of Muhammad.",
        "You know, there's this sense that it's forbidden, but I know that I've seen historical depictions from, like, classical India showing the Prophet.",
        "So what are the rules?",
        "Well, there are no Koranic prohibitions against depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.",
        "And even among the six or so authorized schools of law, there's all kinds of disagreements about whether you can and how you can show the Prophet Muhammad.",
        "It's certainly a cultural taboo, but that taboo arose organically and through a long period of time, which is why, precisely as you say, the history of Islam teems with thousands and thousands of images of the Prophet Muhammad from his childhood, various scenes from his biography, all the way, really, to the end of his life.",
        "It's a very common thing that we see throughout Islam's history.",
        "If there are no fixed rules, can you explain the reaction to the Charlie Hebdo cartoons?",
        "Well, partly it has to do with the fact that these cultural taboos have become fixed in the minds of particularly Sunni Muslims who adhere to a puritanical, ultraorthodox brand of Islam.",
        "So, for them, any depiction of the Prophet Muhammad is insulting.",
        "But let's be clear.",
        "These weren't just depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.",
        "They were quite deliberately provocative images of the Prophet Muhammad.",
        "They were intended to provoke a kind of response, not a violent response, but a kind of negative response from Muslims in Europe.",
        "And in many ways, the editors of Charlie Hebdo would say, quite unapologetically, that the purpose of these images is to act as a kind of test for Europe's Muslims.",
        "Can you bear to have the Prophet Muhammad caricaturized in this way?",
        "If you can't, then you don't belong here.",
        "Reza, you and I roughly the same age, and I feel like I've seen a change in sensibilities and sensitivities over our lifetimes.",
        "I think back to the Salman Rushdie controversy in the late '80s.",
        "I had a Pakistani friend who said to me at the time, you can buy \"\"Dante's Inferno\"\" in Karachi, which has Muhammad in the eighth circle of hell with his entrails hanging, and they banned satanic verses.",
        "What's going on?",
        "I think that there is a fundamental source to what has become a kind of virus of radicalism across particularly the Sunni Muslim world.",
        "And that source is Saudi Arabia.",
        "We have to understand that what we are faced with is a ultraorthodox, puritanical strain of Islam that arose in the 18th century - the end of the 18th century in Saudi Arabia, often referred to as Wahhabism, and which became the official religion of the Saudi state in 1932.",
        "Over the last 25, 30 years or so, the Saudi government has spent somewhere along the lines of about $100 billion promoting this kind of puritanical strain of Islam across the world.",
        "And this Saudi Wahhabism is unique in that it takes this notion of iconoclastic behavior to its extreme.",
        "I mean, one of the first things the Wahhabis did when this movement began is they went around destroying any tomb or any sacred space in Saudi Arabia that was associated with the Prophet or his family.",
        "They even tried to destroy the Prophet's tomb itself in Medina.",
        "Now, $100 billon buys you a great deal of traction.",
        "I mean, at this point, there is really not a Muslim community anywhere in the world that has not been affected by this strain of Saudi puritanism.",
        "And it's created an enormous shift among Muslims towards this kind of Arabocentric, ultraorthodox, puritanical strain of Islam.",
        "Reza Aslan is a scholar of religion.",
        "His latest book is \"\"Zealot.\"\" It's a biography of Jesus Christ.",
