        "And so one of the things that I was describing in my piece was the way in which young adult literature has changed even, you know, in the lifetime of those of us who grew up, as you say, reading Judy Blume.",
        "It's - there's a lot more specificity, let us say.",
        "Dark things that were hinted at in the past or maybe lightly outlined, you know, are very often you'll find very, very detailed descriptions.",
        "And also language.",
        "You know, this is a constant back-and-forth between, I think probably the adult world and the child world as to what language is appropriate, you know, what expletives are tolerable or not.",
        "And it is a feature of a lot of young adult literature, clearly not all of it, that expletives are used with a freedom that they are not used in other parts of our culture.",
        "Haven't there always been authors who have continually, over the course of literary history, pushed the envelope.",
        "As new issues came to light, people felt the need to be explicit about issues like - well, it got controversial about masturbation all those years ago, and now of course it's self-mutilation and other dark things that if you don't address them, they stay in the closet, they're hard to talk about.",
        "Well, I don't know.",
        "I mean, I suppose it depends on what you think the purpose of literature is.",
        "If it's envelope-pushing, and if it's to - you know, if it's a measure of some kind of cultural expansion into ever darker places, then this won't obviously disturb you at all.",
        "I think you're absolutely right that, you know, authors and creative people have often pushed.",
        "Authors and creative people have often not pushed, as well, and brilliant literature has resulted from people exercising some restraint on what they write.",
        "Here's another point I think that it's important to make, and that is when we talk about young adult literature, we are still talking - except for the case of the 18, 17- and 18-year-olds, about children, and children going through perhaps a very tumultuous phase of their life but still, we custodial adults have a responsibility to think about, even if it's just to say I think about it, and I open the floodgates, to think about what our children are consuming, what is furnishing their minds."

        "You wrote an article, wittingly or unwittingly, that in my opinion grossly and negligently misrepresents the current culture of young adult books, and what happened that made me so mad was that you then put forth a claim that a big part of the problem were editors and publishers who had a coarse sensibility, or at least that's an idea that you threw out.",

        "And then suddenly in some ways - though I must say there are obviously exceptions to this, it's as though when you get to young adult books, you drop off a kind of cliff, and suddenly you are awash in dark topics, dark situations and dark depictions.",
