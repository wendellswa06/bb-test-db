        "Hi, thanks for taking my call.",
        "I'm a father of a 12-year-old boy, and the point that I wanted to make about books and the topic here is that as a parent, I feel more challenged to meet the needs of what he does encounter in the world around him and how he thinks about them.",
        "And, you know, when I was 12, I didn't consider some of the things that he asks me about and that he comes up with from school.",
        "And I'm wondering, for the author and the critic here, I mean, do you see this as being an equitable challenge that parents have to meet?",
        "And likewise, what's the point of putting the information in a book, per se, for kids to read if there's no backdrop for them to help them sort through what it is and what to do with that information they're reading?",
        "I myself do not adhere to that point of view.",
        "I think that adolescence is - that children are exposed probably to more media than they ever have been, and as a consequence of that, they're exposed to more ideas.",
        "They're certainly - I mean, our - this generation of teenagers is probably more affluent, as well.",
        "So they have the means to purchase things that would - that could bring some difficulty into their lives.",
        "But I don't think that - well, look, let me back up.",
        "I think that one of the arguments for taking care with books about some things like cutting is that even in the best - with the best of intentions, what can happen is, as I think you said, is that it can extend the boundaries of what teens think adolescence is about and for.",
        "There has been much research done in the instance of drug abuse and tobacco abuse.",
        "Researchers were puzzled for years.",
        "They couldn't understand why early childhood education about the horrors of drugs also seemed to correlate with greater drug use in adolescence.",
        "And of course the difficulty was, as was eventually discovered, is that when you educate children and expose them to, in this case, drug abuse, what you are - and tell them it's something that teenagers fall into - that you're giving them the meta-message that you expect them to engage in it.",
        "And I have heard from people, in fact some people who felt that these books - when I say these books, the books detailing more lurid practices and self-mutilation - that they were actually influential in reaffirming their feelings of torment and that in some cases they learned from the books how to pursue these things, you know, more - well, more efficiently, I guess.",
        "You know, again, I'm not saying that everybody who reads a book about cutting is going to turn into a cutter, but the more there is about it, the more there is of it in the culture, the more children hear about it, and, you know, children are young and malleable, and it's part of what makes them children.",
        "I did say it might make it more normal.",
        "I was quoting you, Meghan Cox Gurdon, it was not my thought.",
        "So forgive me for that.",
        "Lauren Myracle, does writing books about these things make them more normal and indeed more widespread?",
        "You know, my mind is so boggled.",
        "I have so many places to go with this.",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "Do books normalize dangerous behaviors?",
        "My answer would be people aren't dummies.",
        "Some are, but most aren't.",
        "Kids aren't, either.",
        "I think that kids are, again and again, not given enough credit for being smart and for being critical thinkers."

        "And kids aren't going to be fooled into thinking that beating a gay boy up and leaving him for dead, which is what happens in \"\"Shine,\"\" is a good idea because they read about it.",
        "Likewise, myself, I don't care what Goldilocks did.",
        "I'm not going into the house of three bears.",
        "I enjoyed Goldilocks' story, I'll tell it to my kids, but they don't seem to want to hang out with the bears, either.",
        "So does it normalize it?",
        "I think that Meghan's really interesting example of drug consumption going up and smoking consumption going up is a good one to look at because it's a correlation, and correlations are not cause and effects.",
        "For example, I remember when my kid - my husband and I had a nightlight in his room, and then we read this study.",
        "Oh my goodness, kids who have nightlights in their room turn out to need glasses.",
        "And so everybody took their nightlights out of the baby's rooms.",
        "And then the next year, they said oh, whoops, sorry, it turns out that it's really that kids who have parents who don't have good vision tends to put nightlights in their kids' rooms.",
        "So it was a correlation, not a cause and effect.",
        "So is it books talking about drugs, or the culture talking about smoking that makes more kids smoke?",
        "Or, could it be there's more access to smoke, there's more, you know, meth production?",
        "I don't think you can take a correlation and turn it into a cause-effect relationship.",
        "Michael, thanks very much for the phone call, appreciate it.",
        "Just let me say that was not my correlation.",

        "Totally.",

        "It's a correlation between - well, never mind.",
        "I wanted to read this email we have from Samantha(ph), which is again one person, one anecdote and certainly not necessarily a correlation: I'm a 23-year-old who has suffered from major depressive disorder since I was 13.",
        "I have been a cutter, and I'm a recovered anorexic.",
        "As a sick teenager, books about cutting and eating disorders did glamorize destructive habits and inspire me to engage in them.",
        "I saw them as methods to prove just how miserable I was and to find an identity for myself, albeit a disturbing one.",
        "I do believe writers intending to educate teens about these issues are doing good, but they are also inadvertently glamorizing them for teens whose thought processes are severely disrupted by mental illness.",
        "I hope my story lends credence to Ms. Gurdon's argument against disturbing YA fiction, which went largely unsupported by other listeners."

        "Many interesting points here.",
        "I would have to largely agree with Lauren that it is disrespectful to teens to feel that just reading a book about something will cause them to perhaps engage in those behaviors or normalize those behaviors.",
        "Also, I was bothered by the part that maybe teens are more affluent and are able to, you know, purchase items that bring them closer to issues.",
        "I've seen issues in teens, everything from suicide to sexuality issues to abuse issues, from all economic areas.",

        "I have teens who've been exposed to things who are a lot older and more mature than some 19-year-olds.",
        "It depends on the teen.",

        "I don't think that teenagers are kids.",
        "We can argue the 12-year-old point if you want to, but let's just leave them out of it for now.",

        "And, yes, we need to have loving boundaries, but that love can't stem from fear or ignorance.",
        "And teens need opportunities to reflect and think critically about their world.",
