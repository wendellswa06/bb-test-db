        "In 1977, the family of John Demjanjuk, a retired autoworker in Ohio, was astounded when he was accused of having been a guard, known as Ivan the Terrible, at a Nazi death camp in World War II.",
        "Demjanjuk was extradited to Israel to stand trial for war crimes, and so began a saga of legal battles that has lasted more than 30 years.",
        "The Demjanjuk conviction in Israel was overturned.",
        "He was later tried in Germany on other charges, and now at 91 is free while awaiting an appeal.",
        "The Demjanjuk case was considered the last of the Nazi war crimes trials, but this past week prosecutors in Germany said they were reopening hundreds of investigations in a last-ditch effort to prosecute remaining war criminals from World War II.",
        "Joining us to discuss this is historian Deborah Lipstadt, author of \"\"The Eichmann Trial\"\" and \"\"Denying the Holocaust.\"\" Deborah Lipstadt, welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you.",
        "It's a pleasure to be here.",
        "What's the central factor about the Demjanjuk case that has prosecutors thinking they can reopen more like it?",
        "Well, Germany has made a decision to be willing to prosecute Nazi guards, even if they don't have specific information that on Tuesday, May 24, 1943, John Demjanjuk shot a specific Jacob Fishman from Lviv.",
        "Before, they limited themselves to having to find specific information, which of course meant that most of the guards - people we knew clearly, according to multitudes of sources and records, participated in the killing process - couldn't be prosecuted because we didn't have the specific information.",
        "And now, Germany has decided to reinterpret the way it looks at the law.",
        "Now, prosecutors say they're reexamining hundreds of cases.",
        "And do we have a sense of how many people are still alive and would fit the bill and even be able to stand the trial?",
        "The number that I've heard is a couple of dozen at the most that will.",
        "But these were the guards who were at the pure death camps - places like Sobibor, places like Treblinka, Belzec, where the only thing done there - unlike an Auschwitz, where there was both work and death - was just the killing factories.",
        "Are there many people left who can serve as witnesses or help the investigation in other ways?",
        "Not very many.",
        "And, you know, it's hard for someone who today would be in their 80s or 90s themselves to look at someone who's 90 and say I know that person was there.",
        "But what we do have, we have identity cards.",
        "Some of these identity cards come with fingerprints.",
        "And people who acknowledge that they were guards but said I never killed anyone.",
        "But the Germans are now saying you were part of the killing process, and that's how they convicted Demjanjuk.",
        "Do I get the T-shirt?",
        "No.",
        "You know, most people run a normal fever.",
        "Anything less than a hundred, you probably consider that normal.",
        "Anything over a hundred, you want to start getting concerned with the flu.",
        "It's going to be something even higher like 102.",
        "You're going to feel so miserable you're not even going to think about going to work with the flu.",
        "But if you're below a hundred, you know, no reason not to stay away."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And what about the accompanying symptoms that we all, you know, identify with coughs - the coughs, the sneezes, the throat?",
        "All of those can be an indication of the cold, the flu, or even allergies.",
        "So those alone aren't going to tell you whether or not you should go to work.",
        "Sneezing, usually allergies could be a cold.",
        "The best indicator is, one, fever, and two, if you just feel miserable you're not going to be able to get anything done, why bother?",
        "And now, should you worry about whether you're going to infect your co-workers?",
        "Oh, absolutely, I mean, that's really the main reason for you to stay away from work especially if you work in close quarters.",
        "Now, if you're in a system at work where you're in pretty much in solitude where you're not going to be around others, the likelihood is less that you won't infect someone.",
        "But the biggest danger is that you would infect others, potentially others who might become even more ill than you are if they have something like asthma.",
        "We have an e-mail here from Christopher(ph) in Kansas City, Kansas.",
        "(Reading) Whether or not you're too sick to go to work is really dependent on your work environment.",
        "I used to work with cancer patients, some of whom were going to bone marrow transplant treatment.",
        "I was expressly forbidden from coming to work if I had so much as a sniffle.",
        "I've also been a corrections officer and was told there really wasn't any illness that should prevent me from coming to work because an assignment could be found that would work around any symptoms I might have.",
        "So the work environment in his case was very important.",
        "Yeah, I mean, certainly when you're working around cancer patients, their immune systems are a bit weakened or compromised.",
        "You definitely don't want to expose your yucky viruses to them.",
        "If they get a cold or particularly the flu, serious complications are much more likely, like even pneumonia.",
        "And, I mean, people don't realize it, but about 36,000 people a year even die from the flu.",
        "And now, we've all heard about absenteeism, there's something you write about called presenteeism, what's that?",
        "Right.",
        "So absenteeism is when we don't go to work because we're sick.",
        "Presenteeism is when we do go to work despite being sick.",
        "And you get there and you're just not very productive either because of the illness or potentially because of the medications that you're taking for the cold or the flu."

        "Yeah, the flu.",

        "You don't want to take those during the daytime because they will make almost everyone sleepy.",
        "And even, you know, you see commercials for like you do have cold head, it's just when you're taking these types of medications, they kind of make your head feel swimmy and your brain just isn't functioning at 100 percent.",
        "Now depending on the kind of job you have, if that's going to impact your level to produce whatever you're doing, then that's another reason to stay home.",
        "So I guess one question to ask yourself is not only how sick do I feel but how productive am I going to be today.",
