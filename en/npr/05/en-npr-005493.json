        "So knowing the name and that was something I learned early on, 25 years ago, when I first walked those projects, was to know everybody's name.",

        "What does your mom call you?",

        "But then gang members would come in and lift their shirt and say, you know, I want this one off, and it would be the name of their gang across their chest.",

        "So I discontinued that, but we did it for five years.",
