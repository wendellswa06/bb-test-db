        "Yeah, gangs are bastions of conditional love, and one of the ways to counteract it is to offer community, which will always trump gang, and that's what happens at Homeboy Industries.",

        "I used to think that it looked like this.",
        "And so yeah, I always ask gang members every day, when they come in, they're ready to start all over again, and you have to kind of, you know, talk to them about you can't wear that cap anymore, and different things, you know.",
        "Name one good thing that's come into your life because of your gang.",

        "Yeah, that's a story about a kid who had had been in prison for 10 years but had been so entrenched in gang life for 20, and he said: I spent the last 20 years building a reputation for myself, and now I regret that I even have one.",
