        "Law enforcement would take, you know, the sole credit for that, but that's preposterous because it's an enormously complex social dilemma, and it stands to reason it would require an enormous set of complex solutions and strategies.",
        "So in the past 20 years in L.A., you know, lots of people have done lots of things, from mentoring to after-school programs to Homeboy Industries.",
        "Do I think that's the reason why we've seen this decrease?",
        "Absolutely.",

        "People from all walks of life, rich kids, poor kids, the thing that we had in common was a terrible home life, and before you knew it, you know, when I was 19 years old, there were 30 of us living in a giant house together that we all pitched in, and at any given time maybe eight to 10 of us had a job.",
        "But we kind of formed this community, if you will, and a lot of it was based on the ideas of honor and of tolerance, and locally we're known as the Goof Troop, was what they called us, because we're just a bunch of social misfits, and we have, you know, American Indian, we have homosexuals, we have skinheads and neo-Nazis.",
