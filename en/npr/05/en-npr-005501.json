        "We know that the situation in Iraq is very grave.",
        "We know that the security situation is spinning out of control.",
        "We know there is no magical solution to Iraq's complex challenges and we know there is an urgent need for a new approach, a new American policy towards the country because there's a consensus in the United States and the international community including the Bush administration that the current American strategy has failed and it has failed dismally.",
        "One of the top recommendations in the report is to pull out most combat brigades in a year, by the first quarter of 2008.",
        "What effect will that have in Iraq and in the broader Arab world?",
        "Well I think it all depends on how the United States and the international community find ways and means to secure the peace in Iraq.",
        "Whether to engage Iraq's neighbors, whether to succeed in bringing the various Iraqi communities together.",
        "I fear that the main focus of the report is how to extract American forces from Iraq's killing fields rather than really finding solutions to Iraq's difficult problems.",

        "You know, even as the opt out movement has been running high, last spring in states like New York national polls reported that a majority of Americans don't support sitting kids out of mandated tests.",
        "And one important political change in the new federal law is that states no longer have to make test scores a central part of teacher evaluations.",
        "And it was this one issue, the linking of test scores to teacher evaluations, that really mobilized teacher unions in particular against tests.",
        "And so I think that even if the new law doesn't cut back on testing, it may have effectively neutralized some of the opposition to testing.",

        "So a couple of months ago, I decided seeing that no one else would get into the race to offer the American people a better choice, I decided to get in and try to do just that.",

        "He's defended Planned Parenthood, even in this election.",
        "And Donald Trump is not someone who can be trusted.",
        "This is a man who does not stand for anything other than himself, so the notion that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who are constitutional conservatives, I think, is a real stretch to put it mildly.",
