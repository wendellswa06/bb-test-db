        "NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details.",
        "Scientists have known for decades how to genetically engineer bacteria, plants, insects and other creatures, but this new approach is like a turbocharged version of genetic engineering.",
        "It's called a gene drive because it can drive a gene through an entire species really fast.",
        "James Collins of Arizona State University co-chaired the National Academy's panel that took a look at gene drives.",
        "It's powerful technology.",
        "So powerful that scientists think it could revolutionize genetics and let them do all sorts of things, like create mosquitoes that could wipe out malaria or Zika, engineer super crops that could feed the world, save endangered species.",
        "It's very exciting science.",
        "It's just fascinating science.",
        "But the panel also concluded the gene drives could be very dangerous.",
        "They could run amok, messing up ecosystems, wiping out species, accidentally at unleashing epidemics.",
        "So Collins' panel concluded it's way too soon to even think about letting any gene drive organisms loose.",
        "At this point, there is insufficient evidence available to support the release of gene drive modified organisms into the environment."

        "The National Academies hit a lot of right notes in terms of advice on the ethics and the ecological safety.",
        "But do we really have the right to even build something in the laboratory when a mistake could affect the lives of people outside the lab, without telling the people who might be affected?",

        "He worries gene drives could fall into the hands of terrorists who could use them to destroy crops or worse.",
        "For example, a lot of work on gene drives is for insects and the idea of weaponizing insects - say that rather than not carrying malaria, they do carry some kind of toxin, for example - would be a particularly scary outcome.",
