        "Were the slaves in any way compensated?",
        "We do know that slaves were paid some kind of compensations for some things they did; otherwise none of the slaves would have been able to buy their, say, their freedom.",
        "You know, there's a few cases where they did buy their own freedom, and which, of course, was to me an amazing fact in itself.",

        "And certainly in some instances, free blacks could read and write, and certainly the free blacks were paid.",
        "Now, when you speak of slaves being paid and receiving some sort of compensation, in some instances, not necessarily as they worked on the White House or the Capitol, some instances where slaves hired their time from their owner.",
        "In other words, they would go to their owner and say, look, someone wants to employ me down the road to cut wood.",
        "I'll cut that wood.",
        "They're going to pay me $15 a month, and I'll receive - the slave will receive $5 of that money, and certainly the owner would receive the remaining amount of the money.",
        "And in some areas, not necessarily in the capitol city, but in some areas, particularly in some of the areas in South Carolina and Georgia were the slaves were hired out, they were able to use the monies that they received, that they negotiated with the owner, to buy other properties.",
        "You know, maybe they would buy chickens; they would buy cows.",
        "And of course, in those areas, they would go and certainly purchase other things and make additional money, and then sometimes many of them, who may have did a lot of - variety of things, were able to accumulate enough monies to buy their freedom, of course.",
        "Buying themselves.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now, in terms of technical work on the White House, you know, most of the slaves, they did - they were bricklayers; they were carpenters; they worked in the quarries; they worked in the - a swamps where the trees where extracted to provide the joists for the White House.",
        "And some of them, no doubt, worked as, perhaps carvers.",
        "Now, they worked right alongside the whites, some of the professionals, the stonecutters and the carvers, and it wouldn't surprise me that they were doing some of that work as well.",
        "It's just like today, when you have people who apprentice that are doing work, that are working around the master carpenter or whatever, certainly they learn the techniques and the ways of doing the work.",
        "So, in a pinch, I'm sure, and not only in the pinch, when there were shortage of these types of people, certainly the slaves jumped in and did that work as well.",

        "And in the right-hand corner, they'll have the actual name of the owner who was actually receiving the pay for the work of these individuals.",
