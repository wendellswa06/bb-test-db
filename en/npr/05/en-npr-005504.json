        "Two of them are in Texas; one in Pennsylvania.",

        "They were overcrowded.",
        "There was a lack of nutrition and hygiene.",
        "There were even reports of children being forced to sleep standing up because they could find no room on a hard, concrete floor to lie down on.",
        "So the lawsuit, which was brought by the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, says that these detention centers are unlicensed and detrimental to the welfare of the children.",
        "What is the administration's argument then for keeping these family detention centers open if they're so bad?",
        "Lawyers for the administration say that these residential centers provide a key function in just keeping the family unit together in what they deem is safe and humane conditions, pending possible deportation proceedings.",
        "Many of the women are applying for asylum, and remember that language about keeping minors in the least restrictive environment possible.",
        "So they're releasing the unaccompanied minors, keeping mothers with children, and that's what the lawsuit is all about.",
        "And clearly, the court does not actually agree with that approach."
