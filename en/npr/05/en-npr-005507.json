        "And if you were to explain to us the most basic division about who's on which side of this referendum in Scotland, what would you say?",
        "Well, there are a couple of cleavages which Scots are breaking down on on that one.",
        "The most important one is obviously the party support that Scots have demonstrated in the past - the Scottish Nationalist Party - the SNP, which, as its name implies, is very much in favor of Scottish independence.",
        "And then we have the more English, mainstream, Westminster-based political parties - the conservatives which is led by David Cameron, the prime minister, which is against Scottish independence, the Labour Party which has also come out against independence and the liberal Democrats which has also come out against independence.",

        "They have got to actually show that he came within the context of the Espionage Act.",
        "And in my judgment, that's not an easy case to prove.",
        "That's because Assange could argue that he made the diplomatic cables public for a legitimate reason - to influence foreign policy.",
        "That would force prosecutors to show he acted instead to help America's enemies.",

        "That warning is a mechanism that was created in 2003 by congressional Republicans.",

        "Known as Part B, it covers doctor visits and other outpatient care.",
        "The warning is triggered when, for two years in a row, Part B is expected to exceed 45 percent of total Medicare spending within seven years.",
        "This year is the second year.",
        "As Leavitt noted at the press conference, the first action triggered by the warning comes from the White House.",
        "The warning requires that the president propose solutions to curb spending when he submits his 2009 budget.",

        "It's not really possible to get Medicare cost to grow financially lower rate than those of health care cost in general and still provide the kind of access to health care that Medicare beneficiaries have been promised.",
        "There's another reason Congress isn't likely to act on the funding warning.",
        "Robert Greenstein, who heads the Liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says Congress can't even bring itself to act on more minor funding recommendations made by its own Medicare expert advisors.",
        "Any member of Congress who makes a statement this week about Medicare in response to the trustee's report ought to be tracked all year long on how do they vote when the rubber meets the road, and their specific proposals to adopt their own commission's recommendations to save money and help Medicare's finances.",
        "Unfortunately, I think you'll see a number of them from both parties turning around and voting against those recommendations when the actual votes come.",
        "One of the suggestions those advisers made for this year is that Congress cut funding for private HMOs that offer coverage through Medicare, something those HMOs are lobbying heavily against.",
