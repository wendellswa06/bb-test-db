        "That's correct.",
        "President Bush managed to land a heavy for this third try at picking a treasury secretary.",
        "And this will be his debut performance.",
        "And I think people will be watching very closely to see whether he'll be a mouthpiece, if you will, for the Bush administration, or whether he will use this testimony to steer policy a little bit in some other direction.",

        "And they are the most interesting group.",
        "The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, has very much come out against Scottish independence.",
        "But a third of Labour supporters in Scotland do not appear to be following him.",
        "So which side wins this referendum may come down to the extent to which the Labour leadership is able to impart upon its supporters to stick with the Labour no position rather than fall in line with Alex Salmond and his Scottish National Party in favor of yes.",
        "Geographically, Glasgow - I gather the metropolitan area in Glasgow is 2.8 million.",
        "It's about a half of the population of the country or Edinburgh.",
        "Is one especially pro-independence and the other especially pro-remaining in the union?",
        "I think that possibly overstates the extent of the Glasgow population slightly.",
        "But it is true that Glasgow will have a dominant presence on this result.",
        "And it does seem that Glasgow is a center of the potential yes vote.",
        "Edinburgh I think is a little bit more Anglicized, perhaps more likely to go with a no vote.",
        "So they are very different cities in nature - Glasgow and Edinburgh.",
        "And there's a little bit of antipathy between the two - it has to be said sometimes.",

        "A minor one.",
        "Men do seem to be slightly more favorable towards independence than women.",
        "I think it breaks about 56-44 in favor of no among women.",
        "And it's split down the middle for men.",
        "In terms of income or class, is there a pretty neat breakdown between who favors independence and who's against?",
        "A slight one.",
        "The intellectual, slightly more affluent Scottish elites seem to believe more favorable towards Scotland remaining in the United Kingdom.",
        "It's the less affluent, poorer people who seem to have something more of a desire for independence for Scotland.",
        "An advocate of independence told me that he thought that if the nos win, it's the last time they'll win because so many elderly voters oppose independence, and that they won't be around in 15 years if there's another referendum on Scottish independence then.",
        "Is that true?",
        "Do you see an age difference?",
        "We do.",
        "It's very much the case that the oldest cohort of Scots - those aged 65 and over - are much less inclined to vote for Scottish independence.",
        "It breaks down about 65 percent, 70 percent for no."

        "They do seem to be breaking down in favor of no. They've got an antipathy to Edinburgh political power elites as much as they do to Westminster ones.",

        "And what would be a policy where he would be pushing the administration, nudging them a little bit?",
        "The most interesting, and I think, dangerous, place for him to go is the budget deficit itself.",

        "In order to get the Democrats to the table to actually discuss restraining spending on social security or Medicare, most people, and I'm one of them, think he'll somehow have to put taxes on the table.",
        "So one thing I‘ll be listening for is will Mr. Paulson indicate a willingness to at least listen to the possibility that the only way to get a grand compromise on the deficit is to be wiling to at least entertain tax increases of some sort.",
        "And when you say tax increases, would that mean just letting some of the current tax cuts during the Bush administration expire over the next few years, or actively raising taxes?",
        "Well, one way, is to let the tax cuts expire.",
        "I doubt that the President is ready to do that.",
        "Another way is to change parts of the tax code in ways that bring in more revenue than is now projected.",
