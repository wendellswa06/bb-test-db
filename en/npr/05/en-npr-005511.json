        "America is full of religious groups that are testing the boundaries of what is possible to believe — much of which will have a very ephemeral lifespan and will fade from the scene because it's without substance.",
        "On the whole, Lawrence looks askance at impersonal prayers for passing motorists.",
        "Tossing out words to God as if I want to pray for the guy in the semi with a Louisiana license plate on it is not anything close to the encounter where somebody engages in what I know has been practiced in many places - truck stop ministries.",
        "Yet roadside supplication is not all they do, Heartland World Ministries - the church at the center of Light of Highway - sends prayer teams into jails, malls, well-to-do neighborhoods and Dallas' gay bar district.",
