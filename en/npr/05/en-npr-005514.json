        "And when you discovered these pictures of Josef Mengele, these are in and of themselves important.",
        "Yes.",
        "These are, as far as we know, the only photographs of Mengele taken at the camp.",
        "Not only is he in uniform, he's surrounded by, in one photograph, the commandant and the ex-commandant.",
        "The current commandant, who - his name was Richard Baer and he was Karl Hocker's superior officer, Hocker worked for him.",
        "Standing next to him is Rudolf Hoess, who was the former commandant of the camp, brought back specifically to oversee the Hungarian arrivals.",
        "He was such a specialist in mass murder that they brought him back to help.",

        "Resolve their Jewish problem.",
        "Yeah.",
        "…yeah, yeah.",

        "And let's get John(ph) on the line.",
        "John's calling us from Dayton, Ohio.",
        "Hi there.",
        "I was just wondering if - since we know that the German people are now very well integrated in the modern society and are not a violent people anymore than anyone else is, do these kind of photographs show that any kind of society can be turned to such dark deeds through, you know, the right kind of charismatic leader or the right kind of a rhetoric that causes them to throw aside their shared humanity even with another people?",
        "I think they do and I think that's a very perceptive question.",
        "There are photographs in here of Karl Hocker shaking hands with his dog, showing his dog how to sit.",
        "These are things that I do with my dog.",
        "There are things that everyone does and it really shows that - I'm trying to figure out how to phrase this.",
        "It shows, again, the banality of evil - that they went home and did the sorts of things that we did.",
        "But their society had gotten to a place where they found it morally acceptable to kill massive amounts of people simply for the way they were born.",
        "Well, I think that maybe the most important thing - just my opinion again - is that it's not necessarily that evil is some highly archaic thing you can always identify but rather it's the fact that they lost their appreciation for their shared humanity, and they could look at these people who were clearly just like them and would have the same moments of sharing with their dogs or pets but could somehow perceive that they didn't share the same kind of - you could call it soul or brotherhood for the lack of a better word.",
        "It's also - and it's a very good point, John, but it's - as you were talking about earlier, Rebecca - it's the ability to compartmentalize.",
        "For example, those young women with the bowls of blueberries, did they know what was going on at that death camp?",
        "Oh, absolutely, they did.",
        "They were in charge of the teletypes that went from the camp to Berlin, and we know some of what those teletypes said.",
        "It included, this is the number of the transport that came in, these are the people who were on it, and these are the people who were selected to work.",
        "And these are the number of people who were not selected to work.",
        "This is what they did during the day.",
        "And so I don't think you could defend the fact that they did not know what was going on.",
        "They had to have."

        "A very interesting - again, none of this discussion, you know, gives any sort of approval to what the events that occurred but it is important to recognize that we're all human beings.",
        "Yeah.",
        "No.",
        "And one of the most important things that we want to reiterate is that you need to see this album within the context of the Holocaust and within in the context of Auschwitz.",
        "If you just look at it by itself, it's a vacation album.",
        "But in the context of other photographs that we have and what we know was going on, it shows the evil, the absolute evil that human beings can get to.",
        "And your Web site, in fact, they are contrasted with that other, the so-called Auschwitz album, which showed those Hungarian Jews, that are out there.",
        "Yes.",
        "And there's actually a Web feature in which you can flip through the album yourself.",
        "It's at the museum's Web site at www…",

        "After that camp was liberated, they escaped.",
        "Karl Hocker was caught into a British POW camp until 1946 and then resumed his daily life.",
        "He was a banker, became a banker again and lived happily until 1963, when he was picked up as part of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trial.",

        "But one of major lessons I've taken from it is where it actually happened, and that it happened in Germany, which was a highly civilized society and, you know, in context, they had the Bauhaus movement, they had jazz, they had a very liberal society.",
        "And the lesson is that it happened there so we've always got to be on guard for it because it can happen.",
