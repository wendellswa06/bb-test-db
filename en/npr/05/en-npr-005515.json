        "Is there a concern of normalizing these individuals?",
        "There really is and that's why we've tried to be so careful to put it in the context of the other photographic album and to make sure that people understand it that this was happening at Auschwitz, make sure that people know what was going on at the camp at the time that these photographs were taken.",
        "As we've stated before, just flipping through it, it makes them seem normal, it makes them seem like your next-door neighbor.",
        "And they were and they weren't because as we have spoken, they were human beings but they were also human beings who are perpetrating the greatest crime of the 20th century.",

        "And Gaza last weekend had its deadliest day in years.",
        "And so when you, sort of, look at the facts on the ground, as we like to call them, the trends are going in a very negative direction and the peace talks have been really slugging along very slowly.",
        "And I think that as the sense that the process is going nowhere grows, you are going to see more and more frustration on the ground.",

        "Certainly Hamas has spoken in favor of it.",
        "What effect could that have on Hamas being included on talks between Israel and other parties?",
        "Well I don't think anybody's likely to include Hamas in the talks even if they don't claim responsibility.",
        "Ultimately the Israeli government is fairly adamant, and I think the United States government is as well, that if they include Hamas in talks or open talks with Hamas on cease-fire, it would undermine their efforts to negotiate a deal with Abu Mazen - President Mahmoud Abbas - who is basically is, you know, the moderate leader in the region.",
        "So even on the smaller issue of a cease-fire in Gaza, there's really not a lot of momentum there.",
        "Thousands of people turned out in Jerusalem for the funerals of the seminary students.",
        "So I wonder if I could get you to talk about that.",
        "I'd say it was a fairly stunning attack for Jerusalem.",
        "It is the first kind of attack like this in more than four years.",
        "And there was sort of a growing sense in Jerusalem that, you know, maybe these kind of attacks have passed in the last year or so, especially you have sort of a return of life on the streets here; cafes and restaurants, people sitting outside in a way that you, you know, not have seen at all during the Second Intifada.",
        "Okay.",
