        "It's possible they've read his autobiography, \"\"The Education of Henry Adams,\"\" or his novel, \"\"Democracy.\"\" But they may be less familiar with Adams as an historian, and it's unlikely that most Americans ever made it through Adams' nine-volume history of the years spanning the administrations of Thomas Jefferson and John Madison.",
        "That history is the subject of Gary Wills' new book, \"\"Henry Adams and the Making of America.\"\" Wills, who has written on everything from Richard Nixon to the pope, has never been afraid to challenge conventional wisdom on anything.",
        "In this book, he refutes the accepted reading of Adams' history as an attack on Jefferson.",
        "His own thesis provides interesting insights into our national history which still resonate in the politics of today.",

        "So a non-exhaustive list of some of the stuff that's come out in the past week - you have, first of all, former vice president Joe Biden - he put out a criminal justice overhaul plan.",
        "Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar put out a plan to increase access to affordable housing.",

        "That issue came up in the first debate a few weeks ago.",
        "What's he proposing?",
        "So his plan is pretty sweeping and includes gun control measures, and he calls for the end to the federal death penalty.",
        "But there's one big, overarching aspect of it - this grant program intended to incentivize states to incarcerate people less and rehabilitate people more.",
        "Broad strokes, he says he's looking to shrink the incarcerated population.",
        "Now, his plan has drawn some criticism, maybe most loudly from New Jersey senator Cory Booker, who is himself running for president.",
        "He called Biden's plan, quote, \"\"inadequate.\"\" And he also said that it doesn't go far enough - that, for example, it should make more use of the president's clemency powers, that it should legalize marijuana instead of simply decriminalizing it.",
        "But also, very pointedly, Booker called Biden, quote, \"\"an architect of mass incarceration\"\" - this really big insult that he lobbed at him.",
        "Now, that strong words there.",
        "Yes.",
        "Yes.",
        "And it's a reference to the 1994 crime bill, which critics and some experts say contributed to mass incarceration of African American men in America.",
        "So one thing that we are seeing here - it's an ongoing dynamic in this race - is that, on the one hand, Joe Biden uses his long resume, his long political career to his benefit on the trail.",
        "He uses it as a way of saying, look - I'm qualified to do this.",
        "But on the other hand, that long career means that his opponents have found a lot of past Biden positions and actions that they are weaponizing against him."
