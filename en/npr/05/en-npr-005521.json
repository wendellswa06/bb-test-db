        "I was surprised to read that portrayal of Abigail, because she's had something of a renaissance, I think, lately, and has quite a few fans out there.",
        "And this was a more negative portrayal of her.",
        "Decidedly.",
        "She was a terrific wife.",
        "She was really wonderful.",
        "She supported John in all kinds of ways.",
        "But she told her children and her grandchildren, `You've got to live up to your father,' and she told John Quincy, for instance, when he was coming home as a boy from Europe, `If you have been corrupted by Europe, I hope the ship bringing you back home will sink and you will not reach America.",
        "That was the kind of mother and grandmother she was.",
        "And as a mother-in-law, she was certainly as bad.",
        "And Henry believed that, and so much so that he had written out, in his own hand, a compilation of the diaries of Louisa, and he was going to publish them as his first published work.",
        "That would have destroyed his father, to say that `Your mother called your father this oppressive tyrant.",
        "So he didn't do that.",
        "On the other hand, he did not at all thing that the Federalists in general, and the Adamses in particular, were very good for America.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Now...",
        "Now the strange thing is that it is doctrine in the historical profession to think that he did say that, that he did admire his ancestors and he did want to defend them against Jefferson in the history.",
        "How that can be is one of the great scandals, to me, of intellectual history in America.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Why do you feel it is so important to look at these nine volumes again, this history of the presidencies of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison--to write an entire book about it, for that matter?",
        "Well, for a lot of reasons.",
        "It's, I think, the greatest historical work in our history.",
        "I think it's the greatest prose masterpiece of non-fiction in America in the 19th century.",
        "It is also a book that the making of it--the story of the making of it is fascinating.",
        "Adams, from a very early age, wanted to write a great historical work.",
        "He took as his model Gibbon's \"\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\"\" And so he had planned to do some big, big project.",
        "Well, why would he have chosen just 16 years of American history for this big project and prepared for it so well, done all of the groundwork for over a decade, worked writing it for over a decade?",
        "He did that because he thought America, under the Federalists, had receded into a sectionalized, sluggish, intellectually indolent country, and the Republicans woke America up, shook it out of its doldrums, gave it a national vision, gave it a westward vision, gave it an international engagement.",
        "Much of this was done almost against their own will, but nonetheless, they had the vision and the practical tinkering ability to make it work.",
        "So he begins the nine volumes with six chapters describing how terrible America was in 1800.",
        "Unfortunately, a lot of people read that and think that's a description of the whole work.",
        "But he ends the nine volumes with four chapters at the end saying it was a totally different country by then.",
        "It was intellectually adventurous.",
        "It was religiously more tolerant.",
        "It had a great interest in science and engineering.",
        "It had forged a whole new generation of leaders in the War of 1812 who would now take over the political leadership of the country.",
        "So that--this was a period that he chose carefully precisely to talk about the mechanics, the dynamics of social change.",
        "What brought about this change?",
        "It was a change that went very deep, demographically, economically, in intellectual ways, in art, in aesthetics.",
        "How did it happen that a president that promised to decentralize government came in and that the Jeffersonians then advanced both nationalism and internationalism in this country?"

        "Well, they had to, in the sense that they had a regional base, the slave culture of the South, and they had to create a larger coalition or they couldn't hold power.",
        "And in creating that larger coalition, they had to bring in first Pennsylvania, then New York, and they had to force themselves out of their own regional preconceptions, something that the Federalists were unable to do.",
        "They had the idea that New England had a monopoly on the intellectual capital of America, and there was no reason to go outside it and to try to create broader coalitions.",
        "And, Ed, first of all, tell us what happened at this Shiite shrine and how heavy the damage was.",
        "Thank you for having us.",
        "Also, of course, Jefferson needed Florida.",
        "His Southern people wanted an outlet through Mobile and other places.",
        "And so he went over to Napoleon and said, `I've got to have Florida,' and Napoleon said, `Well, you can't have that, but you can have Louisiana.",
        "So all of a sudden, this huge tract was opened up in the West, and in order to cope with that, Jefferson had to create very strong central powers.",
        "He appointed the governor, the Legislature, the judiciary in this vast area out there.",
        "He had no choice but to use powers that he had criticized and condemned when the Federalists used them.",
        "And then, of course, Madison got pushed, pushed, pushed into conflict with England, and the War of 1812 took place.",
        "And again, you had to have a centralizing of communications, transportation, logistics, supplies.",
        "All of those were nationalizing efforts that they couldn't avoid.",
        "And they didn't--they couldn't really avoid it on principle, because they did have an idea that this should be one nation, which the Federalists never had.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Let's talk--can you talk about that a little bit?",
        "Yes.",
        "One of the great things about Adams is that he sees the whole world, that America is not simply separated from Europe or from the rest of the world in general.",
        "He had traveled.",
        "He had worked in Europe.",
        "He had done lots of research in Europe.",
        "And so he was very aware of the fact that the two giants of the age, in his eyes, were Napoleon and Jefferson, and they were fencing all through this period.",
        "Napoleon knew that Jefferson desperately wanted Florida.",
        "There was then two Floridas, East and West.",
        "And he kept promising, `Well, you can have it if you do this,' `You can have it if you do that.",
        "And Jefferson would say, `OK, OK,' and then Napoleon would pull it back.",
        "And so there was this kind of constant tension between them.",
        "And then, when Madison came in, Napoleon played the trade game against England, trying to force America into war with England, and he succeeded.",
        "So, in a way, he was always a step ahead of the Jeffersonians and Madisonians.",
        "On the other hand, he'd failed because Toussaint L'Ouverture in Haiti broke his attempt to move into the Caribbean.",
        "And one of the great things about Adams...",

        "If you'd like to just continue your train of thought...",
        "Well, I was going to say that Toussaint L'Ouverture, the great black leader of the rebellion in Haiti, frustrated Napoleon's designs.",
        "And one of the great things about Adams is that he realizes how much America benefited from the actions of other people that were outside our control.",
        "Toussaint was one.",
        "The Spanish people who were frustrating Napoleon was another.",
        "And Tecumseh was one, who didn't really frustrate our designs but is one of his great heroes.",
        "Two of the most important figures in the history are Toussaint L'Ouverture and the Native American leader Tecumseh.",
        "He was such a great warrior on the side of the British in the War of 1812 that Adams admires him immensely and describes him with great skill.",
        "One of the things that's interesting about the book is that Adams, though he was not a warrior himself, vastly admires military leaders, and especially naval heroes.",
        "He describes the professionalism of the American seaman and of our naval architects.",
        "We were building the best ships in the world in this period.",
        "Joshua Humphries, the naval architect who designed the frigates under George Washington, designed boats that were considered miraculous.",

        "We've got to have a ship of the line, at least, to fight one of these things.'",
        "And so one of the thrills of the book is the description of the feats of some of the naval leaders during the War of 1812.",
        "He had planned to do only eight volumes.",
        "It was all symmetrically arranged.",
        "There would be four for Jefferson, two for each of his terms; four for Madison, two for each of his terms.",
        "But the War of 1812 took so much coverage that he had to add a ninth volume to the Madison, so it would be five of Madison.",
        "And it's really pioneering military history.",
        "He'd prepared for it when he was his father's secretary during the Civil War in London.",
        "His father was our emissary to London.",
        "And he studied the kinds of law of the sea, logistical supply, things of that sort, to inform his father on these matters, and it made him one of the earliest people to understand the economic substrate of war.",
        "Admiral Mahan was just coming out with his naval histories, and Adams anticipated many of his findings and was clever at using things like the Admiralty Court decisions on engagements, which involved insurance costs.",
        "And so you could estimate what was the exact cost of every engagement and how much an underdog prevailed and that kind of thing.",
        "So all of that goes into the history.",
        "As I say, he would prepare so thoroughly.",
        "He taught history at Harvard and studied historical method there.",
        "He set up the first graduate seminar.",
        "He graduated the first doctoral graduates.",
        "And then he edited the North American Review, in which he edited and wrote himself many, many reviews of historical things connected with this.",
        "And then he gave both up to devote himself to this project.",
        "Interestingly, though, you mention in the book that he's mostly taught in English departments at this point, not so much thought of as an historian.",
        "I went through a list of four-letter names and just thought - you know, I was trying different combinations, and I just thought of, you know, popular culture."
