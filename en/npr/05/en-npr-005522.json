        "Thanks so much for your call, Tom.",
        "The attack took place at around seven o'clock this morning from the information we've gathered.",
        "And it looks like insurgents who were dressed as police commandos went into the shrine area, handcuffed and tied up several shrine guards, and they proceeded to place explosives around the shrine.",
        "I wanted to ask you, with regard to the book, some of the sort of insights that you have that sort of resonate in today's political situation.",
        "You say there's a tendency that all Americans tend to think that you have to fall into two sort of different ideologies that have their roots in the thinking of either Jefferson or Hamilton, but that Adams shows in this book that that was really never the case, that our history is more complex than that.",
        "I wonder if you could expand on that idea a little bit.",
        "Yes.",
        "Well, it was almost the case before the Jeffersonians took over.",
        "There was certainly a Federalist and Republican divide.",
        "But in the course of reacting to reality, the Jeffersonians broke out of that, and it was not that they went back to federalism when they set up a more powerful central government; it's that they went into a different plane of action.",
        "And one of the things that is fascinating about the book is the play of irony.",
        "Adams had Tolstoy's \"\"War and Peace.\"\" I can't prove that he read it because he didn't mark the margins.",
        "The pages are cut--you know, the three-volume set that he had, which I looked at at the Massachusetts Historical Society.",
        "But both Tolstoy and Adams are very good at saying `the great man theory' and `the ideological theory' and all these things are wrong because the ironies of history overtake you and push you in all kinds of directions you didn't expect to go and that...",
        "Let me just remind our listeners that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "And in order to survive to float on the floods of history, you have to flop around and come up with new things.",
        "That can happen tragically, which is what Tolstoy describes happening to Napoleon, or it can happen benignly, which is what he describes--he says that Jefferson and Madison were involved in a comedy of errors.",
        "They didn't know what they were doing, but it turned out well.",
        "He says you have to have a light touch, a beau marche(ph) touch, when you're dealing with them because they kept trying to do things wrong and they kept doing things right.",
        "It's a wonderfully ironic reading.",
        "And that's one of the great things about it.",
        "This play of wit, of sparkling wit through the whole nine volumes is just magnificent.",
        "There's an e-mail here that sort of also gets to this point from Dunken in Kentucky.",
        "He says, `I've been telling my kids that all of American history is a titanic struggle between Jefferson and Hamilton.",
        "I still think that's true, but I'm not sure who's carrying the ball for Jefferson these days.",
        "I suspect you'll agree that your paraphrase of Adams' description of federalist America sounded a lot like the country today.",
        "Where, if anywhere, would you look for a rebirth of democracy?'",
        "Well, our problems are quite different.",
        "We have an economic pressure on our democracy that's very hard to break--that is, it's so expensive to run for office with television ads, etc., and the lobbyists are so important to the financing of this that we have people who are ideologically for a decentralized government, but actually have to supply the needs of the lobbyists who want more and more money, more and more activity.",
        "So ideologically it's very hard to read America now.",
        "Is it conservative to have the lobbyists in such power?",
        "I don't see how that can be?",
        "On the other hand, the opposition is almost equally shackled by these economic needs."

        "The kind of national debt we're building up and the kind of expenditures by the central government are really staggering, and they go against the ideology of both parties.",
        "And I don't know exactly how that's going to be solvable.",
        "I'm curious.",
        "Do you think that the Adams history should be read by most Americans or mainly do you want it reread and rethought by historians?",
        "No, I think most Americans because--you don't have to read all nine volumes.",
        "That's one of the problems; that's kind of daunting.",
        "But read anywhere in it.",
        "It's just a good story.",

        "If I were going to say for the ordinary reader where should you begin, I would say begin with the last volume, with the last part of the War of 1812.",
        "Skip right to the end, you're saying.",
        "And then I hope you'll fall in love with it and read around in other ways.",
        "As I say, I think it's the prose masterpiece of the 19th century.",
        "Well, thanks...",
        "If you're going to read \"\"Moby Dick\"\" this is a much better story.",
