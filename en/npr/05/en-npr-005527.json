        "And even in the '90s, folks were disenchanted with this health care in America for a lot of reasons, primarily because of the - what I would term the impersonalization of care.",
        "And there was - there were probably a lot of reasons for that, and we probably don't have time to go into all of those, but I think that, you know, our focus here was to sort of search for a way to bring that back and to really return to those human interactions that are so important in terms of enhancing communication and care coordination and all of those things that I think many of the folks that are in health care, those are the reasons that they got into health care was to do good by patients and to care for patients.",
        "And when you talk about the impersonalization of care, it goes from, well, seemingly small things that turn into big things.",
        "The patients are treated almost as if they're invisible.",
        "Well, I think that that - and again I think part of the reason, not necessarily the reason for that, but, you know, part of things - some of the things that we did to try to remedy that was to as we began to roll out our patient-focused-care model here at Fauquier Health, we focused on making sure that the caregivers, literally all of the employees within the health system, understood what it was like to be a patient and understood the helplessness that some patients may feel as a result of not being listened to.",
        "You know, during that time, we conducted retreats for the whole staff to try to change the culture, if you will, and the attitude of the staff towards patients, and I'm not saying that, you know, the entire staff was thinking that way, but in order to get consistency and to - I mean, our objective was to make sure that every patient had a consistent experience as they were here.",
        "You know, we had to - everybody had to understand what it's like to be - to feel this helplessness.",
        "I mean, there were, during these sessions, there were experiential, you know, exercises that we conducted with employees in terms of doing such things as a blind man's walk or having employees feed one another and let them sort of understand what it was like to perhaps have a stroke and someone having someone feed you for the first time in 60 or 70 years, you know, since you were an infant, which you probably didn't remember.",
        "But - and, you know, the whole idea behind the (unintelligible) model of patient-focused care is to really personalize the care, humanize it and demystify it.",
        "I mean, many folks don't necessarily come to hospitals on a regular basis unless they have some sort of a chronic condition.",

        "It really is sort of a different atmosphere than at a lot of other hospitals I've been to.",

        "Sometimes they may go to a rehab center as - or a step-down unit of some sort, but they're still going to need some care once they leave the facility.",
