        "No, but I was going to say you're a smart guy, because I don't think anybody's clear.",
        "Look, I think it comes down to this, if you listen to Robert Gibbs, the president - the White House press secretary.",
        "He said, basically, look, the president in his heart of hearts really likes the public option but he's willing to negotiate, he's willing to hear what other people have to say.",
        "And what we've heard from some conservative Democrats, notably Kent Conrad, who's an important Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, is he doesn't think the votes are there for the public option and he is supporting the idea of cooperatives, which might have some of the same ability to provide competition for insurance companies and force them to do better in terms of not excluding people with preexisting conditions, portability, if you shift jobs and the like.",
        "But what's the political effect when the president refers to the public option as, I think, what was the phrase, just a sliver?",
        "Just a sliver.",
        "Well, he says it's just part of - again, he's in negotiation mood and the impact was that it set off the left; Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, initially saying I've got to have a public option.",
        "Everybody down the line - Chris Dodd in the Senate, who is on another Senate committee that was instrumental in crafting some health care legislation here, said, you know what, without the public option, you don't have health care reform.",
        "Howard Dean, others, everybody's saying this.",
        "So the left gets energized and angered, and suddenly the president, who needs to make sure that he doesn't lose support among Democrats, finds that he's now threatened even from his own party on having any success with health care legislation, his number one domestic priority.",
        "Well, it raises this question: a number of prominent voices, supporters of the administration, columnists, and even some politicians, have said forget the Republicans, we can't talk to them.",
        "Let's pass this with our own votes.",
        "Is that possible, or what are the effects of that?",
        "It's possible, but it's literally what would be called a nuclear option in terms of reconciliation.",
        "You're talking not only about losing Republicans but losing some conservative Democrats, forcing it through, let's say, with 50 votes, 51 votes, and it would feel, I think, to most Americans like, you know what, this was just being shoved the American people's throats.",
        "And it would lose the notion of widespread support, the moral argument that we need health care reform.",
        "And so you see that that's slipping away from the president.",
        "It would damage - I think it would be damaging.",
        "Final question: Last night the administration released the fact that the federal deficit is projected to be $2 trillion more over the next ten years than what they thought just a few weeks ago.",
        "What's the political effect of this?",
        "Well, again, so much of the political strategic argument about this is, are we really having a conversation about health care or are we having a conversation about the economy?",
        "And if it's a conversation about the economy, news that the deficit's going to be even higher lends support to those who say, well, then how can you put additional funds into reforming health care at this time, it's just going to drive up the deficit, make it less likely that we get out of recession.",
        "And that's a big problem.",
        "NPR News analyst Juan Williams, thanks so much."
