        "For the beginning of the withdrawal.",
        "I mean, if you go back and look at those statements over time, it's never been exactly clear what was meant by that.",
        "But one thing always has been pretty clear: It was not meant as an off switch.",
        "And so I don't think that you're going to see a substantial draw-down then but just the beginning of what they'll be calling the draw-down.",
        "What about - obviously, the key factor in enabling any sort of draw-down is going to be Afghan forces being able to take on more responsibility themselves.",
        "How do you rate their progress?",
        "I take a pretty dim view of the Afghan forces.",
        "I've been out with them on many patrols over the years, dozens and dozens of patrols in multiple provinces, and I haven't really seen much change in their capabilities or in their attitude.",
        "And if - there's always been a pretty strong disconnect between what gets said in Kabul about how the Afghan forces operate and how they perform at the upper levels and their interactions with their senior mentors on the - from NATO and the U.S.",
        "and how they actually perform out in the field.",
        "And there's a similar disconnect for how they're trained and how they perform in the field.",
        "What you see in the training is that it has gotten better, unsurprisingly, as more people have become involved in the training, and there's more resources have been put into it.",
        "But when you go out into the field, and you walk patrols with these Afghan soldiers and police, or you observe them in their living conditions and on their posts out in the remote provinces, you consistently see the same thing, which is a disinterest, at best, sometimes even a hostility to real hard work.",
        "You see an unwillingness to do independent patrols.",
        "You see extensive drug use.",
        "And I don't have a lot of faith that this force is capable this year of changing the dynamic on the ground.",
        "Not capable this year.",
        "Do you see something changing next year, a couple years down the road?",
        "We're now hearing a lot of talk about a 2014 - one hates to say deadline, but the 2014 date of when they would be able to take over security."

        "Well, what - the question will be, and it's always has been unanswerable.",
        "But the real question is: As the United States starts to draw down, will the Afghan military forces and the Afghan police forces have a sense of responsibility.",
        "One place we can look at that I would say might be a chance for us to project outward, and that'll be in the Pech Valley.",
        "Here, in the next couple of months, the United States is pulling its forces, almost all of its forces, out of a valley that was, you know, once sort of central to the American way of fighting this war.",
        "The Afghans are (technical difficulty) there.",
        "The Afghan army will be in there, and they'll probably be in there in pretty good numbers.",
        "It's a really tough valley.",
        "It's got multiple insurgent groups, it's got awful terrain, and it's isolated.",
        "Now, if we look at how they do, the Afghan forces who are left behind this year, maybe that can tell us something about how the Afghans might do going forward.",
        "And it'll be more than them just surviving.",
        "It's not enough not to be overrun.",
        "They need to be able to operate.",
        "They need to be able to demonstrate that they're willing to do independent patrols, plan operations, and if they merely survive, we'll also have to ask ourselves: Have they cut some sort of live-and-let-live arrangement with the insurgent groups there?",
        "And if they do, and if that's what happens this year, then that will be a very worrisome sign because it will raise questions about the value of this whole American project in Afghanistan because that area will be under titular Afghan control but, in fact, a safe haven if that happens.",
        "So I think that this is going to be kind of a high-priority thing to watch, as the fighting season takes shape.",
        "How do the Afghans do in the Pech Valley?",
        "Well, big picture, Chris Chivers, I know that you're in the reporting business, not the analyst business, but do I hear correctly, you sound somewhat pessimistic that the U.S.",
        "is at a major turning point in terms of being able to ramp down forces and commitment in Afghan anytime soon.",
        "This will be the key year.",
        "I think that we really now have all the forces on the (technical difficulty).",
        "The forces that are on the ground are well-equipped.",
        "They're now experienced with Afghanistan.",
        "It's not enough to just come over from Iraq.",
        "It takes a while to learn the ground.",
        "And the forces have been there.",
        "The temperatures are about to rise.",
        "The vegetation's about to climb.",
