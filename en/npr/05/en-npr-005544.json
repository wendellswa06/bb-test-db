        "They're very quick about resulting disputes with the law.",
        "So it's a pretty easy decision for them.",
        "And the analogy that I've always used is that if we fight the Taliban, we're essentially - but we don't solve the problem with the government, then what we're doing is we're mopping up a leak, but we're not fixing the leak itself.",
        "So until we tackle the corruption in the government, I think it's always going to push the people over to the side of the Taliban.",
        "John Nagl, what do you make of that analogy?",

        "That's a tough fight.",
        "The good news is - the other good news, I think, is that the Afghan people have lived under Taliban rule, and very, very few of them want to return to that.",
        "So the Karzai government, bad as it is, does out-poll the Taliban pretty much everywhere in Afghanistan by large numbers.",
        "It's - Karzai is polling 60 percent or so, which is frankly better than the administration is here.",
        "So there's a lot of work to do.",
        "We are working on this problem.",
        "And this goes to one of the things that I'm most concerned about, which is civilian advisors to the civilian Afghan government, something we're still working on getting better at.",
