        "Remind us, what were those words?",
        "Yes.",
        "Those five words were school, half, cupboard, Wednesday and friend.",
        "And the challenge was to identify what specific and unusual property these five words have in common.",
        "And I asked you to, if you get the answer, to name a sixth word that shares the property.",
        "Well, the property is, of course, it each has a silent letter.",
        "It's more than that - it's always the third letter that's silent.",
        "And in addition, if you remove that third letter, what's left will always, in each case, is pronounced the same.",
        "And other possible answers were salmon, debt, juice, subtle and aghast.",
        "OK.",
        "So, about 500 of our listeners figured that out, and our randomly selected winner this week is Steve Worona of Montpelier, Vermont.",
        "Congratulations, Steve.",
