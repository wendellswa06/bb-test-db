        "Now tell us, what can you say about what's in this classified Democratic memo?",
        "Well, the important point that you mentioned earlier is that it's a response to the Republican memo, and that's the one, of course, that alleged the FBI and Justice Department omitted important facts when it got court approval to conduct surveillance on a former Trump campaign aide.",
        "That's Carter Page.",
        "Now, Democrats say that that document was misleading, and they say their own memo is basically a detailed rebuttal of the Republican claims.",

        "If they vote this time to release it, what happens?",
        "Well, it will follow the same process as the Republican memo.",
        "So it'll be sent to the president, who will have five days to decide whether to make it public or not.",
        "If he wants it released, it will be.",
        "If he objects, then the full House can vote to overrule that veto and make it public anyway, but, of course, that would require the support of a lot of Republican lawmakers.",
        "White House spokesman Raj Shah says that if the Democratic memo is sent to the White House, the administration will consider it.",
        "It will undergo a legal and national security review, just as the Republican memo did.",
        "Democrats have also said that they will - that they want to be sure that their memo is reviewed by the FBI and the Justice Department to scrub out any information that could be deemed sensitive or classified.",
        "And that, of course, was a point of friction over the Republican memo.",
        "The FBI and the Justice Department, of course, very pointedly said they did not want that released.",
        "Today, the president was tweeting at the Democratic leader of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff.",
        "How did this all go down today?",
        "Well, basically, the president accused Schiff of being one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.",
        "At the same time, we have to remember that, you know, this is part of a dueling Republican-Democrat memo situation here.",
        "And Trump praised the man behind the Republican memo.",
        "That's the committee's Republican chairman, Devin Nunes.",
        "He said that Nunes was a man of great courage.",
        "He said that he'll someday likely be considered a great American hero."
