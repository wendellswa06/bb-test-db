        "Nice to be back.",
        "Let me just refresh all of our memories back in Nature, a paper in 2005, you wrote, my results suggest that future warming may lead to an upward trend in tropical cyclone destructive potential.",
        "Now, with this new paper, are you changing that position and revising it?",
        "Give us some idea of what you're talking about now.",
        "Well, I think the new study certainly modifies that instead of looking at past data and drawing conclusions directly from that, what we've done is to develop a new technique which allows us to infer from the course output of climate models what their hurricane climatology should be, And what that study suggests going forward is that globally the changes we expect to see while we do still expect to see an increase in hurricane power somewhat less than what one would do simply from extrapolating what happened over the past.",
        "So, would that explain why we haven't seen the strong hurricanes predicted by the last couple of seasons?",
        "No, because both of these techniques - looking at the past climate change and also looking at the future, look at sort of long-term variability and ignore the year-to-year variability.",
        "So, we really can't - nothing we've done that really does address the year-to-year fluctuations.",

        "What does this model do better that the previous ones?",
        "Well, the previous study that I did was not a model at all.",
        "It was simply an analysis of hurricane data and showed that hurricane power is very strongly correlated with measured ocean temperature.",
        "There are studies on the other hand which have looked at global climate model projections.",
        "And the problem with global climate models themselves is they're far too coarse to resolve hurricanes.",
        "Their grid points are maybe 100 or 200 km apart.",
        "And the intense core of a hurricane may be 10 km or 20 km across.",
        "So, our technique gets around that by running very detailed specialized, very highly-resolved hurricane models embedded within the climate model.",
        "And so, we can essentially get the best of both worlds.",
        "We can get the global climate models to produce what they're supposed to do, which is to predict global climate and the hurricane models do what they're supposed to do which is to suggest how hurricanes ought to react to that.",
        "So, you have two separate models here that have to be reconciled?",
        "Would that be accurate?",
        "How did you overcome it?",
        "Did you literally just have to go and do it and just work through the butterflies and the terror and the shaking and all those things?",
        "They can't do and show everything, but they can do and show more than the broadcast networks do.",
