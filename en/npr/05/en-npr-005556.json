        "Well, first of all, I told people that there were two big surprises I had running for president, and one of them was how much easier it was to run for president than to run for anything that I ever experienced in Arkansas.",
        "The political environment in my state, for a Republican, was so very brutal and savage that it really was playing a full-contact sport with no pads.",
        "But to be fair, you won in Arkansas.",
        "Yeah, I did.",
        "I think I would've won at the national level had I had that kind of money, but everybody thought he can't win, he doesn't have any money, and the media made this about a money issue, not a message issue.",

        "She's made more decisions in less than two years as a governor of Alaska than Joe Biden has made in years and years and years in the Senate because he's in a deliberative body, not a decision-making body.",
        "But she's probably going to face the same kind of questions that you faced, being a small-state governor, or Bill Clinton faced…",
        "Yeah.",
        "In the meantime�",
        "Well, I think the thing that we're all puzzled about is that, you know, we saw something like a 60 percent increase in hurricane power globally.",
        "And when we use this new technique run on past climate data sets, that gives a result which is very consistent with what we saw in the hurricane data themselves.",
        "That is we saw the 60 percent increase over the last 25 years.",
        "But now, when we apply that technique going forward over the next hundred years, we see much more modest increases and that is a dilemma.",
        "It might be - that one interpretation is that maybe what we've seen over the last 25 years really isn't due to global warming.",
        "It's due to something else.",
        "Another possible interpretation is that there's something systematically wrong with these climate models which isn't capturing the global warming signal that we're seeing in nature.",
        "But we don't know which of those two it is yet."

        "So, you're keeping an open mind about this.",

        "And what do you need to see, to change your mind one way or the other, the third way?",
        "Well, I think we need to try to get to the bottom of why the changes that we're observing this two new techniques, happen.",
        "That is what aspect of the physical changes in the atmosphere being predicted by global climate models, are driving the changes that we see in hurricane activity.",
        "If we can get to the bottom of that, we can begin to understand whether how much confidence to place in these projections or whether there might be something we discovered that's systematically wrong with the way these models are working.",
        "So, to just sum up in the last minute or two that we have, you're not backing away from your prediction that there will be stronger hurricanes?",
        "No, I think both the data and the models suggest qualitatively that hurricanes should become stronger, they may become less numerous globally.",
        "But what we see in this technique is a lot of variation from one model to the next, and from one place to the next.",
        "So, we're really talking about numbers here.",
        "The indications are hurricane power will go up, but we need to know whether it's going to go up by a trivial amount that we shouldn't worry about or by enough that we do need to worry about it.",
        "And because you can't predict the immediate from these models, it doesn't really affect us one way or the other in this hurricane season.",
        "No, no, nothing that we're doing really has any bearing on what's going to happen next year or even in the next 10 years.",
        "I mean, we have to be looking out much further than that.",
        "That's typical science, we'll stay tuned.",
