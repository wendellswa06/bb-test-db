        "Well, there was a little bit of it that was a bombshell, but a lot of it was expected.",
        "Mr. Manafort's attorneys in their opening gave a little bit of a preview of what they could expect, which was a smart thing for them to do.",

        "Correct.",
        "So you're saying the biggest thing that we learned in the trial yesterday was actually that Rick Gates was doing some shady stuff.",
        "Yes, I think so because it's one thing to say that you're in lockstep with somebody, that you're in a conspiracy with somebody; you're in lockstep with them; you're doing things at - and what the prosecution is trying to portray is that Mr. Gates was doing everything at Paul Manafort's direction.",
        "Well, I don't think Mr. Manafort was giving him direction to take hundreds of thousands of dollars from him.",
        "Well, if that's the case, if the thing that interested you most was Rick Gates admitting that he did some illegal stuff, tell me about the prosecutor's strategy here.",
        "Is it a good idea to essentially start the testimony by having Gates admit that he, too, committed crimes?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think it was the smartest thing they could have done, simply because you don't want that to come out through the defense and give the jury the impression that somehow the government was hiding something from them."
