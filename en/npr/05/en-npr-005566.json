        "Has a farm in New Jersey, and this perhaps may make it even more contentious than anything else.",
        "But the next Senate seat up in New Jersey is that of Robert Menendez, the nation's only Hispanic senator, and he's a Democrat running in New Jersey in 2012, and so there's some talk about Lou Dobbs running for the Senate there.",
        "Now, that's also - 2012 is also, according to the Mayan calendar, the year the world ends.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "So you know, if the world ends before Lou Dobbs runs for the Senate, it's going to be very upsetting for a lot of people.",
        "We'll have more on that on Monday.",
        "Anyway, 60 votes in the Senate.",
        "All of the Democrats and independents lined up on the procedural vote to go ahead with the debate on the health care bill.",
        "Nevertheless, its prospect for final passage unclear at this point.",
        "It is unclear, and yet there was a lot of drama behind last Saturday's vote.",
        "All 60, as you say, the 58 Democrats plus the two independents, voted for, to bring the measure to the floor, and that's probably the easy part, because there are still Democrats like Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, the independent, all say that they're not going to vote for a bill that has the public option in it.",
        "And so it's interesting, Sharon Brown, the progressive senator, a Democrat from Ohio, said wait a second, we have 56 Democrats here who support the public option.",
        "We're worried about the Landrieus and the Ben Nelsons.",
        "The tail wagging the dog.",
        "Exactly.",
        "So there's that out there too.",
        "So Harry Reid would love to have this pass by Christmas in the Senate, and then of course it goes back to the House and Senate to merge the two differences.",
        "And look, they want it out before the Senate 2010s have to run for re-election again because a lot of Democrats are nervous about this vote."
