        "What's happened is, of course, the old one, John Garamendi, was elected to Congress.",
        "He's a Democrat, was elected to Congress on November 3rd, and Arnold Schwarzenegger picked a fellow Republican, a state senator by the name of Abel Maldonado, who is basically one of the few Republican Schwarzenegger allies in the state legislature.",
        "He voted for the tax increases.",
        "So not only do the conservatives hate this guy's guts because they feel he's Republican in name only, but the Democrats in the legislature, who control the legislature, may not want to confirm Maldonado as lieutenant governor because they don't want an incumbent running in 2010.",
        "In California, Schwarzenegger could nominate whoever he wants, but the legislature has to confirm him, and there's no guarantee the Democrats will do that.",
        "And what it is about New Jersey?",
        "A former football player for the Philadelphia Eagles plans to retire at the end of this year, Jon Runyon, and he says he's going to plan to run for Congress in the state of New Jersey.",
        "That's right.",
        "He is looking at John Adler, who is a first-term Democrat.",
        "First-term - Democrat, rather.",
        "And of course nobody knows where this guy, where Runyon stands, except he's left tackle.",
        "I mean, you don't know�",
        "He'd have to shift to the right side to run as a Republican.",
        "As a Republican.",
        "So he's one of the people - look, Adler's very, very - on tenuous ground, a long-time Republican seat, one of the few Democrats who voted against the health care plan because he feared for his political future.",
        "Let's see if we can get some more answers to our trivia question.",
        "We already know that Pat Buchanan is part of the answer.",
        "We're looking for the other part of the answer of a former CNN star.",
        "This was the first of them to run for political office."
