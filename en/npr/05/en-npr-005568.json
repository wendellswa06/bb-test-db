        "And what prompted this discussion?",
        "Was it that 49 percent approval rating?",
        "Well, less the approval rating than some of the commentary you're seeing, even from people who are staunch Obama supporters - a couple of columns in the New York Times, Maureen Dowd this morning wondering sort of what became of the man who they voted for and who was so inspiring on the campaign trail.",
        "And indeed, you've gotten some interesting responses.",
        "Yes, and there are several schools of thought.",
        "One is that he never really had it, that it was in the eyes of the beholders and the worshipful crowds and the young people and the media.",
        "So the - questioning essentially the premise.",
        "I don't accept that because I think he did have a huge amount of charisma, depending on how you define that.",
        "Another common theme today is that, well, this is the difference between governing and campaigning.",
        "That's what Dana Perino, the former White House press secretary�",
        "Dana Perino, who ought to know, had something to say about that, and I think it was very wise that when you're dealing with the difficulties, the day-to-day difficulties of that job, it's difficult to maintain the same level of flash and enthusiasm that you have on the campaign trail, which is an entirely different stage.",
        "I was also interested, Republican strategist and Reagan biographer Craig Shirley said from the vantage point of the peanut gallery, it appears to many he is simply lost in power, that neither he nor his people understand the difference between stagecraft and statesmanship.",
        "Yes, and Craig knows something about that because he helped manage President Reagan's stagecraft, and here this theme is essentially that his managers have done him in.",
        "There's a couple of people who say get rid of Rahm Emanuel�",
        "Big shakeup.",
        "�and it'll all come back.",
        "And there's also a theme that, you know, our perception of the president is determined by the circumstances.",
        "The circumstances are not so good, and when you get, particularly in the media, when you get somebody who appears to be, shall we say, less than successful, every perception about that person changes accordingly, and the media is fickle that way."

        "Walter Russell Mead, the historian and foreign policy expert, said: No president is charismatic when unemployment is in double digits and rising.",
        "Exactly, but there's a deeper thing going on here because people are commenting, and if you read some of the comments about Obama's specific style, one of them even calling it robotic, business-like, methodical, and there really is, let's face it, a very different style that he's adopted as president, and it goes beyond the no-drama and it's very different than when he was in a large room with 70,000 or whatever that maximum figure was.",

        "But two things hit me.",
        "One, he was actually dispassionate when he was a candidate.",
        "I think one of the reasons people liked him so much was he was not the kind of guy who would get excited about things, and he would just be very methodical about the way he ran things.",
        "Two, as we've pointed out before, charisma is not going to end wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and it's not going to reduce unemployment.",
        "But three, Dick Cheney was not Mr. Charisma either, and he may have been the most effective vice president in history.",
        "Well, Fred, there were some people who had some things to say about his, what some would call dithering.",

        "Yes, and that was one of the pieces that I cited in the Arena this morning.",

        "The Bush-Cheney style, he said, was, quote, \"\"cowboy-like, typical Texas, typical Wyoming and extremely secretive.\"\" In contrast, a lot of people cite President Obama's style as - well, Mr. Spock.",

        "One of the commenters says this is a grown-up and we should be glad to have him, but the way you lead, particularly when you're leading in difficult times and trying to do ambitious things, I think it's very important whether you can rouse people to your support.",
        "That may or may not be charisma.",
        "It may be persuasiveness, maybe, and he changed from the moment - if you remember the inaugural address, there was a lot of comment, wait a minute, is this the right - is this the same guy?",
        "Yeah.",
        "And Dana Perino points that out, and my son said that when we watched the inaugural address.",
        "So something changed.",

        "I think some folks are just unrealistic.",
        "These issues did not occur overnight, and they're not going to go away overnight.",
        "But what I think that he still has is that I think he is able to communicate effectively as far as what he's doing.",
        "He is communicating it to the people, and I just think we're being a little unrealistic as far as everything he has to deal with.",
        "I don't think he's lost his charisma.",
        "I just think he's dealing with some serious issues, and that's taken his attention.",

        "I agree with what Melissa says, but also if you think of the addresses, the nationally televised addresses that Barack Obama's made regarding health care or regarding war policy and things like that, you notice that after he speaks the polls don't indicate much of the public changing, much of a public movement.",
        "So I don't know if it's charisma or leadership or whatever we're talking about, but ultimately when you address the nation on something so important as war or changing the health care, some - there should be some movement in public opinion, and we have not seen that.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Melissa, appreciate it."
