        "Thank you.",
        "And talking about the setting, or at least the stagecraft for comments about war, it was interesting to see there was - in the middle of your conversation news came down the president plans to go to West Point on Tuesday to make his address to explain the policy in Afghanistan, and you had two rival comments on that.",
        "I think it was one saying this is exactly the right place, he needs to look these young men in the eye, they're the ones who are going to be the second lieutenants in the field, carrying out his policies; and another saying no, no, no, he's got it all wrong, he should do this from the Oval Office and go to West Point the next day to reinforce it.",
        "Right, and you know, it's going to be judged by his success.",
        "The standards of how a president ought to conduct himself are - have been determined by decades of successful presidencies, and if he is successful, people might say, well, this is the way to do it.",
        "If he's unsuccessful, they might, as they do with Jimmy Carter, say this is the way not to do it.",
        "The man clearly has a style that doesn't suit the traditional managers of presidencies, I think, and there's beginning to be a lot of comment on that, and there's also a little bit of disappointment.",
        "The guy is capable of turning on and off his charisma.",
        "We all wish we had that ability.",
        "Sure, yeah.",
        "And he's chosen to turn it off and probably for a calculated reason.",
        "Maybe he's uncomfortable with it�",
        "Or to save it for when he really needs it.",
        "To save it for when, and Sharolyn Eiffel(ph), one of Arena contributors, points that out, that it's a precious commodity.",
        "Use it carefully, use it when you need it and not otherwise, because it can get stale."

        "We're going to take some more calls on this in just a minute.",
        "Here's a couple of emails, this from Thomas in Baton Rouge.",
        "I believe the longer Obama equivocates on issues and seeks to please everyone, people are seeing more and more resemblance to Jimmy Carter, which we just mentioned.",
        "People remember how ineffectual Carter was and fear this will be four to eight years of talk, compromise and failing to accomplish anything of substance.",

        "We're beating him down with unreasonable expectation.",
        "In the meantime, we spoke earlier about the state dinner at the White House yesterday.",

        "I think I have the unique advantage of coming from India, being India's economic and political rise in the world, and having access to both worlds, having trained in the medical tradition by the schools that Nehru put up.",
        "You know, when Nehru became the prime minister, he focused on education and said the most important thing we can do for India is to have educational institutions.",
        "And we're reaping the benefits of that now.",
        "And my only hope is that - is President Obama and Mr. Manmohan Singh can start a partnership for economic development and help Pakistan come along the way.",
        "It might actually help the problem in Afghanistan.",
        "You know, ease tensions, get the Kashmiris to be a little more independent and foster economic partnerships, decrease the tension between India and Pakistan, focus on Afghanistan with Pakistan's help by building their infrastructure.",
        "And perhaps these troops that are being sent are just, you know, a temporary alleviation of the problem in the long-term.",
