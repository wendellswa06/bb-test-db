        "Now it's important that we not rest on our laurels here and say, `Gee, given all the difficult conditions, crime still is going down.",
        "It will not go down forever, and the decline was relatively small.",
        "If we continue to slash budgets for prevention programs, everything from athletic leagues to after-school programs, we could face, indeed, increases in the years ahead.",
        "So let's not get complacent.",
        "Of course not.",
        "But to what do you attribute this somewhat surprising number?",
        "Well, it's only a few-percentage-point decline, for example, in homicide.",
        "And there are some reasons why it may be happening.",
        "The other end of the demographic spectrum is that the largest-growing segment of our population are the seniors.",
        "Almost a third of the population are over 50 years old.",
        "And the aging baby boomers aren't babies anymore, and they're doing their part to bring down the crime rate if only by getting older and certainly not very violent.",
        "We're also sending more and more people to prison.",
        "That is not necessarily the best strategy and most cost-effective strategy for fighting crime, but at least it works.",
        "The offenders behind bars aren't committing crimes on the streets, although I do believe that some of those funds, significant funds, we spend on corrections could be reinvested in crime prevention programs.",

        "The decline in the murder rate, for example, could be explained just by looking at the city of Chicago.",
        "Right.",
        "Chicago did have a very good year.",
        "And other cities had bad years.",
        "And part of the problem is, if you spend too much time focusing on year-to-year changes, you can be seriously misled.",
        "Sometimes crimes go down in a city because the previous year was unusually high.",
        "And sometimes crime rates can go up because the previous year was unusually low.",
        "In the same way that economists will not focus too much on day-to-day changes in the stock market--rather, they'll look at the long-term trends--the same thing holds for crime statistics.",
        "In the long term, we're pretty well off.",
        "Some cities, yes, are seeing an increase, but, at least in terms of homicide, for example, part of that can just be bad luck.",
        "That is, more victims last year happened to not survive an assault and became a homicide victim as opposed to a previous year where a comparable victim maybe was saved by emergency personnel and became an assault victim.",

        "Yes, they have been used as political weapons.",
        "When crime rates go down and politicians and police chiefs like to take credit, oftentimes they're taking more credit than they deserve.",
        "Yes, there is some role that local activities and police activities have, but there are many factors that have nothing to do with these initiatives.",
        "And when crime rates go up, they oftentimes take too much of the heat, too much of the blame.",
        "So I think that crime statistics are useful in gauging where we're going in this country--let's not focus too much on the year-to-year changes because you can be seriously misled.",
