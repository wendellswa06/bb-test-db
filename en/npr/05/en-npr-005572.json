        "It's - you know, and it affects everything.",
        "It's the subtext of everything in America, economically, socially.",
        "It's a big part of our lives.",
        "And to the extent that this campaign furthers that conversation, to the extent that these two candidates grope their way towards some conversation about race that's beyond where we've been, I think that's good for the country, and I think we ought to talk about it."

        "There's a tendency, because I think the difference for them is much more pronounced than it is for younger Americans.",
        "But I think, you know, race is a part of the - I think it's fair to read race into a lot of things happening in the campaign that're not extensively about race.",
        "And just as a quick example, I mean, I think Senator Obama's trip to Europe and some of the imagery that makes him seem very presidential, I think, is overtly intended to get people over the mental block of seeing an African-American man in the role of president, in the row with world leaders."
