        "But to me, that's a story.",

        "Sure.",

        "I think that's an important point.",

        "But that's not it.",
        "But getting over my nervousness at that, I - you know, it is ironic, right?",
        "Because McCain in 2000 was the star and one all the reporters seemed to want to be around and he got great coverage.",
        "And what's interesting about this is, you know, there's a cycle here, right?",
        "I mean, people always get great coverage and then they feel they're being treated poorly.",
        "You know, Obama got this great free ride for a long time, and then during the Reverend Wright controversy, it was suddenly, you know, the media won't let up.",
        "And so, surely McCain feels that he's, you know, run into his worst nightmare.",
        "It's his own image reflected back.",
        "But in the end, I'm pretty - I feel pretty good about the way that our media environment, just over the last four years or eight years, has diversified.",
        "Now, there are so many different sources online and in news, and you know, it's become such a segment of mixed market.",
        "There are things about that I really don't like, but you know, at bottom, I think both these candidates are going to get scrutinized, and they're going to get their hearing, and I do think we're in a moment where Obama's has gotten quite a nice ride."

        "So, I think I've had quite a bit more practice at this than some of my colleagues have.",
        "And I think that a lot of my peers in the business feel the same way.",
        "I think the difference is that, as Matt pointed out, there's a lot more diversity in the business now, not as much as some of us would like, and some of our colleagues are now having to have the experience of analyzing their perceptions against that of their colleagues.",
        "I think the issues with some of these stories are invisible to us.",
        "Some of these, you know, biases are invisible, because you, and your gatekeeper, and everybody who is in that chain of custody that the caller was talking about, if you all are - have the same perceptions and the same life experience and the same world view, then that doesn't change a whole lot, you know?",
        "Matt, do you check yourself?",
        "Ah, no, I don't - I'm not aware of doing that because, you know, I do think there is a, you know, again, a difference between - you know, I don't know if it's always generational, it's in different ways, but you know, we've spent - people who went to school at the time I went to school and come up through media organizations spent a lot of time talking about this over the years and may have, you know, some comfort level with that disparity.",
        "I mean, I - you know, it's interesting to me, as my piece came out, just went online today, and in the piece, I talk about interviewing Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, and I talk about how he kind of made fun me gently for trying to, you know, cautiously talk about race.",
        "And he sort of poked fun at sort of the clumsy way I was going about the questioning.",
        "And I've gotten a lot of mail today, and it's interesting how much of the mail, you know, a large segment of it focused in on that very section of the piece from white readers who really were struck by that section.",
        "And I think because there is, for white Americans, this experience, often, if you're around diverse audiences, if you have black friends, or if you come into contact with different racial groups on a daily basis, of trying to talk about this and failing, right, of not quite knowing how to bridge this divide, of feeling inept at talking about these issues.",
        "And so, you know, I think the reason that struck a chord with people is because that's what a lot of white journalists, I think, are going through, is trying to talk about this, write about this, and not make a mistake, right, and do it respectfully, and also do it perceptively, and it's very, very hard.",
        "And some for the first time, too.",
        "Many for the first time.",
        "Which it's such a good thing, in my opinion.",

        "But you know, better late than never is my point of view.",
        "I'm thinking of a colleague of mine whom I interviewed last week for a panel at this UNITY Conference of Journalists of Color.",
        "His name was Ti-Hua Chang, and he's a reporter for a Fox affiliate in New York and New Jersey.",
        "One of the things he said to me that he does as an exercise is when he's writing a piece that pertains to another ethnic group, a group other than his own, he substitutes his, and he says, how would I feel if this were being written about me?",
        "If he's doing a story about immigration and the issue is, say, Dominicans in the, you know, the Bronx or whatever, Upper Manhattan, he says he substitutes Chinese.",
        "I think that's a useful exercise, and I think we should do more of that.",
        "For example, when, you know, there was an interesting issue in the media the other day that a reporter for one paper, a national paper, talked about - and I thought it was tongue-in-cheek - about whether Obama's skinniness put him at odds with the American people, who tend to be larger sized."
