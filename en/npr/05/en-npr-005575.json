        "Lisa Feigenson is a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Hopkins and one of the researchers behind this study.",
        "Some pieces of knowledge are so fundamental in guiding regular, everyday interactions with the environment, navigating through space, reaching out and picking up an object, avoiding an oncoming object.",
        "Those things are so fundamental to survival that they're really selected for by evolution.",
        "So when the ball rolls down the ramp and does go through the wall thanks to some sleight-of-hand by the researchers, that cute baby - she's surprised.",
        "And this is where the learning part of our story kicks in.",
        "Not only did the babies in the study react when the ball appeared to go through the wall or, say, a toy car floated across the stage, their surprise appeared to make them better learners.",
        "What does this mean?",
        "Well, when the babies were given new information about these seemingly magical objects, like the ball also squeaks, the infants were more likely to retain it.",
        "But if the ball stopped at the wall as it did for some babies, they paid less attention to it and were less likely to remember if it also squeaked, as if to say, it's just a ball.",
        "I get it.",
        "Who cares?",
        "In another experiment, the babies were given a chance to play with the items that had surprised them, and not only did they prefer those to other toys, they played with them in a way that suggested they were trying to learn.",
