        "She was a canny producer and it was her production company.",
        "It is an absolutely perfect piece of theater for them to have done.",
        "And they enjoyed working together.",
        "There's a wonderful tension in this story between Taylor and Burton - apart from the love affair and the alcohol and the pills - and it's about acting.",
        "And I want to play a bit of what Dominic West, as Burton, says about the first scene that they played together.",

        "So in the early days, as it's really a rescue, recovery, emergency operation, they used primarily satellite phones because there isn't infrastructure and they need to be able to communicate.",
        "But that's expensive and not sustainable.",
        "So the next thing they try and do is look for some sort of short- to mid-term operation that doesn't rely on such an expensive technology.",
        "And here's where things get interesting.",
        "One of the options that's coming to the plate is the parent company of Google, Alphabet, has this idea called Project Loon that comes out of its X research unit.",
        "And the idea is to use these high-altitude balloons to connect the cell phones in areas where the infrastructure is down.",
        "And they have preliminary approval from the FCC to try this out in Puerto Rico.",
        "I mean, I'm guessing priority No. 1 is trying to get power restored across the island.",

        "Obviously, a lack of clean water could lead to waterborne diseases, sanitation issues.",

        "And they're looking into whether solar and batteries might be a longer-term solution.",
        "There is opportunity here that things, when they do get built back, will be built back significantly better than they were before the hurricane.",
        "Are you able to gauge whether these tech companies are working together at least for now?",
        "Or are they competing?",
        "I mean, these are competitors in the tech markets.",
        "I mean, the really neat thing about this is certainly in the emergency response through NetHope these companies really do work side by side.",
        "They set aside their competitive things.",
        "And this isn't really a moneymaking opportunity in the short term.",
        "It becomes one when we talk about rebuilding.",
        "And I think you will see some of the same companies that are working side by side as volunteers today competing for contracts down the road for the actual rebuilding.",
        "So they haven't given up on capitalism altogether.",
        "Well, that prompts my last question, which is, who will pay?",
        "Because Puerto Rico is broke, and these technologies are not going to be cheap.",
        "Yeah, the tech companies aren't going to provide this for free.",
        "So, I mean, ultimately it will have to come through either the dollars being allocated for the relief effort or additional investments.",
        "These will be costly expenditures.",
        "Hopefully the political will will be there to make this happen.",
        "But certainly none of these companies are offering to rebuild it for free.",

        "Only about 4,000 of the almost 490,000 active-duty Army soldiers identify themselves as Jewish, and among them is Army Specialist Joe Kashnow.",
        "He spent about six months in Iraq before he lost a leg in an explosion.",

        "It's something that I've always wanted to be a part of--military work or police work or law enforcement or the protection of other people--and it was something that had been always something that I saw as more of an honor and a privilege to serve, and a bit also as a duty to serve as a Jew and as an American citizen.",
        "I think that as Jews, we have something to give back to our country as we do in other fields.",

        "The cases of meals disappeared very quickly; they were stolen in Kuwait.",
        "But it took about six weeks until I was able to get kosher rations back through the Army properly.",
        "And at that point, they still weren't coming in on a regular basis, and it got to the point where my direct supervisor didn't seem to be doing quite a lot about working on it, about getting it squared away for me.",
        "And I told him I just--I'd lost patience with him and I very nicely said to him--I said, `You don't need to worry about it anymore,' and I told him I was going to walk down the hall and go to the battalion commander's office and explain to him what was happening and ask if there's anything he could do to help me out.",
        "He basically freaked out, I think, in fear of his own job and asked me not to do it and promised me he would be able to take care of it and it shouldn't be a problem and nothing else would happen.",
        "And the next day, I had three cases of MREs magically show up.",
