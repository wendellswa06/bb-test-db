        "The agreement divided the country along ethnic lines: a separate area for Serbs and a Muslim-Croat federation.",
        "While many acknowledged the agreement was less than perfect and often Byzantine--among other things, there are three presidents--it did stop the carnage.",

        "And Wake Forest University constitutional expert Mark Hall says almost every legal scholar he knows considers an individual mandate for health insurance consistent with Congress' power to regulate.",
        "Here's why.",
        "An individual who goes out and tries to purchase health insurance cannot buy a policy that covers preexisting conditions or that asks no medical questions.",
        "Such a product's simply not sold in most states.",
        "And it can't really be sold economically, unless we require most people to have insurance.",
        "So the requirement is really part and parcel of the regulation of the structure and conditions for the marketplace that would allow a very desirable kind of product to be sold.",
        "And Yale legal scholar Akhil Amar says the fact that a requirement by health insurance would be enforced through fines shows that Congress is exercising an even more fundamental constitutional power: Its power to impose taxes.",
        "Amar says courts should not be concerned that such a mandate had been used before.",

        "There was resentment by many New Yorkers against the mayor for flouting democracy and overturning a term limits law twice approved by voters so he could run again.",
        "There was also resentment that in a deteriorating economy, the mayor spent so much money for an election many felt he would win easily.",
        "But in the end, it was closer than anyone thought.",
        "Bloomberg, an independent, ran on the Republican and independent lines.",
        "This is a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans six-to-one, but many voters, no matter their party, supported the mayor because they believed that the city is better managed than it's ever been and more harmonious.",
        "Some political analysts felt Thompson never really defined himself well.",
        "In his concession speech, he said it was important to get ideas like the plight of working people into the debate.",
        "We may not have won the election, and yet I know that this campaign had to be waged.",
        "Bloomberg's victory speech emphasized independence, nonpartisanship and redoubling efforts in tough times."
