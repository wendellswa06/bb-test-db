        "Forced the parties how?",
        "Well, a combination of threats, of cajoling, of coaxing, and I think that's what it took to get them all and, finally, frankly, to sequester them in Dayton, where they couldn't go away, where they couldn't just go home, and it was pretty much that which really--it took to get them really to concentrate and actually endorse the peace agreement.",
        "Yeah, we talk about the signing ceremony at the hotel ballroom, but really, it was three weeks on an Air force base that provided this agreement.",

        "And what they got, though, was a unified country, and at least in name, at the time, a central government.",
        "So what do you think, Laura, was Dayton's biggest achievement?",
        "I think it was stopping the war.",
        "I think it was--actually, you look at it, there was not a single American killed by enemy fire in that intervention, in that whole years of the peacekeeping.",
        "And I think it was really in getting the people to start the long and slow process of living together, at least in the same state, and of, you know, starting about the business of rebuilding a state.",
        "Before, the war, Bosnia, and certainly the city of Sarajevo, its capital, was a multiethnic society.",
        "Is it today?",
        "That's what I think is the biggest loss of the war, in addition, obviously, to the lost lives and the millions of people who were displaced by the war.",

        "The idea that it didn't matter whether someone was Serbian or Croat or Muslim; it was a mixed and common heritage of being Bosnian.",
        "And I think to many, to a great extent, that is lost today.",
        "There still--it still lives on in individuals, and it still lives on in Sarajevo, perhaps, but it's not the same strong sense of what Sarajevo was with basically a Bosnia in miniature, as well as a former Yugoslavia in miniature.",
        "And today it is?",
        "It's a city where you have people who are cosmopolitan, you have people who are obviously from mixed marriages or just identify themselves as Bosnian rather than as Serbs, Croats or Muslims.",
        "But it's also a city that, for four years, was under a siege, a city where many people--no one's life was untouched by the war.",
        "And I think you have a residue of that and a city that's not--it's not quite the proud centerpiece of Bosnia that it once was.",
        "Laura, you've been back quite frequently.",
        "What's it like economically there today?",
        "It's made, obviously, a vast improvement from the end of the war, so we have to be careful.",
        "When we look at it, we have to also realize it takes a long time to rebuild from nothing.",
        "But today many people who have the option of leaving Bosnia or Sarajevo will leave; people who can vote with their feet, so to say, people who can go--who have a better chance of building a life elsewhere, they will leave.",
        "You have a Bosnia where it's very, very complicated to rebuild an economy because of the--frankly, of the very complicated construct of the Dayton Agreement, the agreement that was done 10 years ago today.",
        "Everything has to be negotiated.",
        "It's very complicated to do, say, any kind of simple economic reform, which may not even be so simple, becomes even more complicated in Bosnia-Herzegovina today."
