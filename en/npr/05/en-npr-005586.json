        "And, Ambassador Holbrooke, very good of you to join us today.",
        "Well, it's my pleasure.",
        "Looking back on the 10 years since Dayton, what are the lessons do you think we should draw from this?",
        "Well, the biggest lessons for me is that the United States has a role to play in these issues.",
        "It should take the lead.",
        "And when it engages, it makes a difference.",
        "We got into the Bosnian situation much too slowly.",
        "1991, the Bush administration disengaged.",
        "Clinton, after campaigning that he would get involved, was slow to get involved.",
        "When we finally got involved in August of '95 in a serious way with an all-out negotiating effort and bombing--and, by the way, I should note that three of my four initial negotiating team members were killed trying to get into Sarajevo; Bob Frasure, Joe Kruzel and Nelson Drew, on that terrible road that Carl Bildt knows so well.",
        "When we finally got involved, including NATO bombing, we got them to the table, got them to the Wright-Patterson Air Base outside Dayton, Ohio, and forged the Dayton peace agreement.",
        "That was American leadership.",
        "The second point I'd make is that Dayton worked.",
        "It achieved all our initial objectives.",
        "It ended the war, and not one American or NATO soldier has been killed or wounded in the 10 years since then; 60,000 NATO troops went in, of which 20,000 were American.",
        "Now we're down to about 7,000 total, of which under 200 are American, and I repeat, no American or NATO killed or wounded.",
        "We wrote a peace agreement, unlike Iraq, which was full and complete.",
        "Everyone signed on to it.",
        "And the agreement worked.",
        "Now Dayton wasn't perfect, but it achieved our objectives, and I think it stands as perhaps the most successful peace negotiation of the last quarter century anywhere in the world.",
        "Ambassador Holbrooke, what do you think then are the challenges that lie ahead for the country?",
        "For Bosnia?"

        "This should have been done years ago, but quite frankly, in the four years leading up to the last few weeks, the US government did absolutely nothing in the region of any consequence, and I'm including Kosovo in this, because I heard your last discussion with Carl Bildt on Kosovo.",
        "Kosovo's going to be a much harder problem.",
        "Condoleezza Rice assigned the undersecretary of State, Nick Burns, to this issue.",
        "Burns, who was a veteran of Dayton--10 years ago today, he was at my side as we negotiated the final drama there, exactly 10 years ago, almost to the hour.",
        "We pulled a negotiation out of a failure, a success out of a failure.",
        "Burns knows the area.",
        "He's engaged, and so they're trying to fix Dayton.",
        "It's belated, but it's the right thing to do.",
        "I want to echo something that I hard Carl Bildt say a minute ago.",
        "In Bosnia's case, we're trying to improve on a success to fix some of the flaws, but in Kosovo, we're dealing--we're going to have to deal with a situation that was ignored for the last four and a half years and that has gotten progressively more tense and for which the solutions are going to be far, far more difficult.",
        "We're talking about the lessons of the Dayton Peace Accords which were signed 10 years ago today.",

        "Good afternoon, gentlemen.",
        "I'd like to know, of those people who fled, especially in those last days before the war began in '92, how many actually came back to Bosnia, particularly in Sarajevo?",
        "I wondered if you know that?",
        "That's a fifth of their revenue.",
        "So...",
        "Wow.",
        "I'm so glad you asked that question.",
        "The statistics on the war are pretty staggering: 300,000 killed, two and a half million homeless.",
        "Of the two and a half million refugees, homeless, well over half have now returned to the country, and most amazingly of all, many of them, many, many of them--statistics are a little weak here--have returned to minority areas.",
        "Let's take the worst place in the whole region, Srebrenica, the famous killing field where one of the great war crimes in the 20th century took place, where the Bosnian Serbs killed 7,700 Muslim men and young men in the soccer field.",
        "I was there in that soccer field, in that mud field on its 10th anniversary a few months ago as a member of an official delegation, and two my utter amazement, 4,000 Muslims had returned to the valley.",
        "When I was there five years ago, the number was 10 Muslim families.",
        "Now 4,000 had returned.",
        "The Serbs who had come there from Sarajevo had begun to leave.",
        "They were down from 12,000 to 8,000.",
        "And I believe that when we come back there in five years, the valley will once again be a Muslim valley."
