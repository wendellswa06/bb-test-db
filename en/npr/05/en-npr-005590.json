        "You mentioned after a certain amount of weeks, if you're not finding work, say, after five weeks or so, you may go through different sort of stages, almost mimicking the stages of grief, I guess.",
        "In the early phase, people are typically quite reactant, which means that they give a good effort, they search hard, and they believe that the battle will be short, and a good night's sleep, and it'll all be over.",
        "But when you have extensive duration of unemployment and that helplessness sets in, that then begins to change your mindset, but it also alters the way that potential employers look at you.",
        "We're hearing the argument that getting unemployment benefits, that people who are getting them essentially aren't getting jobs, aren't moving on to jobs because of the unemployment benefits because they have something in place.",
        "There is some evidence that as people get very close to the end of their unemployment benefits, there's a spike or an increase in the likelihood that they'll find work.",
        "But the question is whether they're finding work that'll be long-term and satisfying to them."

        "If they were to take a job that would not enhance their marketability in the future, it can actually be damaging to them as they search for jobs when the economy actually begins to grow again, which looks like it'll happen in 2011 and '12.",

        "And what work-sharing does is it allows an employer to reduce somebody's hours and their take-home pay, say, 20 percent, 30 percent, 40 percent, and then have that person receive a fraction of the unemployment insurance they would have got if they were laid off completely.",
        "And so what that does is it incents employers to instead of taking one person and kicking them off the grounds of the firm, they can take five people, reduce their hours 20 percent and have the same labor cost savings for the firm, and those individuals will then get, say, 20 percent of their unemployment insurance.",
        "And that's good for employers, because when they start to expand again, they don't have to have a costly search for new workers.",
        "And it's great for workers because they don't have to be disconnected from the workforce, and they don't have to go through the shame of saying they're unemployed.",
        "Well, more data are needed, I think, is what scientists are fond of saying, and this is certainly a case where that is true.",
        "So it's a program that's a lot better than what we do.",

        "And so I think...",
        "But is there evidence that in these places where they do have these programs, when things get better, employers bring everyone back to full hours and bring back up their wages?",
        "Generally what happens is that the countries that have work-sharing programs will suspend them when times are good again.",
        "And so you could imagine - I think in the U.S., most economists think the economy's growing maybe in the 2.5 percent range now, but the unemployment rate's very high.",
        "If we started growing four or 5 percent, and the unemployment rate dropped a couple of percent, well then we would suspend the work-sharing program.",
        "What are some other alternative out there to the current system?",
        "The other type of system that people talk a lot about is one where the compensation that you get from the unemployment insurance program isn't so heavily dependent on the duration of your spell of unemployment.",
        "And so instead of, you know, cutting you a check every week, we could instead give you, you know, a big lump sum payment upfront or maybe a big lump sum payment in the first four weeks and then another one for the, you know, second half."

        "Prosecutor Paul Knight took less than an hour to outline the state's case to jurors.",
