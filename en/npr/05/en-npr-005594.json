        "Well, I think Dorothy Day, in a sense, brings together the two wings of the Catholic Church.",
        "The left wing of the Church can identify with her social activism.",
        "She founded the Catholic Worker magazine.",
        "She vigorously supported the labor movement.",
        "On the other hand, she was a champion of Catholic orthodoxy on many issues.",
        "Though she actually had an abortion as a young woman, she became very pro-life later on, which endears her to more conservative Catholics.",
        "So she's a hero to both wings.",
        "And by highlighting her, the pope can highlight his own view of himself as a bridge builder.",
        "Well, from Dorothy Day, let's pivot to the other lesser-known Catholic in the speech, Thomas Merton.",
        "He was a monk.",
        "He became famous writing about his own spiritual awakening and was very popular in the 1960s.",
        "That's right, Ari.",
        "He was active also in the mid-20th century and yes, very spiritual.",
        "He wrote that he belonged to God, not to himself.",
        "He said to belong to God is to be free of all the anxieties and worries and sorrows that belong to this Earth.",
        "So not surprisingly, with that worldview, he was drawn to the Eastern religions, to Buddhism in particular, and that's one of the reasons he was especially popular in the '60s when Eastern religions were getting a lot of attention.",
        "It was also interesting.",
        "The pope described him as not only a man of prayer but also, quote, \"\"a thinker who challenged the certitudes of his time.",
        "Right.",
        "And there again, he could've been - the pope could've been talking about himself because Thomas Merton, in spite of being very spiritual, was very provocative.",
        "He was active in the antiwar movement.",
        "He was active in the movement against nuclear weapons.",
        "So there, he has that in common as well with Pope Francis, who considers himself a ruler of peace between people just the way he described Thomas Merton.",
        "Just briefly, when you take these four people altogether - Thomas Merton, Dorothy Day, along with Lincoln and Dr. King, what do you take away from what the pope is trying to portray about himself?",
        "(Soundbite of spray-paint can being shaken and sprayed)",
        "Caldwell spray-paints a code on one of the windows to let other patrols know that the house has already been checked.",
        "He says as the water goes, down more and more people are coming into these neighborhoods, which forces the Guard into a new role.",
        "To political news now, and how is this for burying the hatchet?",
        "Hillary Clinton as Barack Obama's secretary of state - that's the political rumor de jour.",
        "Transition team officials aren't saying anything on the record, but off the record, they're saying she is on the short list.",
        "NPR news analyst Juan Williams is here now for our weekly chat.",
        "Hi, Juan.",
        "Hi, Madeleine."

        "Well, what is the argument for giving the job to Senator Clinton?",
        "After all, the two did not exactly see eye to eye on foreign policy during the campaign.",
        "Well, there are two levels of argument.",
        "From the political angle, if you leave Hillary Clinton in the U.S.",
        "Senate and of course, Hillary Clinton is there kind of to lead Democrat-pressure opposition to an Obama administration and to kind of carp and complain when he doesn't meet expectations coming from the left.",
        "But there's a more serious level, and it goes like this - and it makes her, actually, right now the favorite for the secretary of state's job, which I think is something we would not have foreseen even a week ago - that increasingly, the old hands around the Democratic Party foreign-policy apparatus have all said, wait a minute, are you thinking about Bill Richardson?",
        "Are you thinking about John Kerry?",
        "Are you thinking about Chuck Hagel?",
        "to President-elect Obama, and he says yes.",
        "And they say, but imagine if instead, you were sending Hillary Clinton over to foreign capitals and - to deal with people who are quite difficult.",
        "The stature would be far greater, and Hillary Clinton, as a part of your inner circle, would add to your stature in the country and among Democrats.",
        "OK.",
        "So, speaking of the Senate and Senator Obama, he will resign his seat on Sunday.",
        "His replacement will be appointed by the governor of Illinois, Rod Blagojevich.",
        "Who are the likely candidates, and who's likely to actually be appointed?",
        "Well, the most likely candidate and the person most likely to be appointed is Jesse Jackson Jr., the congressman from Chicago.",
        "But there are a range of candidates, and it's quite interesting because, as you know, the governor is in political hot water himself.",
        "His numbers are very low.",
        "There's all sorts of talk of investigations and the like.",
        "So, the question is, would he, potentially, maybe appoint somebody who's a close ally in the state legislature?",
        "There's the 73-year-old Emil Jones.",
        "Then, what about pressure from the Hispanic community?",
        "There's Congressman Luis Gutierrez.",
        "And there's also talk about Tammy Duckworth - Tammy Duckworth, who runs the Veterans Affairs Department for Illinois, and she is a double amputee and close to Obama.",
        "But there are also people who might be potentially opponents for the governor going forward, like the attorney general, Lisa Madigan, or the treasurer.",
        "So, there's all these kinds of angles to the game that are very interesting.",
        "But it looks at this moment, most likely, that you're going to end up with Jesse Jackson Jr.",
        "OK.",
        "And Juan, what was your best political conversation of this week?",
        "Well, you know, everybody's talking about the fact that there's so many Clinton people going into the administration, and this led to an interesting conversation where John Podesta, who was a chief of staff to President Clinton and now is running the transition committee, had really - an interesting choice, and I think this was a choice that was made by Joe Biden to pick Ron Klein, who was Vice President Gore's chief of staff, to be his chief of staff.",
        "And the question becomes, then, is this really the Clintons' return?",
        "And it comes in an unusual package, because remember that Senator Obama defeated Senator Clinton.",
        "And so there are lots of people asking questions about, well, you know, is it just the third term for President Clinton?",
        "And I think the answer is no. But, right now, if you looked at this transition, I think lots of people are just scratching their head and wondering how far this goes and whether it's just a case that the Democratic bench is limited to Clinton people after two terms of President Clinton.",
        "Although the other side to that argument is you've got experienced people hitting the ground running, and you're not going to have the disarray that you saw when President Clinton was first elected, when he did bring in a whole band of outsiders."
