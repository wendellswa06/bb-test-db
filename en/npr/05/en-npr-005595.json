        "Fine, thanks.",
        "Well, we spoke last on Friday, when Sarah Palin was first introduced.",
        "Since then, some potentially damaging news has come out, of course, her daughter's pregnancy, her shifting support for federal earmarks, and the bridge to nowhere.",
        "How are you feeling today, on Tuesday?",
        "Are you as enthusiastic?",
        "Well, I hope that the response that I offered Friday was more analysis than advocacy.",
        "I guess what I would say a few days later is, there is still a lot of open questions about Sarah Palin.",
        "And as we talked about on Friday, Senator McCain took a big risk in naming someone so unknown to the ticket and hope (unintelligible) would appear to be two political objectives.",
        "One he is clearly looking to rally the party's securities base, and it seems he has done that.",
        "Second, he's hoping to reach out - use her to help reach out to some of Senator Clinton's supporters and other working class voters.",
        "I think it is still an open question whether these revelations help, hurt, or don't matter in that regard.",
        "OK.",
        "So what we're hearing from the convention, though, is there's a lot of support for his choice, that people are rallying around the choice, at least at the convention, and among the party faithful.",
        "And so from that perspective, has it achieved at least one of those objectives, which is rallying the base?",
        "There's no question it has achieved that first objective.",
        "McCain, even though he's been gradually shoring up support among conservatives, that support to a large degree has seemed very dutiful.",
        "And now, there is much more enthusiasm, it seems, both gauged by what's going on in St. Paul, but also by his fundraising and organizing efforts.",
        "But the real key as to whether Sarah Palin was the right choice or not is how he reaches out to those working-class voters - more accurately, how she helps him do it.",
        "Neither Senator McCain himself or, for that matter, Senator Obama has been particularly successful reaching these voters the way Senator Clinton did in the spring.",
        "I think, just as Barack Obama selected Joe Biden in (unintelligible) because of Biden's ability to talk to these - this key voting bloc.",
        "That was one of the main considerations for Senator McCain's selection, but it's really only been three or four days since she was selected, and I think it's worth giving it at least a week to figure out whether the pick was a smart one or not."
