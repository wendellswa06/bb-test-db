        "Much more serious, the report found that disparities between black and white children continue through the rest of their school careers.",
        "Yes.",
        "That black-white disparity in suspensions even gets a little bigger in K-12.",
        "We see it with expulsions as well and notably with black girls, who are five times more likely than their white peers to be suspended.",
        "And a related area to the discipline issues in this release has to do with what is sometimes called the school-to-prison pipeline?",
        "Yes.",
        "That's a term that advocates use to describe the set of structures in place that tend to get certain groups of youth less connected to school and more likely to be in trouble with the law.",
        "And so, for example, we see that over half of high schools with large black and Hispanic populations have a sworn law enforcement officer on the premises.",
        "And, in fact, there are 1.6 million students who attend a school that has no counselor, but that does have a police officer in the building every day.",
        "But are those two facts related?",
        "Are numbers better where there is a guidance counselor?",
        "If cops keep school peaceful, perhaps that works for students other than the ones suspended.",
        "Well, that may be true.",
        "On the other hand, civil rights groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center argue that the presence of police in schools is linked to the inappropriate escalation of incidents into the courts.",
        "And this survey found that black students are 2.3 times more likely to be than whites to be referred to law enforcement or arrested as a result of something that happens at school.",
        "There are several items in this report that get at the actual quality of education, right?",
        "Yes.",

        "When you talk about issues like which school has a security officer versus a counselor or which schools have AP courses, that isn't necessarily racial discrimination, is it?",

        "Well, you raise a good point.",
