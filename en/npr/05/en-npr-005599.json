        "Thank you so much for having me.",
        "I'm really happy to be here.",
        "So, you know, you bring together a lot of different topics here, and it isn't really just Russia.",
        "I do have to say that one of the things that this book does is - you say it yourself - it stitches together - I'm reading here - it says it's a thread that wraps its way around the globe from Oklahoma and Texas and Washington, D.C., to London, Kyiv, Siberia, Moscow, Equatorial Guinea, the Alaskan Arctic and to a trove of Michael Jackson memorabilia, a luxury hotel in Central London, a divorce court in Oklahoma City, a crappy office building offering its workers a free power supply in St. Petersburg, Russia.",
        "There's a throughline here, and the throughline is oil.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I did not set out to write a book about oil and gas.",
        "I didn't set out to write a book at all, but I was very curious.",
        "I found myself putting a lot of focus on my show on what Russia did in 2016.",
        "I was really stuck in terms of trying to figure out their motive force, not just for why they would want to influence our election but for why they would try to do it in that way, why they would throw that kind of very innovative, MacGyver kind of wild punch at us.",
        "And I ended up getting to this issue of oil and gas, and it surprised me as much as I think it might surprise anybody.",
        "But I do think that the Russian economy being a mess and being totally dependent on oil and gas does explain some of Russia's weakness.",
        "And some of Russia's weakness explains why they attacked us in the way they did.",
        "So the beginning kind of nugget of this is that you're trying to understand what Russia's motivation would be.",
        "And what you see is that they want to use oil and gas as a tool for expressing kind of global power.",
        "But your thesis says it's larger than that.",
        "I mean, your thesis is that Russia, like a number of other countries, is basically the victim of a resource curse, right?",
        "Would you talk about what that means?",
        "Sure.",
        "The basic idea is that if, in your country, you've got natural resources, that somebody is going to pay to come into your country and extract and then sell on the international market.",
        "That seems like something that ought to economically benefit your country.",
        "You will get new revenue from the extraction and sale of your natural resources.",
        "But what we see over and over again is that selling off your natural resources in the commodities market tends to kind of ruin your country.",
        "It tends to leave you worse off, even economically worse off.",
        "And that's because it has a warping effect on your economy.",
        "It's hard to have a diversified, stable economy when you've got one resource that's pulling in such a big revenue stream.",
        "And when you've got one resource that's pulling in such a big revenue stream, you tend to end up with very rich elites who will do anything to hold onto power, who stop doing the other things that governments should otherwise be doing to serve the needs of the people.",
        "OK.",
        "So what does this have to do with Michael Jackson's glove?",
        "(Laughter) Well, it's both a sad and all areas side story in this.",
        "The government in Equatorial Guinea got all these oil revenues.",
        "And they basically decided to turn the president of the country and his son into some of the richest and most ostentatiously, flagrantly tacky people on the globe while the people of that country suffered and got poorer.",
        "And the son of the president of Equatorial Guinea amassed one of the world's great supercar collections and amassed mansions in the most flamboyant places in the world and put together a really spectacular collection of Michael Jackson memorabilia, all on oil revenue money that was essentially looted from the treasury of his country."
