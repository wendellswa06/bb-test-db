        "A report out this week from one of the engineering teams investigating the levee failures and flooding during Katrina - this one led by the University of California at Berkeley, and funded by Berkeley and the National Science Foundation; this report concludes that much of the damage was not due to the size of the storm.",
        "It wasn't the size of the storm that was the problem, but the flaws in the way the levees were designed, built and maintained.",
        "And so for the rest of the hour, we're going to talk about what needs to be done to protect New Orleans from future flooding.",
        "Are there lessons here to be learned for places, and from places like the Netherlands and Japan?",

        "Bees aren't exposed to it.",
        "They aren't insecticides and bees are insects, right?",
        "So bees are very, very sensitive to these pesticides.",
        "The thing is there's two - there are sort of different ways in which bees actually could be exposed to these.",
        "One, is at planting time, you know, there can be dust that goes off the plant or, you know, from these seeds, these pesticide-coated seeds.",
        "That's one way in which bees, you know, can actually be exposed to, you know, high amounts, enough to kill them, in isolated cases.",
        "But the pesticide actually goes with the growing plant, from the seed.",
        "As the plant grows, the pesticide - small amounts - go with the plant, and that's what makes them effective.",
        "Insects, like, you know, feed on the plant and die.",
        "Bees feed on the pollen, and could also be exposed to very low amounts."
