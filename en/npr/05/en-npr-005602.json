        "Are they suffering the same kind of fate?",
        "Well, it's good that you bring that up, actually, because we focus a lot on the honeybees, because they're the ones we know and they make the honey for us, and these are the ones that are easily managed and that get, you know, sort of transported around and provide commercial, what they call pollination services.",
        "But honeybees, you know, they are - they're foreign to this continent.",
        "They were brought here from Europe, originated, probably, you know, in Africa.",
        "But they're useful for agriculture.",
        "You know, sort of extensive, intensive agriculture requires, in some cases - in the case of almonds, certainly, also - intensive pollination, and you bring in lots and lots of hives of honeybees to do that.",
        "bumblebees, leafcutter bees, carpenter bees.",
        "And, you know, there's been some interesting research lately on their sort of health.",
        "And there's sort of two things to keep in mind.",
        "One is that they are also very affected by the things that we're talking about - for instance, the changing use of land and the declining sort of prevalence of flowers in the landscape.",
        "But the other side is people didn't realize how important they were also for pollination of crops.",
        "And there was some research done, and if there are lots of native bees around, no matter how many honeybees you put into your orchard, the native bees actually make a better crop for you, for unknown reasons.",
        "Maybe they just sort of are attracted to different kinds of flowers in a different way.",
        "But the native bees that you don't manage, that just are there because of the landscape, are contributing significantly to agricultural production.",
        "So, again, are the natural bees suffering the same colony collapse?",
        "Well, not colony collapse, as such, but their numbers certainly are down - maybe not for the same reasons, except for the important reason of habitat change.",
        "They may also be affected if they - you know, if the honeybees are being affected by the pesticides, the native bees probably are, as well.",
        "They may not be afflicted so much by the mites in the hives that are affecting honeybees.",
        "I'm not sure about that, actually.",
        "I'm not a big bee expert.",
        "But they certainly are affected by sort of the declining habitat.",
        "And we've just heard that there will be more corn planted this year than ever before in our history.",
        "Dan Charles, thank you very much, and we'll hope for the recovery of the bees."

        "So the flooding is certainly not going to be over on the Missouri River for the next several days, but it should be as bad as it has been the last few days anyway.",
        "So the conditions will persist for several more days at any rate?",

        "Well, we have eight authorized purposes, and flood control is one of those authorized purposes.",
        "When we get into a situation like we had this weekend, flood control is the priority here.",
        "What happened with this particular flood is that it is produced from runoff from tributary streams that come in below our large storage reservoirs up in South Dakota, North Dakota and Montana.",
