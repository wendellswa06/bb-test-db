        "It can cause some damage to the airplane, but the airplane should stay airworthy and should be able to fly.",
        "So it may be that the storms are related to what happened, but the storms in and of themselves should not have caused the airplane to come down.",
        "Another thing people find hard to understand, why couldn't the pilots - there was no time to radio a mayday?",
        "When you're out over the ocean, when you're offshore, you can't use the same radio that you use when you're over land masses.",
        "So, over land masses, we use what we call VHF radio, which is line-of-sight.",
        "And when you're in that situation, you can just pick up the radio and call quickly.",
        "Over the oceans, you use what we call high-frequency radio.",
        "It's short wave radio.",
        "And it's literally like going back to the 1940s where you have to tune the radio, and you're basically bouncing the signals off the ionosphere.",
        "As a result, pilots don't normally listen to the radio full-time.",
        "They only use it for their check-ins every 600 miles or so."
