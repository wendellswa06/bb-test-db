        "Yeah.",
        "It didn't vanish from radar.",

        "The private sector gained 64,000 jobs, but the gains are still pretty modest.",
        "And that's, you know, consistent with what we've been seeing this year; which is, you know, some private sector job growth, but not enough to keep pace with the population growth as a whole not a really enough to make any kind of dent at all in the huge unemployment problem.",
        "We had 14.8 million people looking for work in September, and actually, the unemployment rate would be a lot higher if you include all those people who are working fewer hours than they'd like, and all those people who've grown so discouraged that that they don't even bother looking any more.",
        "Okay, so job losses in the public sector that is government jobs.",

        "The stock market is hovering around 11,000, it's doing well-ish.",
        "What are investors seeing that makes them more optimistic?",
        "Yeah, I think the - what you've seen there is a lot of a lot of companies have figured out ways to cut costs, so they're doing pretty well, and they're the survivors.",
        "I think a lot of economists will tell you that this is just part of the process of recovering from a recession.",
        "You know, they're the ones who are going to be in a good position to, sort of, take off when the economy really rebounds.",

        "What stands out from your study - you had three major conclusions and critical ingredients to this Hurricane Katrina, and the fact is that the flooding was the result of pre-existing weakness in the city's system, and not from the storm itself.",
        "That's correct.",
        "We found the system essentially riddled with extremely important and critical flaws and defects, and these things had, not by intent or by some sort of evil force, been embedded in the system.",
        "But largely since the 1965 Hurricane Betsy that I referred to, we riddled the system with flaws.",
        "And when it was seriously challenged by Hurricane Katrina, we failed.",
        "What kids of flaws are we talking about here?",
        "Well, they could be on technology flaws, where we failed to connect the dots properly.",
        "It could be where we were focused on the construction of individual projects and losing our sensitivity to the overall flood protection system that needed to be intact there.",
        "We had lots of interface or connection breakdowns in the system where we would erode a soft soil levee right next to a higher standing concrete floodwall, where normally you'd want that soil levee higher than the concrete wall, so that when water did overtop the system, we would attack the concrete and not that erodible soil.",
        "So many, many breakdowns at these connections, which I think are indicative of a long-term, long incubation period, where we were looking at pieces and not the entire system.",
        "Is it that the specs, you know, as we say in engineering, the specs for the levees were wrong, or they're just not built to the specs?",
        "Well, in fact, we found evidence of both.",
        "The specifications, by and large, sort of got frozen back in the 1960s period, and, in fact - some, in fact, pre-date the 1960s.",
        "That's a way of saying that we were unable to keep pace with the advancement in technology.",
        "In other cases, we found clearer evidence where even the specifications were being, you might call it, sidestepped or modified to - in an attempt to work with what we had.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So these kinds of things end up embedding flaws.",
        "And it was your conclusion that if everything worked as it should have, if the system had been built as it should have been built, there would not have been a catastrophe?",
        "That is exactly right.",
        "The way I explain it to my wife and to my friends is, if everything that we had in place there worked as we wanted it to, we would be back repairing some shingles and perhaps mopping up some wet carpets.",
        "But by no means would we have the catastrophe that those people are continuing to struggle through."
