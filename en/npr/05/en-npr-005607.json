        "Ivor Van Heerden, didn't scientists in New Orleans know what a Katrina-size storm surge could do and create - the havoc?",
        "You know, scientists in Louisiana have been warning for over ten years that southeast Louisiana, and especially New Orleans, were super susceptible.",
        "And from about 2000 onwards, we've been able to use the ADCIRC surge model to just show how vulnerable that is.",
        "Yes.",
        "So New Orleans was and still is extremely vulnerable to flooding from major hurricanes.",
        "Bob Bea was talking about some of the deficiencies in the way that the levees were created.",
        "Can you give us, from your own analysis, what some of them might be like?",
        "Well, I think one of the most glaring things is, and Bob referred to this, the use of a standard project hurricane, which was a design hurricane, which dated back to 1959.",
        "And even though the Corps had been instructed by the Chief of the Army to use newer definitions, they never did that.",
        "So if they had used what they were supposed to, we would've been designing for a Category Four storm, 140 mile an hour winds.",
        "So there's the first thing that ends up.",
        "With a weaker storm, you don't have to put the levees as high.",
        "The second thing, you know, that Bob mentioned, that really stood out to us, was the cost-cutting measures, where the original design memorandums called for very robust T-wall designs, and we ended up with I-walls.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And then the other thing that stood out was our team looked at the way the Corps had calculated the soil strengths and come up with the designs for the sheet piles and the foundations.",
        "And we found a number of errors on the way they did their calculations, and obviously, in other cases, they just didn't get the sheet pile down deep enough.",
        "Hi, Juan.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Now that the Corps has rebuilt most - almost all the levees, I'll ask all of you, and I'll ask you first Ivor.",

        "No.",
        "If we had another Katrina, we would se overtopping of levees that aren't high enough.",
        "There's still a lot of I-wall and other sections of the levees that are in a weakened state.",
        "And as good a job as the Corps has done on the eastern side along the Mississippi River Gulf outlet, those are still unarmored urban levees; they don't have grass.",

        "Hmm.",
        "David Daniel, you agree?",
        "Largely, I guess I would say that I agree.",
        "And I might just indicate that I chair a 14-person committee that is reviewing the inter-agency performance evaluation team's work, and we have commented on a number of pieces of the work.",
        "It's very interesting to me that there's so much in common of what these different groups in different parts of the country are concluding about the engineering and some of the deficiencies.",
        "Although there may be some differences in some of the interpretations, we're largely, I think, all saying basically the same thing.",
        "If you're all saying…",
        "Yes, go ahead, I'm sorry, Bob.",

        "Thanks to you and the team, you've reestablished my faith in our American Society of Civil Engineers.",
        "You guys have done a great job.",
        "Well, thank you, and I might just take a moment.",
        "There really are several key things that you've heard that we've identified.",
        "The first is that no one agency or single entity is in charge.",
        "We called it organizational dysfunction, and we know from NASA and other engineering failures that you can't fix engineering - you can't make good engineering when you have organizational discontinuity.",
        "No amount of good science and calculations is going to make for an exceptionally sound system of levees and flood protection in New Orleans, unless the organizational issues are addressed.",
        "Now, I know - I know that's sort of a jargon and hard for us to understand.",
        "You really want to say something more specific.",
        "When you say the organizational problems that could mean for us a lot of things.",
        "I know you know what it means.",
        "Can you explain in detail what that means?",
        "Why wasn't it - what was the problem?",
        "Well, let me just give you - let me just sort of paint the picture, first of all.",
        "You've got local levee boards that have certain sets of responsibilities.",
        "Local parishes that operate pumps.",
        "Cities and state government agencies, federal agencies, The Corps of Engineers itself with multiple agencies, and then Congress providing marching orders and dollars to fuel all this.",
        "But the problem is that no one entity has any comprehensive set of authority or responsibility to look at the whole system.",
        "That's why it developed piecemeal.",
        "Furthermore, if you're a levee designer, you need to make some assumptions about whether trees are going to be allowed to grow on the levees, for example.",
        "Trees are a very bad thing on levees during hurricanes because they blow over, they pull out giant root balls and extract huge masses of earth from the levee.",
        "That's a very bad thing.",
        "Are there trees growing on levees?"

        "Yes there are.",
        "Yes.",
        "And if you are a designer for, let's say, the Corps of Engineers you have to make some assumption about whether there are going to be trees there or not.",
        "But if you have absolutely no control over that, you know, if you're a really prudent person then you'd probably say, well, my gosh, trees might grow, but then you wind up making the levees so massively wide or you build them out of concrete.",
        "A much more rational and sensible approach is for there to be some degree of connectivity between the choices that different entities make and the results that result.",
        "And right now we don't have that.",
        "There's still no one decision-making body about what to do?",
        "No, and the coordination is not nearly as deep as it could be or should be.",

        "We don't know how to fix organizations, but we do know when science and engineering based organizations are not functioning to the degree of effectiveness needed, and that's precisely what we have in the New Orleans area at this time.",
        "Well, knowing what you just said, how does that impact the fact that -like Ivor was saying these levees are not high enough and strong enough to withstand another hurricane like Katrina or greater - whose decision is that not to make them higher or bigger?",
        "Well, first of all, come back to the standard project hurricane.",
        "How do you pick how high you will make the levees?",
        "The rational person would do some sort of a futuristic forecasting or probabilities and make some selection.",
        "For example, we might pick the hundred-year hurricane, although the Netherlands has chosen the ten thousand year hurricane.",
        "There needs to be an informed - a science informed decision process that involves the people of New Orleans and our governmental decision-makers.",
        "And thus far, we have not had the science-based facts presented in a way that there could be a rational discussion and decision-making process.",

        "Anytime you'd like to.",
        "Well, I think the first thing we have to recognize is that Congress, through 1965 Flood Control Act, directed the Corps of Engineers to build the levees around New Orleans for the most severe meteorological event that could reasonably occur.",
        "And so, in many ways, this was a Corps of Engineers led operation.",
        "Now, part of the problem that the Corps of Engineers has is, if you look at its management structure, and I think this is reflected in some of the decisions the Corps makes, every three years we get a new colonel coming through New Orleans.",
        "So it takes him about a year-and-a-half to learn how to pronounce the names in Louisiana, he's just getting his feet on the ground and then he's gone.",
        "So most of the decisions are made at middle management levels.",
        "And I think that's one of the failings of this whole system is that you've got these people who are in supreme power, in many cases, coming in and going out very, very regularly.",
        "And it's hard to have a long-term project, to take a long-term management approach as you needed here in New Orleans with the levee systems.",
        "So the thing is broken in many, many, many places, and we really need to recognize that as we try and move forward and come up with a new system.",
        "Talking about Hurricane Katrina and other - and preparing for the next one on TALK OF THE NATION: SCIENCE FRIDAY from NPR News.",
        "I'm Ira Flatow with Robert Bea; Ivor van Heerden, author of The Storm: What Went Wrong and Why During Hurricane Katrina - The Inside Story From One Louisiana Scientist; David Daniel, Chairman of the American Society of Civil Engineers' External Review Panel, President of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
        "What can we learn from - hearing what you just said, Ivor, and also everybody -what can we learn from other places where these systems work?",
        "Like - you mentioned the Netherlands.",
        "What kind of, you know, scientific or what kind of review system do they have to ensure that it works there?",
        "Well, I think as David mentioned, you know, having a full accounting of the risks and probabilities enables you to come up with decisions related to levee heights.",
        "And, you know, as we go forward here in Louisiana, I'm really encouraging everybody to look at the Netherlands.",
        "When you compare our levees to theirs, you know, it's almost shameful.",
        "They've got it right.",
        "You know, they've got lots of technique.",
        "They've combined hard structures and earthen levees, compartmentalization.",
        "They've got some excellent pump technology.",
        "You know, we could learn a lot from them.",
        "But the plus that we have in Louisiana that the Netherlands doesn't have is we have our coastal wetlands - what's left of them - we have barrier islands, and we have the sediment of the Mississippi River.",
        "So combining, you know, the levees - looking at the Dutch, learning from them, combining the levees with wetlands, with barrier islands, gives us, in essence, a three-tier level of protection."

        "I'm thinking of New York; I'm thinking of other cities around the world.",
        "Is it possible to actually build in these places gates and floodgates and levees that might hold out the sea?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, I think it is.",
        "Tell us.",
        "How would they do that?",
        "You go to the places where we've got a potential to bring water into the areas we want to protect, and then, as Ivor was outlining, you look first to nature by understanding that you need to respect and engineer with nature not against or contrary to.",
        "And at that point you start to say, well, where can I defend first?",
        "In essence, in this context, the water is the enemy and we need to find out how to slow it down, number one; and number two, when it starts to get out of hand, we need to be able to control the water levels and the wave action.",
        "So gates in some places are things we want to think about, levees are, pumps are, evacuation techniques are, water ponding are.",
        "So there's a wide variety, a wide arsenal, of things that we have at our disposal to not only help areas like New Orleans, but other areas that have important deltas around the United States and, of course, many of the coastal areas that will be - we'll call it stressed, by things like rising sea levels.",
