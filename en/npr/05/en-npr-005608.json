        "We're talking this hour about hurricanes, levees, and ways to protect cities with my guests Ivor van Heerden, author of The Storm: What Went Wrong and Why During Hurricane Katrina, the inside story from one Louisiana scientist, out this week from Viking.",
        "He's also Director for the study of Public Health Impacts of Hurricanes and Deputy Director, LSU Hurricane Center at LSU in Baton Rouge.",
        "David Daniel, Chair of the American Society of Civil Engineers' External Review Panel, President of the University of Texas at Dallas.",
        "Robert Bea, member of the Independent Levee Investigation Team, Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at U.C.",
        "Berkeley.",
        "Our number 1-800-989-8255.",
        "Considering that there are these that we mentioned that need to be protected during increased hurricane ferocity and ocean rising, wouldn't this be a good time, gentlemen, for cities to start thinking about a project that could take 50, 100 years?",
        "That is exactly right.",
        "We need to make prevention the number one on our list.",
        "You know, it's going to take a long time to get ahead of the problem in a sensible way.",
        "I think the other thing that we need to recognize is when to give up.",
        "That's a way to say that in some cases we need to surrender back to the coastal areas and back to other river areas what it is that we should not be protecting; or another way to let nature do its job.",
        "So there's some hard decisions that have to come forward, and it's going to take a significant amount of time to mobilize the works, get them into place.",
        "But I think the key is first to recognize that we need to get ahead of flooding.",
        "It is, to my knowledge, the single most devastating and damaging thing to the people of the United States that we have to suffer within our confines; and with all of the technology that we have and I think we know how to start thinking about how to approach it.",
        "So the problem is not the way.",
        "The problem is the will and the focus on prevention in, in this case, flooding.",
        "I think one way to look at it is, New Orleans could be the test bed for the rest of the coastal portions of the U.S., and probably elsewhere in the world.",
        "You know, the Dutch have achieved it; sixty-percent of their country's below sea level.",
        "Dealing with the soft soils of New Orleans, its unique geomorphology and the fact that we've got these wetlands that could be a real part of the protection, you know, we could learn a lot as we try and sort this out that could be applicable elsewhere.",
        "How are you, Farai?",
        "I would agree with that.",
        "And I think one of the lessons learned is that in critical life safety issues like this, where infrequent but catastrophic events occur, like a major earthquake, we tend to forget as time passes.",
        "And history has also taught us that to make it work you have to create very systematic rigorous practices for continually assessing life safety.",
        "For example, in large dams - earthen and concrete dams - where failure would be catastrophic, we have federal programs in place to periodically inspect and reevaluate the safety of those structures.",
        "We have to be in this for the long run or we won't succeed."

        "Hi, Malcolm.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY.",
        "Well, good morning, gentlemen.",
        "I'm glad you brought this subject up.",
        "It's very important.",
        "I have a question, but I'd like to preface it by saying I used to work for the geological survey and the Forest Service, and one of my responsibilities was designing culverts for road - you know, creeks going under roads and what not, and we designed them to be able to pass, theoretically, a one-hundred-year flood.",
        "Now, that's fine if a culvert washes out, you got and put a new culvert in and cover it with more dirt, but to protect a city like New Orleans with only a one-hundred-year flood protection seems really, really weak to me.",
        "And I wonder - my question is, what would the relative cost be to build levees that would protect New Orleans against a 500 or 1, 000 or 10,000-year flood, compared to rebuilding the city again?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Ok.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "You want me to pick up Malcolm's question?",
        "Sure.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Good question.",
        "Good question, Malcolm.",
        "I think the answer is the conditions that we've been designing New Orleans for are way under the mark.",
        "There's a vast, I'll call it armada, of structures that we have founded around the world in the deep ocean, and I'll refer to the wonderful world of offshore structures.",
        "Those structures are designed to resist conditions at their ultimate limit state, when they fail.",
        "So, in essence, we've got water coming - not only through but over your culvert - that are in the range of the 10,000 year return periods that Ivor was talking about before.",
        "So for number one, we need to sort of push into gear current technology and current thinking about how to manage risk.",
        "And that says, well, we've got to change from this thinking about the 100-year thing to starting to think about these more, we'll call it obscure, less probable, events that nonetheless happen.",
        "And when they do, they're catastrophic.",
        "Now that also says that we can't use brute force and ignorance to kind of stand up against these things.",
        "Things like defenses and depth and robustness or damage and defect tolerance have got to show up in the system, as well.",
        "So not only have we got to have a pipe big enough to get the water through, we've got to be able to defend the road, because that's what the culvert is trying to do."

        "And how would, in terms of hurricane protection, how would you, in concrete terms, how would you translate that?",
        "Well, I think Ivor was started down that track when he said, well -and, in fact, I gave this problem to my class that works on risk management.",
        "We looked at New Orleans and came to the conclusion that, based on economics and standards of practice and historic precedent like the New Orleans - or pardon me, like the Netherlands - that we would need to go for a 10,000-year level of protection in most areas.",
        "It could be 1,000 in other areas, depending on what we were protecting.",
        "The next step we took was, well, how do we do that?",
        "And, at this point, we started thinking about big levees, and levee heights of 40 or 50 feet started to show up.",
        "And, at this point, you say, hey, this isn't sustainable.",
        "If you try and pile up something like this in a permanent works, with subsidence and settlement, you can expect it to go down.",
        "So, at that point, we had to abandon the traditional, what I call brute force approach, and start thinking about defenses in depth.",
        "And here's where Ivor said, well, let's start tripping the ocean out there at those barrier beaches.",
        "Slow her down; then let's use those wetlands to help absorb some of the turbulence and energy out of the water.",
        "And then - and that's been called, by the way, many times, horizontal levees - and then, by the time we get to the perimeters we're trying to defend - this third level -we've now got earthen levees, and in some cases, indeed, gates, where we can stop the water from getting into areas around New Orleans like Pontchartrain and Lake Bourne.",
        "And, at that point, you say, well even then I've got to have pump stations to get water out of these low-lying areas.",
        "What you're doing is you're developing a system, and the system is one that starts with nature - so uses the natural defenses and then compliments nature with engineered works, so that we have a system in place that is environmentally friendly and very, very, importantly, we can afford it and sustain it.",
        "So I think we're learning again, it's not the ways that are the devil here, it's the will to go and do it.",
        "I'd - Bob, I would just add - that was beautifully described.",
        "I would just add that we are where we are because things developed piecemeal.",
        "It was never a comprehensively thought through as a system.",
        "I think it would be a huge mistake to assume a priori that it would be economically infeasible to provide a reasonable level of protection to the New Orleans area.",
        "But I think in providing that protection, just as you described, we need a much more comprehensive systems-oriented approach.",
        "You can't think of it just in terms of, well let's build today's levees higher and that will solve the problem.",
        "Amen, brother.",

        "Robert Bea, member of the Independent Levee Investigation Team and Professor of civil and environmental engineering, University of California-Berkeley.",
        "Yeah, I think you both hit the nail on the head.",
        "In fact, in my book I try and put a conceptual plan together that looks at this, how we can maximize getting the sediment out of the Mississippi River to build the wetlands, how we can go offshore and mine the sand to build the barrier islands, and then we are - there's no question about it - we are going to have to retreat from parts of Louisiana.",
        "There's some communities that are just too vulnerable; they're too small and near the coast.",
        "The other thing that's very important is some of the artificial levees that protect us from river floods, and especially on the lower parts of the Mississippi River downstream from New Orleans, actually exacerbate that storm surge with storms like Katrina.",
        "So we may well want to, as we move forward, recognize we're going to have to bend in some communities and we're going to have to degrade some of these large river flood control levees.",
        "But it's that systems approach, and in the past we've looked at coastal wetland as one issue in Louisiana, levees as another issue, and never did the twain meet.",
        "Now we have to do this all as one.",
        "What other cities around the country have to do this planning about whether, you know, where do you move the defenses?",
        "Like a general, what can we defend properly, and what is just too sparse and pulled apart and low-lying -what places do we have to abandon?",
        "I mean there...",
        "That needs to be looked at very seriously.",
        "I've talked with a lot of people in southern Louisiana that, in fact, inhabit the bayous and areas down south of New Orleans into Plaquemines Parish.",
        "Those people are smart.",
        "I mean, they know that putting a levee around them is not the protection that, in fact, is sensible, and hence they are thinking about elevated homes and, in some cases, they're even thinking about disposable homes.",
        "Hmm.",
        "So sensibility, I think, is the way to go.",
        "Now, one of the things that I would hasten to add - needs to be appended to this word system that we're talking about.",
        "It's something we address in our report in depth, and that's called the technology delivery system.",
        "So that, in addition to worrying about levees and wetlands and barrier beaches, this technology delivery system that struggles to unite, number one, the public, the people that we're here to protect and to serve, then brings in the focus - the government that is supposed to be representing our people, and we'll call it making wise and good decisions about the allocation of our resources; and number three, the very, very important one in the middle of all of this called industry and commerce.",
        "And ultimately, we think that not only nature first and engineering second, but the mobilization of the technology delivery system becomes absolutely critical.",
        "If you get these two things together, and perhaps focusing on the U.S.",
        "Army Corps of Engineers as a servant to that technology delivery system, we can start to draw into reasonable focus how to accomplish what looks to be impossible.",
        "Mm-hmm."

        "But shouldn't cities and - or places like the Florida Keys and other low-lying places, shouldn't they be saying to themselves, hey, you know, we just missed what they had.",

        "You're exactly right, Ira.",

        "All of those places need to - we'll call it feel the pangs of pain that the people in southern Louisiana have felt, as a - we'll call it, early forewarning of what can happen when you turn your back on the sea.",
        "So I think it's time to turn our face towards the sea, take sensible action to defend ourselves, and, as we've noted, know when to surrender; and also, by the way, when to preserve.",
        "There's a lot of our coastal areas are, by the way, are river rain areas that need to have respect given to them.",
        "So that, in some cases, we want the flooding to happen so that we can preserve the wetlands, preserve the breeding grounds for waterfowl and the marine life that is a part of our life.",
        "And so there is a major issue that, in fact, this painful experience can help serve the rest of the people of the United States.",
        "And I'd dearly love to see us stand proud at the end of this experience.",
        "You know, one other issue that enters into this is perhaps the regulatory issue, in that if, in many cases, and I'm just going to pick on one - building on barrier islands - you know, anybody that builds in the barrier islands is going to be a sitting duck for a hurricane at some point in time.",
        "And we may have to recognize that we may have to strengthen regulations, in terms of where we can develop and where we can't develop.",
        "You know, from building in flood plains to barrier islands to perhaps some other locations where we're expanding our urban areas.",
        "So it's a very complicated issue, but it's something that we, in the U.S., can readily handle.",
        "We've got the expertise, we've got the technology; there's a lot of this research going on at a number of different institutions and universities.",
        "But we've got to get it under an umbrella organization that can look at all aspects and be cognizant of every little issue as it goes forward with its planning and ultimate construction.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Last words - David Daniel?",
        "Well, I would just add that there's an enormous amount of science and technology capacity and capability available, and it has not yet manifested itself in a protection system for the citizens of the New Orleans area that's at a level consistent with the best in the world, such as the Netherlands."
