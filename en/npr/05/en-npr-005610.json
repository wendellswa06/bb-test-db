        "I think that the professionalism - if you look at the statistics of the crews in most of the developed world is excellent.",
        "And if you look at the accident rates, they're no different in Europe than they are in the U.S.,.",
        "There are some differences in procedures and style.",
        "But I wouldn't say that, you know, one country has cowboys and the other country doesn't.",
        "I would also note that from, you know, taking a trip standpoint, you know, I wouldn't be worried about it.",
        "You know, by any measure, commercial aviation is the safest way to travel.",

        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "In the U.S., we lose about 40,000 people a year in car accidents.",
        "We actually have more people run over by trains than we have killed in aviation accidents.",
        "And a colleague actually of mine has calculated that if you were to take a flight once a day, day in and day out, for, you know, every day of the year, you'd have to live 35,000 years before statistically you'd be in a fatal aircraft accident.",

        "And I forgot to ask you, John Hansman, about part of that earlier call.",

        "Normally, aircraft maneuver around thunderstorms, as I understand it, in that part of the world - near the equator - that's not always possible?",
        "They were flying through - when you go north-south through the equator, you fly through what we call the intertropical convergence zone.",
        "And it's an area that tends to develop bands of thunderstorms, long bands of thunderstorms that run east-west.",

        "And apparently from the satellite reports, in order to get around that line of thunderstorms, they would have had to go 300 or 400 miles out of their way.",
        "So it's likely they would pick the place of lowest precipitation and penetrate the line at that location.",

        "Gabrielle with us from Sacramento.",
        "You know, I - this is such an important topic to me, and I'm glad you're asking the question.",
        "And I'm glad you're talking about the statistics, because until an airline has an, you know, an incident like this based on incompetence and complete neglect, I will keep flying as much as possible, for business and pleasure.",
        "Because the statistics, you just said, are always in my favor as a passenger.",
        "And I don't think any airline would do something like this neglectful.",
        "It's devastating, but I just - I would hate for anybody to not fly based on this one isolated incident.",
        "So Gabrielle, you might be more concerned by the crash of that flight up in Buffalo, which was judged to be due to the inexperience of the pilot on that particular aircraft?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And I, you know, I have to say, I have flown a lot of the smaller regional jets, and that's the only time I'm ever a little bit nervous.",
        "I know they have younger, less experienced pilots flying those.",
        "And you've, you know, pilots go through a lot of kind of stress, I think, when they're first starting out.",
        "And those flights make me somewhat nervous, and it's usually a short hop, 45 minutes or so.",
        "But I have absolutely no problem being on the larger commercial jets.",
        "And I can't even imagine that this is based on incompetence by the airline.",
        "If anything, it's going to be - probably, maybe human error or something to do - connected to storms.",
        "But this will never affect the way I fly.",

        "Hi.",
        "Yes, this is Susan.",
        "I'm a terrified flyer to start with, but I'm leaving June 23 to go to Spain.",
        "And one way I rationalize is that if I could make it through takeoff and landing, that no plane ever crashes over the Atlantic.",
        "And then that happened."

        "So my big question has to do with turbulence because I hear that word, and it strikes fear in my heart.",
        "So I was wondering if he could address that these planes ever just fall out of the sky due to turbulence?",
        "John Hansman?",
        "Generally not.",
        "The cause of turbulence - turbulence is basically just the change in the direction of the air.",
        "And normally the turbulence will be associated with things like storms.",
        "And we have radar onboard the aircraft to identify the storms, and normally try and fly around them.",
        "Occasionally, you'll run into something called clear-air turbulence, where often you get it at the edge of the jet stream.",
        "Again, normally, if there are other airplanes in front of you, they'll tell you when the turbulence - where it is, and you'll have people sit down and put on their seatbelts.",
        "Normally, the risk from turbulence is actually people bouncing around the inside of the airplane if their not strapped down.",
        "That's why you should wear your seatbelt.",
        "And occasionally, there have been cases where a flight attendant was hurt, literally bouncing off the ceiling.",
        "But the airplanes, structurally, are designed to take very severe turbulence, so you shouldn't have a problem of the airplane breaking due to the turbulence.",
        "I know the wings are supposed to - designed to flex in those situations.",
        "I just don't like to look at it.",
        "That's true.",
        "Yeah.",
        "They are designed to flex.",
