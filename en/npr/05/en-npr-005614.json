        "Yeah.",
        "...Really more cases than that because many of those defendants that we've prosecuted have raped more than one woman.",

        "Yes.",
        "...Including, as you note, the fiscal problems that Detroit has been enduring for more than a generation.",
        "But was there also indifference?",
        "Yes, that's all a part of rape culture.",
        "Back then, when some of these kits took place, we had law enforcement in Detroit that really didn't take the case seriously.",
        "And that's really a national problem - it still is when it comes to sexual assault.",
        "I call sexual assault kind of the neglected child of the family - where if we were talking about homicide or if we're talking about carjacking, we wouldn't have this problem.",
        "No one would shelve, let's say, guns and knives that were used as murder weapons.",
        "So - but they did these kits, which also are - each one of them is a box that contain a lot of evidence that could be tested.",
        "And so yes, we have a problem in this country with rape culture.",
        "You see that going on right now.",
        "It's never been more evident than it is now - rape culture, sexual harassment culture, all of that.",
        "And so training was also needed.",
        "Back then, when we first started, we had found police reports in some files that we pulled where police officers were writing very disparaging things about our victims - not believing them, dismissing their cases, not bothering to work on them.",
        "And so that was a part of it as well - not just the neglect, not just no money but just active rape culture in play, where they just did not care.",
        "Based on your expertise, this is happening in a number of cities and counties.",
        "Isn't it?",
        "Yeah.",
        "There are estimated to be over 400,000 untested abandoned rape kits in this country.",
        "And I don't know if you're familiar with Michigan Stadium right here in our state.",
        "It seats over 100,000 people.",
        "When I tell people that the amount of untested kits in this country that they're estimated to be - you can fill up the biggest college or national football stadium in the country four times.",
        "And that's if each kit represents a victim - which it does - and you think of game day at Michigan Stadium four times over, that's how many we have in this country.",
        "And that's probably a conservative estimate.",
        "It is absolutely horrible.",
        "And hopefully, it is changing, albeit very slowly."

        "And we went through a congressional hearing.",
        "We went through a Justice Department investigation.",
        "There were some things that went on in the way of the application and use of deadly force, as well as, you know, complaints about police brutality.",
        "We went through all of that.",
        "Our city fathers, as well as the police chiefs, instituted a bunch of reforms.",
        "And so we are much better than a lot of places in the country, but we're not where we need to be.",
        "Do you think there's been a special burden on black police officers in this time period?",
        "Being an African-American police officer is one of the most difficult things that you'll do because there are African-American police officers all around this country and in this city who I talk to on a daily bases that, even before recent history, believe that there were issues between police officers and young black men.",
        "And one of the things that I think creates the problem - I've heard the word utilized a lot in describing the relationship - is that African-American men and particularly young men - say late teens to early-to-mid-30s - are - the word used is demonized."

        "But I'll say that if you're a black police officer in America, there are some difficulties simply because you know that your race and gender has been on the receiving end of some very serious and questionable uses of force, whether they be deadly or just plain force used to make an arrest.",

        "Yes.",
        "Basically, the people who want the elections to proceed because they see that as a necessary step to creating a democracy here and those who want to see a more immediate departure of Tantawi and the military rulers and have authority handed over to a neutral civilian body - for example, the constitutional court."
