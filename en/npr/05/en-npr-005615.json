        "But in terms of the reason for these tactical improvements, which was to allow the Iraqi government to take shape, to allow the Iraqi army and police to get up to speed, to allow the Iraqi people to find a way top economically sustain themselves by dividing up the revenue from oil and other economic enterprises, that that just hasn't come about."
