        "Madeleine, I used to work in San Francisco, and in my head I still see images of the Golden Gate Bridge.",
        "On a ferry boat across the Bay one evening, the bridge pylons exactly framed a cloud that had settled on the distant horizon of the Pacific.",
        "The setting sun lined itself up behind the cloud and made a hot glowing outline all along the rim of the gray mass.",
        "It was a perfect moment, an amazing setting for a film.",
        "But the new documentary, The Bridge, juxtaposes this scenic beauty with the horrific images of people jumping to their deaths.",
        "(Soundbite of movie \"\"The Bridge\"\")",
        "I think the bridge has a romance, a false romantic promise to it, because he's dead.",
        "But he doesn't benefit from it.",
        "So what if his story has that at the end?",
        "He's gone.",
        "Eric Steel directed The Bridge.",
        "He set up cameras and recorded every day in 2004.",
        "There were 24 suicides that year.",
        "He videotaped 23 of them and interviewed family members, friends and people who witnessed the deaths.",
        "I asked Eric Steel why he wanted to make this film.",
        "I saw the World Trade Centers fall from my office and I was very aware of the people who had jumped out of the building rather than die in the inferno.",
        "And when I read in the New Yorker about two years later that the Golden Gate Bridge was the popular suicide destination in the world, I guess I saw some connection.",
        "I imagined that the people who were jumping off the bridge were making a choice to escape this emotional inferno that they were living in.",
        "The idea that two dozen or so people do this every single year, it just sort of felt like if you sat there at the bridge for an entire year and watched and watched you would learn a great deal about something that people don't often see."

        "You know, every time we'd try to make a sort of compendium of physical attributes, we were proved wrong.",
        "I mean the first person that I actually saw in close up climb over was a man who was jogging one minute and he was talking on his cell phone and laughing, and then he hung up his phone and climbed over.",

        "When you saw people who seemed to be in distress, did you feel I should go up there and try to save that person?",

        "And so if we had called or done something every single time we were anxious, it would have been like the boy who cried wolf.",
        "So we had to set some sort of guidelines.",
        "And our guidelines were that any time someone stepped up onto the rail, that was when we would call.",
