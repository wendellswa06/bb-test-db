        "And it is in many ways, but it is certainly happening not only at the doctor level, but companies are rationing.",
        "In the case of Doxil, which is the drug that Susan needed, the company has a waiting list, and it put out a letter on September 23rd saying not everybody on that waiting list is going to get the drug.",
        "So why is it that manufacturers can't simply ramp up production to meet demand?",
        "Well, it's - a lot of people think it's because there's not enough money to be made in these, and we might want to come back to that question.",
        "It's more complicated than that.",
        "But basically there are really very few companies these days in America making these so-called sterile injectables.",
        "Only about seven companies, according to the FDA, produce most of them.",
        "And so when one company has a glitch in the manufacturing process - I mean, there can be some contamination with some particles or something - they have to shut down the line and correct that, and of course they should, but then there's either no other supplier, maybe two or three other suppliers of that drug, and they can't ramp up production fast enough to meet the demand is what I'm told.",

        "We use it intravenously.",
        "Versed doesn't clear the system as quickly.",
        "It doesn't do what we call as clean a recovery as Propofal, and also its onset is slower.",
        "I can knock you out in a matter of 30 seconds or so with an intravenous dose of Propofal.",
        "It might take several minutes more than that with Versed.",

        "Richard, as you've looked into this, is that the explanation you're hearing?",
        "Well, the FDA says that only 11 percent of the drug shortages that we're seeing are due to a company deciding this drug doesn't make me enough money, I'm just going to stop making it, that most of them are due to either the manufacturing problems and contamination or whatever or not enough capacity to meet the demand, that's the usual phrase.",
        "But I think we have to step back and look at what might be called a structural issue in the industry, and again this complicated stuff, and I don't understand it, really, but over the past 10 years or so, it looks as though there's been a great consolidation in the number of companies who were interested in making these injectable drugs.",
        "So as I said before, only seven companies produce most of them, and in a given drug, only one, two or three may make it.",
        "So there's kind of domino effect when something goes wrong.",
        "Now, that seems to say that these drugs are not a very attractive business opportunity, I mean, that you can't make the tens of thousands of dollars per patient that you can with a brand-new, designer, cancer drug, for instance, or multiple sclerosis drug.",
        "These tend to be older drugs.",
        "They've been around for a while.",
        "They're generic, many of them, most of them, and therefore apparently the economics of it are not in favor of a robust supply chain, something that's going to hold up when a problem arises with one company.",

        "Well, I would just take a little bit of issue with what Richard said.",
        "You know, third-party payers encourage the use of generic drugs rather than the more expensive brand products if there is a choice between them.",
        "So I believe that is one of the reasons why so many of the large manufacturers acquired firms that would make generic products, so that it could bring those generic products into their business.",
        "And I have to believe that since seven companies are making generics that they must be making a profit off of them.",
        "How much I don't know because I don't have access to that information, but, you know, with generics being the preferred products, one would assume that there is a market for them."
