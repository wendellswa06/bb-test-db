        "Eddie's(ph) calling us from Chico in California.",
        "Hi, thanks for taking the call.",
        "Sure.",
        "A year or so ago, my wife started suffering some arrhythmia problems, and one of the drugs that worked, in fact the only drug that kind of worked to control her arrhythmia was a drug called Mexelti(ph).",
        "It's not an injectable.",
        "It's been around for a few years, and it was very effective at controlling her arrhythmia.",
        "The problem is that at the time, there were three manufacturers, and two of them elected to stop manufacturing, especially in the dosage that she takes.",
        "So the challenge we ran into was trying to find her the proper daily dosage when there was a dwindling supply of everything.",
        "One of the things that her cardiologist did was change the interval of time that she actually took the medication.",
        "Another change that he made was to change the number of pills.",
        "For instance, she might take five of a lower dosage per day as opposed to three of the quote-unquote normal.",
        "And the most frustrating thing for us about it was that this drug was not readily available simply because there was no manufacturing.",
        "It could be compounded by any of several compounding pharmacies, but our insurance company said that, well, it's a commercially available drug as it is, so there's no need for you to compound it.",
        "And the good people at CareMark, our insurance provider, simply refused to do any coverage of the compounding because it was available commercially, even though there was none to be found.",
        "And the way it finally got resolved is our local pharmacist, who is not part of a large chain, worked his contacts and kept her in a steady supply of this pill until the manufacturing process caught up to demand.",
        "Bona Benjamin, that's clearly not an option for a lot of people.",
        "And I'm not sure it's an option for a lot of drugs, either.",
        "Well, it's not.",
        "Not all drugs can be easily compounded, and some drugs or some therapies probably shouldn't be compounded in compounding facilities - or maybe not compounding facilities but in pharmacies.",
        "And by compounding I mean making a large quantity of drug for distribution for multiple patients."

        "We recently heard about (unintelligible) nutrition solutions, intravenous feeding solutions, made by one compounding company that caused infections in patients and deaths.",
        "So while compounding is part of a pharmacist's training and education and part of their job, compounding is a fairly complex activity, and you really have to be careful.",
        "And I'm very sorry about this caller's situation.",
        "That's not an uncommon thing that we hear when only one manufacturer makes a product, what we call a sole-source product.",
        "Eddie, how's your wife doing?",
        "Well, the medication is currently be manufactured.",
        "Again, they've caught up to demand.",
        "She's doing well.",
        "In fact, we're on our way now to see her cardiologist for a follow-up.",
        "But she's doing well under the medication.",
        "I just hope that it continues to be available in some form because this particular one seems to be the one that she responds to.",
        "All right, thanks very much, we wish her the best of luck, Eddie.",
        "All right, thank you.",
        "And I wonder, Bona Benjamin, pharmacists are among those who are having to make these decisions about who gets what.",
        "Well, pharmacists are involved with physicians and other members of the health care team in developing strategies, we call them conservation strategies, we also call them prioritization strategies.",
        "They are in fact rationing, but it's not rationing as I usually think of it.",
        "It's simply using the amount of product that you have to benefit the most people in the most possible - to give them the best possible effect from the drugs.",
        "Richard, as you've talked to people who have been forced to make these kinds of decisions, this is unusual.",
        "You know, of course everybody tries to make the decision on the greatest good, but these are awful decisions.",
        "Yes, so far people have said to me that they're usually able to make substitutions, that it causes a lot of anguish and anxiety within hospitals because instead of using a familiar drug that they know well, and they know how to - you know, the IV pumps are set to administer it at a certain rate, and they know how much a given patient should have, if they're using a substitute or a combination of drugs, then that can increase the risk of a medication error, a dosage error or what have you."

        "And they say that must be happening out there as a result of having to do these workarounds.",
        "There is a lot of anxiety about - I think especially cancer drugs because these are patients who, as Susan Kennedy said, need it on a timely basis.",
        "And there's a drug named Taxol now that's a really the mainstay drug for a lot of cancers, breast and ovarian in particular, that is in shortage and there's a lot of concern that that may raise some very acute decision - problems, you know, who - this patient versus that patient problems.",
        "With Doxil, there is a substitute drug that though the problem is it's much more toxic.",
        "But with Taxol, you know, you have a little bit more critical need, I gather.",
        "And, Bona Benjamin, is there a temptation at one hospital or another to say, if Taxol is running out, why don't we stock pile it to make sure our patients have it?",
        "Well, we've heard that that is happening, that care providers at hospitals are charged with taking care of their patients and so they try to acquire as much of the product as they possibly can.",
        "It's interesting that Taxol is one of the drugs mentioned because I was with a pharmacist, a friend of mine, the other night and she said we have lots and lots of Taxol now.",
        "We didn't have it for a long time, but we have lots and lots of it now.",
        "And we hear - at ASHP, we hear things like that all the time, where many, many people will be reporting a shortage of a particular drug, but yet some have lots and lots, and we don't understand how that happens.",
        "Shortages lead to market distortions and, Richard Knox, to black markets.",
        "Yes, but there's something called grey market that is causing a lot of the concern.",
        "This is not apparently illegal, but suppliers, distributors will garner a supply of a drug in shortage and offer it to desperate hospitals at an extreme mark up.",
        "And I just heard today that one - there's some interest in Congress in investigating or there is an investigation on grey marketing, and whether that - whether anything should be done about it.",
        "One of the problems, a lot of hospitals don't want to buy those because they're not quite sure what their providence is, what - whether they are what they say they are, whether they're pure or whether - how they've been handled and stored and because it's a kind of an extortion and hospital is liable if there's some problem with the drug.",

        "One of the biggest concerns we have from a pre-hospital care setting is that EMS may be able to get drugs that are in short supply across the country, but we can't get it in the formats that we're used to handling it in, or one that is safest for our patients, or more importantly safest for our providers to administer.",
        "Norepinephrine was - I heard earlier in the conversation was mentioned, and, while it's certainly a widely available drug in some of the pre-mixed syringes in the last few years those have gone away, and it requires our providers in the field to brush up on their drug math and do better calculations rather than just grab a ready-made, ready-mixed medication.",
