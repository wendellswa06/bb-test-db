        "He actually put - on his special menu, he takes his friends' names.",
        "He made - my son's name is Dominic, so he has Dom's Super Gyro on the menu.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "Yeah.",

        "He's made quite a bit of money.",
        "But he prefers to be up from the pub.",
        "And he'll be sitting there watching TV, and a kind of rumble will begin below.",
        "And he'll know that it's time for him to come down and just sort of show his face and say, now, lads, you know, you're making a bit too much noise.",

        "That's funny.",

        "Most people would head there after church and hang until midafternoon.",
        "Or on the southern Irish coast, a meal of fresh, steamed mussels, homemade soda bread and again, a pint of Guinness - memorable meal, even 20 years later.",
        "And I was astonished to realize - I was reading your book, Bill - what an important part food now plays in a pub's business.",
        "It does, particularly in the city.",
        "In the country, it's still - there are some country pubs you walk into, and if you say, you know, do you have any peanuts, the publican will look at you like, ah, there's something wrong with you.",

        "Wanting food in a pub.",
        "But in the city, you know, one of the biggest publicans has said quite recently that most pubs are going to have to do 50 percent of their business in food.",
        "So that's a big change.",
        "You also - your book, written - no fault of yours - at the time when the Celtic Tiger was growling strong and has since - as I think one of the reviewers of your book wrote - been stuffed and mounted.",
        "The boom is over.",
        "So what has changed?",
        "Do - you write of a situation where pubs being bought and some even torn down because their real estate was worth more, and that because of the enormous pressures of - the boom times was bad for the pubs; I assume that down times are not good for the pubs, either.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "But the - you know, it's a relatively inexpensive form of entertainment.",
        "And I think - also, people like to be somewhere where they're going to be distracted.",
        "Now, at the same time, pubs - publicans will always tell you they're suffering.",
        "So you take it with a grain of salt.",
        "That's true.",
        "But you now do see signs in the city of Dublin posted, saying we will not - we guarantee we will not raise our prices for a year.",
