        "And from your point of view, what makes a great a pub?",
        "The staff.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "The Irish staff that we have here, that have been with us since the day that we opened, like Diedre Black(ph) from Galway, Ora Neilen(ph), Sandra Killeen(ph), all from the West of Ireland, (unintelligible), all from the West.",
        "It's the staff.",
        "It's that 100,000 welcomes, that you make people feel welcome when they walk in, the atmosphere, the decor, the traditional Irish music, reviving the old traditions that made Ireland great, people that are passionate and loyal, people that really eat, drink and speak Irish, like we speak fluent Irish here at the bar, as well.",
        "But it's just really that 100,000 welcomes, people coming in.",
        "The staff is the most prominent thing.",
        "In Ireland, you don't have it anymore because of the drink-driving laws.",
        "Now you have the super pubs.",
        "It's very, very, very hard to find a true, authentic Irish pub these days.",
        "There's a lot of plastic (unintelligible) bars out there and everything like that, but a true, traditional Irish bar - as a person that is so passionate about it, that knows all about the literature and the background and - the Americans love to come in, and Irish-Americans love to come in - who are more Irish, in some ways, than the Irish themselves…",
        "And Miles, you're going to be seeing a lot of them tomorrow on what a lot of people think of as amateur night, but a good St. Patrick's Day for you.",
        "Thank you so much, indeed.",
        "It'll be a great day tomorrow.",
        "And happy St. Patrick's Day to everybody out there - all the millions of Irish that live in America.",

        "In Chicago a team of special prosecutors is substantiating claims of torture and abuse of prisoners by Chicago police officers.",
        "This would have been back in the 1970s and 80s but the prosecutors who released a report on the torture today, say the statute of limitations has run out, therefore the officers who committed the abuse cannot be charged.",
        "NPR's David Schaper is covering this story and joins us now.",
        "David tell us what you can about the allegations.",
        "Well there have been a number of allegations, hundreds of allegations of brutality by Chicago police officers on suspects that they were interrogating -mostly for more serious crimes and murder investigations throughout the 1970s and throughout the 1980s.",
        "And most of them specifically dealt with one (Unintelligible) first detective, John Burge, who later became a commander of a south side unit of the Chicago Police Department, and detectives under his command.",
        "The special prosecutor was appointed four years ago to, to try to substantiate these claims that have been kicking around Chicago for, for years and years and years.",
        "And they have decided that if they could bring indictments, that they would, against Burge and some of his underlings, for at least three cases - and that there are probably a good seventy five to one hundred other cases that they believe abuse and torture took place, but they don't have enough evidence that they could bring a case.",
        "Well what is, what is the next step?",
        "What's going to happen here?",
        "Well this was - this investigation by a special prosecutor was ordered by a chief judge of Cook County, four years ago, because of repeated claims of abuse and torture by some - some people who claim that they were convicted of crimes, based on confessions that they signed because they were abused and tortured into signing those confessions.",
        "And so there are a number of cases still working their way through the courts that could be impacted by this, because of these claims of innocence by people who have been sitting in jail for, in some cases, fifteen - twenty years.",
        "There have been some who have already been exonerated, because of these, these allegations of abuse and torture.",
        "But beyond that the — because the statute of limitations on the specific acts which are crimes, they cannot bring any charges against the officers.",
        "And all of the officers involved are no longer on the Chicago Police Department.",
        "However, there is civil matters that could go on, lawsuits that could be filed by those who believe that they were tortured, and there could be high judgments.",
        "In some cases we've already seen some multi-million dollar judgments in favor of victims who claimed that they were tortured at the hands of Chicago police officers.",
        "Any way to generalize what the response of those officers who have been named, has been?",
        "Many of those who have been named, and had been named in media reports and in other investigations prior to this one, have often taken the fifth when, when put on the stand and before grand juries.",
        "They've refused to talk to the media, and in most cases, there's just very little or no response.",
        "In court documents, many have — some of these cases that have wound up in the civil courts, they have denied the allegations.",
        "And because there has been such a code of silence within the Chicago Police Department, many of these cases end up being one person's word against another.",
        "In some of the most heinous cases, in the three in particular that special prosecutor mentions, there is such evidence of physical wounds and things, that, that overwhelmed the evidence and removed the, the denial, that some of the officers have given in the past.",
        "NPR's David Schaper talking with us from Chicago.",
        "Thank you David.",
        "Thank you Noah.",

        "Next up, a rocket last Sunday lifted off at Pacific gate toll of the Marshall Islands and it was bound for earth orbit.",
        "But there was something very different and significant about this rocket.",
        "It was designed and built privately without government assistance, and the rocket was named the Falcon 1, built and launched by the Space Exploration Technologies Corporation or SpaceX.",
        "It's a private company aiming to provide low-cost long services and making a business of selling - maybe selling a ride into space - cheaper and more reliably than the previous launched techniques.",
        "Last weekend's rocket launch was the first privately designed built system to make it, as I say into earth orbit, and it came after three failed attempts.",
        "Joining me now to talk about the launch and what comes next, is Elon Musk, he's the founder of SpaceX and the company's CEO and CTO and has a big smile on his face, I'm sure today.",
        "Welcome back to the program, Elon."

        "Thank you.",
        "So this was the fourth try charm, huh?",
        "Well, I mean, I was just saying that this is a joke because - you know, the common idiomatic expression is third times the charm, but yeah, this was a great success for us and we're finally able to iron out one of the design-related issues with the vehicle.",
        "In our case it was particularly tricky because the entire vehicle was smashed from the ground up.",
        "So, you know, the first stage engine, second stage engine, all the structure, avionics kinds of control, was all done internally at SpaceX from a clean sheet.",
        "Typically launched vehicles have a long heritage and contain - what these - many of the components have flown before.",

        "Why start from the ground?",
        "Huh.",
        "Because their designs are not good.",
        "They're very expensive and they do not have any potential for usability.",
        "In the case of Falcon 1, it is designed to make a substantial cost breakthrough, and you know, a lot of cost is actually there right at the design point.",
        "If you designed something that is inherently expensive, it's going to be expensive.",
        "And that's typically how launch vehicles have been done in the past.",
        "So, you know, we had to really start from a clean sheet to make something that was low-cost to manufacture.",
        "And then also which was designed, at least in the case of first stage, to have the potential for reusability.",
        "Yeah, the first stage is designed with a potential for reusability.",
        "And unfortunately that - it did not survive reentry on this flight but we - we've got some good data to make improvements, and I think we've got a good shot of recovering it on flight five or six.",
