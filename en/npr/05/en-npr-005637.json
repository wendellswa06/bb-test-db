        "The symphony was commissioned by Northeastern University where Fairouz teaches.",
        "The idea was write something exploring the conflicts in the Middle East.",
        "So for inspiration, he delved into the poetry of the region, both ancient and modern.",
        "In reading the poetry, I really started to develop an idea of synthesizing these poems, as well as some of the ancient liturgies of the Middle East, to form, you know, what the title of the symphony implies, \"\"Poems and Prayers.\"\" And the symphony is scored for chorus, orchestra, solo vocalists, solo instrumentalists, so there's a variety of ways in which these texts can be articulated.",
        "Let me ask you specifically about some of the music and how you broke it down.",
        "There are two different sections that are striking, both women's voices.",
        "You have a woman's voice with a solo clarinet, and then in a different part, a woman's voice with a solo violin.",
        "I understand that both of those portray very moving stories.",
        "Tell me about those two moments.",
        "Well, the woman's voice with the solo clarinet is the second movement, the lullaby movement of the symphony.",
        "And that's a text by Mahmoud Darwish, the great Palestinian poet.",
        "And in a way, the mezzosoprano sings into the clarinet, saying, if you'll not be a rain, my love, be a tree.",
        "It's very classical Arabic poetry.",
        "And then at the last moment, this poetry takes a switch, takes a turn, and Mahmoud Darwish breaks out of meter and he says, this is what a woman said to her son at his funeral.",
        "So I saw in the voice of the clarinet the dead son of the woman.",
        "And I saw the woman singing to the clarinet, and the clarinet being a voice but not a human voice, no longer a voice that could echo her with words and be present.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)",
        "And then in the last moments of that movement, the clarinet does what only a clarinet can do, which is this decrescendo, this dying away.",
        "And her voice and his voice come together as one and just sort of die away into nothingness."

        "And were you working with primarily American musicians who might not have been familiar with these sources and with some of the techniques that this music required?",
        "Yes.",
        "The mezzo did need some coaching on the Arabic, read through the Arabic for me, Mohammed, and the - but in general, the music was reacted to very intuitively.",
        "And I think that this is partially because the musical and literary traditions are really ingrained with us as Americans.",

        "I don't necessarily think that through creating these works of music that we, the composer and the performers, are changing the world necessarily.",

        "That sparked some real fears that the economy could be headed toward a recession.",
        "How much the Fed eases interest rates depends on how aggressive the central bankers feel they have to be to attack the problem.",
