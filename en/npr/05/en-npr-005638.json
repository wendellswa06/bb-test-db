        "Roland Martin, executive editor of The Chicago Defender joins us from member station WCLK in Atlanta, Georgia today.",
        "And at our member station WFDD in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Nat Irvin, professor of future studies at Wake Forest University.",
        "All right, folks, we want to get into a number of things today.",
        "First, we want to talk about the President and what the White House seems to be doing.",
        "We saw him in front of an audience yesterday not only delivering a quite long speech but taking questions and obviously, front and center was the notion of the unauthorized surveillance of Americans.",
        "The President is standing by the fact that he says that he did not break the law by authorizing domestic eavesdropping and suggests that this now all falls under, Mary Frances Berry, the umbrella of what he calls the terrorist surveillance program.",
        "And in plain terms he says, look, you can't have it both ways.",
        "You either accept spying or terrorism.",
        "Well, actually, the foreign intelligence law that was passed makes clear that there are procedures that the President should follow when he wants to wiretap.",
        "He obviously has violated that law.",
        "I mean, that's clear.",
        "The Congressional Research Service says it.",
        "Even the Washington Post editorial, which usually supports what he does on these issues, says and acknowledges that what he's done is not - he's violated what's there as the law.",
        "He - that law has all kinds of provisions that would make it easy for him to go.",
        "He also said something about he has briefed members of Congress.",
        "The foreign intelligence - the law - says that he has to brief all the members of the committee, which he didn't do, and so I think that the polls show that Americans believe that the President should follow the law.",
        "They also are afraid, and I think that what he's doing is like you wave the boogeyman at kids to get them to stop misbehaving.",
        "He keeps waving terrorism at us and has been doing it since 9/11 to frighten everybody, and I think we're in for a setup too because Pat Roberts, who's chair of the committee, intelligence committee, was there, and he was in Manhattan, Kansas yesterday.",
        "And Senator Specter's going to chair the committee to investigate this.",
        "The Republicans, of course, control both houses of Congress, so that we're gonna get a phony investigation.",
        "If the checks and balances system worked and if at least one house of Congress was controlled by somebody else, right now we would be seeing an investigation toward an impeachment of Bush for violating the law.",
        "Well, here's an interesting point, Nat Irvin, here's an interesting point.",
        "As Mary suggested, 56 percent of the people polled recently suggested that the Bush administration should be required to seek a warrant before electronically monitoring American citizens.",
        "Yet, what this White House has always done and what even critics of this president say he is good at is going and talking to people, pressing the flesh and winning him back over.",
        "Clearly the White House has him out doing that.",
        "Oh, man.",
        "He had the Richard Pryor defense yesterday, which is who are you going to believe, me or your lying eyes?",
        "And if you were to say it, who're you gonna believe, me or Osama bin Laden, Americans believe him.",
        "It's an absolutely brilliant turn of the phrase, as Mary mentioned, to the terrorist surveillance program for domestic spying.",
        "I mean, who's going to be opposed to American values of apple pie, hotdog, and ice cream.",
        "I mean, you're talking about--the President is saying, look folks, we're going to be attacked.",
        "I am not spying on you.",
        "I'm spying on those who would do us harm.",
        "I'm spying on the--quote, I have my hands up here--\"\"the folks who are associated with Islam.\"\" I mean, you know they're--and then this is all aided, of course, by the very right-wing talk show hosts that we have--and I won't mention any of them--who simply just help to reinforce the notion that the President is not spying on you, he's spying on them.",
        "The only times Americans right now seem to be concerned about spying is if you mention the IRS.",
        "Other than that, I think that we're very much like we were as a country during the 1940s, when we were afraid of the Yellow Peril.",
        "Now it is that we're afraid of Osama bin Laden and anybody associated with al-Qaeda, and we are willing to give up, apparently, a lot of civil rights--civil liberties--and not even ask any questions.",
        "Even though our family name is Lord, we're not lords.",
        "That might've gotten you in."

        "All the other launch vehicles in the world are expendable.",
        "You have to know where you have to send the ship to know where it's going to splash down, I imagine pretty accurately.",

        "And then you got to fish it out of the water and make sure it doesn't sink.",

        "But it's - so it's not going to sink, it doesn't really leak or anything.",
        "That so - no dangerous sinking, but there is obviously a challenge of ensuring that it does not corrode when in seawater and that the electronics aren't damaged by seawater.",
        "What do you foresee now as the first commercial use of your spacecraft?",
        "Well, we have quite a few launch contracts for both government and commercial satellites for Falcon 1.",

        "Probably both of those will be - U.S.",
        "government launches.",
        "And then maybe even like an additional launch, which would be a commercial launch for replenishment of the old com consolation(ph)."

        "We're not going to have a space shuttle to use, to service the space station, right?",
        "Can you fill that gap with your space vehicles?",
        "Yeah, absolutely.",
        "So, the shuttle is slated to retire in 2010.",

        "SpaceX won that contract and that - at least one of the first three or four parts of the contract which are to take pressurized and unpressurized cargo to the space station and return it to earth.",
        "There's a fourth element to that contract which NASA has not yet exercised but we hope that they will.",
        "And we do things in the best interest of the country and I think, they will- which is to upgrade our Dragon Spacecraft to carry people.",
        "So, in which case we would - we will not, you know, United States will not need to rely on the Soluse(ph) for carrying people to the space station between 2010 and 2015 or whenever the NASA, the next NASA developed system is available.",
        "So we're expecting to do our first demonstration flight of Falcon Nine Booster, which is our big booster, in our Dragon Spacecraft, which will go and dock with the space station next year.",
        "And then there are a couple of more demonstrations in 2010 at which point we'll go operational.",
        "1-800-989-8255, talking with Elon Musk of the SpaceX Corporation.",
        "So you're saying that it's possible that you could create a little module where people could be sitting in and go back and forth to the space station?",
        "Or would they just stay with it while it's up there and keep docked with it at the space station?",
        "They would - we will be raising a video probably in a week or two, that will give people a very clear illustration of what is we're talking about.",

        "I try to distinguish between orbit and space because flights two and three certainly made it well beyond the boundary of space.",
        "They just did not reach full orbital velocity and it's much, much harder to reach full orbital velocity than it is to get to space.",
        "It only takes - to get to the boundary of space, you'll only need about, say, two percent of the energy you need to get to orbit.",
        "Wow.",
        "So if you compare the energy capability of our vehicles with say, SpaceShipOne, which is what was used for one of the several (unintelligible) or SpaceShipTwo, which is what Virgin Galactic will be doing, then, you know, we're about 50 times the energy of those vehicles.",
        "But for flight one, the issue was basically a corroded nut and that was because we'd inadvertently used a stress corrosion-prone alloy of aluminum, and it happens to be in a high corrosion environment.",
        "So our test-run was in sort of a normal environment, but out there on the island, it's a high-corrosion environment so that made our - you know, we encountered an issue that we just didn't see on the test, which was a very rapid corrosion of a nut.",
        "So we took corrective action after that.",
        "Then flight two, the problem was that - what was with the control of the second stage, which is a tricky thing to figure out because it's going at - it goes from Mach 10 to Mach 25 in a vacuum, and accelerating from just under one G to over five Gs.",
        "So there's no way to really test that well and you can't really test that on the ground.",
