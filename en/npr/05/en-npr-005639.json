        "What happened with number three?",
        "So number three - number three would have worked if we had kept the same first stage engine as flight two.",
        "But we upgraded the engine because we wanted to use the engine on flight three that we planned to use in our big vehicle, Falcon 9, and get flight history on that before using it on our big vehicle.",
        "And unfortunately, the thrust transient, which is for - during shutdown, which is basically the rate at which the thrust- how the thrust decays over time.",
        "It was a much longer thrust decay than the old engine.",
        "And so after we separated the stages, the first stage actually still had residual thrust and basically kept on going forward and rear-ended the second stage.",
        "I hate it when that happens.",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, (unintelligible).",
        "No kidding.",
        "So you fixed that through that for number four.",
        "We've basically made a very small timing change to basically extend the time from when we initiate managing cut off, to second stage, to the stage of separation.",
        "We just increased that by a few seconds, and solved the problem, then we got through all of it."

        "That's the first problem.",
        "Yeah, but you know what, Mary, that being said, it seems to me this White House may have been able to supersede all of the problems that they've had, avoid them, if you will, had they just gone to Congress beforehand, sat down with leadership on both sides of the aisle, said, look gentleman and ladies, this is what we need to do to keep this country safe.",

        "The hearings are a joke.",

        "But in any case, then the next thing that happens is, on these issues, they don't fight.",
        "They caved in on the filibuster, gave it away, which was the only thing that they had, and got up in public and tried to make it sound like they weren't giving it away.",
        "That's because the Democratic Party internally is divided between those who want to fight and those who see that, they ought to make themselves appear to be different or not.",
        "So, the Alito outcome is a result of that non-fighting stance, which has prevailed.",
        "And what I'm worried about, everybody keeps talking about abortion, I'm worried about the race cases.",

        "It's a movie called Son of Man.",

        "When you look at the traditional image of Jesus and you see what this movie, and others before it, have tried to do, is there a need really, today, to revisit the image of Jesus and what Western society has portrayed this man to be, physically?",
        "Oh, I think there is always.",
        "And there is a constant... Well let me put it this way; there is always a struggle within the faith community to re-examine the message of Christ and I think even more so today than ever before.",
        "And that this film is representative of new communities have technology and having a story, and being able to put the story of Jesus in their context.",
        "I think it, you know right here at home we're looking at, I think it's an NBC Series, The Book of Daniel in which, the American Family Counsel is outraged by the portrayal of Jesus as being sort of a-I've seen a couple of installments.",
        "I don't think this Jesus has blue eyes, but he is a sort of a modern, contemporary figure who is very passive and who sort of offers these kind of non-controversial judgments.",

        "Yeah, Roland, always interesting to see, when you go to your grandma or your auntie's house, to see Jesus lookin' like on the Beatles in the mid-70s.",
