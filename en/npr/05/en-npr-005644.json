        "The Treasury Department is planning to use a special advisor, Ken Feinberg, to help referee pay cases in the companies that got federal bailouts.",
        "Feinberg has experience in mediating delicate financial issues.",
        "He previously helped to decide cash settlements to victims of the September 11th attacks.",
        "The new post will give Feinberg unusual authority over the income of hundreds of private sector employees.",
        "But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says that kind of federal oversight is justified under the circumstances.",
        "These are private sector employees that in many ways have their job based on the extraordinary assistance that has been provided by taxpayers to ensure that they can continue to have their jobs.",
        "The administration's moves on compensation are just the beginning of a broader overhaul of financial regulations.",
        "Tomorrow, a House committee will consider the connection between the way bankers are paid and the risks they're willing to take - risks that could wind up hurting the paychecks of every American.",
        "Scott Horsley, NPR News, Washington.",
        "From NPR News, it's ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Guy Raz in Washington, and this hour, we'll check in on four continents, from a desperate standoff in Sri Lanka to a crusading judge in Spain.",
        "We'll visit African high-rises and a lingerie boutique in Saudi Arabia.",
        "But first to diplomacy.",
        "Today, Israel's government appointed its controversial foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, as point man for a strategic dialogue with the United States, and next weekend, that country's conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, will visit Washington to meet with President Obama.",
        "Now, some Israel-watchers believe Washington and Jerusalem may be headed toward a clash over how to restart negotiations on Palestinian statehood.",
        "And last week, Vice President Joe Biden spoke to the annual gather of AIPAC.",
        "That's the powerful pro-Israel lobby, and he raised a few eyebrows when he said:",
        "Israel has to work toward a two-state solution.",
        "You're not going to like my saying this, but not build more settlements, dismantle existing outposts and allow the Palestinians freedom of movement based on their first actions, X access to economic opportunity and increase security responsibility.",
        "Joining us is former State Department adviser on the Middle East, Aaron David Miller.",
        "So we just heard this quote from Vice President Biden at the AIPAC conference.",
        "Does it sound like a change in tone with respect to the way Washington is addressing Israel?",
        "There's no question that it's a change in tone.",
        "During the course of the last eight years, the latitude and the leeway that the previous Bush administration gave to the Israelis was quite large, and to have the vice president, who was clearly viewed as one of Israel's closest friends, talk with that kind of firmness, yeah, I think it reflects a change in tone.",
        "There's no question.",
        "Whether or not that change in tone is going to be translated into a change in policy, however, remains to be seen."

        "Prime Minister Netanyahu seems to be pushing for a sort of focus on boosting the Palestinian economy before he begins talks on a two-state solution.",
        "The White House wants something completely different.",
        "They want the issue of statehood to be dealt with first.",
        "I mean, isn't there an inherent conflict in the way the new Israeli government sees things and in the way that Washington sees things now?",
        "There is, and a successful negotiation between Israelis and Palestinians, leading to an agreement if that in fact is even possible, will require a bottom-up approach, building (unintelligible)'s capacity, security, as well as economics, and marrying that to an Obama administration's desire to deal with the final status issues: Jerusalem borders, security and refugees.",
        "So you've got to marry the two approaches.",
        "Now this past week, Israeli President Shimon Peres made the rounds here in Washington.",
        "He's got a lot of friends in the city.",
        "He's a former Nobel Peace laureate and associated with the left in Israel.",
        "It seems as if he was softening the ground, in a sense, for the eventual visit of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, and what kind of reception do you expect Mr. Lieberman will receive here in Washington when he eventually arrives?",
        "I think his reception will be appropriate, courteous.",
        "Benjamin Netanyahu is pulling the strings here, and it seems to me in the end, it's his relationship, both with the president and the secretary of state, that are going to count much more.",
        "But there is some discomfort over Lieberman at the State Department.",
        "I think that's true, but again Avigdor Lieberman in that sense, even though he's very important to coalition politics, is probably a kind of speed bump from the perspective of both the president and the secretary of state.",
        "He's not the main guy.",
        "I understand that there are political sensitivities and sensibilities that any White House would have to sort of take under consideration, but does Obama have more of a license to really almost push Israel in a way that it hasn't been pushed by an American administration in a long time?",
        "The reality is that you fight with the Israelis for a reason and a purpose, not because you're frustrated with them, not to make nice (unintelligible).",
        "You fight with them when, in fact, you have the prospects of reaching an agreement.",
        "Every single time a president has articulated a strategy toward Arab-Israeli peace that had the acquiescence and support of both the Arabs and the Israelis, presidents led, and they were successful.",
        "Aaron David Miller is a former Mideast negotiator at the State Department, author of the \"\"The Much Too Promised Land\"\" and a scholar at the Wilson Center here in Washington.",
        "Aaron David Miller, thanks for coming in."

        "And Emily, I guess the first question that came to my mind is why on earth are people willing to showcase their personal lives on the Internet, or did I just fall into the gaping generation gap?",
        "Well, I think that's the question pretty much everybody from the older generation asks in response to this, and that applies to everything from blogs to even text messaging, emailing, like a whole line of different technological phenomena.",
        "People just say why would you do that?",
        "And part of what I'm talking about in the article is the fact that for younger people that's not a very meaningful question.",
        "Their life is very much lived with technology at the center of it, and it's not something they question a lot, and it's shaped in a lot of ways the psychology of how they're growing up.",
        "So to ask a 16-year-old why are you putting a blog online?",
        "Why do you have a profile of yourself?",

        "And often people really live a lot of their social and creative lives online and connect their online lives with their offline lives in a very significant and complex way.",
        "When I talk about a generation gap, I'm talking about it primarily in terms of the values that people have about privacy that are shaped by this experience of using technology.",
        "But this is not to say that every older person is different than every younger person or that every younger person literally puts every single thing they've ever experienced online.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But I am talking about what I see as like a genuine social shift in the psychology of what people consider private.",
        "And I do think for someone like me who grew up without e-mail even when I was in high school, the sense of what it must be like to have, say, the worst breakup and fight with your friend that you had when you were 16 and a series of videos of some of the best times that you had at parties all available easily online not only to yourself and your friends but often to strangers is a really striking and shocking thing."

        "Well, sometimes it's small and sometimes it's large.",
        "And the bigger thing is sometimes you actually can't tell whether it's large or small.",
        "The people who are coming up with this technology as a given have an experience of using something that might seem very intimate and then suddenly, like an accordion kind of shaped sort of communication, might suddenly expand to everyone.",
        "So for instance, you might be instant messaging with a friend and then make a little joke, and your friend might cut and paste that and put it on their blog.",
        "Or somebody at a party took a photo of you, and you're drunk and acting silly, and it's a goofy photo, and they put it up on Flickr the next day.",
        "And then, you know, a snarky blog picks it up and sort of makes fun of the photo, or somebody forwards something onto their friends.",
        "So the feeling that you have when you post things online is that you might be speaking quietly and nobody might be reading you...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...or everybody might be reading you, and it can happen pretty suddenly.",
        "And in fact one of the things that people, including yourself, have noted is there's sort of a disconnect, that young people are somewhat alarmed to find that not just they and their friends have access to places like MySpace.",
        "In fact, their parents and other grownups do, too.",
        "Well, I've talked to a lot of younger people, and they had a range of different responses to that.",
        "Some people do have a sort of deliberate denial, I think, about it, where they basically - the idea that a parent or relative or a teacher or something could go in just seems boggling to them.",
        "But I think that a lot of that was due to the introduction of these technologies.",
        "There's always a period when a technology is introduced that nobody knows how to use it, and people use it with real bumptiousness.",
