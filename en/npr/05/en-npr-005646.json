        "My sites are exceptional.",

        "I guess some people are becoming pretty familiar now with YouTube - and we always get this question: Y-O-U-T-U-B-E.com, that's all one word - but YouTube has become a fairly familiar phenomenon.",
        "What's Vimeo?",
        "How is it different?",
        "YouTube is a great site, and I do use it for watching TV clips and stuff that's wildly popular.",
        "Vimeo's different than that.",
        "It's about people who make videos, sharing those videos.",
        "And there are a lot of seemingly shared videos on YouTube as well.",
        "Yours - this is more intimate, are you saying?",
        "Yeah, it's - it's hard to find stuff on Vimeo that wasn't uploaded by the person who created it.",

        "We see a wide range.",
        "The types of videos that my friends and I put up, we tend to do a little more editing.",
        "But we find a lot of people putting up just clips right off their digital camera of their babies or their nephews or of their cats.",
        "It kind of depends on who the person is.",
        "But the consistent theme is that people put up stuff that they made themselves.",
        "They made themselves.",

        "Yes, I think that is what it is.",
        "It's a combination of things.",
        "I mean, people create these things sort of to communicate with other people as a form of self-expression, as a form of self-documentation.",
        "I mean, a lot of the videos that I've seen on Vimeo are these little kind of just slices of life.",
        "And a lot of times when I've talked to people about this, they've gone, but why would you want to watch this?",
        "Why would you want to watch just basically a piece of behavior of somebody that you might not personally know?",
        "But actually, I have to say - maybe I'm just a huge voyeur or something - but I do find it quite compelling, because they're not, you know, they're not - they're stylized in their own way, but it does give you this odd little window into somebody's world in a way that is, you know, different but connected to me, to a lot of different things that people do online, which is basically sharing little parts of themselves.",
        "So for instance, watching a Vimeo video of when Caitlin was visiting New York and she was just hoola-hooping in Washington Square Park is a weirdly fascinating experience because you just get this tiny little intimate peek into somebody's world and experience.",
        "And there's a level of context that you get that adds to the fascination.",
        "It's not just the video sitting there on a Web page.",
        "The video is there with, separately, a photograph of the person who took it, information about where they live, links to other clips that they're in.",
        "So while a video of a girl holding a cat isn't necessarily interesting on its own, if I have a crush on that girl, the video is fascinating.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "OK, I hadn't really realized that that was - that that's the focus of the site, is for people to be able to seek out their crushes holding kittens.",

        "But I actually do think that what Jakob is talking about is true, is the fact that - not just on Vimeo, but in general, on some of the more fascinating kind of places on the Web - what you get is you get a link between the person and all of these different kind of arms of self-expression on their part, and people make different choices.",
        "I mean, in my article I talk a lot about, you know, private and public and the idea of the values of private and public.",
        "And people just have very different definitions of what constitutes publicness.",
        "The videos that are on Vimeo that Jakob is talking about might strike many people as really like raw and like strangely putting your life out there and everybody can see you.",
        "But to the people who actually put stuff out there, they make careful choices of their own about what they consider intimate and what they consider private.",
        "I actually don't think I interviewed a single person, even the most - the person that I considered the most exhibitionistic - who didn't say to me, you know, I'm kind of a very private person.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Because I think that people know that culturally, it's supposed to be a positive thing to say about yourself.",

        "It's not like an on-off switch between I spill everything out into the world and I tell you nothing.",

        "But in reading along on her MySpace, I was able to find out all about their sex life and drug use - or hers, and things that she wanted to do.",
        "And so pretty much I greeted my son's homecoming from summer camp with pointing out that not only is it just between them, but his younger sister is able to read this stuff…"
