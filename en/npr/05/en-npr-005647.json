        "But the thing - this is just a sort of more general point, it's not about your particular situation.",
        "But what I wonder is whether this moment in history, when there's a real disjunct between the feelings of parents about these kinds of things and the feelings of teenagers about these things, whether that will change over the course of the next 15 or 20 years.",
        "I mean, I can't really say because it could go in different directions.",
        "But one thing I wonder is at the point that say, your son, you know, is an adult and say, has somebody younger working at his workplace and finds out that the person has a really - a bunch of pictures of himself drunk online.",
        "I wonder if at that point it will just seem like a more normal thing.",
        "I mean, for good or for bad, I wonder whether there's really a, you know - over time there will a societal shift so the kinds of things that were considered -as you were talking about - like really shocking, shameful, no modesty will actually shift the definition, because that's happened in the past.",
        "I mean, you know, in the past, merely finding out that somebody had had premarital sex would have been a very shocking and appalling thing.",
        "Yeah, that's true.",

        "And at this point, having - or, you know, like a teenager smoking pot.",
        "And, you know, to some people, that would still be very shocking, but there's definitely been shifts in what's considered appalling and shameful.",
        "And I wonder whether that will continue to shift so that talking publicly about one's experiences and feelings won't be considered as surprising or as shameful in the future.",
        "I don't know whether that's a good or bad thing or if it'll keep up in that way.",
        "Let me…",
        "It's up to the person to understand what's appropriate to talk about, and I guess if you think that, well, this is MySpace, and I'm going to talk about whatever I want, you know.",
        "You know?",
        "Yeah.",

        "I mean if you just look at any conversation - you put a couple of people in a room together, everybody's just dying to talk, and people tend to cut each other off, and everybody wants to be involved.",
        "And I think that extends to taking pictures, writing poems, all that stuff I see as people externalizing their thoughts.",

        "And until there was a real sorting system, you know, there was no way to figure out what you were interested in, what you wanted to see.",
        "And Google especially has changed things in terms of people's self-expression, because there's this - there's all sorts of odd phenomena attached to Google.",
        "Including - as I'm pretty sure that everybody who has used a computer has Googled themselves and found basically what does the Web think of me.",
        "Who am I?",
        "Like you end up seeing all sorts of odd things, like, you know, it could just be a reference of some committee meeting that you took place with will show up online.",
        "And people are often really startled the first time they Google themselves.",
        "And sometimes they become obsessed with it and they Google all their ex's and they Google all their friends.",
        "And it becomes sort of part of ones identity, basically the portrait of yourself that shows up on Google.",
        "And one of the things that I found among some of the younger people that I talked to was a feeling that to a certain extent your life is taking place in public anyway.",
        "All of your transactions are tracked.",
        "You know, there are cameras in public places.",
        "All your e-mails are saved on somebody's server.",
        "And, frankly, references to your life are going to show up online one way or another, especially if you're coming up from, you know, your teenage years onward.",
        "Like there are going to be traces of you.",
        "So you can either leave those traces out there, or try to fight them and eliminate them, or you can participate and actually try to get yourself the top Google ranking.",
        "And get yourself what's sometimes called Google juice and basically shape your own image.",
        "So it's becomes a real politic question of -it's not a question of am I private or am I public.",
        "You are public.",

        "Well, in a way, I guess maybe all these people blogging made everybody insensitive.",

        "And so essentially you end up with these kind of time lapses of your day, and that's been used by people who've got memory problems to do a memory recall.",
