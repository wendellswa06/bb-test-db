        "McCain does plan to compete in Iowa if he runs in 2008.",
        "One more sign that this time, the maverick has become the frontrunner.",

        "NPR National Political Correspondent Mara Liasson traveled with John McCain and filed this report.",
        "It's Saturday morning, and the Borders Bookstore in West Lebanon, New Hampshire is overflowing with hundreds of adoring McCainiacs--lined up to get the senator's signature in his latest book.",
        "Now ready for number 51 through 100, then go ahead and get in the line.",
        "It's six years since McCain won the last New Hampshire Republican primary, and two and half years before the next one.",
        "But judging from the size of the crowd here, McCain is still a bona fide political celebrity.",
        "Tens of thousands of Britons made like Boston Red Sox fans this week to celebrate England's victory over Australia in the Ashes cricket series, which Britain hasn't won since 1987.",
        "Great Britain invented cricket, but over the past few decades Commonwealth countries, including the Aussies, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, have often bested the Brits.",
        "I'd describe the highlights to you, except for many Americans cricket has no highlights, save for its hilarious vocabulary of stumps, googlies and sticky wickets.",
        "The competition went on for seven weeks.",

        "The U.S.",
        "Justice Department charged Roof with a hate crime and is now seeking the death penalty.",
        "During the sentencing hearing last week which will determine Roof's sentence, Roof told jurors that he had dismissed his lawyers and was representing himself because he rejected any claims that he is psychologically impaired.",
        "Prosecutors are arguing that Roof deserves death because of his obvious lack of remorse, his blatant racial animus and his stated desire to start a race war.",
        "But there are other points of view.",
        "A number of the family members of the victims have publicly expressed their opposition to the death penalty.",
        "Some have said that the years of appeals that accompany a death sentence will be an additional burden to the family and to the community trying to heal."

        "And it's different from the moral position.",

        "It's hypocritical for them to do that.",
        "It's really a Christian position.",

        "One of the important things about having a death penalty for something - be it Osama bin Laden or Hitler or Jack the Ripper or whatever we want - it means that then we can calibrate other heinous acts down from that.",
        "So we can't delegate the decision to them, and we can't overweigh their particular take on it.",
        "It's part of the consideration, but I think it can't be given undue weight.",
