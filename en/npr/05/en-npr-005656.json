        "What we're saying is the viruses that are circulating in the United States right now that over 90 percent of those that we've tested thus far are demonstrating resistance to these two medications so that they shouldn't be used.",
        "We can't yet take that next step and say that the reason for this is because the drugs were overused in the past.",

        "That there's reason to suspect that high use of the drugs could have resulted in resistance.",
        "But that's not the case in the United States where these medicines have and always have been prescription only drugs.",
        "It's also possible because this resistance is mediated by a single mutation or singly substitution in the amino acid chain of the M protein of influenza.",
        "It's possible that the predominant strain of influenza that's circulating this year just happens to have that mutation in it."

        "That's true, that's true there are a number of underlying reasons though that makes it potentially less of a problem.",
        "One is that the mutation that results in resistance to Amantadine and rimantadine doesn't impair the virus anyway.",

        "We know that the mutations that are necessary to confer resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors do appear to have some selective disadvantage for the virus.",
        "In other words it's kind of a hindrance for the virus to carry around those mutations such that those viruses are less likely to be transmitted among people and perhaps less likely to cause disease once they infect people.",

        "So you can look at it one way in we lost half of the potential drugs that we had available to fight the flu and so that's a big deal.",
        "We've seen similar cases in terms of certain drug resistant bacteria where a good number of the drugs previously effective are no longer affected.",
        "A little bit more difficult thing to say and that's what I as eluding to before is that we know that in many cases we can, for antibiotic resistance among bacteria, we can link overuse or in appropriate use of the drug to the development of the resistance problem.",
        "In this particular instance, with these viruses that appear to be resistant to this class of drugs it's not as easy to make that assessment because again it only takes one mutation in the amino acid chain of the virus to result in this resistance profile.",

        "There are other H5N1 avian flu viruses circulating in Indonesia that don't necessarily contain the mutation that confers resistance.",
        "So many of the viruses that we've tested, that are H5, show resistance but not all of them.",
