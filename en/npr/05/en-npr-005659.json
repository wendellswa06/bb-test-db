        "And I think it gets to the truth of, you know, corruption being in all aspects of industry and how, you know, it's really truth and whatever industry, whether it's politicians and bribery scandals or the police and kickbacks or, you know, hospital physicians and the unnecessary tests that go on.",
        "I think it all comes down to power and money.",

        "Yeah.",
        "Wouldn't it be great to have that kind of money and that kind of power?",
        "Wouldn't it be - I think in any sort of film genre that where people exist in extremes or in extremist and outside of the bubble in which we usually live our lives - prison movies are another example - we somehow tend to identify and say, gee, what would I do under that circumstance, you know?",
        "What - which character would I be like?",
        "And I think it allows us the freedom, the movie-going experience for the couple of hours where in the theater, for a gangster movie allows us that kind of guilty pleasure of, you know, how we would act under those circumstances.",
        "Hmm.",
        "And yet, it also, at the very end, has a moral to it in the sense that you could say all of these movies are, you know, they follow, the rags-to-riches-to-ruin, and so that we're sitting there and we're identifying these characters and saying, what would we do and wouldn't it be great?",
        "But then, we are put at the end of the film, we're put, you know, back on our feet again and well grounded by the result of what happens to these characters.",

        "But what they don't mention is that Frank Lucas went back to drug dealing and went back to prison.",
        "So there's a certain - maybe they are glamorizing it a little bit, I don't know."
