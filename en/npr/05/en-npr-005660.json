        "Yeah.",
        "I - can I add one more quick comment?",
        "Go ahead, Ron.",
        "Yeah, I see it on all levels and, you know, all ages, too.",
        "I mean, a lot of the teens that get into the whole gangster attitude, it seems, you know, it's just as powerful a draw for teens as it is for people in their 20s and 30s and 40s.",
        "If you look at \"\"The Sopranos,\"\" how - what kind of audience they drew, they drew an audience probably that ranged from, you know, the mid-teens all the way up through people in their 60s and 70s.",
        "I'm certain about that.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Thanks very much, Ron.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "And Murray, I wanted to ask you, we mentioned at the beginning that movies and gangsters grew up together, and there was a lot of - well, back and forth, I think it was Raymond Chandler in his essay, \"\"The Simple Art of Murder,\"\" the great crime novelist, of course.",
        "And he wrote that after a while, the real-life criminals started watching these movies and picking up patter from the films.",
        "And all of a sudden, nobody had a revolver anymore, they were all packing heat.",
        "Right.",
        "And I think it's sort of - by the way, I think whatever definition you have of the gangster movie, I realized just going over my notes this morning that one of the things I'd left out was automatic weapons.",
        "I mean, it's sort of the rigor.",
        "But I think that's very true, Neal.",
        "I think that, I mean, who might again say Raymond Chandler?",
        "I think that it's absolutely born out by what's happening today.",
        "And as the hour progresses, and we talk more about BET and about gangsta life in America, I think that the movies have informed the sense of style of a lot of young people in America and old people as well.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "The other thing - even though I'd never want to work wherever Ron, our caller, was working, the truth of the matter is I think it even extends to the family.",
        "We're often told by sociologists and criminologists that the gang or gang life is a substitute for family, but there's, generally, a real father figure or a real parental control and it exists in apposition to normal society.",
        "One friend of mine said that she knew somebody who said - watched \"\"The Godfather\"\" and said, gee, I wish I lived in a family like that.",
        "They're all so close and they communicate so well.",
        "So, I mean, that's part of - I think, John, what you're talking about, with the universality almost of the gangster picture it's very inclusive.",
        "And by the way, we never mention much, Neal, about other cultures.",
        "You know, you've got Chinese movies like \"\"Hard Boiled\"\" and you've got, from Japan, the yakuza movies, and you mentioned \"\"The Departed.\"\" We were showing at our theater not long ago \"\"Eastern Promises,\"\" the David Cronenberg film about Russian gangsters in London, and now, you know, African-American movies.",
        "So it's something that is striking a cord among in a whole pile of people.",
        "And which French new wave cinema picture was Gerard Depardieu, standing in front of a movie picture of Humphrey Bogart with a (unintelligible) out of the corner of his mouth saying, bogey."

        "Well, that is true, and that's the essence of - I think that's one of the appeals of the Westerns, certainly, when it was on, when it was in its heyday, and that has continued into the gangster picture.",
        "We all identify with that particular figure just as in real life.",
