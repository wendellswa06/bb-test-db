        "Those French new wave pictures, there's something incredibly hip and cool about them, but nothing glamorous, I think.",
        "You know, these guys don't live - it's more as in \"\"Goodfellas,\"\" which is based on Nicholas Pileggi's book \"\"Wiseguy,\"\" and part of the reason for the book I think was to show how hard these guys were…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…to be following these petty mobsters around from like 8 in the morning to 12 at night.",

        "Well, I mean, I think for BET is that, you know, we show a lot of music videos and show a lot of kind of talent and stuff like that, but we wanted to show the other - the flipside of the some of the negative parts of what happens in these communities when the drug lords and the famous guys from all over hoods - and they riot, and what happens in kind of the aftermath of that.",

        "I mean, as much as you get Frank Lucas talking about all of the great things he did or even Nicky Barnes or his cars or him posing on the New York Times, you got to go to those places where the people were addicted to drugs or families were torn apart.",
        "I mean, I went into an apartment building in Oakland, California, where, you know, basically, a whole neighborhood have been decimated, you know what I mean, and whole families.",
        "So we go - this is a documentary style where we really go in depth.",

        "And I wonder, were there any decisions that you had to make to ensure that these tales remained cautionary?",
        "Of course.",
        "I mean, I think that at the end of the day, you know, you don't want to glamorize certain things, so you have to have an amazing amount of balance.",
        "I know that in the edit I did on Felix Mitchell, I made sure that I took out some of the people who - because as much as the government or even some other people look at these people as negative, in their hoods, they were kind of like the Robin Hood, they gave out turkeys, they did stuff and amazing things, so we want to make sure that we also show that.",
        "So I don't want to just put in a whole bunch of people celebrating somebody, you know what I mean?",
        "So, we wanted to have a balance.",
        "And I think that's - for BET, that's what we really aim to do at the end of day is teach our viewer that, you know, if you're out there and you're in this world or you're doing this kind of lifestyle, it's usually not going to end up in a positive way.",
