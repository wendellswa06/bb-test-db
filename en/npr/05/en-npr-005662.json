        "We've been talking about America's love with the gangster film, in particular on this weekend where \"\"American Gangster\"\" is dominating the box office, and we got a lot of calls from people who love gangster movies.",
        "Aren't these movies as - they're told from the protagonist point of view - inevitably glorifying that figure, the criminal?",
        "Well, to a certain degree, absolutely.",
        "Some would argue, in the case of an African-American criminal however, that ironically enough, there hasn't been a democratization of the acknowledgment and glorification of the black gangster and criminal, so that in one sense when one sees a Frank Lucas with all of the brouhaha occasioned by the departure today or at least the acknowledgment that he would depart of Dick Parsons at the top of Time Warner…",
        "Right.",
        "…and recently, Mr. O'Neal, the reality is is that Frank Lucas could have well been a CEO had he gone in a different direction, had opportunity presented itself to him to be able to use that ingenious mind of his for more edifying purposes.",
        "As it stands, the acknowledgment that he had assets in excess of $250 million in the mid-70s ranks him certainly near the top of any criminal gangster in this country.",
        "And ironically enough you both have to acknowledge that overlooked reality while at the same giving the cautionary tale about how that life would inevitably end.",
        "A difficult thing to do when a man is simultaneously portraying himself as Robin Hood and as, well, you know, any ogre you want…",
        "Sure.",
        "…as a drug dealer, he's wiping out entire neighborhoods.",
        "Well, he is decimating entire neighborhoods, he's making more vulnerable the people who consume the product, the blue magic or whatever…",
        "Yeah.",
        "…a name can be attached to the heroin and the like.",
        "So yeah, it's the duality there.",
        "On the one hand, he is an absolute, heartless criminal who was vicious even to his own family.",
        "On the other hand, he created pockets of, you know, at least episodic wealth for those who consumed, you know, the benefits of his product, and he tore them up and built them up at the same time.",
        "It's a rather ironic judgment about this singularly interesting and intriguing figure."

        "I wonder what you make - one of our earlier guests noted that you can have the same portrayal in a book on the printed page, put it up on the screen and you will see something different.",
        "Of course, because the visual is rather more arresting.",
        "We live in a post-literate culture to a large degree so that the cinematic literacy that is evoked by films is much more arresting and goes to the heart of the matter, gets to the cinematic jugular, so to speak.",
        "So, yeah, when you put it up there on the screen, the nuance, the complexity, the back and forth, the moral trajectory is lost, but at the same time, you gain a kind of pictorial display of the different stages through which a person can, you know, endure or transform if it's done well.",
        "Look at Tony Soprano.",
        "I mean, here was a guy who was a monster from the very beginning, but there was moral, you know, workings around that monsterhood so to speak or \"\"The Godfather.",
        "So now with Frank Lucas, you know, there's a back and forth that at least is occasioned by our conversations and many others that talk about he was both good and bad at the same time.",
        "He did some good, a lot of bad and yet in these annals of criminality in American society, the black gangster and godfather serves even a useful function.",
        "For instance, in the film itself, you know, there was disbelief that a black man could somehow best the mafia.",
        "That's a story that has to be told even as the overarching moral viewpoint of gangsterism itself has to be critiqued.",
        "Yet, a story that's been told before in - it wasn't \"\"Cotton Comes to Harlem,\"\" but with the other film it followed on, about the numbers game in Harlem started by African-Americans and resisted attempts to take it over by the mob.",
        "For example, in April, the White House had to announce that accidental deaths in Pakistan of American and Italian hostages.",
        "They were killed in a drone strike back in January.",
        "President Obama promised a reassessment.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Sure.",
        "Well, you've had many films.",
        "You'd had \"\"Hoodlum.\"\" This was originally the article that - Mark Jacobson's article that this film was based on - it's called \"\"The Return of Super Fly.\"\" You had \"\"Super Fly,\"\" you had \"\"The Mack.\"\" But I think in terms of a crossover film, this film did better even among white Americans and African-Americans; a large percentage of females were involved.",
        "So this was a transcendent figure.",
        "In one sense, Frank Lucas becomes the Martin Luther King Jr. of the crime, you know, element in American culture, ironically enough, with all apologies to Dr. King, but as a transcendent figure who moves beyond the ghettoization of black crime into now, potentially, the annals of American crime.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Is it appropriate and - we're talking about somebody as careful with his character as Denzel Washington and a moviemaker as careful as Ridley Scott - both of whom said they were intensely concerned that they did not want to come off glamorizing a terrible drug dealer.",
        "And yet it seems, in a way, they both have."

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, you know, the glamour and the glory are inevitable.",
        "People find themselves rooting against the character played by Russell Crowe, Ritchie Roberts, and rooting for Frank Lucas, in part because criminals are a relief valve when they're cast in that Robin Hood mode, especially in oppressed and minority communities because they speak back to the unjust power that prevails even among the police.",
        "What we can't escape here is that the real criminals also are the police people - the white police people who ruled over African-American communities, not simply by their illegal trade in drugs and complicity in the very drug trade that Frank Lucas was brought down upon, but also because of their racist beliefs.",
        "So in one sense, the compensatory value of a Frank Lucas is that he is, in a sense, getting back at the white supremacy that rules even in the crime world.",

        "Well, I think what struck me is that North Korea's starting to test technologies that it can apply to building an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the United States.",
        "And so the high loft of the missile test had to do with testing what's called a re-entry vehicle, which protects a nuclear warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere after flying long distances.",
        "And so this is an important development in their program.",
        "Are we able to discern what this means for a timeframe - how far they are away from being able to develop an ICBM?",
        "Well, it's very difficult to figure out because we can't predict the rate of testing in the future.",
        "So most experts think that they could deploy an ICBM by about 2020 to 2021, but they certainly could start testing it much sooner.",
        "So there's a new leader in South Korea.",
        "How much of this missile test had to do with sending a message to him?",

        "They're sending the same message to the Chinese.",
        "And it's important that the test took place on the eve of President Xi's global economic summit, so it's somewhat embarrassing to him.",
