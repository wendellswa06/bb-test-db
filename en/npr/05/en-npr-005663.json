        "It's called Peer 2 Peer: Challenging Extremism, and it's an Obama administration initiative which invites college students from all kinds of disciplines - marketing, international relations, computer science, just to name a few - to dream up social media campaigns that will challenge ISIS online and dissuade violent extremists.",

        "The question is, will it work, and will the next president choose to pursue this kind of strategy, which brings us to another challenge that al-Qaida did impose.",

        "You write that there are very similar accounts to what's in those 28 pages, we think, from the 9/11 Commission's papers that have been released over the past year and a half.",
        "Right.",
        "So the 9/11 Commission gets the famous 28 pages from the congressional investigation and then pursues the evidence within those 28 pages.",
        "And we now know they took those 28 pages as a roadmap to conduct their own investigation, identifying many of the same suspects and actually interrogating some of the Saudi suspects who were believed to have assisted the two hijackers in San Diego."

        "Well, we hardly have enough time for everything that's in these pages, but what are the main things that you discovered from reading these documents?",
        "Well, the big discovery of the investigators in Congress was that there appeared to have been some sort of Saudi network in Southern California who went out of its way to provide food and shelter and other assistance to two of the hijackers, who lived pretty openly in San Diego in the year before the attacks.",
        "And the question became whether or not this network of Saudis was linked somehow to the Saudi government.",

        "The 9/11 Commission and, before that, the congressional investigation - they were quite suspicious that Thumairy was somehow tied into a support network for the two hijackers.",

        "Bob Graham of Florida - the head of the Congressional investigation - as a low-level Saudi government spy who had been dispatched to Southern California to keep a watch on the Saudi community there and who was apparently tasked by someone - someone else in the Saudi government - to help out the two hijackers after they showed up in southern California.",
        "And Osama Basnan.",
        "Osama Basnan is a San Diego resident - another Saudi expatriate who's described as the informal mayor of the Islamic community in San Diego, who also appears to have been part of this support network.",
        "And he came under investigation in particular because his wife had received enormous payments before 9/11, apparently for medical care.",
        "There was a lot of concern on the part of both the congressional investigation and the 9/11 Commission that some of that money ended up in the hands of the hijackers."

        "I mean, does it suggest a Saudi plot to hijack planes and fly them into the twin towers?",
        "Well, again, I don't think anybody's arguing strongly that the Saudi government writ large was involved in this, but they are saying - and I think there's a lot of evidence to suggest - that lower-level Saudi government workers - people on the Saudi government payroll - were involved in assisting two of the hijackers.",
        "Now, who tasked them to do that is very much a mystery.",
