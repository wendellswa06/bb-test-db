        "You know, I think the numbing effect that numbers have is pervasive in much of journalism.",
        "But what I find is, frequently, when journalism tries to phrase those numbers in a way that make sense, it always ends up making me suspect the numbers.",
        "For instance, every three seconds a woman dies of a heart attack, kind of summary.",
        "When that happens, I actually find myself disconnecting from the number even more as I start to question the means in which those numbers are derived.",

        "The average arrests for a suspect in a homicide is 10.1.",
        "Do these numbers have value?",
        "I think it's somewhat in the eye of the beholder, but there are numbers like this that put into context, sort of, the environment that is involved in these crimes.",
        "To me, those are fairly startling and important numbers.",
        "Do they tell the whole picture?",
        "No. They tell a piece of it.",

        "Whether it's a story or whether it's the show like HBO's \"\"The Wire\"\", which I'm sure Baltimore doesn't love that much.",
        "However, it's stories like that that actually connects me more to it.",
        "It's the anti-reality that makes the reality more real.",
        "And there's an absence of that coming out of the current situation in Iraq and for obvious reasons, but I think that, perhaps fiction coming out of that area would also give a greater sense of what's really happening.",

        "All right.",
        "Dan, thanks very much.",
        "Not only \"\"The Wire,\"\" but sort of, in a way, a predecessor show \"\"Homicide: Life on the Street.",

        "David Simon, its creator, is a former Sun reporter a long time ago.",
        "And in many ways, yes, in terms of maybe the public relations nature of how you want to present yourself to tourism or so forth.",
        "But \"\"The Wire\"\" itself has done a terrific job - in my opinion and I think those of a lot of us - that it's realistic and poignant and gets to some truce, I agree, that straight reporting can't achieve.",
        "So I think that just for that sense, Baltimore is part of the creative nature of this city, I think, and that people care about this community tremendously, and that \"\"The Wire\"\" is a great example of creative people in Baltimore, creating a show that gets to things that ordinarily wouldn't be seen.",
        "And it certainly elevates it from the police blotter in a way…"

        "And is there - in the research, is there any way to try to address this situation so that we can, I guess, balance the scale?",
        "DR.",
        "PETERS: Well, I mean, one way of thinking about it is that the research is showing something very basic and very fundamental about how we process information.",
        "That - and it suggests that telling stories about people, telling about an individual child or an individual family is going to elicit more action from people.",
        "And in fact, it's going to elicit more action than if you describe the single child or the single family, plus the statistics, believe it or not.",
        "So just the single story makes a difference.",
        "It also suggest, though, that because this is a basic and fundamental aspect of how we process information that when we see something that's going on a more mass level, like the situation in Baltimore perhaps and certainly the situation in Darfur, that perhaps we need to take more legal remedies, that we have these single stories, but we know that there's this massive, you know, horrific thing that's happening and that perhaps more legal action is needed from more of a governmental standpoint."
