        "Yeah.",
        "There are six pre-selected candidates here in Iran, and his two main competitors are both conservatives.",

        "The first one is currently the mayor of Tehran, airline pilot, former police commander Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf.",

        "You know, one of the criticisms, as you mentioned, that has been leveled at President Rouhani is that he swept into office, he promised economic reform.",
        "Are you able to paint us any kind of picture of the quality of life of whether sanctions relief has actually helped people's lives improve?",
        "Well, I was just talking to two young guys at the coffee shop, and they were both between 20 and 25 years old.",
        "For those two guys, President Rouhani hasn't delivered.",

        "I think it's very much in the Iranian establishment's interest to keep the nuclear deal in place.",

        "So no matter who becomes Iran's next president, they will try and keep this nuclear agreement.",
        "And, of course, we must be honest, it wasn't President Rouhani who created this nuclear deal in Iran.",
        "You can't make big decisions without the supreme leader signing off on it.",
        "So in the end, this is a decision by the highest power in Iran.",
        "Is that what Iranians will be voting on or is it, like, just about everywhere on Earth that people are voting based on how they feel this might shake down into their ordinary life?",
        "It actually shows how Iran over the decades has become a less ideological and more normal country because it's not ideology.",
        "It is the economy (unintelligible).",
        "And if you go to Tehran or to Mashhad or to the smaller city here in Iran, people will tell you I want life to improve for me, for my family.",
