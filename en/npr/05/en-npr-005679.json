        "So within a year's time, where we went from almost nobody attending these, and now, about 80 percent of families choose to fly to Dover to watch this short ceremony as their loved one comes off a giant cargo plane and into a van, to be taken to the mortuary.",
        "It's a very wonderful ceremony; they had just never seen it.",
        "So they have to come, and they may be waiting for two or three hours at this facility, waiting for their turn to go out onto the flight line.",
        "And it was an old lobby of an old chapel.",
        "So it was white tile floor, blue folding chairs, fluorescent lights above their head, and most of these ceremonies are happening in the middle of the night.",
        "A lot of them are coming back for some reason - I'm not sure - they come back about 2 or 3 in the morning.",
        "So these families are in shock.",
        "You're not going to make it better for them.",
        "You're not going to ease their pain.",
        "They're not ready to talk to you.",
        "But possibly, by making the - you know, the surroundings comfortable, you can just ease it a couple percentage points and just make it not as painful as it has to be.",
        "So now there is this wonderful, new facility that's more comfortable for what is not such a very comfortable situation.",
        "Unidentified Group: Cheers.",
        "Jeff Brumfiel, NPR News.",

        "It is a beautiful facility.",
        "And I have to tell you, the stories that go along with this - the company that made the furniture, they said they couldn't get it to us in time, and it was going to be about a three-month delay.",
        "The president of the company went to the factory, stopped the furniture line and said, we will make this furniture first, and then we'll go back to our regular production.",
        "People who found out about it drove from several states away to bring artwork that they wanted to contribute to this Center for the Families of the Fallen.",
        "The American people are still wanting to give in any way possible, and this gives people a concrete way to give back."

        "Alison, this is just one example Suzie Schwartz is talking about, of how a military wife can have an impact, a meaningful one.",
        "And it is one that you could argue, as you've already said, Suzie, makes sense from a woman's point of view because it shows a little more compassion, I think was what you were talking about.",
        "Are there other areas that are not necessarily connected to compassion, that you as military wives are able to bring about change within the military?",
        "Well, yes, within the military but also, I think, within the civilian community.",
        "And that's what I've been really concerned with.",
        "I mean, when I married into the military 10 years ago, I was from a non-military family.",
        "I had all kinds of stereotypes about service members and their wives, and what that life was like.",
        "Basically, I thought service members were just robots who followed orders, and their wives were unambitious at best, probably, you know, and that's why they followed their husbands around.",
        "But when I got to know the military community, all these stereotypes were shattered.",
        "And what I've seen throughout the last 10 years is that there is this tremendous gulf in understanding between the civilian community and the military community in America.",
        "And in effect, I think it is we're seeing two different Americas, one that serves and one that doesn't.",
        "And this gulf in perception has arisen since the abolition of the draft in 1973 and, you know, and it's hard to cross it.",
        "So what I've really tried to do with my writing is close the gulf between the civilian and the military communities.",
        "And I have people coming up to me all the time since my book has come out, saying, how can we help, how can we help?",
        "They want to help military families, especially those who are going through deployments and especially those with kids, but these civilian families just don't know how.",
        "And so that's a really critical area of education that I've become involved in.",
        "Let me ask you briefly to describe, if you can: Is there such a thing as an average or contemporary military wife?",
        "And if there is such a person, who is she?",
        "It's funny you should ask.",
        "I mean, I get after my book came out, I found it funny that a lot of publications called me a non-traditional military spouse.",
        "And I found that funny because all military spouses I know are non-traditional military spouses.",
        "There is no cookie-cutter military spouse anymore because I think the times we live in are so challenging, and the demands put on military families are so intense that, you know, there's no typical military family.",
        "Everyone handles it their own way."

        "So I mean, if there's one unifying quality that military spouses share, I think it's just that we fell in love with somebody in the military.",

        "I was wondering if your guests could speak what it's like for male military spouses.",
        "Do they face similar challenges as female spouses, and do they have similar support systems?",
        "It's different and yet the same.",
        "I have to say just before I came here, I was sitting in a luncheon with a male spouse - it was at a table, five female spouses and a male spouse - and he chose several years ago - he's retired military - that he was going to follow his wife as she proceeded her career, and he has done - he's been the president of the Officers' Spouses' Club; he's been the honorary adviser.",
        "He has done all the things, attended all the change of commands, and he has enjoyed every second of it.",
        "It was a conscious decision that he made, and he's enjoyed it.",
        "Now, he has also decided that he's not going to try to work full time.",
        "He's worked part time but for him, he's very comfortable in that, in not working and being the spouse.",
        "But for some, they do find that - are - is - the spouse network is heavily women, and sometimes we do lose sight and we do, let's say, manicure/pedicure items, and they push back a little bit.",
        "But for the most part, I find that they have chosen that life, and they -really, the stresses are the same.",
        "We all would like to have good employment, and so they have the same stresses, that - it's hard to move every two or three years.",
        "So I find we have more in common than not.",
        "What would you say, Alison, is the thing that is the most challenging for a military wife to deal with?",
        "Well, in our case, and among a lot of the wives I talked to, it's been the tempo of the deployments during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars because, you know, there's a new normal now, and things aren't the way they used to be in terms of when troops get sent out, how long they spend at home, and then when they get sent back out overseas.",
        "And so for us personally, dealing with deployments with two small children has been a huge challenge - because, you know, kids are different at every age developmentally, but ours were 1 and 3 when my husband started deploying.",
        "They're now 5 and 7.",
        "And it really -it just doesn't get any easier with time.",
