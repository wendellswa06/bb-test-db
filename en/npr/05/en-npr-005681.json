        "Let's start by explaining how these discharges work.",
        "What does it mean, other than honorable?",
        "Basically, the vast majority of service members get out with an honorable discharge, but there are a lot of categories below that.",
        "There's a category of other than honorable, which is an administrative discharge.",
        "It covers everything from a pattern of misconduct, breaches of military order, to failing a drug test to drunk driving.",
        "And then there are discharges that come with a court martial - a bad conduct discharge or even a dishonorable discharge, for very serious crimes.",
        "So how does that affect a veteran if he or she is discharged this way?",
        "Bad paper means no GI Bill, no VA home loan.",
        "It can mean no VA at all.",
        "We spoke to dozens of veterans for this series; and I heard a recurring story, which is veterans with bad paper getting turned away from VA centers.",
        "Like Eric Highfill, an Iraq and Afghanistan vet - when he tried to go to a medical center in Michigan, he couldn't get past the front desk.",
        "Not a postcard (unintelligible).",
        "And then eventually it started being used in sports as well, particularly boxing for instance.",
        "If a boxer was really beat up very badly you could say that he was shellacked.",
        "And, you know, then we saw the transfer of that into things like politics, where you could talk about it as being a bad defeat at the polls.",
        "So what makes a word or phrase catch on?",
        "Very often it can rely on past words as a kind of a mash-up.",
        "We often see this happening in pop culture for instance, where fans of Justin Bieber call themselves Beliebers, which combines Bieber and believer.",
        "Or the fans of the TV show \"\"Glee\"\" call themselves gleeks, which combines glee and geeks.",
        "So very often you can find the building blocks of new words and phrases just by combining things that we already have at hand.",
        "And then it also really needs to strike a chord.",
        "It needs to resonate with a particular subculture, and we find these things catching on very quickly these days through the use of social networking.",
        "Social media like Twitter and Facebook allows these things to spread very quickly these days.",
        "Ben Zimmer's website is called \"\"Visual Thesaurus\"\" and he's also on the Executive Council of the American Dialect Society."

        "When the uranium left Poland a couple of weeks ago, reporter Geoff Brumfiel was on the scene, and he has this report.",
        "There's no way that you'd mistake this for a shipment of, say, Polish sausages.",

        "These reactors are using highly enriched uranium fuel pure enough for a bomb.",
        "Since September 11th, the U.S.",
        "government has grown increasingly worried that terrorists could steal this material or buy it.",
        "Bunn says that these reactors aren't very well guarded.",
        "They're just not places where it's plausible that you're ever going to have the kinds of, you know, military-scale security that are really, in my view, appropriate."
