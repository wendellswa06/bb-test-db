        "I mean, does the country still owe these vets something for just having gone to war in the first place?",
        "That's exactly the question.",
        "It comes down to two interpretations of what we owe them.",
        "Do you earn your veteran's health care by performing and earning and getting an honorable discharge, or is this some sort of a covenant, which from the minute you take an oath to go fight your country's wars, it's sealed?",
