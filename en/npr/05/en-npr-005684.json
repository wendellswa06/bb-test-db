        "Brian Strahine still remembers the time he and his Delta Upsilon brothers at Cornell put pledges through a grueling spring night.",
        "They dressed up, got drunk, swam in the lake, then came back to the house basement.",
        "Strahine noticed one particularly ill-looking pledge slumped over the couch.",
        "He was struggling.",
        "And actually, I remember a senior telling me that he was a pre-med major, and he knew how to handle the situation.",
        "As fraternity president, Strahine overruled the senior and had someone take the sick pledge to the ER.",
        "Strahine says he did the best he could to look out for the guys.",
        "But even as the hazing continued into the early hours, Strahine didn't put an end to it.",
        "The whole night, I just felt uncomfortable.",
        "I felt sick to my stomach.",
        "I was angry.",
        "To this day, Strahine continues to feel complicit.",
        "I would give anything to meet with them again and apologize.",
        "I would have nothing else to say other than I'm deeply and terribly sorry.",
        "And I'm ashamed of the things that I did.",
        "Strahine, who today speaks on college campuses about his experiences, knows a lot of people revere nights like the one he just described, defining moments when someone believes they became a man.",
        "Strahine says he can't relate.",

        "On June 3rd, 1979, an exploratory drilling rig off the coast of Mexico blew out.",

        "The biggest difference between the Ixtoc I blowout in 1979 and the Deepwater Horizon is the depth of the water.",
        "Instead of 5,000 feet, the Ixtoc I was in 160 feet of water, which meant divers could easily get to the well.",
        "While that was nice because they didn't have platoons of underwater robots back then, it still took 10 months to cap the well.",
        "A nasty sheen of oil spread out across the water while massive jets of natural gas, belching from the ocean floor, fed a continuous inferno of flame burning on the surface - its own little watery hell on Earth.",
        "Between three and five million barrels of oil poured into the water.",
        "At that time we had about 170 miles of the south Texas coast coated with oil.",
        "Wes Tunnell is the associate director of the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M in Corpus Christi.",
        "Tunnell says the Ixtoc spill coated the beaches of South Texas to an extent and depth not seen with the Deepwater spill.",
        "It was about 20 to 30 feet in width and a half-inch to one foot in thickness along the entire stretch of the south Texas coast.",
        "It was a mess.",
        "The Mexican oil company Pemex eventually called the Red Adair Company in Houston to shut it down.",
        "They did manage to close the well casing and put out the fire, briefly, but then the well ruptured again.",
        "And because of the danger to the ships on the surface, the massive natural gas plume had to be relit so as not to accidentally blow everyone to kingdom come.",
        "In 1979 this all happened in relative obscurity.",
        "You can imagine the Monday-morning quarterbacking if it were to have happened in 2010."
