        "It remains to be seen just how well - or how quickly - it will work.",
        "But there was an immediate burst of activity in the mortgage market.",
        "Across the country, mortgage brokers reported a deluge of calls from people wondering whether it was a good time to refinance.",

        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "Could you help us understand the link between a drop at the Fed and how that actually affects the mortgage market?",
        "Well, what the Fed did was they cut short-term interest rates; short-term interest rates affect prime lending, monthly adjustables, and it trickles up to long-term interest rates.",
        "But it is not a direct effect always.",
        "The mortgage industry and the bond market has taken into consideration that the Fed was going to be cutting rates at half percent hopefully next week.",
        "They were surprised by a three-quarter percent drop in the rates.",
        "The bond market reacted very positively to it originally.",
        "And the rates actually did go down.",
        "And we saw rates on Tuesday drop from around 5-7/8 percent to around 5-3/8 percent, but then once the market settled down, we actually saw mortgage rates settle back up into the 5-3/4 to 5-7/8 range in the past day.",
        "So there was a small window there of a few days where it actually sounded like it was a good time to refinance."

        "Well, that's correct.",
        "It's still a good time to refinance.",
        "What people have to look at is there is no one specific good time; they've got to look at their individual situation.",
        "Maybe they thought they were going to be in their home for three to five years and now with the values of houses having come down some, they're going to end up staying in their house longer and they want the security of a fixed-rate mortgage.",
        "Is there any clear category of homeowner, a person that should not refinance?",
        "I think you have to look at how long you're going to be in the home for.",

        "So tell us Joe, what is the big celestial event of the summer?",
        "Well the big celestial event of the summer unfortunately is going to be out of view for those of us who live on this side of the Earth, the North American and or western hemisphere.",
        "The big event is the great total solar eclipse that's going to be occurring on the 22nd of next month, July.",
        "The path of that particular eclipse, the region where the sun is going to appear completely covered by the passing new moon, stretches across portions of India, China, just to the south of Japan across the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.",
        "I hope I pronounced that correctly, actually passes over Iwo Jima before moving out over the central Pacific Ocean and moving off of the surface of the Earth, the shadow of the moon will, at the end of the eclipse.",
        "So nothing, no chance for us unless we want to go to Iwo Jima or something?"

        "And that is going to make this the longest total solar eclipse available on the Earth until the year 2132.",
        "And so many people have waited many years I think to make their plans.",
        "And many folks are going to be heading toward China, India or on cruise ships to position themselves again within the path of the total eclipse.",
        "And they're going to be literally, because especially it passes over China, tens of millions of people who are going to be in the zone of the phase of the total eclipse.",
        "In fact this is going to pass - the shadow is going to pass over four of the 10 largest cities in China, including Yushan and Shanghai.",
        "So there are going to be a lot of folks, and they've got their fingers crossed I am sure, that that particular day July 22nd will be clear so that they'll all be able to see this fantastic sight.",

        "The next total eclipse of the sun over the United States, the continental United States will be, mark your calendar, August 21st, 2017.",

        "And they look, you know, down the road five, 10, 15 years and say, okay I'm going to be here, I'm going to be there, I'm going to be doing this and that on specific days, you know, many, many years from now.",
        "And just as I said a lot of people had been waiting for this big eclipse next month.",
        "And I'm sure there are a lot of folks who don't have the funds, especially in this poor economy right now to go to China or go to India or on a cruise ship, who say, okay I'll miss this one but I'm definitely not going to miss that one on August 21st, 2017, that literally passes right across perhaps our backyard.",

        "Okay, well, if you are an early riser you might want to get up in the pre-dawn hours, say around 3, 4, 5 a.m. and look over into the East, Northeastern sky.",
        "You'll see our old friend, the planet Venus.",
        "I say our old friend because it was glimmering and was a brilliant evening star for many, many months during this past winter and early spring.",
        "It's now transitioned to a morning object.",
        "You could see it just before sunrise and it has a companion.",
        "It has had a companion since early May, a much smaller, much dimmer object hovering nearby with kind of a yellowish-orange tint and that's the planet Mars.",

        "That's absolutely correct.",

        "Venus is actually the closer of the two planets but because of our position in the solar system we are looking at Venus and then beyond Venus if you will, along the same sight of line here you can also see Mars.",
        "Mars is apparently much, much dimmer as it usually is when you compare it to something so brilliant like Venus.",
        "But interestingly in the coming months Venus is going to be turning over toward the part of the sky where the sun is.",
        "It will become less and less prominent later on in the year.",
        "In the meantime Mars will be getting closer to the Earth and when we get to the beginning of next year, the early part of next year, when Mars reaches a point in its orbit relative to the Earth in what we call opposition, it will be shining like a very brilliant yellowish orange star with not twinkling in our wintertime sky - January, February, March - just after sundown.",
        "So, Venus will become less and less prominent toward the end of the year and Mars will be ramping it up.",

        "And this is absolutely an untruth.",
        "If Mars was in fact in apparent size that large it would only be about twice the distance of the Moon from the Earth, about a half a million miles away, and then we would all be in big, big trouble.",
