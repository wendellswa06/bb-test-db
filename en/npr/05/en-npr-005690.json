        "Thanks.",
        "So Joe, you were going to tell us about the Perseid's which I think is in August.",
        "Is that right?",
        "That happens to be my personal favored astronomical event.",
        "Well, the Perseid's are a favorite of many people.",
        "It's probably the most beloved meteor shower of the year.",
        "There have been, of course, over the years others that have had greater intensity, like the Leonids, about a decade ago, but the Perseids are the Old Faithful, the old reliable.",
        "They come back every year.",
        "They are the dross, they are the debris left behind by the comet Swift-Tuttle, which takes about 130-some-odd years to go around the sun.",
        "Every time the comet goes around the sun, it leaves behind a river of rubble.",
        "The earth just happens, in its orbit around the sun, to intersect that river of rubble, which…",
        "River of rubble.",
        "I like that.",
        "And this river of rubble consists basically of particles the size of copier toner up to about pebbles and sand grains, and when the earth rams into this debris field, every year in the middle part of August, we see streaks of light that apparently shoot across the sky, dart across the sky, giving the impression that stars are falling out of their fixed place in the heaven.",
        "But really, what we're seeing is the end point of this debris as it rams through the atmosphere at 30 or 40 miles per second and lights up or heats up the air along its path.",
        "It produces this streak effect.",
        "The Perseids are the favorite because many of the meteors that appear with this shower are quite bright, and also they're reliable.",
        "Some meteor showers are good some years and not so good other years, but they're fairly reliable, the Perseids are, producing, under perfect conditions, dark, clear skies as upwards to maybe 50 or 60 meteors per hour.",
        "We have one problem this year, and that will be the moon, which unfortunately will be in the sky when the shower reaches its peak on the nights of the 11th and 12th of August, in the wee hours of the morning, actually, just before sunrise.",
        "If you're out and about looking for shooting stars this year, the moon is going to be a bit of a hindrance because it's going to be at the last-quarter phase and kind of bright in the sky.",
        "So some of the fainter streaks may not be immediately visible, but if you're out and about with, you know - and I always find it best to go and watch this with friends.",
        "If you get a bunch of friends together one of those two nights, the night of the 11th or the night of the 12th, and just lie out on a lounge chair or blankets or whatever, look up, maybe you might want to chit-chat, maybe have a little music in the background, and every once in a while, you'll see one of these streakers.",
        "And depending upon how large the piece of debris from that comet is as it enters the earth's atmosphere, you could see anything from a little streak like to maybe something like almost like a Roman candle for a few brief moment, blazing across the sky as well."

        "They always put on a good show, and if the weather is clear, hopefully they'll do so again this year.",
        "So by streakers, we're talking about meteorites, not some other kind of streakers.",
        "We don't want to mislead anybody here about…",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Exactly.",
        "Well, I must tell you that when we get into August of this year, and if you do find Saturn in the sky and train your telescope on it, you won't see any rings because the rings are turning edge-on to the earth in early September, and the sunlight will not be falling on those rings during most of August, so…",

        "The collision will help scientists learn more about comets, and it will also make for some stratospheric fireworks on Independence Day.",
        "Our correspondent Farai Chideya spoke with Dave Eicher, editor in chief of Astronomy magazine.",
        "He described what's going to happen.",
        "This is a very unusual thing.",
        "It's never happened before that we've fired a very large bullet that's made largely of copper and aluminum, the size of a washing machine, at a comet that's about--the comet's nucleus is about four or five miles across--to make a big crater.",
        "It's very strange.",
        "It's something that people have thought about doing for about 30 years, but there are several reasons for doing it, and the main one is to find out: What are comets really made of?",
        "We have a pretty good idea that they're made of dirty ice, but beyond that, we don't really know the details of what they're made of.",
        "Now you mentioned dirty ice, and some people call comets `dirty snowballs.",
        "You're literally talking about ice, as in water.",
        "These are big floating icebergs or something?",
        "We are, indeed.",
        "We're talking about frozen carbon dioxide, frozen other kinds of gases, but also water ice, and it's thought by most astronomers now that, originally, comets contributed a huge amount of water to Earth and a lot of what is now in our ocean."

        "Now when you talk about early material from the solar system, what sorts of things are NASA folks looking for?",
        "We can't really understand the solar system and how it got going unless we can really understand the origins and the conditions that happened when the solar nebula, this cloud of gas and dust, contracted down and the star turned on and the planets got going.",
        "With comets, we're looking not at sort of a rocky impact world that shows us the way things were and it simply hasn't changed because there's not flowing water on it; but we want to see active material, this water, this ice, to smash into the comet and to study the spectra, the spectra of the material that gets shot up in a big plume with this collision.",
        "That will tell astronomers a lot, they hope, about what the original early days of the solar system were like.",
        "Now final question: This has obviously been planned far in advance to occur on Independence Day.",
        "What is this collision going to look like from the Earth, and how should people set about viewing it?",
        "We don't know exactly.",

        "Nobody knows.",
        "But it's a comet that you need binoculars or a small telescope to see now, for minutes or even for an hour or two after this collision.",
