        "Richard, when you talk about taking the focus away from individuals and putting them on systems, what are the means of redress and recourse?",

        "Well, the law provides for many mechanisms to deal with these types of problems, and one thing I'd like to emphasize that most people, both lawyers and non-lawyers, think that we have to find a racist in order to have legal redress.",
        "So, the image that most people have in their minds is that we look for a discrete state of mind, bigotry on the part of some decision maker in the - in management.",

        "Thomas, when you have looked at racism or race in the North, which is what your book, \"\"Sweet Land of Liberty,\"\" looks at, how might people have played the race card differently in the north than they did in the South?",
        "Well, I think a lot of Northern activists, and I think Southern activists did this as well, put attention on trying to ascertain individual intentions rather than looking at the ways in which race and racial inequality were built into the structure of the economy, that it wasn't just a matter of racist employers individually harboring negative thoughts about African-Americans; that was part of the story, but a really important part of the story was the ways in which the cumulative effect of those decisions over time, set up workplaces in ways that basically cordon off African-Americans to one type of job and gave whites opportunities for other types of jobs.",
        "And that goes beyond an emphasis on individual intention to really looking at the whole way we organize our workplaces, our neighborhoods, our everyday life.",
        "Richard, just briefly, how have people who are not black and not white - Latinos, Asian-Americans, Native Americans, people of mixed race - have been treated in this kind of dialogue?",
        "Well, the law prohibits discrimination on the basis of race regardless of one's race, so it treats Latinos, Asians, Native Americans - to the extent they're understood as racial groups - exactly in the same way that it will treat African-Americans, and indeed, it also prohibits discrimination against whites.",
        "So, legally, there's no distinction made between the various racial groups.",
        "Now, of course, in social dialogue, I think it's fair to say that most of our country's discussion about race relations has taken the form of a kind of a black-white paradigm, that that was the most striking - those were the most striking examples historically of racial discrimination.",
        "And even today, they define many of the most severe cases.",
