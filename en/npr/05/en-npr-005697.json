        "And then we'll go on to other storms.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, let's start with Hanna first.",
        "As you mentioned, it is a tropical storm, and the good news is we do not expect it to be at hurricane strength when it makes landfall.",
        "The center of the storm as we speak is sitting about 375 miles south/southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina.",
        "Another way to look at that is about 110 miles east of Daytona Beach, Florida.",
        "Hanna's picked up some forward speed, moving northwest to 20 miles per hour.",
        "Looks like a turn more to the north will happen later today and do a turn to the northeast, and it'll pick up in forward speed on Saturday.",
        "So, in that track, the center of Hanna will be near the southeast coast of the United States this afternoon or tonight.",
        "Thank you, Scott.",
        "In that part of the world, it really isn't.",
        "It's starting to be picked up around the big area of high pressure to its southeast and a little bit of help in the upper atmosphere as well.",
        "Then it'll race it to the northeast over the weekend and that's certainly good news.",
        "You know, these things hang around inland for days, then you got a horrific flooding event, not that we're not going to get a lot of rain out of this.",
        "It's not going to be a hurricane.",
        "It will be a tropical storm, but what is it going to be like?",
        "It's going into this kind of a low-lying, marshy and outer-bank island area along the part of the coast there?",
        "Well, Hanna's expected to produce rainfall accumulations of three to seven inches from coastal South Carolina, north through North Carolina, on up and the center of Virginia, Maryland, southeastern Pennsylvania.",
        "Could be some isolated - a maximum amount of 10 inches.",
        "So, yes, there is the potential for flash flooding, particularly in the northern Middle Atlantic states and all the way up in the southern New England."

        "Ok, behind Hanna, Hurricane Ike, and I think Ike is a hurricane, not a tropical storm.",

        "Well, it is heading in the general direction of the extreme southeastern United States, including the state of Florida and including the city of Miami.",
        "We are certainly in that day-four and day-five cone of concern, as we call it.",
        "Ike remains a pretty powerful hurricane.",
        "It is 120 mile per hour sustained winds right now.",
        "That's makes it a category-three hurricane, a major hurricane.",
        "We do expect some weakening in the storm over the next 24 hours.",
        "But Ike is expected to strengthen again back up to a major hurricane.",
        "Exactly where it's going to go right now, bit difficult to say.",
        "The skinny black line that we always referred to that you're not supposed to concentrate on, now brings it through the Florida Straits and over to Florida Keys and maybe into the Gulf of Mexico.",
        "However, as we always say, hurricanes are not a dot on the map.",
        "They impact a large geographical area.",
        "So, this could still have a very significant impact across South Florida and Central Florida as well.",
        "You are at the National Hurricane Center.",
        "So, even though this is a - well, it's a bad thing happening, you must be excited about it.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "It's hurricanes that got me interested in weather when I was eight years old.",
        "That did it for me.",

        "And there's really no higher calling, and that is our mission here.",

        "Would Tennessee whiskey by any other name taste as sweet?",
        "A debate in Tennessee is on simmer over a bill to distill - sorry, that was irresistible - a legal definition of what makes Tennessee whiskey Tennessee.",
        "The state legislature passed a bill last year saying whiskey can be labeled Tennessee only if it's made in the state from a mash that's 51 percent corn, trickles through maple charcoal, and is aged in new, charred oak barrels.",
        "Now, there's some precedent in the spirits world.",
        "Sparkling wine is champagne only if it's from the Champagne region of France; Scotch whisky is from Scotland, and tequila from blue agave grown in Mexico.",
        "The Brown-Forman Corporation, which makes Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in Lynchburg, likes the law.",
        "They credit their founder, Mr. Daniel, with steeping his mash in maple charcoal to mellow the drink.",
        "Jack Daniel's sells about 90 percent of the Tennessee whiskey in the world, and Jeff Arnett, their master distiller, has said we shouldn't do anything that would make Tennessee Whiskey an inferior product.",
        "But Diageo PLC - British company, wouldn't you know, that owns Smirnoff Vodka and Johnnie Walker Scotch - bought the George Dickel distillery, which has been making what they consider equally Tennessee whiskey since 1870.",
        "A Diageo spokesperson says we're in favor of flexibility that lets all distillers, large and small, make Tennessee whiskey the way their family recipes tell them."
