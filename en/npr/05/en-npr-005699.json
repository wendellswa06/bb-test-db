        "Sure.",
        "I was in a classroom in Atlanta once.",
        "And the teacher had rallied her students around the idea - they were first-graders - they were going to read, write and do math like third-graders by the end of the year.",
        "And these kids were excited about it.",
        "Or another teacher I visited just this spring - a teacher named Maurice Thomas, who is teaching high school.",
        "And you walk into his room and there on the wall, it says: All of us will be accepted to a four-year university; the lucky ones to Wisconsin.",
        "Maurice is a rabid Badger fan.",
        "Yeah, I figured.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But he set an ambitious goal, just like any strong leader does in any challenging context.",
        "And the fact that he set that goal helped make it happen.",
        "And as I was there, Maurice pulled out this folded sheet of paper, where he had the names of his 55 students.",
        "And at that time, in the spring, 52 of his 55 students had been accepted to four-year universities.",
        "And this is in a context where most of them were not on a path to go to college before he came into their lives.",
        "Do you think - as much time as youve spent watching teachers, looking at what they do - is there a common thread of just, excitement and energy?",
        "Or could you have a very low-key but high-performing teacher, someone who you wouldnt walk in and instinctively say, wow, thats a great teacher?",
        "You know, it is fascinating.",
        "I think, just my own learning curve here.",
        "I think I came into this work almost 10 years ago with that assumption in mind - that great teaching has something to do with the fire and brimstone and charisma, and all of the drama.",
        "But when we define great teaching not as what the teacher does but as how much students are learning, and the impact a teacher is having in children's lives, there is not one style or personality that predicts an effective teacher.",
        "And I absolutely could take you to teachers' classrooms where there's not much drama.",
        "There are soft-spoken leaders in the classroom who nonetheless are setting ambitious goals, and having just as dramatic impact as those teachers who are, you know, running around the room in costumes.",
        "What do you think the intersection is between being a good teacher and a good disciplinarian?",
        "Are those very similar skills, do you think?",
        "I was looking at one of your case studies, and you talk about a teacher in New York who early on, had to break up 11 fights in a single day."

        "The way that I've come to think about discipline is that it's inextricably connected to the learning in the classroom.",
        "That is, the most effective teachers think about discipline beyond rules and consequences -although that's very important.",
        "What they're aiming for is a room where all the students are so invested in wanting to learn, they're monitoring themselves.",
        "And I had this wonderful experience in Houston one time, where there was a fifth-grade girl.",
        "She was doing some work in this classroom with an amazing teacher.",
        "And I crouched down by the girl and I asked her: Could you just tell me a little bit about what you're learning?",
        "You know, could you ask me later?",
        "I'm kind of busy.",
        "And I just think these teachers, they are convincing their kids that they can and want to learn.",

        "I loved it.",

        "What about the burnout factor?",
        "I mean, the things that seem to be most effective that you talk about are taking a lot of extra time, working with kids after school, taking phone calls at night, maybe.",
        "It could be a really unsustainable life - often for not very much pay.",
        "How do you retain the highly motivated teachers that you might have?",
        "Yeah, honestly, it's something I worry about a lot.",
        "I think that we do see a growing number of these highly effective teachers figuring out ways to make it sustainable.",
        "But we simply cannot solve the problem of educational inequity by expecting 3 million teachers to be working like the most heroic of our teachers are working right now.",
        "You know, the way that I've come to think about it is that these teachers are showing us what is necessary to change children's life paths.",
        "And now that they are showing us that, we need to change the systems around them so that they can do what it takes, but it's easier and more sustainable.",
        "Steven Farr, thanks so much for talking with us."
