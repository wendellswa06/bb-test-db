        "Awesome.",
        "The Cassees are among the growing number of devout Protestants, many of them Americans, who fervently support Israel.",

        "It's also lucrative.",
        "Over the past 20 years, evangelical Christians have contributed billions of dollars to Israel.",

        "They're also given nutrition from what's ever in the air, and in the water and in the humidity.",
        "Nutrition from birds, by the way, is the polite way of saying bird poop.",
        "At the bottom of these trees with the top flowers, there's a carpeting of terrestrial orchids.",

        "Sarah Hedean pointed out the bottom petal of the blossom - it looks like a little bucket.",
        "She calls it a pooch.",
        "And what happens is the pollinator actually falls inside the pooch and has to crawl its way out.",
        "Now, as it crawls out, it goes past the polinia, which then the insect picks up and carries to another plant, and it pollinates the plant.",
        "So, it's a very ingenious pollination mechanism."

        "This variety of orchids grows in fields next to the butterfly weed.",

        "And this orchid doesn't even have to produce nectar to attract it.",
        "So, it just gets pollinated automatically."

        "We have now begun a new line of investigation, and we developed a new theory of the origin of the very advanced social systems like those of ants and bees and wasps on one side, that are the dominant forms ecologically among the little things of the Earth, and ourselves.",
        "We have a couple of questions we need to answer.",
        "One is that if those advanced conditions of social organization which we call (unintelligible), we could define it in a moment if you like, but if they are so immensely successful, why are they so rare in the course of evolution, and why did they take so long to appear?",
        "We're just newcomers, of course, and the social insects, they're so dominant around the world and the land, didn't show up until well into the Mesozoic, the age of dinosaurs.",
        "Before that, there were no creatures like us either among them or among the bigger animals.",
        "So what's the answer to that?",
        "We had to develop a new theory which encompassed other things but also encompassed the possibility to answer that key question.",
        "And what is your new theory?",
        "Well, at the most - at the foundation, I and a number of others have been seeing for years that there were big problems with the reigning theory, which is called kin selection theory, or kin selection.",
        "It has another name, theory of inclusive fitness.",
        "But kin selection is the one that's familiar to most people who've taken courses or read about this subject.",
        "It's been around for 40 years, but it was - it was showing its age.",
        "It was able to seemingly predict some things, but it wasn't able to predict very much, and even the things it predicted seemed not a very good fit after all.",
        "And so it was necessary - foundationally what happened was that the new theory - I mean the old theory - emphasized the relationship between kin, particularly closely related kin, that forms a nucleus of the formation of a very advanced society and that that sort of friendliness, altruistic reciprocity between close kin, was the key to how social behavior came about, including very high social behavior."
