        "In other words, if you had a lot of kin around you, you behaved well and kind toward them.",
        "Yeah, that was the selfish gene view.",
        "In other words, the sacrifice for your brother or your aunt, whatever close kin you have around you, and if you lose in the Darwinian race, I mean you leave fewer children as a result of that altruistic behavior and leave in the next generation fewer, then it doesn't matter because the close relative has the same genes as you by common descent, and therefore the thing, the trait that made you altruistic can evolve in a strict Darwinian manner.",
        "That's why it was sometimes called the selfish gene theory.",
        "Well, that has, for reasons that I think we could spend the rest of the hour discussing, has largely fallen very far short.",
        "Key evidence that was thought to support it proved not to be true, and it just hasn't lived up to the demands of a really good theory, which is that a good theory fits a lot of facts, and it points clearly to new lines of investigation.",
        "The new theory, actually, it's a piecing-together of elements that have been with us for some time, and we built up to it not just through my thinking, certainly, but through the efforts of quite a few people, is that kin selection is not important.",
        "I mean, it can occur but it most likely would lead to nepotism.",
        "It's not an important factor.",
        "And whereas group selection had been marginalized in the kin selection scheme - that is, the competition among groups of individuals and the outcome of that competition in altruism that results in group superiority when group is pitted against group, that was marginalized, but now we see that that was a big mistake.",
        "Kin selection is not a key factor.",
        "Group selection, combined with individual classical Darwinian selection - that is, you know, people competing with other people within the same group, that is the key, and now we're back to re-examining group selection, group versus group, in a wholly new way.",
        "And it's been yielding new ideas and information already very fast.",
        "And so then in this theory, the group then seeks to help itself out.",
        "Rather than working between one-on-one kin, it's all the members of the group that are helping each other succeed.",
        "Yeah, there's a way of comparing group and individual-level selection.",
        "People understand immediately individual-level selection.",
        "Group selection is not hard either.",
        "And the little formula that we use just to sort of sum it all up, to make it clearer, is that within groups selfish individuals beat altruists.",
        "But between groups, groups of altruists beat groups of selfish people.",
        "So both of those are operating simultaneously, and you can see they're operating in contest with one another.",
        "It's a conflict between those two levels.",
        "That means that within a very complex society, certainly including human societies, you are - you have conflicted individuals.",
        "You have a lack of a stable point at which individual welfare and if you want to call it selfishness cannot be expunged, and neither can altruism be expunged without respectively dissolving the society into just a bunch of competing individuals on one end and - or a robotic, ant-like society on the other end.",

        "Yeah, not at all unexpected because there were quite a few people whose research was bound up in or depended upon applications of kin selection theory.",

        "And also it has to be thought out through time, long-term consequences and short-term consequences, and that's what makes being human so difficult and why philosophers ponder so long and laboriously on the whole matter of moral reasoning, trying to get rules and patterns out of it that can serve us as a kind of guidebook.",
