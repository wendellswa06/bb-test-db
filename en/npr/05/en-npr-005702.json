        "Oh, hi, fantastic that discussion you're having.",
        "Just one quick question, sort of comment.",
        "I believe your theory has been proven correct 100 percent by what's happening now with society, has bonded through mass communication methods.",
        "And it looks like that will be the way to overthrow anything which seems to be socially unacceptable, whether it's governmental or whatever.",
        "And as you said earlier, more decisions (unintelligible) and it looks like the use of Facebook or whatever, Twitter, whatever, for mass communication and (unintelligible) society against evil.",
        "That's all I want to say, thank you.",
        "All right, do you agree?",
        "It's a little hard to comment on that except to say yes, that's some of the fine detail of what we do and how we work out our day-to-day existence.",
        "So you believe we're at sort of a turning point then, for our society and our evolution?",
        "Not necessarily.",
        "I think what we are is at a turning point in the sense of having, one, much better knowledge of where we came from.",
        "I think we need to be teaching that and investigating it as just part of routine education.",
        "And second, what are we, and why, from that history, and from what all we know of how our brain works in the like, what we are.",
        "And the - and then we're going to be in a situation - of course we are at the turning point, and we are right on the edge of - we're in the early stage of techno-scientific revolution, where we are becoming essentially a global community in constant and minute communication.",
        "That'll change the arena somewhat, but it's not going to change our human nature or our ability to deal with our problems without a lot of calculation and without a lot of background knowledge.",
        "But your research and your ideas are saying that if we want to stay a successful large community, we have to think altruistically, all of us together.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And that's what your research with ants and your research with people have shown that if we evolve toward altruism, we'll stay successful.",
        "That means we have to get all the different parts of the world working, if there is truly, you know - we're now, through social communities, combining a lot of different - various parts of the world into a larger colony, bigger nest."

        "I know what you mean, but we don't want to become ants, surely.",
        "We want to be as fractious and quarrelsome and uncertain and dithering from now on, but we just want to do it with more wisdom and making better decisions.",
        "But basically, again, as I say, I think the time has come to put together and to put, as part of education, what a host of scientists ranging in their separate interests, all the way from molecular genetics through to portions - to the social sciences, actually, to take what they have - are putting together with increasing clarity and make that basic to our understanding of ourselves.",
        "We're not teaching anything like that now, even teaching it in - with critiques.",

        "Hi, Ira.",

        "This week, we - our Video Pick of the Week this week is part of the series called \"\"Desktop Diaries.\"\" And this week's was a tour of Dr. Wilson's desk and office, he graciously let us camp out for a few hours.",
        "And I'll just set the scene a little bit, but, Dr. Wilson, feel free to jump in and correct me.",
        "So you walk in, and on one side of the hallway is the biggest ant collection in the world, and I think you said maybe a million specimens of ants?",
        "Yeah, about that.",
        "If you have volunteers, we can get the exact figure.",

        "So I've got a wonderful collection there, and I can't bear to throw a single one of them away.",
        "Well, that explains it.",
        "It really is a beautiful collection, and you can see it on our website at sciencefriday.com.",
        "And I was - as I was listening to you talk, it occurred to me that maybe \"\"Desktop Diaries,\"\" our interest in other people in this way has something to do with our genes too.",
        "You said that maybe - you know, that we're really social.",
        "I wonder, do you think that's why we like biographies and, like, sort of a human take on stories?",
        "Actually, yes.",
        "I was just saying - and I'm not - this is not just my perception or off the top of my head.",
        "This is what cognitive psychologists like Michael Thomas Shellow(ph), who's done brilliant work in this area, but many others as well, are showing, is that we are are about as intensely interested in other people minute by minute and just about the most gossipy conceivable species that you can imagine being produced on any planet.",

        "Yeah.",

        "If we collected all the stories of scientists and whatever profession you really would like to understand more deeply, I think it would profit us a lot to, how would you say it, excavated - excavate by testimony and examination in just how it all got started and where those commitments came from.",

        "We wanted to get a better understanding of what these powerful storms might tell us about the climate, so once again, we've called on Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University to explain what's going on.",
