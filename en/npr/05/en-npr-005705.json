        "The head of Grand Canyon National Park did not create a hostile work environment for her employees.",
        "That's the conclusion of a months-long investigation by the Interior Department's inspector general.",
        "Nate Hegyi of member station KUER in Salt Lake City has more.",
        "The original complaint came from a senior official at Grand Canyon National Park.",
        "It said that park Superintendent Chris Lehnertz created a hostile work environment there.",
        "She was accused of bullying male leaders at one of the country's most popular national parks.",
        "The complaint came after Lehnertz proposed suspending that senior official for a day because he missed a meeting and didn't file reports.",
        "The inspector general found the suspension reasonable.",
        "And the investigation has cleared Lehnertz of wrongdoing, saying there was no evidence bullying happened and the claims were unfounded.",
        "Lehnertz's former colleague at Grand Canyon, Martha Hahn, ran the science division there.",
        "She was not only surprised by the allegations...",
        "I was angered.",
        "Angered because Lehnertz was brought in to stop harassment at Grand Canyon after stories of abuse there made national headlines a few years ago.",
        "And there's no way she could be culpable in something like that.",
        "Multiple former and current park employees interviewed for this story agreed.",
        "They say Lehnertz is doing a great job cleaning house and stopping the cycles of harassment and discrimination at the park.",
        "But they do say she's a tough manager.",
        "John Dillon heard some supervisors complain firsthand.",
        "He represents river rafting companies in the area.",
        "He doesn't work for Grand Canyon, but he works with employees there.",
        "They're going to be slow to tell you or not tell you that as bluntly, but I think that that's the concern - is I have, you know, another 10 years, and I don't want to say something wrong or do something wrong or end up in the crosshairs of somebody who's on an - you know, a mission to clean house.",
        "It's unclear whether this atmosphere spurred the senior official to file his hostile work environment complaint against Lehnertz.",
        "Still, when the investigation was launched in October, the National Park Service quickly and controversially removed Lehnertz from her job running Grand Canyon.",
        "The agency says it reassigned her to protect the integrity of the investigation.",
        "Jon Jarvis was the National Park Service director under the Obama administration.",
        "He hired Chris Lehnertz to run Grand Canyon and address sexual harassment there.",
        "He says removing a park superintendent like this is rare, and he thinks the agency overreacted.",
        "I would've thought this seems a little odd to me that a subordinate was claiming harassment by Chris Lehnertz, and I would've wanted to better understand the situation before I took that kind of action to move her out of the job.",
        "What it illustrates is Shakespeare's old saying, you know: `Strive mightily, but sup together afterwards.",
        "In other words, fight like dogs and cats to get what you believe is right, but when it's all over, you go out for lunch together.",
        "You simply do not accomplish anything by creating enemies out of people who oppose you."

        "We felt that it was important that it not simply be a kind of beauty pageant where all the writers write about their own state, and it'd be a kind of a celebration of each state that way.",
        "So we sent some writers to places they'd never been before, because I think a great writer, you know, with fresh eyes and a deadline can tell us things about a place that even natives can't.",
        "So, for example, the wonderful Mexican-American writer Dagoberto Gilb who lives in Texas, we sent him to Iowa where, of course, there are many Mexican migrant workers working in the cornfields.",

        "Those people are Mexican people.",
        "They are of the culture where hand-ground masa was first patted into tortillas.",
        "And because of that, it is said that the physical body of any Mexicano is at least half corn.",

        "This is Matt again.",
        "I think, of course, corn is a huge subject these days.",
        "But when do we ever hear enough about the young Mexicans who are working in those cornfields, and how their work goes, and what they think of their new lives in America?",
        "That goes throughout the book.",
        "There are a lot of immigrant stories.",
        "This is a book with tales about Bosnians in Missouri, Chinese in Georgia, Bangladeshis in Rhode Island, Koreans in Indiana.",
        "Ghanaians in Michigan.",
        "And as Matt points about Dagoberto, he's a Mexican-American writer, but he's just an incredible observer, and he's able to talk to people.",
        "One of the things that I just love about this book, and my editor and I sat around reading statistics out of the back of the book.",
        "I'm looking at them now.",
        "You've got rollercoasters per capita along with the violent crime rate, breast feeding rate...",
        "We had a lot of fun making that appendix.",
        "One of the things that came out of it is that, you know, again a fundamental point of the book is that states vary, and they vary a lot.",
        "We may all think that places are becoming more and more the same, and that's true if you stay on the interstates and you only go to big box superstores, and so on.",
        "But what was remarkable about those statistics is you can put them in order, and it's amazing to see quite the disparity from high to low.",
        "And the portraits that are drawn by those statistics are astounding to me.",
        "We tried to give a variety of states the number one slot, so we really were looking for different tables that would do that.",
        "New Hampshire, you know, rollercoasters.",
        "Crazily enough, Wisconsin, number one, you might think dairy or something like that, but it's alcohol consumption.",
        "My own state of Minnesota, I'm proud to say, is number one in voter participation rate."
