        "Well, this was one of the other things I was exploring with the book, actually, is the idea of nostalgia, that there's always a time before your time when things were better because, you know, I can be prone to that myself, so I wanted to explore what it was like.",
        "And I don't doubt that a thousand years ago, there were men in England saying, oh, it was better when our fathers came; it was better when their fathers came.",

        "You know, it's very challenging, and people want answers right away, and the best datasets that we have obviously come out with a lag.",
        "Part of that is due to the enormous size and complexity of the health system and the law.",
