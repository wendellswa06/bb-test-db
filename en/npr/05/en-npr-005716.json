        "He says that's always the case in the individual market.",
        "It's transient.",
        "Someone loses a job, with job-based coverage, gets covered on the non-group market for a period of time, gets a new job that now has job-based coverage again, and leaves.",
        "In the case of the Affordable Care Act, that was multiplied, because lots of people signed up well before they had to pay their premiums, in October and November and December.",
        "So the reasons for nonpayment, some of part of that is simply that by the time they were needed to pay, life had changed and they no longer needed that coverage.",
        "Because they had gotten a job with insurance, or they found out they qualified for Medicaid."

        "That's because of that same churning that affects premium payments.",
        "People move in and out of insurance all the time.",
        "And what the new marketplaces do is provide a place where people go rather than becoming uninsured during those times.",
