        "Yeah, it was interested in seeing whether or not there was a benefit of treatment in patients with what we refer to as low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer.",
        "There's definitely some prostate cancers that are more aggressive and do warrant up-front treatment.",
        "There are other cancers, however, that maybe much more slow growing, and I wanted to see whether or not there would be a benefit to treating that group of patients.",
        "So if I've just been diagnosed with prostate cancer, let's say.",
        "What do I do?",
        "It's important to speak to a group of physicians, obviously, your family practitioner, your internist, a urologist and a radiation oncologist.",
        "These patients - these physicians can help you discuss what the possible treatment options are, what your risks of developing signs and symptoms from the cancer are, and whether or not treatment is the reasonable option for you based on the context of your other medical problems.",
        "So what would say, Dr. Wong, are the potential far-reaching implications of this study?",
        "I think it's important for patients to realize that there might be benefit to treatment.",
        "Obviously, this study is an observational study and comes with many, many limitations, and therefore it needs to be interpreted within those limitations.",
        "I think patients should speak to their physicians about both the risks and benefits of treatment, the benefits being possibly prolonged survival but balanced against the risks of potential side effects from therapy.",
        "Now you've already acknowledged that the study's design has some built-in limitations, and skeptics have also pointed that out.",
        "Are you concerned at all that this study's results will confuse rather than clear up the picture that prostate victims face in terms of deciding what course to take?",
        "I think that this treatment of prostrate cancer's already a very complicated one, and this study is one piece of a very complicated puzzle.",
        "I hope that it motivates patients to at least discuss the possibility of treatment with their physicians.",
        "And even if they decide not to pursue active treatment, that it encourages them to still pursue aggressive follow-up care.",
        "It is important for patients to know that observation doesn't mean do nothing.",
        "It means to continue to follow-up carefully with their doctors.",
        "Final thing is this, Dr. Wong: There is a racial component to prostate cancer as a disease.",
        "Does your study in any way address that issue?",
        "And for African-Americans who are at the highest risk of getting prostrate cancer, does your finding hold true for them in the same way that it would for others?",
        "Yeah.",
        "We did look at the subset of African-American men and still found that there was benefit to treatment."

        "The problem is you can't take shortcuts in research.",
        "And unfortunately, trying to draw conclusions that she did out of what's called an observational study, which is what this was, is problematic.",
        "My principle issues are this.",
        "In her study, she reported that elderly men who were treated for prostate cancer had longer survivals than elderly men who were just observed for their prostate cancer.",
        "My contention is that in fact the benefit and survival that those men who were treated derived was not because they were treated from their prostate cancer but because they were inherently healthier to begin with.",
        "So it was a selection issue.",
        "That's my primary contention.",
        "The second is that even though the men who were treated were less likely to die from prostate cancer, the difference was fairly small.",
        "So among the men who were treated, 6.8 percent of them died over the next 12 years.",
        "But really the difference in survival between 6.8 percent of men dying versus 8 percent of men dying is not dramatic enough that we should put the accelerator to the floor and start treating many, many elderly men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer.",
        "To follow up on that point then, does this report muddy the water for newly diagnosed patients who already face a wide ranged of complicated choices?",
        "Well, I think that this report doesn't muddy the water as much as it is provocative.",
        "It means that we really ought to be attentive to individual patient preferences when men are diagnosed with prostrate cancer.",
        "That's true for any man diagnosed with prostate cancer, but particularly for elderly men with prostate cancer.",
        "The issue that's really key is what's important in prostate cancer treatment is not only survival but also quality of life.",
        "What are the things that you've said is that you have to be careful not to over-treat when it comes to prostate cancer and that the treatment can be worse than the cancer itself.",
        "I'd suppose you could call that a quality of life issue.",

        "An example of over-treatment would be taking a 78-year-old man who has significant other medical problems and saying, hey, this study show that you're more likely to live longer if we treat your prostate cancer so let's sign you up for radiation or surgery.",
        "That individual is really unlikely to benefit from treatment for his prostate cancer, but is very likely to end up with quality of life problems after the treatment.",
        "Why has watchful waiting, Doctor, been so prevalent as a diagnosis?",
        "Watchful waiting is prevalent as a treatment option because more men die with prostate cancer than of prostate cancer.",
        "So watchful waiting is a very important potential treatment that all men with prostate cancer ought to consider, but particularly elderly men, that is people over the age of 65 or 70.",

        "So, no, African-American men do not receive the same kind of treatment as other.",
