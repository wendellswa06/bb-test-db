        "And it's not just things we humans notice; there's also patterns in the ultraviolet spectrum, petal temperatures and textures and shapes - and they all add up to the flower's particular brand.",
        "And we found that by producing these combinations of sensory stimuli, the plant basically makes its flowers easier for the bee to learn and remember.",
        "That means the bee can forage more efficiently and flowers are more likely to be pollinated.",

        "They chose to land on sweet flowers just about as often as bitter flowers.",
        "But when the sweet flowers carried a small charge, the bees learned pretty quickly to choose the charged flowers.",
        "They get to about 80 percent successful.",
        "The bees had recognized the electric field and had learned to use it to find sweet flowers.",

        "And there's more to it.",
        "So, in the seconds just before the bee lands there is electrical activity in the plant.",
        "The plant's electric field is changed by the proximity of that positively charged bee.",
        "And once the bee leaves, the field stays changed for 100 seconds or so.",
        "Sutton says this probably helps the next bee that buzzes by.",
        "She won't stop to investigate a flower that's already been visited."
