        "This thing, it's had a life.",
        "You know, it was born somewhere, and it's traveled the world, and hauled millions of pounds of who-knows-what, and it ends up as a little restaurant in a street corner in Portland, Oregon.",

        "HyBrid co-founder Robert Humble says there are some container-specific issues - they've got industrial paints and coatings to deal with, and they're just steel boxes, with no real frame.",
        "But essentially, it's a building material.",
        "The mechanical equipment, the plumbing, the electrical, is really quite traditional.",
        "But it is that wrapping in a container that allows the house to be so portable, so flexible, and overtly sustainable on the outside.",
        "Like many in the cargotecture movement, HyBrid tries to emphasize that overt sustainability.",
        "They leave on the original stickers, longshoreman's marks, and all of the other little dents and dings that, Humble says, tell people the story of where the containers have been.",
        "They can imagine the container on a ship, they've seen it on a truck, and they kind of take an emotional journey with that container - and finally it's at rest, and they can live in it.",

        "Once they get to meet someone, they personalize that group.",
        "They think more positively about them, and they often change their views towards gay marriage or other issues."

        "And that's not the only reason people have changed their minds on gay marriage, but it's the biggest one.",
        "Well, to be honest I don't know if it is the biggest, but it is an important one, and I don't think we'd be where we are right now if we didn't have so many gay men and lesbians and bisexuals and everybody else out of the closet who are making themselves known to the people that they've always known, to their family, their friends, their co-workers.",
        "And that has been an important part of it.",
        "And we've had other conversations on this subject on this program, and have learned that people, of course, don't necessarily come out to their co-workers at the same time they come out to their family, or vice versa.",
        "This is a process.",
        "And nevertheless, it is also something that's uneven in different parts of the country and among different groups in the country.",

        "Yes, opinion is shifting among every single group, it seems, but obviously starting from a lower mark among some of them.",
        "Exactly.",
        "In my research I found that in 1988, approval for gay marriage was localized to certain groups: people who live in urban areas, who were secular, highly educated and lived in the Northeast.",
        "The most recent data I've been able to look at is in 2010, because I'm using different data sets.",
        "By 2010, disapproval has become localized, where now it's just found among Southerners, Evangelical Protestants, Republicans and African-Americans - predominately."
