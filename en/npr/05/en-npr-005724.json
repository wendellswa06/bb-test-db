        "The 18- to 29-year-old age group is overwhelmingly approving of gay marriage.",
        "However, again, in the research that I conducted, we found that the trend over time, from 1988 to 2010, was due mostly to people changing their minds on the subject, that two-thirds of the overall societal level of change was because individuals had changed their mind - either because they'd gotten to know people, or they're influenced by media, or they'd just gotten to know more about the topic.",
        "But most of the change in this attitude is because individuals have changed their mind.",
        "And not simply because that older, supposedly less tolerant individuals, have been replaced by younger, supposedly, more tolerant individuals.",
        "We read that changing your mind is difficult to do and more difficult to accomplish.",

        "This is a topic that I wouldn't have predicted before I went into this that the majority change would have been due to changing their minds.",
        "I would have thought, along with a lot of other people, that it would have due to generational changes.",
        "And while that does have an impact, it's that more and more it's because people are getting to know others, or they're just getting to know more about it, and they are changing their minds on the issue.",
        "And we see this with all the prominent politicians that have come out recently on this topic.",
        "We see this every day that people are saying, well, gee, once I got to know so-and-so, or once I had a gay son or a lesbian daughter or once I just thought more about it I changed my views.",
        "And thought more about it.",
        "Some people say wait a minute, if I see this as an issue of individual rights, of civil rights, suddenly it looks different.",
        "It does, and that's part of the success of the gay rights movement is that the gay rights movement has been able to frame this issue in terms of a civil right, and when people start thinking about it that way, when they don't think about it on a moral issue, but they think about it on an equality issue, a civil rights issue, they tend to agree with this topic.",
        "And where do you see this going?",
        "You know, it's hard to predict, but it seems that if the current trends continue that we'll have just greater support overall.",
        "We're now, like you mentioned, previously were about 48 percent according to the Pew poll.",
        "That'll probably continue to increase.",
        "There are some gay rights issues that regularly pull in the high 80 to 90 percent, such as employment discrimination protection.",
        "Those kind of issues or, you know, serving in the military tend to get even wider support.",
        "This issue may approach that level of support at some point.",
        "I doubt that we'll ever get to 100 percent, we rarely get to 100 percent on any type of attitude.",
