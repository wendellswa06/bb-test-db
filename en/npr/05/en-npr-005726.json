        "Sure, absolutely.",
        "And so that's something that also weighs heavily with me.",
        "You know, the pressure that I felt, you know, since a young man, to be on the side of the morality aspect of the argument.",
        "However, if you're looking at simply from the perspective of a civil rights issue, which you mentioned earlier in the show, there was gentleman that came out a few years ago, in flip side, I believe he works for the Cato Institute or something like that.",
        "And he is the one that helped pushed, at least here in California, the concept of a civil rights issue.",
        "And he changed lives and actually open to promote the Marriage Act (unintelligible).",
        "Now...",
        "The Cato Institute is the think tank of the Libertarian Party.",

        "So at that point, you know, with all these things mounted in my mind, I had to come to my own conclusion on this.",
        "And what I came to is that, what is it that the government hopes to accomplish with the issue of marriage license?",
        "This is so that we can see, you know, who are legally bound to each other in terms of if there's a divorce proceeding, if there's a death, those types of things.",

        "And we'll end with this email from Miriam, a straight and strong supporter of gay marriage.",
        "She writes: I'm 68.",
        "My change in attitude took place in the 1970s when I was part of a women's group that included several sisters struggling with their sexual preferences.",
        "By the time these women realize they were lesbians, we had all become deeply involved in knowing and supporting one another.",
        "After one of these women, afraid of who she was in family and societal reaction, attempted to commit suicide.",

        "Hey, how are you?",
        "For people who aren't on Instagram, I guess you're putting up pictures and you can see that five people liked it or 500 people liked it.",
        "What's happening to that feature now?",
        "Exactly.",
        "So in the same way that on Facebook, you can see how many people like your grandma's post about someone's birthday, it's like that on Instagram as well.",
        "But that social reward that we all get for making Instagram posts that get a bunch of likes, it's become a popularity contest, Instagram says, and they want less of that.",
        "So in May, Instagram began to experiment with removing the ability to see how many likes or views other folks' posts receive - just in Canada at first, and not all Canadian users, just some.",
        "And this week, Instagram rolled that out to Australia and Brazil and Ireland, Italy, Japan and New Zealand.",
        "So now, some folks in those countries won't be able to see the like or view counts on other people's posts, but they can still see the tallies on their own posts.",
        "Wait a minute, I can still have that addictive feature of looking to see if anybody likes my thing, but I don't have to feel bad that somebody else got 5,000 likes on theirs?",
        "Yeah.",
        "So at this developers' conference in April, Adam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, he said he wants users to spend a little more time, quote, \"\"connecting with the people they care about, not wrapped up in popularity contests with strangers.\"\" And that kind of statement may be Instagram responding to a recent trend, especially with younger users.",
        "They want a social media experience that feels a bit more private and personal, not so public and performative.",
        "So they basically are moving towards a more walled-off social media just for folks that they actually like or at least know.",
        "And of course, this is also a moment, Steve, full of negative headlines about all of the social media apps, how they affect our emotional health, fears about what kind of data they collect on us.",
        "And so for Instagram, this like test allows the company to possibly get a few days of positive headlines.",
        "And it may make it seem like this big tech company really cares about us.",
        "There certainly are big issues on the table, as you've just suggested.",
        "And there are studies suggesting that people can be more or less depressed, based on how they use social media, for example.",
        "But is this tweak - and I guess it sounds more like a tweak than a huge change - really going to change the experience and make it more healthy?",
        "Well, I was thinking about it.",
        "I use Instagram a lot - all the time.",
        "And I said to myself, even if I don't see the like count on Instagram for other people, I will still see all those pretty people on the beach with abs and pretty friends and cute dogs, living a life that looks better than mine.",
        "The photos and the videos of a picture-perfect life are still out there.",
        "So that intense comparison, it can still be there even without me seeing a like count.",
        "And I talked with Karen North, she's a professor of digital social media at USC's Annenberg School.",
        "And she told me sometimes that like function on Instagram is not a bad thing.",
        "They may be trading one problem for another.",
        "People say, if I get X number of likes, I'll donate, you know, a service dog to a vet or plant a tree or do some other cause.",
        "We cannot join together anymore to promote those causes or even have that sense that we've come together with other people.",
