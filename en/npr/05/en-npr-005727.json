        "It is tricky, says Democratic consultant Chris Keohan, to run as an independent-minded Republican in the very blue state of Massachusetts.",

        "He's got a great bio.",
        "He helps with all the demographics that Republicans historically have done poorly in.",
        "You would think that Gabriel Gomez would be exactly what Republicans would try to make their poster boy nationally.",
        "And to be honest, it really looks more like they've abandoned him.",
        "Even Scott Brown, still popular in Massachusetts, has been quiet, making his first rally with Gomez tonight.",
        "A little bit too little, too late, I think.",
        "UMass, Boston political science professor Maurice Cunningham says, at this point, probably nothing could bump Gomez into another political shocker.",
        "I always like to use a quote from Donald Rumsfeld about the unknown unknowns, and, sure, of course, but we've had two, the Boston Marathon and the scandals in the Obama administration, but neither one has really affected the race.",
        "While Scott Brown built his win on the compelling case that he would be the critical 41st vote against Obamacare, Gomez's core issue of change is more amorphous.",
        "Since primary night, he's been mocking Markey for his 37 years in office.",
        "Eight-track players were big, the first \"\"Rocky\"\" movie had just debuted and that was when Ed Markey first got elected to Congress.",
        "But Markey has been pitching his tenure as an asset to voters who have just lost two veteran senators and has been hitting hard on core Democratic issues like abortion and gun control.",

        "And is that because the timing is such that, you know, waiting it out has different meaning in farming than it does in other jobs, for example, right.",
        "I mean, like, waiting out, you have to plan so far ahead and - that you can't just - it's not a 90 day problem.",
        "Is that what I'm hearing from you?",
        "Exactly.",
        "And for the people that are listening, most Americans pay their bills every 30 days.",

        "Where I am, if I was in any kind of leadership in his administration in the Agriculture Department and you saw this coming down the pike, then immediately, the Agriculture Department should have opened more trade avenues for American farmers.",
        "So you closed 90% of the biggest purchaser for American soybeans, which was China, and you don't open up other channels for alternative markets.",

        "John Wesley Boyd, thanks so much for talking to us once again.",
        "Thank you.",
        "So we'd like you to know we did reach out to the Department of Agriculture for comment on Mr. Boyd's statements about the status of the bailout funds he's applied for, but we have not yet received a response by the time we went on the air."

        "Well, it - you know, it appears the criminal and civil investigation began back in 2017.",
        "And you know, what they discovered according to court papers - and RDC has pretty much admitted to this - is that clear warning signs from the pharmacies that RDC distributes to - clear warning signs that they were just sort of excessively pushing out opioids were ignored by RDC or, even when highlighted internally by compliance officers, were not brought to the attention of DEA as required.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "What kind of signals are we talking about?",
        "There's a number of them that the federal prosecutors mentioned, things like excessive purchases with cash in some pharmacies, purchases from well out of the region of the pharmacies.",
        "And these are opioid purchases we're talking about - excessively high percentages of sales of fentanyl patches and opioid oxycodone painkillers from some pharmacies and some of the larger pharmacies that RDC dealt with.",

        "Two RDC executives face charges.",
        "What are they accused of?",
        "Basically sort of being players in this whole, you know, alleged kind of ignorance or willing ignorance, I should say, of RDC's role in the opioid epidemic, the things we talked about - you know, just sort of closing your eyes to pharmacies that were obviously pushing painkilling prescription meds onto the streets in big numbers.",
        "And the allegations are that the former CEO, Larry Doud, and former compliance officer were key in allowing this to happen internally and just ignored all the signs.",
        "One has pleaded guilty and is cooperating.",
        "And Doud is facing the criminal charges.",

        "So the New York attorney general last month filed lawsuits against a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers and RDC as well, claiming that this sort of breeds almost an incestuous relationship where when your very members or the people who are your entity itself are the ones that are selling the pharmaceuticals, you have less of a willingness to basically do the right thing.",
        "Is this a sign of things to come?",
