        "Wen released a long letter in which she says she was on her way out over what she called philosophical differences with the organization.",
        "And then she said, in one point of the letter, that she'd come to work on a broad range of health care issues, but that, quote, \"\"the new board leadership has determined that the priority of Planned Parenthood moving forward is to double down on abortion rights advocacy.",

        "A lot of key leaders and other staff left Planned Parenthood soon after she came in.",
        "Another factor, I've been told, is that Wen came from a public health background, and she was, as we've said, a doctor.",
