        "But, again, she wasn't seen as leaning in heavily enough to that issue.",
        "I'm told that a lot of people come to Planned Parenthood because they're proud to work on abortion rights and other issues, and so, again, that wasn't a fit.",
        "What it means now - I think it says a lot that they've let their president go at this key time, with so many challenges, potentially a Supreme Court challenge shaping up in the next couple of years, heading into an election year.",
        "You know, clearly, there wasn't a fit there, as we've said.",

        "Well, the impetus was the Moscow Election Commission barring about a dozen opposition candidates from the ballot in the September elections for the city council.",
