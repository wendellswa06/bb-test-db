        "Rob Santana went to this facility in 1999 when he was 13.",
        "His parents sent him there.",
        "He had been referred - his mother had been given the name of the place from a special education committee in Upstate New York.",
        "And he was a pretty troubled kid - always pretty aggressive and had been troubled since he was a baby actually when he was born, addicted to drugs, went into foster care and was adopted.",
        "His mother sent him there in the hopes that it would improve his behavior.",
        "So what exactly has happened there?",
        "I know that there have been children who have died in the center's care.",
        "Can you tell me about that?",
        "Over the years, that center has been around since the '70s.",
        "It's been around for 36 years.",
        "And six children who were in the care of the center have died, though none of those have been linked explicitly to the center's use of aversives or of shock.",
        "You yourself got shocked.",
        "Describe what it felt like.",
        "Sure.",
        "The shocks are two seconds long.",
        "I had a shock device, sort of, an electrode strapped on to my arm and in my other hand, I had a remote control.",
        "The kids wear backpacks with the shock devices and wires run down their pants and up their shirts.",
        "And then they have these electrodes locked on or attached to their arms, their legs, their torso.",
        "I pressed the button and the staff had told me that it's no more painful than a bee sting.",
        "And I have to say, two seconds never felt so long.",
        "To me, it felt less like a bee sting than being stung by a horde of wasps.",
        "Greg, how did you come to this work?",
        "Well, I am (unintelligible) teacher certified in Massachusetts.",
        "And I wanted to try something different so I wanted to enter into the, you know, special ed and so I enrolled there as a teacher.",
        "I actually started off as a teacher's assistant and remained as a teacher's assistant.",
        "That's how I started.",
        "What exactly constitutes a reason to be shocked?",
        "And how involved were you in these treatments in addition to the other aspects of educating the kids?",
        "I was working with mostly with the students with autism and I was - gave many electric shocks to students during my time there.",
        "The types of things, which I saw a student shocked there for are types of things such as tearing a - corner of a paper cup while they're sitting on the sofa.",
        "There's no differentiation between tearing a paper cup or tearing posters off the wall.",
        "A tear is a tear.",
        "Students, you know, blowing bubbles with their saliva or pulling arms or shirt sleeves, a lot of things that's aggression but still categorized things under aggression or other strange behaviors that aren't so severe and treat them like they are severe.",
        "Now, Jennifer, as I understand it, a good number of the high-functioning children there are black and Latino.",
        "There are students who are very difficult to teach, who are very antisocial and other ones that are higher functioning.",
        "So why do you think that is in terms of the racial demographics?"

        "You know, many of the kids who are considered so-called high functioning are actually from New York.",
        "And when I was there, I would ask them, you know, where are you from exactly in New York and they would name neighborhoods often in New York City that were among the poorest in the city, you know, places like south Bronx or northern Harlem.",
        "And I don't have a statistics on the racial breakdown or the class backgrounds of the students, but it did seem to me that they were so disproportionately poor.",
        "And I don't know if that had so much to do with this treatment facility or if it's more something that reflects on the sort of special education system in New York City that's sending a lot of kids to this place.",
        "There is certainly - there's a lot of people who will say electric shock that's barbaric, but we reached out to the Judge Rotenberg Center.",
        "They sent us a response posted to the Mother Jones blog by Matthew Israel, director of the center.",
        "And he wrote - this is quite a bit of a copy but very important to get their perspective in here.",
        "Other so-called effective treatments for severe behavior disorders that JRC has seen in the histories of newly admitted students include lobotomy, removal of teeth for severe biters, constant seclusion, constant medical restraint, and many others that experts refer to as, quote, \"\"more humane and effective,\"\" end quote, alternatives to JRC's aversive procedures.",
        "The lack of an effective alternative and the sheer cruelty of drugging a child into a near coma is why parents turn to a non-public special needs school such as the center that is especially equipped to manage and educate the student and has a proven track record of saving students from the ravages of constant heavy sedation.",
        "What do you say in response to that?",
        "You know, the history of the Judge Rotenberg Center -originally, the students who were there - nearly all of them exhibited very, very extreme types of self-abusive, self-injurious behavior, things like banging their heads or tearing their hair out or chewing on their fingers, and that was the original justification for an approach that involved pain or for eventually for the use of these two-second electric shocks.",

        "Hello.",
        "Hello.",
        "These are the first, I guess you would say, real democratic elections since the country got its independence from Belgium in 1960.",
        "Given Congo's troubled history, these elections are quite significant.",
        "They're not only significant because they mark the end of a very brutal Seven Year War, but they also mark the beginning of finally the democratic Rule.",
        "The end of the 1990s, the dictator of many years, Mobutu, began a democratic process that was interrupted by the war.",
        "So many people see this as the end of the democratic process and the beginning, finally, of democracy in the Congo.",
        "Well, let's look back just for a moment to Mobutu and his 32-year reign, to see, in a way, how hard this is to pull off in terms of transforming the country.",
        "For one thing, I believe the term kleptocracy was coined to describe his style of governing.",
        "That's right.",
        "Mobutu perfected the predatory rule.",
        "He made the state into a predator.",
        "It was a state that provided - towards especially the latter years of his rule - provided almost no social services for the population.",
        "So there was no education or healthcare.",
        "And even the army was not an army that protected people, but it was there to extort money and to harass the people.",
        "So even now, today, most people see the state, as a predator.",
        "There was a World Bank survey that was done, I think a couple of years ago, and they asked the people here what would they do if the state were a person, what would they do to this person.",
        "And many people's answer was we would kill him, or we would take him to justice.",
        "Well, does that bode terribly badly then, though, for this election, or the aftermath of this election?",
        "Well, it bodes badly for the elections in the sense that the institutions that are supposed to organize the elections suffer from this weakness that has been inculcated in them through this 32-year history of predatory rule.",
        "So I think that, yes, it's a flawed process.",
        "Many people are very upset.",
        "But many other people, I think, are glad to get that over with and to try to start a new page."

        "Well, yes.",
        "I mean, if you look at the war - in 1996 the war began here, and it lasted until 2003.",
        "At the height of the war it involved nine African countries.",
        "And I think it destabilized many other countries in the region.",
        "It certainly destabilized Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi.",
        "And I think that many people see elections in the Congo as a step towards stability.",
        "Not only in the Congo, but seeing a stable Congo could also provide security to the rest of the African countries - and especially in the east of the Congo, where I'm speaking to you from, has been used as the rear base for many militia to attack neighboring countries.",
        "So the idea is, if we can create a stable Congo, and not only can we create an economic engine for a central Africa, cause it's a very, very - it's a country that's very rich in natural resources - but we can also prevent militia from using the Congo as a rear base to destabilize neighboring countries.",
