        "It is my job to tell you that there are defenseless civilians on the ground, who are not participants of the conflict, who currently face a triple threat of absolutely terrifying proportions.",
        "How worried are you about the safety of your staff in Syria right now?",
        "I'm very worried always about staff safety in the midst of war.",
        "We have 2,000 staff in Syria.",
        "These are local people, not Americans or Europeans who jet in to work there.",
        "They live in these towns and cities.",

        "There's an extraordinary commitment amongst them.",
        "There's an extraordinary sense of mission.",
        "And when you talk to them about it, they just say, well, look, this is my country, this is my community, this is my family, and I can't defend my community and my family by taking up arms, but I can tend to my family and my community by trying to administer health care, can provide protection for kids and for women.",
        "And so these are people who I worry about but who display an extraordinary bravery above all because they have no choice.",

        "As reporter John Otis tells us, the crisis has now reached the Colombian side of the border.",

        "And I want to get to some of your ideas for fixing the system writ large.",
        "But just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding in Mexico as this so-called caravan makes its way north, Mexican officials say we're talking 3,000 to 4,000 people, that they are a thousand miles from the U.S.",
        "border.",
        "So let me press you.",
        "Is it a national emergency, as the president says it is?",
        "Well, I don't know why he'd call it a national emergency.",
        "But again, what is a national emergency is the multi-year flood of individuals coming from Central America, is unaccompanied children and now it's family units incentivized by laws we have passed, by legal precedent and loopholes that, again, reward people coming into this country illegally because, once they get here, our legal system allows them to stay."

        "And yesterday, the bank managers who had been directing and designing this fight on Wolfowitz's behalf put up this extraordinary letter saying that at this point, their efforts are being undermined, their credibility is being undermined by the questions being raised about governance within the bank itself, and that's a clear reference to Paul Wolfowitz."

        "Because it is no secret that the Federalist Society has been interested in having younger judges serve who presumably would have longer careers and a bigger impact.",
        "So was his age a factor in making him an attractive candidate?",
        "Well, sure.",
