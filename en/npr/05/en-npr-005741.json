        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "What - where are we now?",
        "Give us a little thumbnail sketch of where are we in history or in medicine about knowing what memory is.",
        "Well, memory is an extremely difficult problem, and we're nowhere near having a complete understanding of it.",
        "On the other hand, in the last 50 years we have gone from having a very limited biological understanding to a respectable beginning.",
        "This is not simply the work of a single person.",
        "It's the work of a field, which has three components: very good cognitive psychology, good neural science and molecular biology.",
        "And these three disciplines have emerged in sort of a new science of memory.",

        "Did you ever reach a point where you thought, okay, there's no way we're going to reach consensus; although we're a bipartisan group, it's just too tough for us to reach a compromise on what we say.",
        "I never, never doubted it that we could reach the consensus that we reached because we all went into that room, having checked our partisanship, believing in each other, believing that we could, through working together, come to a consensus, and we did.",
        "Who were you in that room?",
        "Let me ask, were you someone who played a role of bringing people together who were of different like minds?",

        "That did not happen, and maybe it's because we are old, but that did not happened; nobody cursed anybody out.",
        "And I've seen that before, and there were no written dissent or threaten of written dissent.",
        "We had a common purpose and we accomplished it together.",
        "So given that you had 79 recommendations, which one really has your heart?",
        "Which one of the recommendations do you feel is the most important?",
        "Well, there are three primary recommendations and I think they are of equal importance.",
        "The first dealing with a responsible transition of American troops from combat troops to support troops.",
        "The second issue is the national reconciliation on the part of the Iraqi government to meet milestones and to do some things that they must do that they have already set for themselves.",
        "We are holding them accountable, as we should.",
        "And thirdly, the diplomatic offensive.",
        "Those three things go hand in hand, and we think that they're all important and of equal importance.",
        "You have been an adviser to so many presidents, but one of them is not President George W.",
        "Bush who, according to many people who spend a lot of time covering him, is a person who keeps a very tight council with very few people."

        "But it did happen, and so I think he understands his responsibility.",
        "He understands our responsibility, and he was very open yesterday to what we had to say.",
        "And he rightly said I want to read this and I want to come back to you.",
