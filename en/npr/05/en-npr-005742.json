        "That was NPR's Farai Chideya talking with Vernon Jordan, who once headed the National Urban League.",

        "Coming up, our Roundtable reacts to our talk with Vernon Jordan.",

        "Ten years ago, Portugal decriminalized drugs - all of them - from marijuana to cocaine.",
        "The decision followed troubling increases in drug addiction and violence.",
        "As much as one percent of the country's population was addicted to heroin, and addicts shot up in the streets of the slums of Lisbon.",
        "The decriminalization came paired with rehabilitation, and the Portuguese government declared the program a success.",
        "Others note that drug use there is actually up now, and that when the government removed the legal risk, drugs became more appealing.",
        "Journalist Keith O'Brien describes what happened in a piece titled \"\"Drug Experiment\"\" of The Boston Globe, and he joins us now from member station WWNO in New Orleans.",
        "Nice to have you with us today.",
        "Mr.",
        "KEITH O'BRIEN (Freelance Writer): Thank you, Neal.",
        "Good to be here.",
        "And you described Portugal's result as really a Rorschach Test -it depends who's looking.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: That's absolutely right.",
        "You know, people who are in favor of decriminalization and legalization of marijuana or other illicit drugs, look at what's happened in Portugal over the last decade and say, here's an example of how things can go right.",
        "And people who are against decriminalization and legalization look at the very same data and say the exact opposite.",
        "And tell us what happened, beginning with the impetus.",
        "It looked like a pretty bad situation 10 years ago.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Absolutely.",
        "So Portugal was late to the drug abuse problem.",
        "Even though they were a country located there on the seas and had great ports where drugs could have moved in and out, it wasn't until the late '90s or mid-'90s when things really became problematic there.",
        "You had drug-related deaths going up 56 percent within two years.",
        "You had the highest rate of drug-related AIDS in the entire European Union.",
        "And as you said, you had slums where people were literally injecting themselves openly in the streets.",
        "One in particular, was named Casal Ventoso, which is in Lisbon, just a few minutes from the parliamentary seat.",
        "And people literally came there to use drugs, lived there, living and dying in the streets.",
        "It was declared European - the European drug supermarket.",
        "So, given this situation, a lot of people said, time to crack down.",
        "Portugal took a different tack.",

        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, they convened an expert commission in the late '90s, and the decision they made was a bold one.",
        "They decided instead of trying to fight this with incarceration or Draconian drug laws, they opted to make all illicit - possession of all illicit drugs decriminalized.",
        "If you were under this new law, to be found in possession of drugs, you would not go to prison, but to a commission -it was called the Commission for Dissuasion of Drug Addiction.",
        "CDTs, they called them.",
        "These were very informal panels that would meet, say, around a boardroom table, very casual, not at all like a courtroom.",
        "Social workers would be there, counselors.",
        "They would meet with the person who had been picked up in possession of whatever drug it was and discuss the issue.",
        "These CDTs would then hand down various, sort of, not punishments, but treatments.",
        "Some people would, you know, be asked to enter counseling.",
        "Some people would be banned from, say, going to raves, if that's where they were doing their drugs; or banned from attending certain concerts or bars, if that's where they were doing drugs.",

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Even some politicians, at the time, were worried about it.",
        "One said, in particular, that he was worried that Portugal was going to become a junkie nirvana, a sort of drug tourist mecca.",
        "And he said, our motto may as well be we promise sun, beaches and any drug you like.",
        "Yet they had some good experiences.",

        "He wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post this week, asserting that the headline of the National Intelligence Estimate that is that Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons program is misleading.",
        "Because as, I think, anyone will tell you, looking at a nation's capability to achieve nuclear weapons status, the most important thing it has to do is master the very complex science and technology of uranium enrichment.",
        "And the NIE itself reconfirms what we've been saying for quite some time that Iran is continuing and indeed expanding its uranium enrichment activities.",
        "So the idea that some small sliver of activity was suspended in 2003 and that the NIE itself says they don't really know whether that suspension is continued leaves the impression, nonetheless, that the whole thing has been shut down and that there's no problem.",
        "And I think you can see the implications and the reaction both domestically in the U.S.",
        "and in many countries abroad.",
        "Your argument seems to stem from a distinction that the NIE makes between a weapons program and a civilian nuclear program.",
        "And that distinction seems to hang on how enriched the uranium is.",
        "Do you mean to say that uranium that is enriched for civilian purposes is just as bad as uranium enriched for weapons purposes or that they're not that far apart?",
        "The fact is the difference between a low-enriched uranium or reactor-grade uranium and high-enriched uranium or weapons-grade uranium is not that great.",
        "In fact, two-thirds of the work is consumed by getting to low-enriched uranium, so even if they're simply enriching to reactor grade levels, they're two-thirds of the way to what they need to have weapons-grade uranium."

        "The Europeans were offering them carrots; that's not diplomatic pressure; that was an effort to entice the Iranians out of giving up their program.",
        "And absolutely critical to what the Europeans were doing was to say none of the benefits they were promising would be forthcoming until Iran stop its uranium enrichment program.",
        "So the notion that the European effort somehow led Iran to shut down its weapons - the weapons aspect - and I want to it call the weaponization aspect of its nuclear program - but continued uranium enrichment is a non sequitur.",
        "Ambassador Bolton, you say about this National Intelligence Estimate - I'll quote you here, \"\"rarely has an administration been so unprepared for such an event.\"\" Are you sure that the White House did not know about this?",
        "I think they knew about it only days before it was released publicly.",
        "And in fact, I think this is an example of the mismanagement of the intelligence function within the government.",
        "You know, it is - the principal purpose of the intelligence community to advise the president not to make public pronouncements.",
        "And the inside story of how these key judgments were released was contrary to the regular policy not to release these judgments under fear that aspects of it would leak out and would be damaging.",
        "I view that as kind of a threat to the White House and one where it's evidenced that the policy biases that I think underlie this assessment were exposed.",
        "What is the policy formulation here?",
        "The argument made at the - near the end of the key judgments is that Iran is susceptible to making cost-benefit analyses about its nuclear program and that the application of diplomatic efforts can get them to seize those activities; that's a raw policy judgment, and I think it's evident in the way the entire NIE was put together with that one headline right at the beginning that would sweep away people's attention to virtually all the rest of the judgments.",
        "And so what would be the motive of those writing this?",
        "To stop the Bush administration from continuing putting the pressure on Iran, and I think the consequence has been exactly as they predicted.",
        "Despite some rhetorical victories this past week, I think it's near impossible to believe the administration will get another sanctions resolution from the Security Council.",
        "Ambassador Bolton, do you - did you take exception yourself to the way that the NIE was used to support going into Iraq?",
        "Well, I didn't use the NIE to support going into Iraq.",
        "I felt that the regime itself was the threat, and I had written that consistently through the late 1990s, as indeed did the United States Congress."
