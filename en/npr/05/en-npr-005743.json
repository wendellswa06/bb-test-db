        "It's a functional change, a biochemical change within the cells, but if you produce a long-term memory, like if you remember our conversation tomorrow, it's because anatomical changes will have occurred in your brain, in the connections between nerve cells, and there's actually a growth of new synaptic connections with long-term memory, and we can trace this in detail.",
        "What starts the growth of new (unintelligible)...",
        "That's a very good question.",
        "What we found is that when you produce a short-term memory, it not only establishes a functional change, but it sends a signal back to the nucleus to turn on genes, and these genes turn on other genes that give rise to proteins that give rise to the growth of new synaptic connections.",
        "So you can actually follow the movement of molecules from the nucleus out to the synapse.",
        "It's a communication between the nucleus and the synapse."
