        "There are a lot of inhibitory constraints on memory.",
        "So if you activate them, you can prevent what normally would be a memory storage from occurring.",
        "There was some news out this week in some research papers about that actually light can influence neuron brain cells.",
        "I mean, there was different colors of light turning things on and off.",
        "Well, certainly light coming in through the retina can influence them dramatically because color is a very powerful motivator for people.",
        "In addition, there are now experimental techniques whereby you can shine light onto nerve cells and activate them selectively or shut them off.",
        "How could you make use of that if the nerve cells would be inside your brain?",
        "Well, you have to implant the light guide into the brain.",
        "Oh, you would?",
        "And this is not for people.",
        "This is experimental work in experimental animal.",
        "It's called channelrhodopsin, in which you have a light-sensitive ion channel that can either activate a nerve cell or shut it off.",
        "It's a very powerful technique for studying how neural circuits work in the brain.",
        "Now, where is the frontier in memory?",
        "...to change the Lueger ring, to build the scientific community in Austria, and to use that as a vehicle for bringing Jewish students in and energizing the Jewish community in Vienna."

        "The most obvious cases are Alzheimer's disease or age-related memory loss, which is a non-Alzheimer form of memory.",
        "What goes wrong under these circumstances, and how can we reverse those processes?",

        "So there are a variety of disturbances of memory storage that we would like to understand better so we can intervene more effectively for medical good.",

        "I remember too much what happened to me in Vienna.",
        "Do you remember too much what happened to you in Vienna?",
        "I don't consciously think it that way, but when I examine my life and I see how often I've come back to themes that started in Vienna - I'm doing a book now on art and science, and it's focused on the fact that unconscious psychological process, a Viennese discovery, were discovered independently by Freud, Schnitzler and three Austrian painters, Klimt, Kokoschka and Schiele.",
