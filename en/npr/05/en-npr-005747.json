        "And from a literary point of view, it is the most important, because as you probably know, Proust makes the point that when he dipped a madeleine into the tea, the odor that arose from that brought back the childhood experience of having the madeleine and tea.",
        "And the whole outpouring of his earlier memories came back to him as a result of that olfactory experience.",

        "Terrific question.",
        "Neurons have a big job, so most cells are relatively small and self-contained.",
        "The neuron has a part to it called the cell body, where it has the machinery for making energy.",
        "And that small part has to support a long extension that is absolutely gigantic compared to the size of the energy storage depot, and it's got to constantly maintain the nutrition for all of that.",
        "So you can imagine the slightest insult to the energy-producing machinery compromises a neuron much more than any other cell in the body."
