        "Democrats countered with a proposed resolution of their own, condemning MoveOn.org's ad, but also those ran in the past by conservative groups attacking the patriotism of Democrats, including 2004 presidential nominee John Kerry.",

        "An ad like that probably doesn't go over very well with the public, which is, on the one hand, anti-war, but still, on the other hand, pro-military and quite patriotic.",

        "Fifty-nine percent say it's not going well, more than half say the troops should be brought home.",

        "It's a huge victory for prosecutors.",
        "But, in the end, I guess it's not a big surprise, and that's because Causey faced 30 years in prison if he was convicted at trial.",
        "Sure, he could have walked away a free man if he'd prevailed in court.",
        "But while Causey himself is relatively unknown, at the defense table he'd be sitting next to two of the most infamous executives in America, and his fate would go hand-in-hand with theirs.",
        "With all the pretrial publicity in this case over the last four years, that's risky regardless of the quality of the prosecution's evidence.",

        "The chairman and CEO are not accused of being the masterminds of these schemes; that was Andy Fastow, the CFO.",

        "He can potentially guide the government and the jury, draw a road map of the alleged conspiracy, who was whispering what into whose ear.",

        "While people reporting drug use over the course of their lifetime has gone up, somewhat significantly in the last decade in Portugal, people reporting drug use over the last 12 months of their lives has actually gone up only slightly.",
