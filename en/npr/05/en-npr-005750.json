        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, there are certainly people who've likely gone there over the last 10 years, nine years and experimented.",
        "But as someone who's traveled to Portugal in the last 10 years, I didn't notice the difference when I was there, you know.",
        "I didn't see drug tourism, you know, happening in the streets.",
        "So in general, no. That fear was not borne out.",
        "And so the other side, you were just going to go to before I interrupted you.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, obviously, the other side of the argument are those people who are in favor of decriminalization or legalization.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: And these people say that the Portuguese experiment shows that decriminalizing drugs will reduce overcrowding in prisons, will reduce the burden on the criminal justice system, and will lead to no ill side effects.",
        "But, of course, there have been increases in drug use, drug experimentation there.",
        "And so, you know, at the end of the day, what the Portuguese data may show is that there's a little bit of fiction in the arguments of both of these entrenched physicians in this country.",
        "And some may say that the answer to drug abuse and drug policy questions in this country may lie somewhere in the middle.",
        "We're talking with Keith O'Brien, a freelancer reporter who wrote a piece called \"\"Drug Experiment\"\" in The Boston Globe.",

        "And, of course, Keith O'Brien, it's not just the United States and Portugal, which are in big debates over drug policy.",
        "There are any number of countries in Europe, which might see themselves as much more analogous to Portugal, smaller countries more - well, more homogeneous countries than certainly the United States.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: There are.",
        "And it's fair to say that people - other nations are certainly looking at the Portuguese data and trying to determine what it means for them.",
        "There have been a lot of countries that have pursued what are known as harm-reduction strategies in the last decade, focusing less on incarceration and more on treatment.",
        "You know, to be clear, neither the U.S.",
        "Office of National Drug Control Policy nor the Obama administration is interested in pursuing decriminalization or legalization policies.",
        "However, there is a shift that's subtly happening here in this country.",
        "You will not hear the term war on drugs, this famous term that we all know, spoken in the Obama administration.",
        "There has been a focus in Obama's drug-control strategy on treating addiction as a disease, on emphasizing early intervention.",
        "You know, the DEA, for the first time recently, sponsored a national Take-Back Day, where they took expired and unneeded pills, no questions asked.",
        "So there is a movement here in this country for harm-reduction strategies, for treating addiction more as a disease and less as a crime.",
        "Yet we saw the proposal in California that would not just -obviously, medical marijuana legal in California.",
        "And some people say, in many places in that state, it amounts to more or less legalization.",
        "But the idea to both legalize it and allow people to grow it in the state, to tax it, that was defeated.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: It was.",
        "And - but not by much.",
        "This proposal that you're talking about was just last year, that would have allowed California municipalities to allow farmers, say, to grow hemp, to go - to grow marijuana, sell it, to tax it, regulate it.",
        "That is legalization, or something very close to legalization.",
        "Decriminalization is what happened in Portugal.",
        "Decriminalization - if anything radical were likely to take place in states in this country, decriminalization is probably the first step that will be made, if anything is made.",
        "And that was what they did in Portugal.",
        "And there - a similar situation now exists in California.",
        "If you get arrested and you have marijuana in your possession, small amounts, you're likely to get something equivalent to a traffic ticket - not necessarily a rehabilitation program, though.",
        "And that was one of the key lessons that Portuguese authorities cite, that you must have two things working together.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: That's right.",
        "And, you know, the same thing has happened in Massachusetts in the last couple of years.",
        "And there are likely other states that are going to follow that model.",
        "And one critic of the Portuguese data - who believes that it maybe doesn't tell us very much at all about how things would go in this country - says that the way to determine how well decriminalization might work in this country is not to dive into the Portuguese numbers and try to extrapolate them for what they mean for us, but to study what's happening in California right now, to study what's happening in Massachusetts right now and follow those states for a few years, five years, 10 years.",
        "And from that, maybe we'll learn something.",
        "But...",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: As you pointed out, as opposed to Portugal, where treatment has become a major focus of their battle, it is not necessarily a part of what some states are doing right now.",
        "Andre's on the line, calling from San Rafael, California."

        "You've got recreational drug use, and you've got habitual drug use.",
        "And I think if you - you know, if there were some way to look at what those different numbers were, I think we might find that maybe habitual's down and experimental is up, or something.",

        "Keith O'Brien?",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Well, they don't measure it exactly with those terms.",

        "Mr. O'BRIEN: Lifetime report...",
        "Have you ever used drugs any time ever in your life.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'BRIEN: Correct.",
        "And this is self-reporting.",
        "So you know, we're trusting people to tell us the truth.",
        "In Portugal - lifetime - people reporting drug use over any course of their lifetime has gone up somewhat significantly over the last decade, from about 7.8 percent to 12 percent.",
        "Now, the people who are reporting drug use in the last year in Portugal has gone up at a smaller - much smaller, 3.4 percent to 3.7 percent.",
        "And, you know, the authors of this paper in the British Journal of Criminology say that the numbers over the last year is much more significant because that tells us what's happening right now.",
        "And at least between 2001 and 2007 - which is the latest data we have in Portugal - people reporting drug use over the last 12 months only went up just slightly."

        "I think it's going to take a lot of hard work to get a lot of the housing back, but there's housing available all throughout the parts of high and dry New Orleans that we've been talking about, very integrated parts of New Orleans, from Uptown through Central City through Broadmoor through Black Pearl, all the way downtown to the French Quarter.",
        "So people can come back, but there's a lot of work to be done, and unfortunately, you know, we had a lot of promises from the federal government and from everybody else about how they were doing to rebuild New Orleans, but we really have to rebuild it ourselves.",
