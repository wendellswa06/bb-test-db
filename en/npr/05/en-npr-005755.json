        "The river has been flooding for close to a year now, pumping an endless flow of fresh water into the salty Gulf of Mexico.",

        "Healthy oysters have brownish-gray shells that are tightly shut.",
        "Most of these are black, and the shells are open and loose - nothing inside but mud and rotten meat.",
        "And if I had to look at this pile right here, you could probably say 90% is, you know, pretty much dead.",
        "Ninety percent.",
        "Massive oyster die-offs are happening all across the Gulf Coast.",
        "The killer - too much fresh Mississippi River water.",
        "Quick background - oysters thrive in the brackish waters of the coast where the salty water from the Gulf meets the fresh water from the Mississippi River.",
        "Oysters can handle some fluctuations, but they also can't move.",
        "So if it gets too salty or too fresh for too long, they can die.",
        "You know, other species have a tail, have legs.",
        "They can somewhat get out of the way.",
        "So this poor oyster's got to sit there.",

        "Right.",
        "But we always knew there were real problems with it.",
        "I mean, if you're going to have a slope going up to 480 feet in the air, it's got to be a very long, gentle slope, and it would have to be a mile long, and that's just too big.",
        "You can't have anything that big.",

        "It's a mile long, like a road in a parking garage, you know, sort of cork screwing up, and it's been in there for 4,500 years.",
        "So, did they use the ramp as part of the pyramid itself?",
        "Yeah, the pyramid is its own ramp, and you've got this thing going up inside it, and the blocks for the very top are brought up inside the pyramid."

        "There's evidence for it.",
        "But to answer to question, Ira, there are other ways to get at this thing.",
        "We could use infrared photography, you could use ground penetrating radar, and we're really looking for another confirmation of the theory pretty soon."
