        "He's an architect who, eight years ago, gave up a successful practice as an architect, sold his apartment, moved in to a one-room flat with his laptop, and for eight hours a day, did nothing but computer generate graphics of the inside of the Great Pyramid .",
        "And you know, he emerged with a theory, you know, the internal ramp theory.",
        "And he's just an outsider; he had no idea of Egyptology.",
        "He had never been to the pyramid.",
        "You know, when he came to my house and he showed me these beautiful diagrams, you know, I said to him, well, what'd you think when you first saw the pyramid?",
        "He said, oh, I've never been there, you know, and we were all shocked.",
        "You didn't even show him the door at that point.",
        "We were all - no, we didn't...",
        "Yeah.",
        "Because this guy was clearly the real deal.",
        "He knew the pyramid better than anyone I had ever met, you know, but the other kicker is he didn't want to see the pyramid.",
        "He said - I said, don't you want to see it?",
        "No, I know what it looks like, and that was it; he didn't want to go.",
        "I finally dragged him, but he was kicking and screaming.",
        "And so he got to see the pyramid and he said, that's my baby there, and I know what's inside?",
        "Yeah, but you know what's disappointing?",
        "Yeah?",
        "He didn't go crazy when he saw it."
