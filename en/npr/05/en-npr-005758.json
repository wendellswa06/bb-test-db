        "Yeah, I've seen his video.",
        "It's pretty impressive.",
        "I mean, the guy really has a simple way of moving heavy stones, and I think it shows that it's possible.",
        "How does he do it?",
        "He - with balance, very careful balance.",
        "You can do it with a simple rock, and he's got a balance board, and you put it on it and just moves a little bit of the time.",
        "It's really quite interesting.",
        "You pick up one block, you stick a round rock under deck to the fulcrum and you can, just by putting a tenth of the weight at the other end, walk it across, and you stick another fulcrum onto the other end or under the other side of the middle and you just walk it further.",
        "The nice thing is, is that it only takes about twice the width of the blocks to move it which makes turning 90 degrees turns on a spiral ramp, a lot easier to do.",
        "Yeah, no. I think his real contribution is that you can do move fairly heavy objects with very simple techniques.",
        "And very few people.",
        "Yeah.",

        "And I'm just curious, knowing that thermal infrared doesn't penetrate objects, how do you see inside the pyramid?",
        "Well, it's through the temperature differential.",
        "What it is, is the - any void inside the pyramid it's going to have a different temperature from the actual stones.",
        "So, it's based on the temperature differential.",
        "And it's been used in archeology before on buildings, say, in Jerusalem, just to see what's behind walls that you can't move, stone walls.",
