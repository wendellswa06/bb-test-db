        "And the challenge, I think, to get ahead of this problem, which is when the oil runs out, so will the food right now, is that we need to resolarize the food system.",
        "I mean, as you well understand, but a lot of people forget, you know, every calorie we eat is the product of photosynthesis.",
        "Food is the original solar technology.",
        "So, you know, we can grow food without lots of fossil fuel.",
        "Nature grows a huge amounts of bio mass without any fossil fuel.",
        "So the challenge is, how do you ring the fossil fuel out of the food system at every step, and put it back on a diet of contemporary sunlight?",
        "That's really - that's the goal.",
        "And by doing that, you will solve many problems at once.",
        "You will reduce our reliance on foreign sources of oil and natural gas.",
        "You will reduce agriculture's contribution to climate change.",
        "And in fact, make agriculture a net remover of carbon from the atmosphere.",
        "That is possible, if you farm properly.",
        "And you will reduce health-care costs dramatically.",
        "I mean, it's about $250 billion a year...",

        "So, it's kind of nice if you can pull this off.",
        "You can solve a great many problems at once, and you can actually improve the environment and improve public-health at the same time.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, we're going to take a break, Michael, and when we get back, I want to get in to some of the details of what we need to do.",

        "What the government needs to do?",
        "How we get back to a more solar-oriented agriculture system?",
        "And I want to hear from farmers.",

        "Would you like to change the way you're farming, became less chemical intensive, more solar intensive, and we'll talk about it with Michael Pollan how he says we might be able to do that.",

        "And he goes on in a large way to talk about how we need to revamp the country's way of eating and making food, and one of the things you talk about in particular, is - you mentioned earlier, about resolarizing the American farm, and you've talk about the fields in Iowa in the winter.",
        "And how we need to change what's going on in those fields year round."

        "Yeah.",
        "Well, one of the things the candidates may have noticed when they passed through Iowa last winter, is that the fields, for the most part, are black.",
        "From, you know, late October until May, when the corn and soy is not on the fields, there's nothing else in the fields.",
        "And what that tells you, is that we're wasting a huge amount of solar energy.",
        "You know, those fields are vast solar collectors that we're not using.",
        "And why is that?",
        "Well, because our source of fertility on the modern, industrial farm is now fossil fuel, rather than crops.",
        "Rather than using cover crops to fix nitrogen as legumes can do.",
        "And we have moved to this fossil-fuel source of fertility.",
        "We also used to have animals on those farms, and they were providing a source of fertility.",
        "Hmm.",
        "You know, that wonderful close cycle where the animals replenish the nutrients that the crops take out of the land, and the crops feed the animals.",
        "So, you're saying that farmers need to bring animal there - not very separate, aren't they.",
        "You have either cattle ranchers or you have farmers.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now you're saying we should integrate them back again into the family farm?",
        "We need to, yeah.",
        "We need to depopulate these feedlots, and put the animals back on the farms where their waste can be a precious asset, rather than a pollution problem, as it is on the modern American feedlot.",
        "I mean, the big problem, if you want to, you know, simplify it, is monoculture.",
        "I mean, that is really the original sin of American agriculture.",
        "Whether you're talking about a single crop of corn, or a single animal in a feed lot.",
        "As soon as you do too much of the same species, nature has a serious problem with that.",
        "You will, you know, diminish the fertility of the soil, because you have the same crop taking the same nutrients out."

        "It just means lots of food for whatever the pest of that crop is.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So, the key really to resolarizing farms is to diversify them.",
        "To move from monoculture to polyculture.",
        "The model really is, you know, how does nature replenish fertility?",
        "Nature doesn't use fertilizer - fossil-fuel fertilizer.",
        "Well, nature does it in two ways.",
        "One is the decomposition, the returning of wastes to, you know, the forest floor, which happens with the decomposition of leaves, essentially compost.",
        "And we need to do that too.",
        "I think we need mandatory composting in our cities, so that - and then we need to give that compost back to farmers.",
        "And return all those nutrients we're now wasting.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "We waste about 15 percent of the food we eat.",
        "And the other way nature does it is with certain kinds of crops, legumes, in particular, that can actually fix nitrogen.",
        "They can take nitrogen from the air, and because of the soil bacteria they have on their roots, put it into a form that is usable by plants, and then in turn by us.",
        "So, basically, it is diversity and recycling that nature uses to essentially use the sun to replenished fertility.",

        "Now the interesting thing about this rotation is, first, in those first five years, they're producing what is generally thought to be the best beef in the world, completely grass fed, a very sustainable solar way to raise beef.",
        "Then when they start planting the grain, they discovered they don't need any fertilizer at all.",

        "And the reason being that the five years of cattle on grass has built up enough nitrogen in the soil, to essentially feed the crop plants.",
        "They also find that - and by the way, I'm talking about farms that are more than 10,000 acres in size, OK.",
        "These are not little hippy, organic farms, these are big, industrial farms.",
        "They also find that they don't need herbicides, and the reason for that is, that the weeds that would afflict a pasture cannot survive tilling, and the kinds of weeds that afflict raw crops can't survive in a pasture.",
        "So, you break that cycle, and that eliminates the need, or dramatically reduces the need for herbicides.",
        "So we can - you know, we have to look at a rotation like that as being a technology as brilliant as a genetically-modified crop or organophosphate pesticide.",
        "Those are the kind of technologies we need to develop, really clever processes, that will harness the energy of the sun to grow our food.",
