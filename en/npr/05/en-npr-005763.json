        "And my question was kind of related to that crop rotation, was just when we're talking ethanol, wouldn't there be some - ethanol be able to be produced from like the fallow fields if we plant the correct crops, that they're in rotation with corn, instead of getting the ethanol from the corn, but whatever the rotated crop would need to be?",
        "I don't know what that one would be, but...",
        "Let say soy beans for biodiesel, something like that?",
        "Yeah, something like that.",
        "Yeah, there's no reason you couldn't include some sort of biofuel crop.",
        "Although so far, you know, the ecology and economics of biofuels are actually not very attractive.",
        "Corn-based ethanol is a real loser from any measure.",
        "You know, whether you are trying to help with greenhouse gases, or reduce our use of fossil fuels, because it takes so much fossil fuel to make the ethanol.",
        "And so, unless you're growing that corn in a sustainable way, you're really doing nothing for the environment by turning it into ethanol, except making people hungry in the developing world.",
        "But we will learn, I'm sure, how to make ethanol from other products, including crop wastes."

        "I find it pretty difficult, especially in restaurants to find pasture-fed beef.",
        "My question is this.",
        "Does Mr. Pollan believe that we're going to be able to completely replace our current beef supply with pasture-fed beef?",
        "And if not, how much are we going to have to reduce our beef intake to eat only pasture-fed beef?",
        "OK.",
        "Good question.",
        "That was Mara Liasson, NPR's national political correspondent.",
        "Well, that's a great question.",
        "You know, I think if we were willing to return cattle to the grasslands of the Upper Midwest in the High Plains, we could grow quite a bit of pasture-fed beef.",
        "The High Plains supported about, what, 60 million bison very comfortably, very sustainably.",
        "That's less than the number of cattle we now have, I think we have about a hundred million.",
        "So there would some reduction, but you know, a reduction in meat consumption is actually something we need to consider from an environmental, as well as a health point of view.",
        "We - you know, we're - the average American is eating nine ounces of meat a day, that's half a pound per day and that is simply unsustainable.",
        "Because whether those cattle are grass-fed or grain-fed, they are releasing huge amounts of greenhouse gases.",
        "About 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributable to livestock.",
        "So, I don't know that we can replace meat pound for pound, but we can - I'm glad you brought up grass-fed beef, because it actually is one of the more sustainable food chains, since really the sun feeds the grass, and the grass feeds the ruminants, and the ruminants feed us, and the ruminants replenish the fertility of the soil.",
        "And it is a very elegant food chain, yet it does still contribute to greenhouse gases..."

        "I think you will find grass-fed beef much easier to find very soon.",
        "Because as the high price of oil drives up grain prices, feedlot meat is going to get very expensive, and grass-fed meat is going to look relatively more attractive.",

        "It will, and it will happen gradually, but it will take some radical leadership on the part of the Department of Agriculture.",
        "We will have to reconsider the farm bill.",
        "You know, this piece of legislation that passes every five years, that basically writes the rules of the whole economic game, that is the food system.",
        "Right now, the incentives in the farm bill, the crops we choose to subsidize and how we subsidize them, drives farmers to plant monocultures of corn, and soy, and wheat, and rice.",
        "And discourages the plant - it discourages diversity, because you only get rewarded for planting those very few commodity crops.",
        "And in a million other ways, it encourages a monoculture agriculture.",
        "So to begin with, we need an agriculture secretary, and we need agriculture committees in both houses.",
        "Because right now, those committees are dominated by farm-block senators and representatives who are representing commodity farmers, and they are not representing eaters.",
        "Hmm.",
        "They are not representing the public-health interests of agriculture, and they're not representing the environmental interest of agriculture very well.",
