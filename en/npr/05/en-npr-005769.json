        "Well, I think no one - I mean, every individual can make their own choice.",
        "I mean, we certainly want people who are just doing science if that's what they want to do and if that's what they're good at.",
        "But I do think there is an overall sense that it is important.",
        "I would say it's important for scientists to speak out when they can and when they can be listened to.",
        "I think that it's not just when science is being trashed.",
        "I mean, I think the more general point that I'm trying to make in my book is that the kind of thinking that scientists do has even broader applicability just in ways of thinking about problems and asking questions.",
        "They can just be very useful.",
        "And, of course, there's all sorts of other considerations that come in, political and otherwise.",
        "And it will only be listened to a little bit in many cases.",
        "But I do think it's important that some people are out there just saying what they know.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You actually get into a bit of Wall Street there, talking about how that might benefit from doing things more with critical thinking in mind, science (unintelligible).",
        "Well, I'm sure some people think I overstepped, but really, when I was writing this book, you know, this crisis was unfolding.",
        "And, you know, there was this kind of irony of people worrying about black holes that they'd all like to see.",
        "When, you know, we're pretty well-established.",
        "I mean, it's perfectly fine to ask the question.",
        "But we've pretty well-established there's no problem there.",
        "But, meanwhile, all these other risks that are surrounding us, and I really was trying to think how could it be that these are being missed when, you know, there seemed to be some pretty obvious indicators.",
        "And so one of the things that science teaches you is how to ask questions and how to categorize by different scales.",
        "So one of the issues that comes up is just when you're asked about risks, for example, it matters the scale of who you're asking about risks for and on what timescale are you asking about it.",
        "1-800-989-8255 is our number.",
        "What is the state of theoretical physics today?",
        "Give us a brief thumbnails sketch of what we're - what are the big questions that we're still wondering about?",
        "Well, there are sort of two different categories of questions.",
        "There are questions that we think we have a real chance of answering immediately, you know, in the next few years with experiments.",
        "And there's some sort of deeper questions that might take a long time to unfold, that are more purely theoretical.",
        "The state of particle physics is that we have something called the standard model of particle physics, which really does describe matter's most basic elements and interactions."

        "It works really well.",
        "It's been very well tested.",
        "And - but there are some clues that it is not the whole story.",
        "One is that we actually don't know this question I mentioned earlier, how particles acquire their mass.",
        "And although that sounds odd, you think of mass as an intrinsic property.",
        "It turns out that if you - particles just had mass from the get-go, you would make nonsensical predictions, like interactions, probabilities greater than one.",
        "So we know there has to be something around that accounts for it.",
        "And that's probably this Higgs mechanism.",
        "So one of the questions is what is it that provides this Higgs?",
        "What is it that accounts for particles' mass?",
        "But there's a second question that comes with that, which is why do particles have the mass they do?",
        "It seems like if you actually just made a prediction for what they should be based on the theoretical principles we know using quantum mechanics and special relativity, you would think they should be enormously bigger than they are, 16 orders of magnitude bigger.",
        "Although, of course, it's a really important theoretical question.",
        "So it's only by - if you don't have anything else in the theory, it's only by a - what we call fine-tuning that you can account for masses.",
        "Now, we don't believe that.",
        "But then when you actually go down that rabbit hole and try to solve that problem, you find really amazing things that could be the - account for it.",
        "It could be an extension of symmetries of space, time, extensions of, say, rotational symmetry, which says physics looks the same in every direction.",
        "It could even be an extension of space itself, another dimension.",
        "So it seems that the answers to that could really lead to deep insights on both into particle physics and maybe even to the nature of space.",
        "And those are the questions you don't think we'll answer in the near future?",
        "Those are the questions that I do think - I mean that's what's so exciting about the Large Hadron Collider.",
        "I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear.",
        "What's so exciting is that it really does have the energy which we think those questions should be answered.",
        "Another thing we should be able to answer, hopefully, is the nature of dark matter.",
        "That depends on if it interacts in certain ways.",
        "But there are indications that dark matter could even be produced at the Large Hadron Collider or in dark matter experiments today.",
        "The kinds of questions that are more theoretical have to do with distances that are even smaller.",
        "The LHC, the Large Hadron Collider, is studying 10 to the minus 19th meters.",
        "It's questions that have to do with many orders of magnitude smaller than that, 10 to the minus 33 centimeters, where you start getting into questions about quantum gravity and the nature of gravity itself.",
        "And how do you answer critics who say, why should we spend our money building these things?",
        "They're even talking about building the next collider, right, that might go out - go back to Batavia, a linear collider - and could cost billions and billions of dollars?",
        "Well, you know, these are difficult questions to answer, and it is difficult to evaluate.",
        "But if you do look at places where we have invested in science, we've always come out ahead.",
        "We've come out ahead, not only through reasons that we could predict.",
        "And it could be even very theoretical research.",
        "I mean, what's so amazing to me is even quantum mechanics, which seems like the most theoretical type of idea we've had, actually, entered into semiconductor industry, which is responsible for the electronics that we have now, I mean, when people found electricity."

        "One, how does it did you know, can you describe how they actually measured the neutrinos?",
        "What was the detection method that they used?",
        "And second question, about five or 10 years ago, I was reading an article on the quantization of space.",
        "And I - has anything been done with that?",
        "Just the actual - that space itself has a quantized size to it?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "OK.",
        "Thanks for calling.",
        "So let me talk about the first - the second question first.",
        "The quantization of space - so that's sort of the end of the story of scale.",
        "I mean, I talk a lot about scale in physics in my book, in part because I think it's very important to categorize sort of where we are and to get some intuition for these different things, but also to realize how we've advanced in scale.",
        "So this limit - there's probably a limit to distance scale, and I say probably because we actually don't know, even in principle, how we would study distances smaller than what's called the Planck's length, this 10 to minus 35 meters that I mentioned a moment ago.",
        "And part of the reason is if you had enough energy to probe it, you would actually be making a black hole.",
        "And then you add more energy, it gets bigger.",
        "So it really does seem that space might break down, the notion of space that we have, might break down.",
        "We don't know that for sure, but there's theoretical arguments that say that.",
        "But again, this is well beyond what we can do for (unintelligible)...",
        "What do you mean the notion of space might break down?",
        "It's hard for us to wrap our mind around that idea.",
        "That's right.",
        "And it's happening at a scale so distant that it really doesn't matter to us.",
        "I mean, 10 to the minus 35 meters, it's not a scale that we encounter, and it's a scale that we're readily averaging over all the time, which is really how physics proceeds.",
        "So you don't need to know the most fundamental.",
        "You don't need to know if space is ultimately quantized.",
        "It works pretty fine to say the smooth space and general relativity applies to it.",
        "But it could be that at very distant scales, scales that are not affecting our daily lives, scales that aren't even affecting experiments at the highest energies we could do, there could be more radical and remarkable things that happen."
