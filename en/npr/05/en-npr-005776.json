        "Well, first of all, Neal, I just thank you for paying attention to this issue.",
        "We've been working with survivors of homicide families and siblings for about 15 years now.",
        "And, a lot of what we need to know to be helpful has still not been learned.",
        "And just this kind of attention to the issue, I think helps the professional community as well as the families themselves deal with this.",
        "And also, Ms. Mohammed's courage just for what she's doing, I just want to appreciate.",
        "Thank you.",
        "What you've heard is really very similar and very typical.",
        "It's actually a syndrome that we're learning more about similar to post traumatic stress disorder.",
        "PTSD is the diagnosis that is given after a war when veterans come home.",
        "But it's been expanded to include those traumatic situations that people survive.",
        "And in the case of families who've experienced the murder of a loved one, particularly for the younger children, we're finding the similarities.",
        "Now, it's not always post-traumatic in the sense that veterans have come home for -from war and the war is over for them in a physical sense.",
        "But many of these families, and particularly the siblings, are living with ongoing episodes of violence.",
        "Right.",
        "So while it's similar, it's not quite the same.",
        "So we've got a lot to learn about the symptoms - the sleeplessness, the nightmares, the anxiety attacks, the constant replay of the episodes, the hyper fear, all of those are symptoms that we're seeing.",
        "And what you've heard from Ms. Mohammed and the callers is very similar to what we've seen with other families.",
        "Regrettably, murder is not the only crime that's in the human experience.",
        "Is there something, though, different about murder as compared to armed robbery or even rape?",
        "I think there are some differences.",
        "Again, we have a lot more that we need to learn.",
        "And in some ways, families that have experienced a suicide have a lot to teach in this situation.",
        "But what's pretty clear about the situation with murder is the finality of it and the need for a family not just to heal but to figure out how to move forward without this person.",
        "And that's often very difficult particularly during the holidays or during family vacations and rituals.",
        "It leaves a hole and a gap.",
        "And people are expected to go back to work within a week.",
        "Siblings are expected to go back to school.",
        "And the human service and health community has not adequately trained on how to provide the right services.",
        "We really need the voices of these victims, really, the surviving family members to help us even know what to do and what's helpful.",
        "It just occurred to me, as you were speaking, Valencia Mohammed, that Christmas or Thanksgiving has got a whole - have a whole different meaning to you."

        "And I had one student, Cornelius Davis(ph), I don't know if I can do this without crying, so bear with me.",
        "Cornelius was 17.",

        "If you checked the history of most clubbers on the block, they used to be smart.",
        "Now, they burned out, turned out, strung out, ready to rob on the block.",
        "And he went home for Christmas and was sitting in a car outside his house and someone opened the door and shot him in the head with a shotgun.",
        "I'm not trying to justify what happened to that young man, but a lot of times, what we've seen is that, parents place their kids in situations like the job corps.",
        "They put them outside the community in programs because they fear for their lives.",
        "And all of a sudden, whatever kind of wrongdoing or whatever they may have been involved in, they may have even seen something but didn't tell anybody, just that, well, they make themselves vulnerable when they come back into the communities.",

        "We know that taking care of children at the infancy age really matters when it comes to school performance.",

        "Even areas that are very restrictive with regard to handguns, you know, someone can go to another area and purchase a gun and bring it in.",
