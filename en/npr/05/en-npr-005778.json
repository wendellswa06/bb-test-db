        "As to other controversies, he said he opposes citing foreign law in Supreme Court decisions, and he refused to call the Constitution a `living document,' a term that John Roberts was unafraid to embrace in his confirmation hearing.",
        "Instead, Alito more closely identified himself with those like Justice Antonin Scalia, who disdain the phrase and say they base their constitutional interpretation on the text of the Constitution and their view of the intent of the Founding Fathers.",
        "The most contentious exchanges of the day, though, involved questions of ethics.",
        "In 1990, when Alito was confirmed for his current appeals court seat, he promised in writing that he would not participate in any cases involving Vanguard mutual funds in which he had significant holdings.",
        "It now appears he did not put Vanguard on his recusal list and in 2002, he failed to disqualify himself from a Vanguard case until one of the litigants complained.",
        "Alito then recused himself, saying that while he was not required to do so by the Code of Judicial Conduct, he wanted to meet a higher standard.",
        "At yesterday's hearing he said he did not think his 1990 pledge to the Senate bound him forever.",
        "The 1990 questionnaire asked what matters he would initially recuse himself from.",
        "That prompted Senator Edward Kennedy to ask this question.",
        "When you made the promise under oath to the committee that you were going to recuse yourself, and you understand that now to be--in your own interpretation--just to be the initial time, how long did you think that that pledge and promise lasted?",
        "Is 10 years--how about three years?",
        "Is that...",
        "(Through Translator) That's where he abused me.",
        "That was the first time with threats - he showed me a pistol and did what he wanted with me and he threatened me.",
        "He told me not to tell my husband.",
        "Tamayo says the supervisor also a Mexican immigrant raped her three times between 1993 and 1994.",
        "(Through Translation) He said, that I belonged to him and he was never going to leave me in peace.",
        "He said, that since he met me, he'd always been attracted to me.",
        "Without telling her husband why, Tamayo tried to make sure she didn't come and go from the fields alone.",
        "The harassment continued five years later when the man punched her in the middle of a tomato field, Olivia Tamayo found the strength to report him to the company, she says her bosses wouldn't believe her.",
        "(Through Translation) They ignored me, I don't think they did the right thing.",
        "Everything stayed the same, he stayed working in the company and the only thing I felt was bad, because I felt like as woman there was no help of any kind for me.",
        "But a local farm worker women's organization referred Tamayo to the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC.",
        "And last year, a jury awarded her more than $1 million in damages and lost wages.",
        "The ruling affirmed that farmers like all employers are obligated by the civil rights act to protect their employees from sexual harassment.",
        "The message was that a farm worker could stand up against a major company and assert her civil rights."

        "That's EEOC Attorney Bill Tamayo - no relation to Olivia Tamayo.",
        "And that's radical that farm worker immigrant women particular who don't speak English or very limited English speaking would be able to take on a big company and win.",
        "The EEOC has taken on a dozen such cases since Bill Tamayo became Regional Attorney for the San Francisco District Office.",
        "One of his goals was to figure out how to address problems in agriculture, one of California's largest employers.",
        "When Attorney Tamayo met with farm worker groups, they said the biggest problem wasn't racial - but gender discrimination.",
        "Because there were stories and reports of women being raped in the fields being constantly sexually harassed by supervisors or having to have sex with supervisors in order to get a job or to keep a job or to get a promotion.",
        "And I felt like if anything that was going to be a top priority, because these were some of the most vulnerable workers in the country.",
        "And this was some of the most egregious discrimination that could occur.",
        "The EEOC challenge is to inform workers they're protected from sexual harassment even if they don't have immigration papers.",
        "No one knows how many women are harassed in the fields each year, and it's tough to get them to come forward if they aren't legal residents.",
        "The EEOC distributes Spanish language comic books that explain what sexual harassment means and how to make a complaint.",
        "Meanwhile, California's largest farm organization says its members stand firmly, against any kind of harassment or discrimination.",
        "Ann Schmidt-Fogarty is a spokeswoman for the California Farm Bureau.",

        "There's probably a lot of room for improvements and we're working on it.",
        "We believe those who perform sexual harassment should be penalized to the fullest extent.",
        "In Olivia Tamayo's case, Harris Farms has revised it's sexual harassment policy, and established a confidential complaint hotline, but the company still claims Olivia Tamayo was in a consensual relationship with her supervisor.",
        "It has appealed the settlement, so seven years after filing her complaint with the EEOC Tamayo is still waiting for the money she was awarded by the jury.",

        "And Google, of course, has a database of all the searches that have been carried out on its search engine.",
        "And based on that idea that if a lot of people are sick, a lot of people will be searching for these keywords.",
        "It created a basket and tracked the basket over five years and then it matched it against the CDC data on actual flu incidents and it found the correlation to be very, very strong and the advantage, of course.",
