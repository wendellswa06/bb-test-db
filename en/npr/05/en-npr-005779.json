        "In fact it's raining so hard that as we're about to cross this street, there's a little river running down in the gutter and we'd like not to walk in that.",
        "Alex says that as we walk each of us is funneling all this visual information into a part of the brain called the parietal cortex.",
        "You can tap your finger on it about halfway between the nape of your neck and the crown of your head.",
        "The job of the parietal cortex is to put all of that data about puddles and plant boxes into a mental map to help us navigate.",
        "And in fact you don't walk around the world thinking I'm building a map of where I am in the world.",
        "It's all completely automatic and it's automatic to a blind person as well.",
        "Which could be surprising, after all blind people can't see to absorb visual information, but they do have parietal cortexes, so they make their mental maps out of other cues, the sound of a car splashing by or the texture of pavement underneath a cane.",
        "But what about places that are too big to see, like the distance between your house and downtown or the shape of California.",
        "When sighted people want to make mental maps of things like those, they turn to the regular two-dimensional version.",

        "How would you give information directly to the public as a result of this tool?",
        "Well, yeah, one thing that might be interesting would be, we haven't done this yet but now we're all just kind of thinking about possibilities is if someone types in a search term for something that might connote an illness, we might have public health ad up on the top right corner and ad that says this is what you should do or maybe you should go to a doctor if you have these symptoms.",

        "Yeah.",
        "The search engines already do that very well.",
        "I mean, they correlate the ads that they show you with the terms that you type into the search engine so that's definitely a possibility.",
        "And as you look at this tool, as I understand it, Dr. Mostashari, the CDC already get a lot of this information and about the same time that Google does.",
        "They just report it a little bit.",
        "There's traditional food surveillance which relies on manual reporting.",
        "Over the past seven or eight years, there are literally of state and locals as well a federal program to get ads electronic information for real-time to these surveillance tapping in to things like pharmaceutical sales, emergency rooms and so forth.",

        "It's not the first time where public health officials have had access to quicker information than traditional surveillance using existing electrons out there.",
        "But I think what is new about this particular application is that it gives a consistent national view to CDC or to the public.",
