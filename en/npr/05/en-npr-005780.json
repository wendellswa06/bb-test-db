        "Google and Yahoo!",
        "and all these companies have this data, all sorts of data, they collect as we make our way through the web.",
        "Some of the most powerful data is the data in the search engines themselves because that is when we do a search, we're often telling the computer some of our most personal things.",
        "We search for baby names because we're about to have a baby.",
        "Or we search for a symptom because we suspect we have a disease.",
        "And the companies have been using these data internally for marketing purposes.",
        "Yahoo!",
        "is using it, for instance, to find out what people are interested in at a certain time and then program its website accordingly and the question is what will happen if more of these data gets released to the public?",
        "Let's get a caller on the line.",
        "This is Stephen and Stephen is with us from Goldsboro in North Carolina.",
        "Hi.",
        "Yes, I have a question for the gentleman representing Google.",
        "There's nobody representing Google.",
        "Miguel Helft works for the New York Times.",
        "But go ahead.",
        "OK.",
        "Anyway, regardless, my question is: this information, will it not encourage people to go online and look for terms regarding the flu stuff and how that's going to affect the statistics that Google is going to take?",
        "I mean, will it show false outbreaks because people are looking for the application rather than actual fly symptoms?",
        "It's an interesting question, Miguel Helft, because this is something that works sort of inadvertently.",
        "People do this on their own.",
        "It's this idea called collective intelligence.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And the Google people as well as the CDC which helped put this altogether where they cautioned us that past success is not is not a predictor of future success and they're going to be monitoring this tool over time.",
        "The example that the caller makes is that could be for instance a newspaper article saying that there's very little flu and that sends people to the web to search for flu and perhaps, it would skew the data.",
        "So I think they're going to be monitoring this and making sure that it still correlates going forward.",
        "This is Farzad.",
        "I do want to support the caller's question.",
        "We've seen when we monitor, for example, over the counter medication sales that there is poor absenteeism, things like the day before the big baseball game or when something goes on sale.",
        "There are many ways in which this nonspecific information can create false positives.",
        "And I think it raises the really important question of what we need to think about is how would we respond when we see an unusual trend?",
        "And I think that question, we should think about it both in terms of the public as well as for public health.",
        "That's interesting.",
        "You monitor for example if there's a spike in DayQuil sales, you worry about an outbreak of a lot of colds or flu?",
        "That's right.",
        "That's part of these nontraditional surveillance systems that I mentioned that also have provided an early warning once or two weeks before the traditional flu data."

        "That's right.",
        "It's interesting.",
        "And as you look at this Miguel Helft, it does have applications not only for marketing and other things but for other public health applications too.",
        "Yeah.",
        "The hope of Google and some of the other public health people I talked to is this might be useful to track other diseases.",
        "And Google, already makes - for about two years, it's had a product called Google Trends where anybody can go to their website and type in any keyword and see the relative popularity of those terms, how they ebb and flow.",
        "And a lot of people are already using that to make predictions, if you see a lot of queries going up for HDTV, you would suspect that people are shopping for those things.",
        "If you saw a lot of searching for HDTV discount, you suspect people are looking for bargains.",
        "And so I think this data is quite valuable and is being used more and more.",
        "Stephen, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "We're talking with Miguel Helft of the New York Times about the Google Flu Tracker.",
        "Also with us is Dr. Farzad Mostashari who's the assistant commissioner of New York City Health Department.",
        "You're listening to Talk of the Nation from NPR News.",
        "And Dr. Mostashari, let me ask you also, don't you have to be wary as a lot of us will use the web to search for flu symptoms but a whole lot of communities have much less access to the web than others do?",
        "I think that's certainly true although I think the algorithms that Google is using, adjusts for the overall volume of searches.",
        "We actually haven't been able to get kind of under the hood as it were, exactly how the algorithms and statistical methodology works.",
        "But at least in terms of what we've been able to see, it looks like it's done a nice job of adjusting for those kinds of things.",
        "And adjusting for places where there is not an awful lot of people who live there."

        "So it could be by state or by county or by large metropolis?",
        "That's right.",

        "If they're coming in within a day or two, you can prescribe them Tamiflu or one of the other antivirals which really is more akin to a marketing success in what I've seen that translates in a clinical success.",
        "But this is all day to day to day and I think most epidemiologists, people with a CDC, anyone, that data is something but information is really what data needs to be and if it's not really translatable information, what's the point or the purpose?",
        "Dr.",
        "Mostashari, what do you think?",
        "I completely agree.",
        "We do have to when we say we have to think about how the public can respond to these increases.",
        "We should all recognize despite some of the news releases, about the press coverage of this, people should get their flu shot well before flu is epidemic in their communities.",
        "Nevertheless, some people will always be lagers in this regard.",
        "And maybe one of these announcements might get them to take their flu shot.",
        "But also I'm told that one of the best defenses is simply to wash your hands frequently during the day so you don't necessarily pass it to yourself.",
        "Good prevention in most diseases is worth the pound of cure.",
        "But again, when it translates to the patient frequently is they feel so bad, they come in for an average, for an instance an average of emergency department bill for just a nursing care I'd say you'd get two medicines say you get a medicine for nausea and maybe four dollars or something for the aches and pains from which you're suffering and a bag of IV fluid.",
        "The average charge for that is $954 not withstanding if you have respiratory symptoms or older chest x-ray is which is about 195 as well as then the physician charge, if it's a level two or three, you're looking at least $180.",
        "So it really translates into, again, the information.",
        "How does that translate into saving health care?",
        "The patient, those with or without insurance offers $1,500.",
        "I need to look more into the site but it seems like a great idea.",
        "Just maybe it's a tool that we need to find the right bolt to help it screw down some things.",
