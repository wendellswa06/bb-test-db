        "In my two years of close experience watching it and being a major part of it, her instincts were usually very, very good politically and common sense and in terms of how the public would respond.",
        "And she was the one who would sort of push the issue, and she'd push him.",
        "I mean, the greatest example of this is when he did not want to acknowledge that Iran-Contra, and the outcome of that included selling arms for hostages.",
        "And he simply would not acknowledge it.",
        "And we pressed and pressed, and a lot of people went in to tell him, Mr. President, you've got to do this.",
        "But at the end of the day, I think it was Nancy who finally pushed him over the edge.",
        "And he made the statement that it was trading arms for hostages, even though that's not what he thought he was doing.",
        "And so very often when, you know, when we had a problem like that with the president we would delicately bring Nancy into the orbit of the problem, and she could be very, very helpful in getting it resolved.",
        "This was at a time when there were not as many women in public life as they are now in elected positions and in appointed positions.",
        "And I just wondered, did she ever have any difficulty having her voice heard because she wasn't in an elected position?",
        "Oh, no she wasn't, but she had better than an elected position.",
        "She had Ronald Reagan's ear, and she was the closest person in the world to him.",
        "Well, you know, to that end, a lot of people have invoked the legacy of Ronald Reagan during this year.",
        "And I don't know when you last spoke with Mrs. Reagan, but I wondered if you know how she felt about that, people - particularly this year - invoking his legacy as often as they have been doing.",
        "She, I think, was flattered by that but at the same time disturbed, I'm quite sure, that some people invoking his legacy really are not applying his legacy in their political campaigning or in some of the things they're doing.",
        "It's going to be interesting over the next several days or several weeks as people reflect on Mrs. Reagan and then once again on President Reagan.",
        "If the way in which he went about the presidency, and the way in which he entered politics, and the civility that he showed - and perhaps this would calm the temperature a bit in our public debate now and in the (laughter) the lead up to the two conventions and then the general election.",
        "I hope it would because we have got to get out of the problem we're in now with screaming and the shouting and childhood taunts.",
        "I was going to ask you about that.",
        "I would be remiss if I did not ask you how you feel about the state of the campaign right now, particularly the tone of it.",
        "You were critical of - in 2008 of the tone of it, particularly in the Republican Party.",
        "I have to ask you, how do you feel about it now?",
        "Dr.",
        "Brossard, tell us a bit about your piece in Science.",

        "Absolutely.",
        "I started blogging nine years ago, and when I started, I didn't have tenure.",
        "And so I was very nervous about, you know, putting my opinions out there and having people read them who might evaluate me.",
        "And so I sort of developed a voice that allowed me to be able to be critical of scientific research studies without being polarizing.",
        "Well, I still feel the same way.",
        "In 2008, I spoke out against calling the president a Muslim as if that was a curse.",
        "And then in 2012, once again, I was very disturbed about some of the intolerance I was seeing in the party, so I made a statement saying there's a level of intolerance in some parts of the Republican Party.",
        "And there was, and I think there still is.",
        "We have to become more respectful of each other.",
        "We have to listen to each other even if we disagree mightily.",
        "And to stand there and to do junior high school tricks on one another, I think, is belittling the country and belittling the office which they are striving to gain.",
        "And I hope they start, you know, realizing that as amusing as this might be - and it's reality television, but even Jerry Springer thinks it's gone too far.",
        "And when Jerry Springer thinks you've gone too far, my friends, you have gone too far.",
        "How do you want the country to remember Nancy Reagan?"
