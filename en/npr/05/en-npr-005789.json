        "So what happened when you find a story well-written, by a good science writer, that actually is followed by comments that may not be always extremely polite?",
        "So if you did a study, randomly assigned people to different conditions, some people saw polite comments, other people saw the same comments but just, you know, with rude language such as idiot, et cetera.",
        "And what we found is that people that were exposed to those rude comments tend to become polarized about the issue that was covering the story, which was nanotechnology.",
        "So basically just being exposed to rude comments, even if the content of the comments themselves was the same, made people react differently to the content of the story.",
        "So the question is therefore: What do we do, right, to encourage better understanding?",
        "Do you have a suggestion?",
        "Well, I mean, and that's interesting because, you know, like my colleagues who are practicing bloggers and extremely fruitful doing so, that are on the show tonight, today, can actually tell us what they think.",
        "But what we can, you know, basically say is that right now, you know, it's much more the choice of the blogger himself or herself to decide how to manage those comments and not a lot of empirical evidence as far as how to do so.",
        "What our study suggests is that indeed even, you know, slightly rude comments because, I mean, we were not even investigating trolling, we were not investigating, you know, how disruptive behavior, which obviously from a common-sense perspective, you know, everybody would take out from their comments thread, right.",
        "We're just showing, like, people that were getting a little bit, you know, into the discussion so much as to say you idiot, I think you should think like me, or obviously there are, you know, benefits related to this, you know, this technology.",
        "So even the tamer comments were influencing how people thought about the research?",
        "Exactly.",
        "So it was - that's the thing, and that's where, you know, when you asked me what we should do, I think obviously we should get rid of anything that's not polite, That doesn't follow civil discourse.",
        "And then we should, you know, discuss what does it mean to have a civil discussion online.",
        "What are the social norms that we strive to establish in this environment, such as we have social norm, let's say, in - at the dinner table, right, where some things are, you know, implicitly not allowed because it's not something that should be, you know, considered polite.",
        "What is a polite, you know, behavior in the online environment?",
