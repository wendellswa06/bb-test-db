        "And sometimes, the things that I'm most committed to, that I'm really the world expert on, I'm not on the top page of Google rankings.",
        "So it is really becoming a matter of algorithms how we discover things.",
        "Yeah, exactly, John, you couldn't have put it better, and this is something we saw most particularly in the context of nanotechnology when we try - when we tracked the keywords that people were using to search, you know, the issue of nanotechnology.",
        "And then, you know, we looked at the content they were likely to find, and we saw that, indeed, they were most likely to find content really to help even if at the start - as a starting point, they were looking for something (unintelligible) the nanotechnology and the environment.",

        "We try to do that because it's constantly revisited to be able to reflect, you know, basically try to guess what people are looking for.",
        "And I think in the context of science, this is really problematic, because let's say going back to that issue of nanotechnology, it could be any issue, even evolution if you wanted to be more broader and, you know, something that more social implications right now.",
        "But basically, we may give like a false perception of all the dimensions that can be attached to an issue by, you know, like letting those searchers govern to some extent the public discourse.",
