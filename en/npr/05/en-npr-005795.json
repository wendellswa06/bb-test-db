        "What is the basis for the legal arguments in these cases?",
        "Is it immigration law, or is it civil rights?",
        "What do you…",
        "Well, it's really both.",
        "It's - first, that immigration law is a federal area of legislation, and that the federal government sets immigration policy.",
        "The federal government enforces immigration policy, and we do not have a system in this country - and for understandable and good reason - where each town or each community can determine its own immigration laws, where we have a dozen, 1,000 or a 100,000 different immigration laws, each setting their own standards.",
        "And one of the things that I think it's important to note is that as these different ordinances get considered and enacted, each one's a little bit different.",
        "And so they really set up a system where we have inconsistency.",
        "And so the core principle, as was mentioned at the beginning, is that the courts have consistently said that immigration policy has to be set by Congress.",
        "Secondly, these local ordinances lead to and cause discrimination, because as Mayor Barletta had to acknowledge, he doesn't know and no one knows who's documented, who's undocumented, who lives in a family made up of citizens of permanent residences of documented persons, of undocumented persons.",
        "And what these ordinances do is sweep too broadly and essentially say to everyone who looks our sounds foreign in whatever that might mean in a particular community you are not welcome.",
        "You are under a threat.",
        "And you will be subject to different scrutiny and to discrimination.",
        "And that's been the consistent pattern when these ordinances get enacted.",
        "And are you going to take on one ordinance at a time?",
        "I mean, you said that there's - each one is a little bit different.",
        "If they keep popping up, or are you just going to have to go around the country and keep fighting these ordinances?",
        "Well, what - we will if we have to, but we hope we won't.",
        "We are currently litigating a number of them, four at the present time.",
        "More are being considered.",
        "But really I think these communities are being sold a bill of goods.",
        "And what we hope is that - with calmer reflection and as courts begin to enjoin these various ordinances as the court already has in Hazelton, then other communities will stop and take a harder look at whether this is really appropriate policy, and it's not.",
        "And I'd like to go back to a point that was made at the beginning about national security.",
        "The federal government, the inspector general of the social security administration and others have said don't engage in this kind of verification process, across the board mandatory verification, which is what the Hazelton ordinance tries to command, because there'll be unintended consequences, including that what you do is increase the number, for example, of counterfeit documents.",
        "And that, in turn, as the inspector general specifically said, threatens national security.",
        "So there is a reason why Congress has gone very slowly and very deliberately.",
        "It's outlawed certain practices.",
        "It has prohibited employers from hiring undocumented persons.",
        "The federal government enforces that provision.",
        "It has recognized that those kinds of provisions cause discrimination.",
        "So as part of the federal law, it has strict anti-discrimination provisions.",
        "It's recognized privacy.",
        "It takes into account national security.",
        "These are very complicated issues.",
        "And that's precisely the reason why localities cannot enact their own ordinances as they're inconsistent with what Congress has already done.",
        "Just quickly, Mayor Barletta said that the business community is supportive of these ordinances.",
        "Are you finding members of business communities in various locations concerned about it?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There are many businesses that are concerned about it.",
        "And I think we will see increasingly business responding and opposing these ordinances.",
        "And I think, you know, we have to recognize that a lot of communities around the country face a lot of difficult issues.",
        "There's no doubt about that."

        "But for example, an independent study regarding Hazleton said that immigration has rejuvenated downtown Hazleton.",
        "That there are enormous numbers of Hispanic businesses that have increased and contributed to the revitalization of that community.",
        "And when communities enact these kinds of ordinances, what they say to immigrant communities, you are no welcome here, and that's' ultimately counterproductive.",
        "Okay.",
        "I just wanted to say that I'm from the Dallas area, (unintelligible) nearby.",
        "I firmly support what the Councils doing there.",
        "They're showing strong leadership where the federal government has clearly demonstrated they have no interest in enforcing the law.",
        "Therefore it falls upon the people to do so.",
        "Secondly, I would say the elitists that want to encourage illegal immigration and has forced bilingualism upon Americans, the destruction of our culture, we haven't voted for that.",

        "What's being raised here is that the federal government is not doing its job.",
        "It's not enforcing its laws and it seems to be frustration over there, which seems to be fueling…",
        "Which it's not.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it's funny - I was just reading - there's actually a Supreme Court from, I think, 1850-something, having to do with immigration that said, even if the federal government isn't doing its job localities can't step in.",
        "So, I mean that's been said.",
        "But I do wonder, Mr. Guttentag, if you feel that even if you've got legal arguments on your side, by the sheer number of localities, signing on to these ordinances and trying to do something and pushing if there might some sort of, if not legal, political ball that gets rolling.",
        "Because Congress has, sort of, punted now for several years.",
        "Mr.",
        "Guttentag, before you answer that I just want to remind our audience that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Go ahead.",
        "Well, I think that there's some interest in part of communities.",
        "But it's because their interest is being misdirected and thinking that targeting so-called illegal immigrants is either possible on the local level or is productive.",
        "What we need to do is look at what the real problems are that communities face, whether it's regard to the education system, the tax base, crime, population growth, and look and deal with those issues and not divert attention from real problems by saying that the problem is so-called illegal immigration."

        "And, you know, this is not anything new in our community, in our society.",
