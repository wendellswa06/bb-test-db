        "Fort Collins leans Democratic.",
        "But the county that it's in, Larimer, is pretty representative of the state as a whole where you have one-third registered Democrats, one-third registered Republicans, one-third unaffiliated.",
        "OK.",
        "Well, if the shutdown continues, and as we approach the debt limit when Treasury is going to run short of cash, what are you hearing from readers?",
        "How is this all affecting them?",
        "Patrick Malone in Colorado, why don't you go first.",
        "What we are hearing when you go to a coffee shop or restaurant in Fort Collins is a general frustration with Congress.",
        "I think people wouldn't put anything past them at this point.",
        "They're really down on Congress.",
        "And, frankly, matching the national polls, there tends to be a level of blame on the GOP.",
        "A level of blame on the GOP.",
        "A different picture I imagine in Tyler, Texas, Brian?",
        "Well, I sort of took this as an assignment from NPR and put on my reporter hat, and put a fetcher out on Facebook.",
        "And I was pleasantly surprised to find more than 50 comments when I woke up this morning.",
        "I'll read you one right here.",
        "Fed up with an administration that will not compromise; to be honest, I think we can do just fine without the federal government.",

        "Republicans need to hold the line.",
        "And, Felice Belman in New Hampshire, where you hearing?",
        "You know, interesting.",
        "The day before the shutdown actually happened, we had sent a reporter out to do person-on-the street interviews.",
        "And she came back frustrated at how little people seemed to know about it.",
        "And yet, the minute it happened, we were flooded with angry letters and calls from readers sort of all on all ends of the spectrum.",
        "We like to think, particularly in a state like this which prides itself on its sort of live-free-or-die mentality, that we don't need the federal government.",
        "But it's insinuated in our lives in ways we don't even think about.",
        "And I think that's become clear to people over the last week.",
        "You raise an interesting point, Felice, which is how directly is this shutdown or the looming debt ceiling fight - how directly is that affecting people around the country?",
        "Or do they see this really as a Washington issue that isn't touching them?",
        "Patrick Malone, what about in Fort Collins?",
        "It's a disaster.",
        "I mean, you've got Estes Park coming off of monumental hundred-year type flood.",
        "They really rely on this type of tourism season during the fall colors, et cetera, to right at the backdoor of Rocky Mountain National Park, which is now shut down.",
        "Look at the Centers for Disease Control in Fort Collins, 90 percent furloughed.",
        "So you've got about 36 people on duty to respond to any vector borne illness that comes up out there.",
        "You'd be talking about an outbreak of West Nile, Lyme disease, things of this nature."

        "Brian Pearson, I'd be curious to hear the thoughts from Tyler, Texas on the Tea Party and its role in this discussion; and specifically about the role of Texas Senator Ted Cruz, the Tea Party standard-bearer who now some are calling the de facto speaker of the House, for the influence that he's having on this discussion?",
        "How is he being seen in Tyler, Texas?",
        "Well, there is a fairly sizable Tea Party influence in Tyler.",

        "Yeah, you know, there was a brief moment in New Hampshire where the Tea Party and Tea Party affiliated, or Tea Party-sympathetic politicians really did hold sway here.",
        "That sort of ended with the last election and they seem largely unpopular.",
        "There's a former congressman from New Hampshire who is hoping to win his old seat back.",
        "Last time around, he ran, you know, arm-in-arm with the Tea Party.",
        "And now he's talking about, you know, crossing the divide and trying to work with Democrats, and why can't we all just get along, and roll up our sleeves and get things done.",
        "It's a really different tone from him.",
        "So it sounds like you're saying that the Tea Party wave in New Hampshire has turned to some extent.",
        "It has.",
        "I mean, it's not gone altogether.",
        "But I think that crest of popularity certainly isn't around anymore.",

        "Could you characterize in any way how folks in your regions feel now about the Affordable Care Act, which has become such a flashpoint in this discussion.",
        "Felice, in Concord, New Hampshire.",
        "You know, a lot of people that we've talked to are seemingly patient about it, that they want it to succeed and that they're quite mindful of the opening glitches.",
        "And some of them wish that it were more progressive, I suppose you could say, than it is.",
        "But I think, you know, we've also heard from people who say, Jeez, if the government weren't shutdown we could really focus on what's wrong with this and expose how it's not working.",
        "So I think people are still - because the rollout has been sort of eclipsed by what's going on with the shutdown, it's very hard to get people to focus on it."
