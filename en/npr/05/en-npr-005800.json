        "True.",

        "When you look across populations, you'll find a lot of genetic diversity.",

        "Her sons and daughters mate with one another so there's extreme inbreeding.",
        "When they have progeny, those brothers and sisters will mate with one another.",
        "And so the degree of genetic diversity within any one bedbug population is very, very low.",
        "What Coby and his colleagues at North Carolina and collaborators at Rutgers found is that even within an apartment building if you have two populations of bugs, they don't even mate with one another.",
        "So you could have line from one grandmother that occupies several apartments.",
        "You might have a line from a different grandmother that occupies a separate set.",
        "But the two of them don't actually mate with each other.",
        "So the degree of genetic diversity - or rather the degree of mating between those two populations is about as much as you'd get between one population in New York and another in Vancouver.",
