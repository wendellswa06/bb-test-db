        "However, that is a very misleading number.",
        "Less than 1 percent, in fact, 0.6 percent of all the rooms have had bedbugs in them.",
        "That really points to the importance of precise detection.",
        "If you detect bedbugs in a hotel, and you give off an insecticidal bomb in the lobby, or you indiscriminately spray in every room, it's a waste of money.",

        "And occasionally, they do migrate into luggage.",
        "It's important to distinguish between detection and infestation.",
        "And if there's one bedbug, it's not a big deal.",
        "And unfortunately, people do tend to overreact to a single bedbug.",

        "That's very good because the two best things to do for actually controlling and reducing bedbug populations in the house are, number one, getting rid of clutter and vacuuming.",
        "And number two, drying the clothes on the hottest setting in the dryer.",
        "It's not the hot water of the wash, but it's really keeping them in the dryer.",

        "One, can animals, can dogs really detect bedbugs within a residence?",
        "And two, if, for instance, you're traveling and you wake up, and you find that you've been beaten and there are bedbugs in the room, what should you do?",
        "Should you just destroy everything you have and come home with a clean set of clothes?",

        "So for question number one, yes, there - canines are used to detect bedbugs.",
        "Just as dogs have been trained to find bombs or drugs, they can also sniff out bedbugs.",
        "The problem with that is that there are a high level of false positives.",
        "Sometimes they - you think they detect it when they don't.",
        "And it can get really expensive.",
        "So although they can be useful, it's not a sustainable long-term solution.",
        "About your second question.",
        "If you do find that you've been beaten, as I mentioned to the previous caller, probably the best thing you can do is, when you get home, wash everything on a hot cycle, and then put it at the hottest setting of your dryer for the longest time, and be careful of the seams of your luggage, which is where the bedbugs will hide.",
        "All right.",
        "Well, I'm afraid we have to leave our bedbug primer there.",
        "Rajeev - I'm sorry - Vaidyanathan, is the associate director of vector biology at SRI International in Harrisonburg, Virginia.",
