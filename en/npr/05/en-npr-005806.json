        "What research has shown me is that it just hasn't been an educational option.",
        "I mean, you know, I'm 26 years old and, frankly, it was something that I was able to do due to the kindness of other people but Dr. Johnnetta Cole, president of Bennett College for Women, said that there were five factors - she called the five F's - family, finances, fear, faculty, and friends.",
        "Basically that we just don't have a family history of study abroad.",
        "Financially, it's just not very feasible for all of our students, that we're afraid to step outside of our boxes, that faculty don't champion it enough, and that we are somewhat afraid that if we leave our boxes, that our friends are going to forget who we are.",
        "And those are the things that really, kind of, keep us here.",
        "But we designed a program, hopefully, that's going to overcome all those barriers.",

        "No.",
        "I would really say that they motivated me.",
        "As a finance major and an athlete, I knew that the finance sector of business existed globally.",
        "So I was really interested to see how that played a role in the African economy.",
        "I mean, I knew when - I knew I always want to study abroad and I knew that I want to go to Africa.",
        "I just wasn't sure where in Africa that I wanted to go.",
        "But after extensive research and all of that and, kind of, crossing out the X's and the O's, it tunneled down to Nairobi."
