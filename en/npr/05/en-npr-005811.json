        "So both the House and Senate passed bills this year that would end the band, and then they tacked on restrictions forbidding federal funding of needle exchanges within a thousand feet of schools and pretty much anywhere they're might be children.",

        "And we think, you know, if you got to do it, just keep out of sight of children.",
        "Well, we joke that the only two places where we could legally do needle exchange would be in graveyards and in the middle of the Potomac.",
        "But actually more accurately, it'd be in the middle of some national parks, and on the steps of the Capitol are pretty much the only places which we would not be in conflict with the current law.",

        "The Centers for Disease Control calls it an effective part of comprehensive HIV prevention programs.",
        "And in 2000, then-surgeon general Dr. David Satcher issued a report saying needle exchanges are quote, \"\"an effective public health intervention that reduces the transmission of HIV and does not encourage the use of illegal drugs.",

        "That will affect the supplemental poverty measure because we subtract off out-of-pocket medical expenses, and this would change what people have to pay out of pocket.",
        "It won't affect the official poverty rate, which is based only on people's cash income.",
        "So this would give us some sense of what the impact of that health reform would be on what it's doing to people's, you know, bottom line, what they're having to pay in terms of health expenses.",

        "And one of the things that we're trying with this new supplemental measure, which is an experimental effort, is to look at regional variation and to adjust that line for regional differences.",

        "It seems an obvious difference that, you know, your income at - I'm just picking a number - $15,000 a year is different in New York City than it is in Pierre, South Dakota.",
        "So when the official poverty rate was defined, we actually didn't have the data to be able to do that.",

        "Is this the beginning of that?",
        "Well, I think that by producing the supplemental measure, publishing it at the same time as the official rate, it gives us the alternative to look at both of these side by side.",
        "Let me note that that official rate - if you want a fast and dirty calculation of how we're doing, people's cash income is a pretty good calculation.",
        "And there's a larger amount of legislation that looks at eligibility for programs based on people's cash income.",
        "So in that sense, I think continuing to estimate and use the official rate is actually a good thing to do.",
