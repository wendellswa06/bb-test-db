        "So knowing, for instance, whether if we increase the earned income tax credit in this country, what effect that's going to have on people's resources that they have to spend on food, shelter and clothing strikes me of something we need to know in evaluating that program.",
        "Surely we don't want to spend too much of our money on evaluation and data, but we've got to spend some or we can't look at whether the programs are really having the effects that we want them to have.",

        "You know, if you think there's methodological changes that will make this better, you should make them.",
        "It is within your responsibility.",

        "Okay.",
        "So, on one level, what we have here is a Palestinian protest, and they are arguing that Israel has taken their land.",
        "And a way to show that protest is basically to march on Israel from outside.",

        "I have long ago learned that there are very few things that are self-evident in this world when you look at them.",
        "No, I mean, I actually think that different people will use these measures differently.",
        "And, you know, there will be healthy debate amongst folks as to - depending on what the question's being asked, which of these measures should be used.",
        "I should note that this is quite consistent, for instance - again, to use the unemployment rate analogy, the Bureau of Labor Statistics produces unofficial unemployment rate.",
        "But if you look at that monthly release that they put out every month when they release the unemployment and employment numbers, they release a whole variety of alternative employment numbers and alternative unemployment numbers.",
        "They arent the official number, but they're numbers that give us additional insight on, you know, who's hurting, who's unemployed and, you know, which groups are being most affected.",
