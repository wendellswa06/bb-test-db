        "You know, one of the concerns here is just dragging this thing out.",
        "The bottom line is the government did set a deadline and by all indications, it's going to pass without complete resolution.",
        "Now, one of the options has been bankruptcy, either for one or both of the companies.",
        "And there have been recent reports suggesting that it's not the way they're going.",
        "Is it off the table?",
        "Well, you know, the signs are they're not really considering bankruptcy.",
        "One task force advisor last, White House task force advisor, last week, Steven Rattner, downplayed that possibility.",
        "But people I talked to still say, you know, it could happen.",
        "And President Obama hinted at it today.",
        "If they're not willing to make the changes and the restructurings that are necessary, then I'm not willing to have taxpayer money chase after bad money.",
        "And that said, there's no real strong indication right now the White House is thinking this way.",
        "Many people who talked to the auto task force warned against it.",
        "They said there could be huge job losses, and we're already in a deep recession.",
        "But, you know, without the threat of bankruptcy, the White House just doesn't have as much leverage to force some of these deep painful cuts.",
        "Now, you mentioned that the automakers have not met conditions of the loans that the government made back in December.",
        "What's the biggest thing they haven't resolved?",
        "Well, you know, for GM it's getting rid of debt with bondholders and the union.",
        "And essentially this is a $47 billion game of chicken.",
        "That's what GM owns - owes the bondholders and the union.",
        "It has these obligations to the union for retiree health care.",
        "And it wants to give the bondholders about 33 cents on the dollar, the union 50 cents on the dollar and the rest in stock, but both sides are really worried that this stock could be worthless over time.",
        "Marshall Goldman, thanks once again for talking with us.",
        "So this actually goes back to the way North Korean leaders have done this for a long time.",
        "Kim Jong Un's father and grandfather traveled to China many times in these big, green, armored trains.",
        "And the news that they were there only went out after they rolled back over the border.",
        "So it harks back to the way things were for decades between China and North Korea when the leaders of China's Communist Party and North Korea's Worker's Party called each other comrade and spoke of socialist solidarity.",
        "And that's why people thought something was happening potentially because this big, armored train just doesn't roll into Beijing every day of the week (laughter)."

        "Now, this month, North Korea indicated it was willing to abandon its nukes, but this is the first time that Kim Jong Un has actually said that in person to a foreign head of state.",
        "What he said to Xi Jinping is if South Korea and the U.S.",
        "play along and they create a stable and peaceful atmosphere on the peninsula, then we can resolve this nuclear issue.",
        "In a way, it's not unexpected.",
        "It's sort of like a second shoe dropping.",
        "North Korea had already promised to hold talks with Seoul and Washington, so it was highly unlikely that it could leave out its main neighbor and ally.",
        "That doesn't mean, of course, at the end of the day, that Pyongyang will give up its nukes.",
        "We'll just have to see what happens if the talks get off the ground.",
        "OK.",
        "So this could've been China just wanting to get into the game of the diplomacy that President Trump has been talking about.",
        "But things are also kind of tense right now between Beijing and Washington.",
        "Is that tied into this visit somehow?",
        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "I mean, they're tense over the sort of brewing trade war that's going on.",
        "The Trump administration is beefing up ties with Taiwan and there are continued disputes over the South China Sea.",
        "And that makes it a good time for China to say, hey, remember that North Korea is our ally.",
        "But there's also coordination going on.",

        "They're being asked, did Maryland Democratic lawmakers violate the First Amendment rights of voters in the 6th Congressional District when they rejiggered the district's lines during redistricting to shift it from a safe Republican district to a Democratic district?",
        "Now, that is known as partisan gerrymandering.",
        "And my knowledge of all of this is not all that great, but I thought that lower courts have often struck down maps when there's been racial gerrymandering.",
        "Yes, they have.",
        "But the Supreme Court usually allows partisan gerrymandering.",
        "They've never struck that down.",
        "Now we have this case in Maryland.",
        "We also have a Supreme Court case - well, a case in front of the Supreme Court in Wisconsin.",
        "So are things changing?",
        "Could this actually radically change the way courts treat partisan gerrymandering?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "More than a decade ago, the court had a partisan gerrymandering case out of Pennsylvania.",
        "And they essentially threw up their hands, saying, look, we can't find a standard or a test to determine when partisan politics goes too far in redistricting.",
        "And they didn't touch it then until this term when they took the two cases.",
        "The hope is - at least the challengers in - to the Maryland and Wisconsin districts - the hope is that the court now is ready to come up with some kind of test or standard that lower courts can apply when they're faced with challenges based on partisan gerrymandering.",
        "So this could potentially set precedent and really open the floodgates for challenges and mean that there will be much less partisan gerrymandering if any at all in the future."
