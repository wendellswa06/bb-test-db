        "Well, so this is the really interesting thing about it.",
        "I mean, according to this new study, which was commissioned by the Ed Department of the program - it found that of the people who had had their grants converted to loans - and this is actually the majority of the people in the program - 1 in 3 of those folks said on a survey that they had either already met the requirements - the teaching requirements of the program - or they felt like they were likely to.",
        "And again, the review found that nearly two-thirds of everyone in the TEACH Grant Program - that they studied anyway - had essentially failed out.",
        "They'd been converted - had their grants converted into loans.",
        "That's extraordinary.",
        "I mean, does the Department of Education actually explain why these conversions are happening?",
        "So it - well, it is complicated.",
        "There are a number of reasons.",
        "And to be fair, a lot of these conversions are justified because not everyone who says in college, look, I want to be a teacher, give me a grant.",
        "Not all of them go on to become teachers.",
        "And obviously, some may, but maybe they don't teach in a school in a low-income community or maybe they're not teaching a high-need subject like math or science.",
        "But it is clear that paperwork is really hanging up a lot of these teachers.",
        "And the Ed Department said in a statement the results are concerning...",
        "All right.",

        "By writing a memoir, I wonder, are you, in a sense, holding up your life for examination and offering your story as a kind of model?",
        "Well, I'd say, not so much a model, but maybe to provide an insight, here or there, to help somebody come to terms with the dark corners of their own soul, to come to terms with the undecided, their own sense of self, and maybe help develop a capacity to love - to love wisdom, love justice.",

        "Well, I don't know what's going to be done about this, but in the past, federal court orders in the South had a lot of resonance, during the civil rights movement, and elected officials had declined to enforce the federal court orders had found themselves in a lot of trouble.",
