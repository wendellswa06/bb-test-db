        "And one other things that drew you across the bridge was the fact that a really pretty girl lived on the other side.",
        "Yeah, old Sister Delores(ph); I remember listening to the great Curtis Mayfield - gypsy woman from nowhere through a caravan around the campfire lights.",
        "I'll tell you, that song meant much to me, and Delores meant much - and of course, I never got a chance even talk to the sister.",
        "It was like �Just My Imagination� by Eddie Kendricks and The Temptations.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "And yes, it's the Rock & Roll and the R & B of your youth, but it's also other kinds of music too.",
        "Well, all kinds.",
        "I mean, shoot(ph), getting to Stephen Sondheim - I couldn't live without the genius of Stephen Sondheim, be it not just �West Side Story,� but �Follies,� �Company,� �Sweeney Todd,� �Passion.� You can go on and on.",
        "I assume you know that there is a revival of �A Little Night Music.� It's going to open in New York in a couple of weeks.",
        "Yes, and �Send In The Clowns.� I can't wait with Desiree, �Send In The Clowns.� I know they won't sound like Sarah Vaughan when she sings it, but the song itself - it's such a majestic powerful and, of course, comedic in its own way.",
        "But, I mean, most importantly for me, you know, growing up, it was a spirituals, it was a gospels, it was James Cleveland, Aretha Franklin, Marion Williams; and then it was Curtis Mayfield - The Main Ingredient, The Whispers, Black Blue Magic(ph), James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Luther Vandross - that music helped me preserves my sanity, help me preserve whatever dignity I was able to preserve, helping to keep going.",
        "It was a source of tremendous strength in my life.",
        "That's why, for me, music is in no way ornamental or decorative, it's constitutive of who I am.",
        "And that's why, when I say I'm a blues man, that's a very serious vocation - to muster the courage to find your own unique voice, to forge your distinctive style in the world, to leave your imprint in the sands of time in such a way that your singularity, your individuality, remains something that people have to come to terms with.",
        "That's B.B.",
        "King, that's Ma Rainey, that's Bessie Smith, that's Leroy Carr, that's Bruce Springsteen, that's Bob Dylan, that's Janet Joplin.",
        "And that's even Daryl Halls - my dear, dear brother's a blues man too.",

        "You know, we're all vanishing organisms and disappearing creatures in space and time - that death sentence in space in time that Kafka talked about with such profundity.",
        "And so the question becomes, what you do in the meantime?",
        "And you go - if you're forever on the move, especially in the life of the mind; forever reading veraciously, writing, speaking, lecturing, trying to unsettle minds, trying to touch souls, trying to encourage and inspire, on the one hand, but also trying to unhouse(ph) and unnerve people, so that they have to reexamine themselves, society and the world on the others.",
        "There's tremendous joy in it.",
        "I've been blessed, I think, to have tremendous joy in my life in pursuing my vocation, my calling.",
        "And yet, as you know from the story, there's an underside to that, too.",
        "You know, I had blackouts, fallen out, of course, the death threats, people showing up, putting guns to my wife's head with mask, and people having shot guns in the driveway, looking for me or announcing that I've already died before lectures and sending it through newspaper - sending it to newspaper columns they send my mother and so on.",

        "I've heard you address the topic of rap and hip-hop on a number of occasions, and I was wondering if you acknowledge a distinction between the two art forms, rap and hip-hop.",
        "Well, I appreciate it.",
        "No, rap is just a movement within the larger culture of hip-hop.",
        "KRS-1 and others, as you know, has theorized this in such a way that hip-hop embraces a variety of different activities.",
        "Rap is a movement in it.",
        "You've got graffiti, and a host of other movements, as well.",
        "But the important thing for me as an educator is how to - how do we unsettle the minds and touch the souls of significant numbers of young people who don't read texts or don't read my texts, and that's why I've made three CDs.",

        "All these are forms of singing education, what the Greeks call paideia, P-A-I-D-E-I-A, that deep education to get us to shift from superficial things to serious things, to shift from bling-bling to life and death to justice and pain and joy, those fundamental, elemental things that we must come to terms with as we make our moves from our mother's womb to the tomb.",
        "And I think hip-hop can be prophetic and progressive, and at the same time, the dominant forms tend to be homophobic, misogynistic and something that we need to critically call into question.",
        "That's why I actually called.",
        "I kind of beg to differ with you.",
        "All those positive aspects, those artists you name, I consider those hip-hop artists.",
