        "Oh yeah.",
        "My question - yeah.",
        "My question is not so much about your memoir, which I read and loved, but from your book �Hope on a Tightrope.� You made a statement about women being the next wave of leadership.",
        "I just wanted you to kind of expound on that a little bit more, about what you meant and what did that look like to you, that new wave of leadership being led by women.",
        "I just think that as the ugly forms of patriarchy begin to fade or be pushed back - there's still some subtle forms actually operating in a variety of different ways - but as the ugly forms of patriarchy are pushed back, I think the next wave, especially of high-quality leadership, will be disproportionately women.",
        "I think there's a real sense in which the kind of male-centered, ego-oriented, status-obsessed forms of leadership are simply just running out of gas, and people want something real.",
        "They want somebody who's got an honesty, a candor, someone who is willing to take a risk and step out and tell the truth, and I do believe that the decline of patriarchy provides that possibility.",
        "Now of course, the women can always choose the patriarchal models, and you end up with a Margaret Thatcher.",
        "Interesting.",
        "I wonder, Chilandra, you read the book, there's a passage in which Cornel West is talking about the breakup of a personal relationship and said he had to go his way to pursue his calling, which was teaching and dialoguing with dozens of people whose minds nurtured my own, and then you write the line, Cornell West: Women want and deserve inordinate attention.",
        "What do you mean by that?",
        "You can't have a high-quality relationship without time and without trust.",
        "Now, I'm pretty good on the trust, but my time is always so tight because I'm on the move all the time.",
        "It is very difficult to sustain a high-quality relationship that has the kind of mutual intensity, that has a kind of mutual respect, without putting in time.",
        "Now, of course, I could have said that the other way.",
        "The men also require inordinate attention in terms of a high-quality relationship because the standards apply to brothers as well as sisters, sisters as well as brothers of all colors, all cultures, all civilization.",
        "But you have to have that time.",
        "And I think B.B.",
        "King and James Brown and Aretha and the others will tell you that it's hard to sustain high-quality relationships when you're a blues man or woman.",

        "I know you've been a vocal proponent for sexual minorities, mainly homosexuals, and that's fine, but I was wondering: How do you feel about people who are transgender?",

        "No, absolutely.",
        "I mean, it's too many - and it wasn't just black churches, too many black folk in general played a regressive role tied to the Mormon brothers and sisters who actually provided certain financial undergirding for that campaign against my gay brothers and lesbian sisters.",
        "But it's just a matter of being honest and candid and acknowledging homophobia cuts very deep in the culture across the board.",
        "I don't care what color the culture.",
        "I don't care what slice or part of the country.",
        "So that the real question is, how do we speak to the kind of black self-hatred and self-violation and black self-destruction?",

        "There's a lot of white self-hatred, white self-destruction, white self-violation as well.",

        "You have to explicitly call it out for what it is in the same way other forms of bigotry had to be called out in the history of this nation, the male supremacy and the white supremacy and so on.",

        "Not a mumbling word.",
        "Well, if it was so important, how come he didn't say anything?",

        "We got around that one, a lot of hermeneutical tap dancing in order to get around that one.",

        "Well, I'm black Baptist in origin, right?",
        "So we got around that one quick in terms of the joyful noise we make in the name of the lord so that we have to be honest in terms of what do we mean by not just love thy neighbor, which is part of prophetic duty as of Leviticus 19:18, but even love thy enemy.",

        "We never possess the truth - capital T - or possess knowledge - capital K.",
        "It's endless.",
        "But still, the university can have that kind of mission and embrace the community, and the community, of course, can learn so much from the university and teach the university some things because community is not simply about truth and knowledge, it's about a lot of love and taking care of the kids and nurturing the young ones and so on.",
