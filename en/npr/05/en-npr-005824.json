        "Frankly, they're both right and they're both wrong.",
        "They're both right in the sense that if you are taking the point of view that this is a freedom of navigation issue under the 1982 law of the sea convention, which prevails in times of peace, then what the Turkish foreign minister said is true.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "On the other hand, the Israeli spokesman is assuming that they are talking about a period of armed conflict.",
        "The Israelis say that they have a conflict with the Hamas regime in the Gaza Strip, they've declared a blockade and they claim that's an act that is countenanced by the United Nations.",
        "True?",
        "It's, again, true but not fully true because it's traditional customary law that's embodied in article 51 of the U.N.",
        "charter that allows everybody, individual and collective, self-defense.",
        "The point of view of the Israelis is that they are engaged in a blockade and they have certain conditions that have evolved over many, many centuries, really, that have to be met.",
        "And by the way, one of them is that they have to consistently enforce it.",
        "So, if the blockade is not legal, then you're back to what the Turkish foreign minister said.",
        "Now, one thing that people on board the ships and the flotilla made much of was that this didn't happen in Israeli waters or in waters within the limit, I guess, of territorial waters, it happened on the high seas.",
        "Does that make a great difference as to the legality of enforcing a blockade?",
        "The quick answer is no, in this case.",
        "But, you know, we also have more complex problems that come into it.",
        "For example, dual use.",
        "Apparently on this vessel they were carrying cement.",
        "Well, as we all know, cement can be used to make bunkers, but people also can use cement to make homes.",
        "So, again, it's a mixed fact situation.",
        "So far, bottom line seems to be there's a little bit of law or a fair amount of law on either side here, you're saying.",
        "Yes.",
        "And unknown facts galore."
