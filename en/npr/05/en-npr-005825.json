        "Rabbi Black, was there something different about the people who came out on Friday night?",
        "I think there was.",
        "First of all, in the summer - you know, it's sort of a time when people usually don't come en masse to services.",
        "And our sanctuary was filled.",
        "And also, there were a lot of young people with their parents there, which you don't usually see in the summertime.",
        "What did you talk about on Friday?",
        "I said if there's anything that we can take from this, it's the ability to ask, why does someone have access to guns?",
        "And I spoke about what I felt was the need to rethink the easy access to weapons of mass destruction, that's so prevalent in our society.",
        "The principal told Rebecca her son couldn't come back.",
        "So, the next day she stayed home and made appointments a pediatrician, a psychologist, a psychiatrist.",
        "After a round of visits, Jacob was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.",
        "Bipolar disorder used to be known as manic depression.",
        "In adults, it's a disease characterized by episodes of intense highs and lows, periods of mania, periods of depression.",
        "It's seen as a lifelong biological problem that can be controlled by medications.",
        "So Jacob was put on medications: mood stabilizers, antidepressants.",
        "He was four years old.",
        "This is you pod.",
        "And now you can decorate it, see.",
        "Today, Jacob is a video game enthusiast who shows me a game called, \"\"Little Big Planet.\"\" Since his diagnosis at four, he stayed medicated.",

        "His mom says the same.",

        "The number of kids like Jacob, kids on serious bipolar medications like mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, has grown enormously.",
        "In fact, Medicaid spends more money on antipsychotics than it does on any other drug expenditure.",
        "Now, many of these kids haven't had the positive experience that Jacob had.",
        "But even if they had, David Shaffer, one of the psychiatrists responsible for the changes coming up in the DSM, said that while the medications might be helping kids like Jacob today, we have no idea how they will affect them tomorrow.",
        "In many states you go to, people are worried about the proportion of extremely young children who are receiving atypical antipsychotics which we think have quite profound effects on important mechanisms in the brain which may influence growth and development of the nervous system.",
        "You see almost all of the drugs now used have never been tested in children.",
        "So what's happening, critics argue, essentially amounts to an enormous, unregulated experiment directly on American children.",
        "And this morning, in a move they could potentially change mental health practice all over America, the American Psychiatric Association announced that it intends to include in its new DSM a diagnosis that it hopes will be used by clinicians instead of the bipolar label.",
        "Essentially, they're trying to use the power of the DSM - which is incredibly important because insurance companies use it to decide what to reimburse - to change the behavior of doctors.",
        "But Shaffer says that the move shouldn't be misinterpreted.",
        "I don't think anybody's arguing that these are perfectly normal children that get the label - far from it.",
        "We're saying these kids are very sick.",
        "But they probably don't have bipolar disorder.",
        "And they probably do deserve a name which adequately describes what they're doing.",
        "Child psychiatrist Janet Wozniak helped popularize the bipolar diagnosis for kids.",
        "And she says she knows why the diagnosis took off.",
        "The diagnosis took off because it makes clinical sense, because we opened our eyes.",
        "But Gabrielle Carlson, a child psychiatrist at Stony Brook University, disagrees.",
        "She feels the bipolar label took off for a host of other reasons.",
        "For example, many of the kids now categorized as bipolar were once upon a time, she says, diagnosed as having conduct disorder.",
        "Kids with conduct disorder are seen as potential juvenile delinquents: aggressive, prone to anger and destructive behavior.",
        "But, says Carlson, the treatments for conduct disorder are really pretty limited."

        "Prayer and fasting.",
        "We've got parent kinds of treatment, but the evidence that therapy makes a big difference is not wonderful.",
        "Which is why, says Carlson, when psychiatrists were told that they could now think of this set of behaviors not as conduct disorder but as manic depression, they got so excited because manic depression was treatable with drugs.",
        "Heck, if that's what it is, we have got a bunch of medicines that are supposed to be helpful for mania.",
        "I give it one of these drugs, maybe it will get better.",
        "Another advantage to bipolar, Carlson points out, is that because the insurance industry saw bipolar as a biological medical problem, they were happy to fund it.",
        "While conduct disorder, a parenting problem, they didn't want to pay for.",
        "Finally, Carlson argues parents themselves were relieved on some level.",
        "The part of the acceptance of the bipolar if you're a parent is, hey, I'm off the hook on this one.",
        "It's not because I'm a bad parent.",
        "I've got a kid with this genetic problem.",
        "It's not my fault.",
        "And, you know, there's some pros and cons to that, but the fact remains many people found that liberating.",
        "So clearly, there were some real advantages to using the bipolar label.",
        "But the disadvantages, including some of the medications, were so great that David Shaffer told me he and his colleagues on the DSM felt that they had to weigh in and come up with a diagnosis that might be a better fit for kids like Jacob with rage problems.",
        "So, what we thought would be valuable would be to carve out a group with the most severe reactions.",
        "So ones who, when they do lose their temper, do so with, you know, great force, and who are having them frequently two or three times a week.",
        "The disorder, Shaffer says, will be called temper dysregulation disorder and it will be seen as a brain or a biological dysfunction, but not necessarily as a lifelong condition like bipolar.",
        "Of course, there's no way to predict what practical effects these changes might have.",
        "How insurance companies, schools might react.",
        "For instance, when Rebecca, the mother of Jacob, took paperwork that said that her child was bipolar to the school and to her neighborhood, Jacob's violent outburst wasn't seen as evidence that he was a bad seed, he was just sick.",
        "And the school then made plans to immediately take care of the situation, you know, it was Jacob wasn't suspended from school.",
        "He wasn't, you know, he didn't have all those ramifications.",
        "It was as if we had discovered he had cancer, you know, he needed accommodations, he needed help.",
        "Not a whole lot of craziness.",
        "But, Rebecca was told, if he had conduct disorder he would probably have to go immediately to a special program.",
        "So, how will temper dysregulation disorder be seen?",
        "Shaffer admits it's hard to say whether doctors will change their behavior and use this new diagnosis.",
        "And Gabrielle Carlson says it's possible that even with the new diagnosis kids will get the same medications."
