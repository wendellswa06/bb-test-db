        "You'd think today would be Dmitri Medvedev's big day.",
        "Only a major surprise can keep him from winning the presidency.",
        "After all, Putin anointed his dapper young protege to be his chosen successor, and Medvedev's poll numbers have topped 70 percent.",
        "But despite all that, it's not Medvedev who's been making the headlines.",
        "(Soundbite of horns honking)",
        "Here on a building right next to Red Square in Central Moscow, a giant billboard advertising Medvedev's candidacy rises many stories high.",
        "Only what you see is Medvedev together with Putin dressed in a leather bomber jacket.",
        "Medvedev is smiling at something Putin is saying.",
        "The billboard reads, together we'll win, and it reflects something many believe about the election here.",
        "It's not about Russians picking whom they want to lead their country.",
        "The choice has been Putin's alone.",
        "Putin may be stepping down as president because his term limit runs out but Medvedev says he wants to appoint Putin prime minister.",
        "Many believe he'll use the position to hold on to power.",
        "To the last day of campaigning, Putin has remained very literally in the front seat.",
        "When he and Medvedev visited a military airbase last week and climbed into a plane's cockpit, it was Putin who took the pilot seat.",
        "Medvedev sat in the co-pilot's.",
        "(Russian spoken)",
        "And it was Putin who sternly announced Russia is boosting spending on defense by billions of dollars, partly to build a new state aircraft-manufacturing facility at the base.",
        "Medvedev, a former lawyer, sat upright in the audience listening attentively."

        "But while the result of today's vote is a foregone conclusion, what happens next isn't.",
        "During his rule Putin has kept control in the hands of a very powerful president, while his prime ministers have been completely subservient.",
        "However, during a news conference last month, Putin made it clear matters could change.",
        "(Russian spoken)",
        "Putin said the constitution gives the prime minister great powers, including the ability to form the country's budget and oversee its defense.",
        "He said the president may be the guarantor of the constitution but that the prime minister is the country's highest executive.",
        "It's unclear how Medvedev will act once he's in office.",

        "And the danger posed by gases like hydrogen sulfite and ammonia is even more clear.",

        "At these lower levels of exposure, such as we're talking about in the rural environment, they're likely to be more subtle--subtle neurological problems, some aggravation of lung, particularly in susceptible individuals such as young children, or people with asthma."

        "But that's something that, up to now, few farmers have ever done.",

        "Hopkins isn't opposed to the testing; it's being overseen by experts at Purdue University, and is expected to provide a database that will allow producers to estimate their emissions.",
        "Hopkins is concerned about the open-ended amnesty period, which he suspects is part of a delaying action, aimed at postponing the day when livestock producers have to begin reporting on their farm's emissions.",
        "Two years from now, after these studies are done, I predict that the livestock industry will say to EPA, well, we didn't monitor enough farms.",
