        "The presidential primary season just can't wait, it seems.",
        "Today, the state of Florida broke out of the pack, the dozen or so states that are planning to vote on the same day, February 5, 2008.",
        "Under a law signed by Republican Governor Charlie Crist, Floridians will take their bite of the apple one week earlier on January 29.",
        "That is still after the Iowa and Nevada caucuses and the emphatically first in the nation primary in New Hampshire, but it is the same date as the South Carolina primary.",
        "And with New York and California voting on February 5, it makes Florida by far the biggest state with an early role in the presidential nominating process.",
        "Well, Adam Smith is political editor of the St. Petersburg Times.",
        "And Adam, I'd like you to explain something to us.",
        "Florida could actually be penalized by the national committees for jumping - for going so early.",
        "But obviously, it's very important to someone in Florida to have an early primary.",
        "Why?",
        "Why is it so important?",
        "Well, I think they want to matter.",
        "They want to have - they see themselves as the biggest swing state in the country and a diverse state that - much more diverse than Iowa or South Carolina for that matter or New Hampshire, and they want to have a lot of say in who the nominee of the respective parties is.",
        "And to do so, they're taking a risk here.",
        "What are the penalties they might face from the national party organizations?",
        "They are worse for the Democrats than they are for the Republicans.",
        "But both parties say that anyone who busts the window and goes before February 5 without permission lose half the delegates they will send to the national convention.",
        "And then worse for the Democrats, the rule is any candidate who campaigns in a violating state, like Florida now is, will receive no delegates.",
        "Any candidate who campaigns in Florida would receive no delegates?"

        "Now, the rules haven't gone into effect yet because Florida - the Democratic Party in Florida hasn't decreed how they're going to deal with this yet.",
        "But for instance, Hillary Clinton is in Miami today, so if she continues to campaign and this rule continues to hold, she would get no delegates out of Florida.",
        "Do we know whether advertising on a television station in Miami or Orlando qualifies as campaigning in Florida?",
        "That definitely qualifies as campaigning, and even more ominous, because Florida is, sort of, a cash machine for presidential candidates, fundraising qualifies as campaigning in the state.",
        "Well, obviously Governor Crist and the legislators in Florida understood that there would be some push back from the national party organizations.",
        "And yet even so, they - do they think that they can cut some deal in the end with the national parties?",
        "Well, I think the Republican position is - we are still in Florida, too important to the general election to be snubbed in the end.",
        "And also, if we lose delegates to the national convention, so what?",
        "So fewer people will wear funny hats?",
        "But the national convention's really nothing but a big, big party, and so it's more important to have a real say and have a lot of influence in the nominating process than it is to go to a party.",
        "Yeah, it would seem that the Floridians who say that the delegate count doesn't matter - what they're really saying is, it actually will matter the next week when people in other big states might be influenced what they in Florida did in what would then be reduced to a beauty pageant.",
        "Right.",
        "So one of the options that's very seriously being discussed by the Democrats is to essentially not count January 29th.",
        "There would be an election that day.",
        "It would be - the Republicans would be campaigning very hard, and it would be up to the Democrats on how hard they campaign, but it really wouldn't count.",
        "And then at some later date, in maybe later in February or March or even later, there would be Florida caucuses or even a convention that would award the actual delegates to go to the convention.",
        "But when you said don't count the vote, are you actually referring -and we're thinking of Florida right now - to the actual process of counting the ballots, not doing that on the 29th?",
        "Well, it's a great irony, in a state that people talk about - where Democrats spent a lot of time talking about disenfranchised voters.",
        "There really could be a January 29th election where any Democrat that goes and casts their ballot for Dennis Kucinich or Bill Richardson or whoever - it really won't matter because, you know, what's at stake, ultimately, in these primary caucuses are delegates, and in that case, because of these DNC rules, the decision would be made that January 29th did not matter for delegates."

        "In fact, I can be sure of that because I started writing this book in 1996, and Iraq was not - certainly an invasion of Iraq was not on the screen at that time.",
        "But I know a lot of people are going to wonder whether something about our history and our nature ultimately finds us in a place like Iraq.",
        "And, well, you wrote a piece that was published in The New Republic called Cowboy Nation and said these days we're having a national debate over the direction of foreign policy beyond the obvious difficulties in Iraq and Afghanistan, a broader sense that our nation has gone astray; that we should go back to the traditions of American foreign policy, and those traditions are what you examine in this book.",
        "That's right.",
        "I wanted to try to understand what the essential character is of American foreign policy insofar as you can possibly do that.",
        "But the thing that is clearest to me is that while I think most Americans do like to have an image of ourselves as pretty much minding our own business until somebody does something which requires us to go out and act in the world, that that's really a myth.",
        "It's sort of almost a self-constructed myth.",
        "And that if you really look at American history from even before the time of the Revolution, it's really about 400 years of territorial and commercial expansion, and then the expansion of American diplomatic influence, political influence and ideological influence.",
        "And that is the most consistent factor in American history.",
        "Yet I'm sure the first thing that will pop into many listeners' minds is George Washington's oft-quoted advice to avoid foreign entanglements.",
        "This of course a nation that threw off the shackles of European colonialism and then retreated behind the two oceans.",
        "Right, and that's - again, that's the classic American view.",
        "And, you know, if you look a little bit more closely at Washington's farewell address, it's clear that what he's really saying is we need to be careful while we are weak because the day will come, if we're smart, when we can - and this is a quote from his address - we can bid defiance to any power on earth.",
        "And Washington's expectation, as he argued in other writings, was that within a couple of decades, the United States would become a very great and strong power and able to deal with other powers on an equal basis.",
        "Yet Washington's primary interest was looking West, was it not?",
        "Well, that's right, and that's the other half of the myth.",
        "Which is that when you talk about putting up walls around ourselves, if you were a Native American, if you were a Spaniard on the North American continent or if you were French or Russian or British, you didn't see an America that was putting up walls.",
        "You saw an America that was relentlessly expanding across the West, sometimes by violent means, sometimes by merely the threat of violence, sometimes merely by commercial penetration.",
        "But it was a pretty dramatic scene to watch the young United States push off one empire after another from the North American continent.",
        "And indeed that's where you get the title of your book, Dangerous Nation.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "The title, which I understand is a provocative title, but I pulled it from a letter that John Quincy Adams wrote to his father.",
        "John Quincy Adams was serving as the ambassador to the United Kingdom in 1817.",
        "And he reported to his father, John Adams, that all the governments of Europe regarded the United States as likely to become a very dangerous member of the society of nations and that all of Europe was fervently hoping that the United States would break apart and not fulfill what they regarded as this very dangerous destiny."

        "And I think that it would come as such a surprise to most Americans that in 1817 that Europe should regard the United States as a dangerous nation.",
        "But it was based on a record of territorial expansion and in some cases territorial aggression, as well - and from Adams, this was even more important - as well as America's dangerous revolutionary ideology, which the monarchs of Europe - and Europe was all monarchies in those days - believed ultimately threatened their continued rule.",
        "The United States, though, didn't seem to be interested in spreading that revolutionary ideology, certainly not in the early years of the republic.",
        "Well, I don't think that that's actually true.",
        "I think it is remarkable how much the United States did want to see those principles spread.",
        "For instance in Latin America, the United States was very supportive of the revolutions against the Spanish colonial empire.",

        "And in the French Revolution itself, Americans were incredibly enthusiastic.",
        "They didn't have the power to send forces on behalf of these causes, but they fervently wished and tried to support them as best they could.",
        "And we think of most history books in this country teach the War of 1812 as, well, a response to British impressment, unfair impressment of American sailors; seen very differently in Canada.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Seen very differently in Canada, where the United States tried, and not for the first or last time, to seize Canada from Britain.",

        "And I wonder if Mr. Kagan has - if that is his experience also.",
        "Well, I - first of all, thank you very much, and that is certainly what I've tried to do.",
        "You know, the interesting thing is if you wanted to say what kind of history my book is closest to, and some people will think this is ironic, is it's really closest to some of what are called the left revisionists - Walter LeFeber or William Appleman Williams - who talked about this tendency in America.",
        "The difference between my view and theirs is that they were very much - saw this as based on economic determinism, this was really the capitalist system.",
        "Whereas I focus much more on ideology, which includes capitalism but also goes beyond that.",
        "And what I particularly think is important, and I've tried to do in my book, is not only to see the United States from our own point of view, but to see the United States from the point of view of others who had to deal with us in that period.",
