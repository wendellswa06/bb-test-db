        "No, I know and I don't want to suggest - and I don't suggest in my book - that there hasn't been a constant argument throughout our history over what kind of country we should be both at home and in the world.",
        "That argument goes back to before the ratification of the Constitution.",
        "There's another famous quote by Patrick Henry, who was denouncing the authors of the Constitution - and now we're talking about James Madison and others - for trying to create an empire instead of worrying about liberty, which he says was the primary goal of the United States.",
        "And so there's always been a tension and a concern that a big foreign policy would lead to a big federal government which would impinge on our rights at home, and there has been a long argument.",
        "John Quincy Adams is a wonderful embodiment of both halves of that argument because he made that speech in 1821.",
        "In that same speech, he said he spoke directly to the peoples of Europe and he praised the American Revolution, and he said to the peoples of Europe, go thou and do likewise, which means overthrow your tyrannical leaders.",
        "And this sent - today we only talk about the monsters line, but in those days the Europeans were outraged that Adams would call for the overthrow of their governments.",
        "And equally outraged at the Monroe Doctrine.",
        "Oh, absolutely.",
        "And, again, I think that we tend to - at least in the old days, the history textbooks said the Monroe Doctrine was about hands-off...",
        "America for the Americas.",
        "...America for the Americas.",
        "For the Europeans, and for the people in the Americas, by the way, this was a kind of breathtaking assertion of American prerogative.",
        "Where did the United States come off claiming the entire hemisphere was essentially its preserve?",
        "And the other thing that we forget about the Monroe Doctrine was how ideological it was.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "It really was about the reason Europeans shouldn't be here is because they have evil governments, and that was really the key for Monroe himself, and he was very passionate on that subject.",
        "Interestingly, you write about this America idea of hegemony.",
        "First, in relation to the Indian nations that were around the United States, that the United States was not interested in being one of many.",
        "It was interested in being number one; and indeed number one in the hemisphere and indeed, if you extend it, number one in the world."

        "Well, it has been - I mean, again, if you - there's just an ongoing pattern of American behavior.",
        "The founders initially viewed the entire North American continent as - again, quoting John Quincy Adams - destined by the finger of God to be America's domain.",
        "Now this was at a time when they were occupying just a sliver of territory on the East Coast, and yet they already foresaw dominating this entire continent.",
        "At the same time, they also foresaw the United States being the leading power in the Western Hemisphere.",
        "Alexander Hamilton said the United States had to become the arbiter of the New World in dealing with the Old, an incredible arrogation of power to ourselves before anybody was willing to concede that power.",

        "And what better spot to take it all in than up on the ship's bridge with the captain and crew?",

        "For instance, the United States government would negotiate in very great earnestness treaties with the Indian tribes that they fully intended to keep, at least in many cases.",
        "And what would happen would be settlers on the frontier would move into Indian lands, but those settlers were voters.",
        "And so at the end of the day, the U.S.",

        "That was very much a product of individuals and people, not wicked American leaders.",

        "And I don't think that that original city-state in that republic set out to become a conquering empire but as far as I, you know, have studied.",
        "They just sort of by default ended up controlling the known world, you know, and they did become a citizenship-based army.",

        "The thing about the United States that I think it's important to add to the mix is that unlike the Romans and unlike the British, and unlike the Athenians even, the United States has such a strong view about individual rights and self-determination that even when we act like an empire, we feel troubled by the idea of being an empire.",
        "Because we want to do what we want to do, we think we have good reasons for it, but when it entails denying other people their right to self-determination we're troubled by it.",
        "Now sometimes we're troubled to the point that we don't do it.",
        "Sometimes we're troubled to the point that we don't do it effectively.",
