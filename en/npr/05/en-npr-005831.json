        "There is in the late years after the end of the Civil War, while there's Reconstruction -which you describe is our first experience with nation building, an interesting comparison, but nevertheless - after that there is a period in which the United States Navy virtually disappears.",
        "There is then a period of enormous prosperity and peace.",
        "And yet in this time where virtually no threat exists to the United States, the United States builds up a navy in peacetime.",
        "I think that's an incredibly instructive moment in American history, because it's often not portrayed this way.",
        "But if you go back and look at the history, it's exactly what you said.",
        "After the Civil War, the American Navy was essentially dismantled because it had gotten huge; the Northern navy we're really talking about to fight the South.",
        "Reconstruction was very expensive, people didn't want to spend that money and it was very divisive.",
        "As soon as Reconstruction ends really - and now we're talking about the late 1870s - in a matter of a couple of years, the United States in a time of peace with no serious external threats, no need for more resources in particular, a huge territory to still settle, begins the building of a peacetime navy, which eventually grows strong enough that we feel confident that if we go to war with Spain in 1898, we'll win.",
        "If we hadn't built that navy in the 1880's, I doubt very much that we would have gone to war with Spain in 1898.",
        "And why did we build that navy?",
        "You know, then we're really talking about not a navy built for defensive purposes but a navy built to pursue ambitions, to realize potential.",
        "The United States wanted to have dominant influence in the Western hemisphere, but you couldn't have dominant influence in the Western hemisphere if the Chilean Navy is bigger than the American Navy, which it was in 1881.",
        "And so they felt they needed a bigger Navy than Chile's.",
        "We had interest in East Asia and aspirations in East Asia that we wanted to fulfill.",
        "So it was about ambition, idealistic ambition, materialistic ambition, but ambition."

        "When you look at the breadth and the depth of the middle class in this country, what kind of influence do you think in the last 200 years that that's had on all of the sort of political and military and expansive - I mean I really do believe that all this stuff comes from the middle class angst needing more consuming - being their own little military, you know, little nation state within their home.",

        "This is also Adam Smith's teaching.",
        "Americans - one of the founders, Gouverneur Morris, described Americans as the first-born children of the commercial age.",
        "Because when American was founded, the ideas of Adam Smith, the ideas of John Locke were dominant.",
        "And American was founded on the ethos that individuals should go out and prosper and acquire.",
        "And Americans have been trying to acquire ever since, and this does affect American foreign policy.",
