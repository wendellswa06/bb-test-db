        "These areas have been exposed to regular air strikes by Assad and his ally, Russia.",
        "And you have to wonder - I mean, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian president, he was actually quoted on Russian television saying that identifying which city comes next depends on which city contains the largest number of terrorists.",
        "I guess I wonder what he means by comes next, and is it possible that, you know, these civilians will be taken to a place that, you know, the government might just start bombarding more?",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "This has been the strategy over the past year or so where areas that are retaken by the government often in which extreme force and siege tactics are used, those rebels and regular people who refuse to go on to - go over to the regime side, they take deals where they evacuate mainly to Idlib.",
        "And Idlib is dominated by some very hard-line rebel factions.",
