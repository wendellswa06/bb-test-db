        "First, tell me how you compiled this data.",

        "How did you crunch them?",
        "Yes, as a matter of fact, the numbers come from the U.S.",

        "You have to dig around in an obscure corner of their Web site.",
        "You have to download a bunch of spreadsheets and kind of build your own spreadsheet from the raw numbers.",
        "But once I did that and following a methodology that professional sociologists used to look at these numbers - by the way, I didn't make it up - that's when I was able to draw these conclusions.",
        "So the numbers are there, but they're not easy to find and they're certainly not easy to understand.",
        "And some of the conclusions are staggering.",
        "I mean, even when black students make up just a tiny fraction of the school's total population, they can make up many times more suspensions and expulsions.",
        "Exactly.",
        "What you find on a nationwide basis, averaging across the whole country, that black students are suspended and expelled at nearly three times the rate that white students are.",
        "And they are suspended and expelled at more than twice the rate of their proportion of the population.",
        "Is this for equal offenses that they're getting such disproportionate discipline?",
        "Yes, that's precisely what is looked at by the researchers when they look at this data.",
        "They're finding that black students and white students who commit similar offenses, be it talking out of school, tardy, you know, whatever the category offenses, the blacks are consistently disciplined more severely than the whites.",
        "Let's talk real states.",
        "Which one's the worst here?",
        "What I found is that some of the worst states are the states with the least diverse populations.",
        "That is not surprising when you understand what professional sociologists think it lies behind part of this problem, and that is the cultural disconnect between white teachers and minority students.",
        "The vast majority of teachers in this country - I think, it's something more than 85 percent are white.",
        "And what researchers have found consistently is that white teachers will interpret behavior of black students different than behavior from white students.",
        "So for instance, young black males who might have a way of questioning a teacher or speaking out that is kind of perhaps more assertive than a white student, that black student questioning the teacher might be viewed as disrupting the class."

        "I mean, and then there are always things that are difficult to untangle.",
        "Yes, it's an excellent question and, in fact, this is a very complex problem.",
        "That is why it has persisted for more than 25 years.",
        "One of the factors certainly is socioeconomic differences, but the researchers have found that when they control for socioeconomic status and their statistical models, there is still a substantial portion of this discipline that cannot be explained by socioeconomic factors.",
