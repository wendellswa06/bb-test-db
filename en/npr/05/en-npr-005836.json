        "Boisvert says the survey found an average of just two blankets per tent, a woeful shortfall given the size of the families involved.",

        "It's also causing social problems.",
        "It's a culture that normally separates men and women as much as possible, and it separates families from other families.",

        "Many of those on higher ground were expected to come down to lower-lying areas as the winter approached, but they've proved reluctant to leave their land and livestock.",
        "Farhana Faruqi Stocker of Oxfam says so far there's been no big migration down from the hills.",
        "Many, many people now seem to have made the decision of not coming down, which basically means that we would have to ensure--the assistance community and the government have to ensure a regular supply line of food and other provisions over the winter months, without which survival for many, many families and communities would become a difficult challenge.",
        "Fears that large numbers of lives would be lost to cold or disease haven't so far materialized, partly, say aid agency workers, because recently the weather's been kind.",
        "But Stocker says the risk is still there.",
        "Based on what we know now, it is quite apparent that if in the next three and in some places six weeks we do not step up, very seriously scale up the assistance which is required for people in ...(unintelligible), the risks to their lives are very serious, especially to children, to lactating mothers and to old people.",

        "So my comments were not directed at Mr. Bolton, per se, whom I hardly know, but at the general problem.",
        "Well, to what degree do you hold him accountable for that in this past administration?",
        "Well, my exposure was rather limited.",
