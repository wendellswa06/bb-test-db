        "And another bulimic girl, she said, I would like to go to a normal restaurant.",
        "Some are really afraid of being observed or stigmatized.",
        "There are no signs, and nothing on the menu, that suggests Sehnsucht is aimed at people with eating disorders.",
        "That's partly because the intent is to make food normal, and partly because business success will depend on eating customers.",

        "Yeah, and you know, it's actually become more and more volatile each year during the decade so that the new normal, so to speak, is a hyperactive market, and I suspect that that'll continue through 2009; maybe not to the great extent of 2008, where you had $115 separating the lows and the highs, but a lot of wild days, 10- and 12-percent changes in the price of crude oil on any given day.",

        "In Chicago, you may have huge groups, but there's infighting among those groups now.",
        "So you have people fighting over turf, you have people fighting over reputation, you have people fighting back in retaliation, which is something we heard about in the Hadiya Pendleton case, where reportedly these reputed gang members thought that they were going after other gang members who they thought had shot, you know, one of the defendants in this case.",

        "Believe it or not, a lot of guys are gangbanging on Facebook, YouTube, and some guys are under the impression the more violent content they post in their YouTube videos, the more, you know, people will view their videos, and then it leads to rival conflict in some communities throughout Chicago."
