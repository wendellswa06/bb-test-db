        "We're speaking with Tio Hardiman, who is with Cure Violence and CeaseFire Illinois.",
        "Can you tell us a story, Tio, of a time when you feel like you've successfully stopped gun violence from happening?",
        "Without a doubt.",
        "I had a grandmother that called us about two months ago because a guy shot her front windows out trying to kill her two grandsons.",
        "So she reached out to CeaseFire and the violence interrupters, and so they gave us the name of the alleged shooter.",
        "I sent my staff over to talk to this guy.",
        "He told us that he wasn't going to listen to anybody.",
        "So he came back at 5 o'clock the next morning and burnt up the grandmother's car, trying to lure her grandsons out of the house.",
        "So then I had to put the full-court press on this guy.",
        "And I went and got some guys from the streets that didn't work for CeaseFire per se but through the CeaseFire violence interrupters to talk to this guy.",
        "And we got him to put his gun down.",
        "And it all came down to one thing.",
        "The lady's grandsons had posted a picture of this guy on Facebook, and because the guy got beat up at a lounge about a week prior to him shooting up the house.",
        "And he couldn't catch the guys who beat him up, but he knew where the grandsons lived.",
        "And he really was mad about that, and he was going to try to kill those guys.",
        "So we successfully mediated that particularly conflict, and as an end result, we've been following up on it for the last two months, and there hasn't been any more incidents with her grandsons and this particular individual.",
        "Holy cow.",
        "So that's just one of the success stories out of 700-some conflicts we mediated in the year 2012.",
        "And our question for listeners is if you are involved in this effort in your community to reduce violence there, any violence, what have you tried?",
        "Right now on the line with us from New Haven, Connecticut, is Hashim(ph), I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly.",
        "Hashim, you started a radio station online for kids.",
        "How - why did you think that would work?",
        "I actually took an experience from when I was younger in school.",
        "I felt like I wasn't being challenged and would sort of just goof around and get into trouble.",
        "And at the time we had Yale Broadcasting, WYBC, and we was able to - I was able to become a volunteer, and the disc jockeys there really became mentors to me.",
        "So we started a program in New Haven, which a couple years ago was just the fourth dangerous city.",
        "Gun violence here was getting out of hand.",
        "And I just felt like the community should step up along with law enforcement, along with the education department.",
        "And it's turned out to work well.",
        "It started as an after-school program, and now it's part of the in-school and after-school curriculum.",
        "But what it does is it gives kids an opportunity to learn and do it under a guise of being cool.",
        "We have partnered with Horizon Music Group and Elm City Records; they get a chance to go into the recording studio, do their rap stuff.",
        "But the - I guess the catch to it is they have to take either journalism or the computer technology courses.",
        "We teach them audio production in the school.",
        "And it just takes their time.",
        "And that time that they get a chance to spend in school, learning something which is considered cool even by their friends, keeps them off the blocks, and it keeps them out of moments where something may happen and, you know..."

        "On Friday, President Obama spoke to an audience gathered in the Hyde Park Academy High School gym in the same Chicago neighborhood where he and his wife and daughters once lived.",
        "And while he was there, he called for common-sense proposals to make it harder for criminals to get guns, and he also focused a bit on the social climate where violence like Chicago's takes root.",
        "And so that means that this is not just a gun issue, it's also an issue of the kinds of communities that we're building.",
        "And for that we all share responsibility as citizens to fix it.",
        "So if you are involved, like the president says there, as a citizen trying to fix it, to reduce violence in your community, we want to hear your story.",

        "Yeah, it seems to me that President Obama was really suggesting a blend of policies at three distinct levels.",
        "First, as you noted, a focus on law, particularly gun laws.",
        "Secondly, I heard him speak about the need to support children, especially early childhood intervention.",
        "A child that drops out is going to be an adolescent who has a greater risk of being involved in crime and violence and many other negative outcomes.",
        "Well, you know, Ron, there are other speakers tonight.",
        "The keynote, in fact, is from former Virginia Governor Mark Warner.",
        "Another speaker of note is Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, a key Clinton supporter.",
        "Which raises the question, is tonight the night that we finally see party unity really take place?",
        "And thirdly, focus on communities, really community-level supports.",
        "What we know, in Chicago but also in many other cities, is that violence, along with many other social ills such as low birth weight, infant mortality, early dropout from school, truancy and so forth, these tend to be concentrated in specific places.",
        "Violence, especially, is highly uneven.",
        "As Cheryl noted earlier, it's not the fact that violence is somehow going up everywhere.",
        "In fact, violence is, overall, declining.",
        "What we're seeing, however, is that certain communities almost get locked into a vicious cycle, where it's very difficult to get out, and the factors related to that, among others, are high concentration of poverty related to racial segregation.",
        "Let me ask you about that, Robert, because I wonder if this is a chicken and the egg thing, maybe you can't even answer it, but what comes first?",
        "Is it the poverty and the unemployment, or is it the gun violence?",
        "Because gun violence, when gun violence goes up, that results in people leaving a community, businesses leaving a community.",
        "So which of these things happens first?",
        "That's an excellent question.",
        "That's one of the things that we've looked at in research.",
        "It's really hard to disentangle, actually, and that's why I referred to it as kind of a vicious cycle and a trap, really, that communities get into.",
        "We think happens is that both are important.",
        "It's hard to say it's just this.",
        "So you get a cycle whereby you have high concentration of poverty and especially when it is related to particular groups.",
        "So for example in the United States, it's the case that African-Americans are disproportionately poor.",
        "But even if poor, they're much more likely than, let's say, a poor white to live in a poor neighborhood.",
        "And that's what we refer to as a concentration effect.",
        "That then leads to all sorts of other conditions.",
        "Businesses are less likely to invest.",
        "People may be fearful of the violence and as you note move out, which then may make things worse.",
        "So what we try to think about is how to intervene in that social system.",
        "But we do think, based on good evidence, that the characteristics of the communities do seem to have an independent effect.",
        "And likewise, fear among residents is a really important factor in - by the way, not just for moving out of a community, but fear is implicated in anxiety and other kinds of health-related issues.",
        "Yeah, sure.",
        "And we want to take a call here now from Keith(ph) in Philadelphia.",
        "And Keith, meet Tio, you guys both work with CeaseFire, only Keith works with CeaseFire in Philadelphia.",

        "Well, we're trying - we're working on, along with CeaseFire of Philadelphia, we're a community group, like I'm a committeeman, and the other guy named Angelo(ph), he's a community activist.",
        "And we've been - first we started standing on 32nd and York, that's a street in Philadelphia, a major district which has a lot of violence, a couple of people they've gotten killed on that corner.",
        "And what we do, we stand out there with CeaseFire signs, and also we wrote signs that says, on the poster we wrote, talk it out, don't shoot it out.",
        "You know, and then we, you know, we kind of collaborated, and we decided to do some marches.",
        "And we've accumulated maybe about 20 to 30 people in these marches and also people are joining us daily.",
        "And what we do, we walk around the neighborhood, and we walk on small streets where there's a lot of drug activity that's not a lot of - it's fine in some of the blocks, but it's not a lot of enforcement, I would say, not that it's anything against the police.",
        "It's just that, like, the blocks is just a lot of drug activity, and it causes the overspill of gun violence.",
        "No, that makes sense.",
        "Thank you very much, that's a phone call from Keith in Philadelphia.",
        "They're kind of trying to fill in for the policemen walking the beat.",
        "You know, and I wonder, Cheryl, you know, one of the issues that many people, officials especially, have talked about in Chicago is even though they have a lot of gun regulations, most of the - many of the guns involved in crime in the city of Chicago come from the suburbs, implying that one would need to have federal regulations to have any kind of effect.",
        "What have you heard on that note?",
        "Well absolutely not only from the suburbs but from states surrounding Chicago.",
        "They particularly point to Indiana, where the gun laws are a little different than they are in Illinois, and also for the city of Chicago.",
        "So I think that that's why the mayor and the police superintendent do indeed back the idea of federal gun laws and strengthening gun laws.",
        "Part of the problem in Chicago, as you're alluding to, is the city does have very strict gun regulations.",
        "But a lot of the guns that come in and are used in a lot of these crimes, according to the police, are illegal guns that come from elsewhere.",
        "Tio Hardiman, you're with CeaseFire.",
        "I wonder if you think gun regulation is at least part of the solution.",
        "No, my thing is this here: You know, everybody has a role to play, but a lot of these young people in Chicago have grown up in a culture of violence in their neighborhoods.",
        "And it's about changing the way they think in a lot of ways.",
        "Like currently, we're working with 1,100 high-risk individuals throughout Chicago right now.",
        "And we're - we enrolled about 35 percent of the young men back into school.",
        "The other 30 percent, they're working now, and the remaining percentage of individuals, we're spending a lot of quality time with them to teach them they can unlearn violent behavior because it's passed down from generation to generation.",
        "I was on CNN the other day, and I made a comment.",
        "I said, you know, I grew up Henry Horner Projects on the west side of Chicago, a building of 3,000 people.",
        "And if I was mad at you, 40 percent of the people in the building would be mad at you, as well, because I've kind of transmitted the way I think in the minds of the other people there."

        "So they were looking at things like education and employment and things like that that, that they wanted to hear some kind of plan from the president to address that.",
        "Well, let me bring that back to you, Robert Sampson, then.",
        "You're a professor of social sciences.",
        "This is something you've studied.",
        "And we're trying to talk about programs that actually work.",

        "Does community involvement?",
        "Does something like the caller who's walking around their neighborhood, does that work?",
        "Yeah, those are good questions.",
        "Let me address a couple ways.",
        "First of all, I think the issue of the expectations that kids have and the attitudes, as was just mentioned, is crucially important.",
        "If you don't expect to live to age 25, if you don't expect to have a job when you're an adult, then an insult today takes on a greater significance than it might otherwise.",
        "And that's why I think that the - a sense in which much of the violence is rooted in insults and revenge.",
        "I mean, these are classic motives.",
        "And even with strict gun laws, that can be a problem.",
        "So we do need a multifaceted approach.",
        "I think, on two fronts, the evidence on early intervention is mixed, but there are encouraging signs.",
        "And there's evidence, interestingly enough, that early childhood intervention with respect to education - so, for example, Perry Preschool Project - although the evidence on how it affects test scores is mixed, it turns out that kids do better in non-cognitive outcomes, sort of behavioral outcomes.",
        "In other words, do better in later life.",
        "So that's evidence to suggest that the more holistic approaches, we don't just care about test scores.",
        "We care about kids' development in the broadest sense.",
        "So, yes, I think there's encouraging evidence there, and that's why I pointed to that second prong of President Obama's approach.",
        "The third one on community level interventions, evidence is also mixed, but I would say a couple of things.",
        "One, the evidence on policing now, I think, is zeroing in on the idea that certain policies - particularly what's known as hotspot policing, where you're targeting the policing in particular areas, and we have better data now, predictive analytics and other things where we can identify those areas - is promising.",
        "And that is also something that can be done without necessarily locking up more people."
