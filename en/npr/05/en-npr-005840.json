        "Yeah.",
        "At the non-criminal justice level, the evidence suggests that there is a strong relationship between community-level social characteristics that go beyond race and poverty - that is to say, not all poor neighborhoods are the same - the social networks and organizational ties that exist in communities, and particularly the shared expectations that residents have for getting involved.",
        "In our Chicago research, we show that that's directly related to lower violence - so programs that encourage both the community-level aspects and better criminal justice, particularly with regard to policing, I think have promise.",
        "Of course, we also need to focus on the resources, such as housing, reduction of the concentration of poverty.",
        "And there's kind of a debate in the field as to whether it's best to go with more so-called person-based interventions - such as giving people vouchers to move out of a high-poverty neighborhood - or place-based interventions.",
        "I think it's somewhat misleading to see it as either-or.",
        "Both are needed.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "Let's go to a call now, here.",
        "This is Amy in Oakland, California.",
        "Oakland has long been known as a relatively violent city.",
        "Amy, what do you do?",
        "What do you find that works in your community?",
        "Hi.",
        "Right now, I'm working with a young man who has written a one-man show that's called \"\"Cops and Robbers,\"\" and it's a very compelling show, partly because of who he is, the young man, whose name is Jinho Ferreira.",
        "He worked for many years as a rapper, a successful rapper with a hip-hop group called Flipsyde that did music that he was hoping would change the escalation of violence in his community.",
        "When he found that wasn't working, he decided to go into law enforcement.",
        "So he's now working in law enforcement, and he's written an amazing - it's a full-length play, it's not a monologue - with 15 characters that tells the story of a police officer who kills a young black man in the community.",
        "And then we hear from the characters of the people who live in the community, law enforcement, a number of different media characters.",
        "And what's been so exciting is as we have performed this play at different places within the community - once at a theater at the very intersection where the journalist Chauncey Bailey was killed - our audiences are made up of law enforcement, educators, psychologists, social workers and a lot of youth, some youths who are involved in good programs, some youths who are still involved in the life, you know.",
        "And what's so exciting is the discussions that happen after the play, and how these lengthy discussions get people who would consider each other adversaries talking to each other and understanding what's going on in the community from each other's point of view, and talking about how exciting it is to finally have an opening where they can understand each other and talk openly.",
        "That's - thank you very much, Amy.",
        "That's Amy in Oakland, California.",
        "And this kind of approach is something that people like Tio Hardiman use in CeaseFire.",
        "But I wonder, Robert, even for those people who are not victims or perpetrators of gun violence, I read an amazing statistic where it said 20 to 30 percent of kids in Chicago have witnessed a shooting firsthand.",
        "What kind of effect does it have on a generation?",
        "What's the difference in outcomes between a kid who witnesses real-live violence and the kid who doesn't?",
        "That's a huge problem.",
        "In fact, I think the figure may be even higher, according to some studies.",
        "Our research and that of others shows that exposure to violence in childhood is related to a number of later outcomes, including increased involvement in violence itself.",
        "That's often been referred to as the cycle of violence.",
        "It's also related to lower abilities, really, I mean, in terms of schooling and learning, so that kids that are exposed to violence, that are fearful, they tend to skip more school.",
        "There's a recent study that even showed that having a homicide occur in your house was related to a drop in test scores if taken within days of that homicide.",
        "So the evidence has coalesced around the notion that this is a really serious problem.",
        "And, again, even if you are not directly a victim, living in an environment where you are afraid to walk outside, where you hear about what's going on, that then reinforces a lot of the negative behaviors and outcomes - mistrust, in particular."

        "Some of these communities, I think, what we see is such high levels of cynicism and distrust that it feeds a sense in which institutions are not working, which then causes people to pull back even more.",
        "So that's why I think we really need a multifaceted approach to reestablish the validity of key social institutions.",
        "And I would include in that the police.",
        "It's interesting to hear some of the different strategies in terms of engaging the police with the community, rather than the residents viewing the police as sort of an alien invading force.",
        "So I guess - we're going to have to end the conversation there.",
        "I guess there's no definitive answer on what works and what doesn't.",

        "But I think that a lot of people that I spoke to after seemed really cognizant of what the perceptions of Michelle Obama are, and what her speech attempted to do to combat those.",
        "So I heard people say things like, I was really glad she talked more about the family, I was really glad she made jokes, I was really glad that she tried to show people that they're like us.",
        "Or another big thing was people saying I was glad that, you know, she is patriotic, and that she is showing that.",
