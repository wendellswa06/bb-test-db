        "If they are prepared to actually transfer the enormous emotional attachment they have to their candidate to this party unity drive - big question mark if they are - then we'll see this convention come together and be what the Obama people have been hoping it would be.",

        "One of the things that I found interesting in watching last night, and I'd like to get both of you to respond to it, is the fact that at this particular convention, the Republican presence is perhaps more than it's been in the past.",
        "And it seems as if the old rules of staying mum while the other, your opponent is putting his or her convention together is no longer the case.",
        "Could you tell whether or not that dynamic is having any impact at the convention?",
        "Did you even notice it at all?",
        "Not so much, not so much I would say at the convention, Tony, but I do think it's having an impact in the media in general.",
        "If you watch a lot of the cables, if you're out on the blogs, you're going to see almost as much about the Republican spin on this as the Democratic spin on this.",
        "And I suspect it will be the same way the other direction next week when the Republicans are having their convention.",
        "The old Marquis d'Queensbury rules by which the two parties left each other alone while they had their conventions are in the past.",
        "Is that your observation as well, Audie?",
        "Yes.",
        "Inside the convention center, where I'm spending the most of my time, it is all about the Democrats, and I'm not necessarily seeing this other chatter or conversation going on on the outside.",
        "All right, well it's certainly coming across on television in some places.",
        "Let's talk about one more thing in the time that we have left.",
        "That's the battleground states.",
        "My question is to you, Audie, and it's this, which states do you think Barack Obama is able to bring to his camp?",
        "Are there any that he is particularly targeting?",
        "And I say that because for instance last night, he was in Missouri, which is a battleground state.",
        "Yes he was, and I think the way that I've noticed it, and obviously with the primary season, there's been a lot of hints, but down on the floor of the Pepsi Center, the seating arrangements, you know, you have a state like Virginia way up front, a state that the Obama campaign has made very clear that they hope to put in play.",
        "I talked to delegates in Georgia, a state that, you know, arguably it's not decided if it really is in play, but the Obama campaign has certainly had their eye on it, and their delegates said, you know, we used to be in the nose bleed seats, because they're always going to the Republicans in the general election.",
        "And they had a much better view this time around.",
        "So, you know, when you're watching at home, keep an eye on those state signs and see what's up front and what's highlighted, because those are the visual clues as to what this campaign is focusing on.",
        "You know, the swing states from the 2004 election are pretty much in play again this time.",
        "There maybe a few that are in, that weren't and a few that aren't that were.",
        "Ron, how much of the battleground states, how many of the battleground states do you think Barack Obama thinks he has to pull in order to win?",
        "Tony, you will see lists of 18 battleground states, 12 battleground states, eight or seven.",
        "I think we're basically looking at five, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida.",
        "Now, most of those states have been Republican states in the last couple of elections, Ohio, Virginia, Florida.",
        "If Barack Obama can win two of those three, Barack Obama will be president.",
        "What about turnout?",
        "How significant is that?",
        "Because the polls have shown consistently that McCain is creeping up on, and in some cases perhaps, has passed Obama, and yet the Obama camp's argument is that they're not polling the people who are participating now for the first time in the electoral process.",
        "Ron?",
        "You know, I do think there has been a certain amount of back-and-forth about whether or not first time voters can be accurately polled.",
        "And the reason that in the past that hasn't mattered too much is because first time voters don't turn into voters.",
        "They are people who would be first time voters, and they become non-voters in November.",
        "And this year, if the primaries are any indication, we may see record turnout among under-30 and first-time voters, and they are a little tougher to poll.",
        "I don't think there's much evidence to suggest that that's really skewing the polls at this point.",
        "I think Barack Obama was opening a little bit of a lead, it's closed up a little bit again.",
        "It's pretty much a dead heat and all that's going to matter when we get to November is what has happened between the conventions and November."

        "Beginning in the first few years of this decade, an awful lot of investment money that might ordinarily be parked in sleepy mutual funds for stocks has come into oil.",

        "You could argue whether or not it's speculative, but there's no question that it makes the pendulum swing much more quickly from fair value to overvalued, or fair value to perhaps undervalued, like we are now.",

        "It's certainly not a safe investment.",
