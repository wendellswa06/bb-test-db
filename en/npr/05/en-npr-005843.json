        "So the big concern that I have, even though some conspiracy theories may be true, is that when we get caught up obsessing over that it distracts us from the work at hand that we can do to improve our own situation.",
        "Eric, what about the aspect of criticism of gangsta rap?",
        "You know there's actually now been a reply by 50 Cent who said, I don't like people who don't like me.",
        "That statement changes my perception of Alicia Keys totally.",
        "It's just not really a bright comment.",
        "Now the reality is plenty of people criticize gangsta rap.",
        "Again, is this just an issue where, you know, it's about time that some people raise these questions?",
        "Well, to a certain degree it's much ado about nothing.",
        "I think Jay hit the nail on the head.",
        "It's counter-productive, number one.",
        "And number two, there are more important issues.",
        "This is just my opinion.",
        "There are more important issues that we can be talking about as relates to black life in America than talking about conspiracies as it relates to two entertainers that ended up dead.",
        "I mean, I'm not that - you know, I find it ironic and kind of hypocritical when you have rappers talk about all these conspiracies.",
        "Or even anyone in the entertainment field.",
        "But at the same time, they continue to play the role of the pseudo gangster and make money off of spewing the type of lyrics that they spew.",
        "And Jasmyne, when you look at this.",
        "How much of a sense of internal critique should come from people in the music industry?",
        "I mean, what makes this situation difficult to talk about is that, you know, she's saying that she did not actually put these comments up and we're still waiting for more news on that.",
        "But don't entertainers have a right to be a part of a conversation about not just the future of music as an industry but also about what it does to us as a society?",
        "Shouldn't there be more entertainers who actually are part of a debate and a dialogue?",
        "I mean, I think it's good any time you can get, you know, any of the entertainers, I guess, to speak on a, quote, unquote, \"\"political issue.\"\" But I have to say, like, you know, until this story was brought to me by the producer, that we were going to talk about it, it's not something that I even cared about or even cared to blog about.",
        "Because it's just - it's not important.",
        "I mean, I find it very interesting that 50 Cent could find the wherewithal to issue a response to this considering some of the madness that's come out of his mouth.",
        "I don't think he needs to be criticizing anyone.",
        "I think I would echo the sentiments of, you know, Eric and Jay and just say that, you know, let's talk about gangsta rap.",
        "But let's talk about it in present day sense.",
        "Let's talk about what it's doing to us today and what we continue to allow it to do in our communities.",
        "You know, I do follow conspiracy theories on certain things.",
        "I do think there is something behind the whole gangsta rap phenomenon.",
        "You know, I am a west coast girl, been around for the Eazy-E and all of that, came up through all of that.",
        "But today, when I look at gangsta rap, and I look at the influence that it has had on our young adults, you know, that's - those are the discussions that I want to have on how, as entertainers, they can, you know, look at some of the words that are coming out of their mouth and how it is influencing our kids and what they are doing to our community with those words.",
        "I agree.",

        "Eric, we've got one last topic and it's a government one.",
        "So it will be good for you.",
        "The former HUD secretary, Alphonso Jackson, may be out of a cabinet job, but he's still in the news.",
        "He resigned and now he's under investigation for possibly enriching himself and friends with lucrative government contracts.",
        "Now, the New York Times says a developer friend received a 127 million dollar contract to rebuild the New Orleans housing project.",
        "That developer's company paid Jackson more than 250,000 dollars in fees."

        "So, on the one hand, you want to say this is what we're about, to ensure that everyone has an equal footing as relates to getting these types of contracts.",
        "But then because the amount of contracts to minorities goes up, someone wants to make a big deal about it.",
        "Then you start investigating people and you try and find out, OK, where's this extra money coming from that he has in his bank account?",
        "I mean, I think that's ludicrous.",

        "The whole question of government contracts is one that some folks say we should take a closer look at.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, absolutely, we should take a closer look at it.",
        "And I am glad you brought up Dick Cheney because I was about to do the same thing.",
        "I think, you know, one of the - working around so many black politicians, you know, it is a - if you are a black politician, you always have to make sure your i's are dotted and your t's are crossed.",
        "And you always have to know that you are going to be scrutinized more than anyone else is.",
        "And so I find it really hard to believe that, you know, Mr. Jackson would allow himself to be in this sort of position.",
