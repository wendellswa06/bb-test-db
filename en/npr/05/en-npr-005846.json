        "A lot of people say, if you've been diagnosed, well, there ought to be a more rigorous background check.",
        "Well, right now, we have two - we have federal laws on the book that prevent people who have a mental health diagnosis and have been committed to an institution from buying guns.",
        "Most states have similar laws.",
        "Some, for instance in Connecticut, said that no guns can be sold to anyone who'd been in a mental institution in the last 12 months or had been found guilty - not guilty by reason of insanity.",
        "But the fact remains that it's easier to get an assault rifle today in the United States than it is to get decent mental health care, and that is the real stem of the problem.",
        "We are failing people with mental illness because we do not provide treatment.",
        "And you have to have these two arguments together.",

        "145,000 people who live in Connecticut who have mental illnesses, only half of them are - get treatment.",
        "I was in Dubuque, Iowa.",

        "I mean, we are in a crisis in this country when it comes to delivering treatment.",
        "This email from Emily: I agree we need to be talking about mental health.",
        "I think we need to talk about the negative stigma of mental health.",
        "I think there's an issue with access to services.",
        "But if we can create a culture where people feel comfortable seeking help and can let people understand that having a mental illness is the same as having cancer, more people will seek help.",
        "And we can do more to prevent this.",
        "How can we help if we're unaware because people are afraid to seek help?",
        "I understand what her analogy is about cancer.",
        "Obviously, there's an important distinction.",
        "Right.",
        "And the thing that also has been left out of this conversation is that most people who have a mental health diagnosis - if they get proper treatment, if they get proper services, they recover.",

        "He was Tasered by the police.",
        "He had four major breakdowns.",
        "But for the last six years, he has been stable, and he is now working in the mental health field.",
        "People do get better, but you have to give them services and treatment, and that's what we're slashing.",

        "But a lot of these folks, it's their first break.",
        "It's the first time they really interacted, and there may be a lot of reasons for that.",
        "One being that parents' hands are tied when you - like mine were when you have a child who's having that first break with reality.",
        "You have to wait until they're a danger to themselves or others, and that - and it sets up that person for failure in many ways."
