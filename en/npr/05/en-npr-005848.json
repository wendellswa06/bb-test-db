        "What I fear is that in New York and other cities is that we're so accustomed, after several years of low crime rate, that we'll forget these lessons that we learned the hard way in the 1980s when a lot of cities - look, I used to live in Washington.",
        "So I live in Washington.",
        "I live in New York.",

        "Right.",
        "I mean, across the board, there have been budget cuts so - but I mean, it's - it takes determination and you - as I said, you've got, you know, you got to use common sense.",
        "You've got to say - and what bothers me is people who forget what it was once like in major American cities.",
        "And also, look upon this a racist policy because the majority of people who are stopped and frisked are either one race or one ethnic group, forgetting, of course, that's where the majority of victims are and also the majority of perpetrators.",
        "So you just can't - you can't judge it by one set of statistics, which is these are the people who are being stopped.",
        "You have to look at why they're being stopped, and does the stop make any sense?",
        "Is it rational or not rational?",

        "And if this is proving a result and people are using good judgment and common sense in that reasonable suspicion, and the result's good, it's not even a question to me.",
        "And you're not troubled by not just one in area, but citywide in New York City, that the number of those stopped is wildly out of proportion for the population at large, that the percentages for those who are African-American and Hispanic is hugely greater than their percentage in the population?",
        "Right.",
        "But the...",
        "So if you look at the city overall - I mean, I know from being a policeman in the past that when you look at an area, if the area was highly one group, whether it was white, black, Asian, whatever, you're going to see the numbers in that area for the stops are highly towards that area."
