        "What the problem seems to be is that the Trump administration - at least Trump has used human rights not as something we need to work on but as a stick to beat the North Koreans until they come around to talking about nuclear weapons.",
        "He was very careful to mention human rights in his United Nations speech in the fall of 2017.",
        "He mentioned it in 2018 in his State of the Union address.",

        "It may have been raised.",
        "The North Koreans certainly didn't engage on the issue.",
        "And there was nothing mentioned by the North Koreans about human rights in their take on the summit, which suggests - wasn't an issue for them.",
        "Well, what do you think a reasonable expectation is?",
        "What is achievable?",
        "Well, the first thing is raising the issue.",
        "I don't think we start with the worst problem, the most sensitive issues.",
        "But there are things that we ought to do in terms of encouraging the flow of information, for example.",
        "North Koreans are extremely limited in terms of their access to information about what is going on, both in their own country and outside.",
