        "For instance, people who were healthy in middle age but had negative views of aging were more likely to have later developed the brain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease.",
        "And what inspired Levy to investigate these connections was the time she spent in Japan as a grad student, noticing that people there live longer than they did in the United States and that they were treated better and revered by their society.",
