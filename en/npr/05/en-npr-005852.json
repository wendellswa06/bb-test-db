        "The bones that you and I have in our bodies are not technically the same ones that we had a decade ago.",
        "Our bodies are constantly in the process of remaking bones through a process that scientists call resorption, where bits of bone dissolve, and then formation, where new bone is rebuilt.",
        "Researcher Urszula Iwaniec of Oregon State University says this process is healthy, but by the time women reach the age of 50 or so, it can get out of whack.",
        "With menopause, that rate of replacement, that rate of turnover, is elevated.",
        "And so the formation does not keep up with the resorption, and as a result bone loss occurs, resulting in osteoporosis.",
        "Iwaniec and her colleagues wanted to know how moderate alcohol consumption might influence this process.",
        "They had a hunch there could be a benefit since the few large studies have shown correlations between women who consume about a drink a day and better bone health.",
        "So, they recruited about 40 women in their 50s and early 60s - mostly wine drinkers - and tested what happened when they stopped drinking.",
        "So, these women were asked to continue their normal daily activities for the two weeks.",
        "The only thing that they were asked to do was to abstain from alcohol intake.",
        "To gauge what was happening in their bones, researchers took blood samples to measure specific byproducts of bone remodeling.",
        "Basically, when bone dissolves, little bits of protein that were part of the bone spill into the bloodstream.",
        "And these correlate with the amount of bone that is resorbed.",
        "Or being lost.",
        "Iwaniec says after only two weeks of abstaining from alcohol, the women's blood markers changed quite a bit.",
        "What we would found was that the markers were higher, significantly higher than while they were drinking, indicating that more bone was being resorbed.",
        "Meaning more bone was likely being lost.",
        "But once the women went back to the nightly glass of wine, the blood markers dropped back to where they'd been before.",
        "In other words, the alcohol seemed to slow down the bone turnover rate, which over time may protect against fractures."
