        "Now, some people can stop on their own.",
        "As a matter of fact, the majority of alcoholics stop, never receive addiction treatment, go on to do well.",
        "There are different types, though, and some have more severe forms of addiction and need multiple treatments.",
        "I might add that the disease of addiction is really very comparable to similar chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension and asthma where there are repeated exacerbations of the illness, that it comes back.",
        "And in the same way with addiction, relapse is often a part of it.",
        "Now, families can feel like that's somehow a failure, but often one treatment builds on another and eventually leads, like Nicolas' story, to ongoing recovery.",
        "Let's go next to Ken(ph), Ken with us from Tucson.",
        "Ken, are you there?",
        "I guess Ken has left us.",

        "Yeah, I got out of college in 1977 and went straight into the field of addiction treatment, everything from counselor all the way up to clinic director.",
        "So - and I spent 20 years doing that.",
        "I knew the ropes real well.",
        "My oldest son, after the Army, showed signs of addiction.",
        "We began working with him, trying our best to pull him out of it.",
        "He spiraled deeper and deeper into it.",
        "Eventually we realized that he was dual-diagnosed.",
        "He was schizophrenic, and he was medicating himself with whatever he could get his hands on.",
        "Eventually we had to tough-love him.",
        "He ended up in the county jail for a year.",
        "He ended up in Broughton.",
        "We tough-loved him through the whole thing.",
        "But during this process, my younger son, who was 21, he began to experiment also, and he began to hang out with the kids from his high school who were experimenting.",
        "When he was 21 years old, they went out getting high and drinking, and the girl driving the car wrecked the car.",
        "My son was killed, and everyone else in the car lived.",
        "So we lost one son.",
        "And the oldest son is now again sober for, I don't know, two or three years.",
        "He's on medication for schizophrenia, and he goes to AA, and he's been clean and sober.",
        "And in my work in addiction, what I realized is that something that AA tells you is very, very true, and that is there are people who are constitutionally incapable of that form of recovery, and there's just something about them that almost can't be helped.",
        "But in our case, with tough love and with standing firm and with understanding addiction the way I did, we were able to save one son.",
        "And congratulations on that, and we're so sorry for your loss.",
        "But given your profession, David Scheff mentioned, and so did Dr. Schneekloth, the guilt that people feel.",
        "It must have been how could I miss this, how could I - did you feel like you let your sons down?"

        "Well, you go through such a range, a spectrum of emotions when you lose a child.",
        "But the one thing that I think - well, not the one thing but one of the major things that I really learned through the whole experience of both the 20 years of addiction treatment and having lost a child is - and I know this sounds a grave thing to say, but I really believe it's true - no matter what you do, in the end result, you really can't protect them.",
        "You can just give them the very best you can give them and hope that it's the thing that makes the difference.",
        "In our case, one, it made the difference and the other we lost before we were able to really grasp him and help him out of it.",
        "Joe, thank you for sharing the story, and appreciate it.",
        "Sure.",
        "And here's an email that's on the same point from Kevin(ph): As a recovering alcoholic and addict, I would argue that any action which helps the addict to avoid taking responsibility for his own actions is in fact not support at all.",
        "The one most important thing my parents did right was to give me unconditional love and maintain the bridges connecting us.",
        "And Dr. Schneekloth, we hear different expressions: tough love, no you've got to make sure that they do have a place to stay and, you know, unconditional - does it vary case to case?",
        "I think it does.",
        "Now, the unconditional love being available to help them into treatment, into - to receive help whenever they're ready for that, I believe that that needs to be there in support of families that can offer that.",
        "But starting out from that point, where you start in, where you help out, when you provide shelter, very tough for families.",
        "And it needs to be individualized.",
        "I'd like to go back to what Joe from Charlotte said, too, about his family members that had both addiction and an emotional problem because so many people with addictions have that.",
        "And that may impact how a family member acts and how they support them.",
        "And it's so critical for treatment to address both problems at the same time because addressing only the addiction when there is an emotional problem going on as well is only going to get at part of the solution and may be a contributor to someone going back to using.",
        "And, you know, he could quit for a while, but it was almost as if they were afraid to just let him go.",
        "Even though he did live on the street, they thought they'd find him dead in a ditch somewhere.",
        "Instead, they found him in their garage on April day, and with heroin and cocaine and some other barbiturates in his system.",
        "I'll just say quickly that that was Nick's, my son's situation, too.",
        "And it took a long time because, you know, when someone's using drugs, it's hard to see what else is going on.",
        "But Nick finally was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and he's on medication for that.",
        "And he would say that that's one of the biggest components of, you know, this recovery that he is now, you know, able to pull off."

        "I had to break my addiction first.",

        "But you know, often a simple intervention of talking with him, going to the family physician with him and the three of you discussing it together may be a step to get him help.",

        "Often when someone is just in a cloud of their addiction, they're not able to see what's going on.",
        "Now, there are also, you know, interventions that can occur with family members in contacting county social services if you think that there's an imminent danger that someone has, and that's really the only time you're able to force an adult into treatment that they don't want against their will.",

        "We shouldn't be doing that with family members, to take them into addiction treatments that really haven't kept up on the advances in the brain science.",

        "And that needs to be teased out in a safe setting by highly qualified professionals.",
        "I know in our own practice here at the Mayo Clinic over the past 50 years, we've had to continuously change those treatments based upon the advances in the science.",

        "Many people with alcoholism don't have that as part of their treatment.",
