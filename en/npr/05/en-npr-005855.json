        "Thank you for having me.",
        "So the Justice Department says that Whitaker's appointment does not violate the Constitution's appointment clause because he is serving in an acting capacity.",
        "And I believe the law says the time limit's around 210 days.",
        "So what's the basis of your challenge?",
        "What President Trump has done, essentially, is an end run around the Constitution.",
        "There's no way that any of us, as senators, can perform our critically important and constitutionally required responsibility to provide advice and consent, to approve or not, to scrutinize this appointee.",
        "And it's virtually unprecedented in modern history for a principal officer who reports directly to the president, the chief law enforcement officer, to be appointed for a temporary period without any approval by the United States Senate.",
        "If he does name someone within this 200 days, would that be OK, or do you have a problem with this candidate in particular?"

        "Our system of checks and balances is at risk when the president can simply dictatorially appoint someone without any check by the United States Senate.",
        "Again, we want to mention that the law does say that someone can be appointed temporarily.",
        "That is constitutional.",

        "And there is a specific law that says the succession is from the deputy to the attorney general.",
        "And constitutionally, there is simply no way that this appointment can pass muster.",
