        "Yeah.",
        "And let's bring in NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow who's in the studio.",

        "You are.",
        "...As we know.",
        "You know, this was already a key battleground state for Democrats because of the focus on the suburbs.",
        "They were really eyeing the Philadelphia suburbs to begin with, the seats they could flip, then two things happened to make it way more of a Democratic priority.",
        "First is that we've been talking all year about Republican retirements.",
        "You had five Republican members of Pennsylvania's congressional delegation leaving.",
        "And that included several of these suburban seats in Philadelphia.",
        "And then, even more, the state supreme court, a couple of months ago, threw out the existing congressional map as unconstitutional.",
        "They said it unfairly favored Republicans.",
        "The court drew a new map.",
        "These new lines really do favor Democrats, make a lot more races competitive for Democrats.",
        "And as a result, Democrats very optimistic - so much so that in one of these Philadelphia suburb seats that's empty, you have 10 Democrats running today.",
        "For one seat?",
        "To be one seat - yup.",
        "My goodness."

        "This is a seat in the Lehigh Valley vacated by moderate Republican Charlie Dent.",

        "Well, that's the key question.",
        "I mean, the Europeans were emboldened by China and Russia signaling that they will continue with the deal as long as Iran fulfills its obligations.",

        "My uncle's friend was there when my uncle died, the night he died, and all of the history that my uncle's friend described, it really did help me understand how, for over a decade, he's been struggling with addiction and was never able to get help largely because of stigma.",
        "When Ostrovsky found out that his uncle had died because of opioids and other drugs, he started to question a lot of things, including his career.",
