        "Well, it's both of those and beyond.",
        "I mean, in the first place, it's about these seven previously filibustered nominees, but for Frist it's a matter of principal that, as he reads the Constitution, all of a president's judicial nominees, particularly the appellate and Supreme Court, deserve an up-or-down vote.",
        "People are looking ahead.",
        "Everybody expects Rehnquist to retire by the end of June since he's been ailing with thyroid cancer for many months now.",
        "But even more importantly, people are looking ahead to what could be other vacancies in Bush's second term, such as if Justice John Paul Stevens, considered the leader of the court's liberal bloc, or Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who is right in the middle of the high court and really is, for all intents the most influential justice--certainly the most influential associate justice.",
        "If she retires, one of those--if Bush names replacements for one of those justices, that would be a battle even more apocalyptic than the one everybody expects to start the summer over Rehnquist's replacement.",
        "And the question is whether or not the minority party, the Democrats, can continue the threat of a filibuster for some of the more controversial nominees.",
        "It's been an institution in the Senate for a long time.",
        "There are ways, apparently, that the Senate can get around this, and that's what's at stake.",
        "Yes.",
        "Now Republicans will say that never before, you know, have appellate court nominees been systematically filibustered, but there are a lot of things that have customarily happened in the Senate in the past.",
        "For example, for 150 years, until the mid 20th century, it took the consent of all senators to vote on judicial nomination, and since then we've gotten to the point where it now takes the consent of a 60-vote majority.",
        "But the point being that, you know, it's hard to say sort of what's never been the case or what's historic.",
        "And Democrats will say, well, President Bush consults with them much less or really not much at all on his appointments, much less than past presidents from either party consulted with senators of the opposite party on their judicial picks.",
        "And what makes this feel nuclear, as its been described certainly by the Democrats, is the fact that you have the possibility of the vice president of the United States taking the chair and ruling unconstitutional the filibuster itself or one of the Senate rules.",
        "That would be big news, and that's something that appears to be sort of a grand shift--would be a grand shift for the Senate.",
        "It is.",
        "What would likely happen is they would stay away from--even though Republicans like to call it the constitutional option, you might not hear that word that much if the parliamentary sequence actually unfolds because questions of constitutionality have to be put to the whole Senate to decide, and that's debatable.",
        "But what will happen, if it happens, is that Frist will make a point of order that a certain number of hours of debate or a certain number of days of debate on an appellate or Supreme Court nominee are sufficient or, you know, enough for the senators to decide, and then vote.",
        "Cheney, presumably, would be presiding over the Senate then, or at least would be on hand to break a tie if needed.",
        "He would rule in favor of Frist.",
        "Democrats presumably would appeal the ruling of the chair, and that's debatable and thus filibusterable, but--if that's a word--but Frist would then move to table the appeal or kill it, and that motion to table the appeal of the ruling is non-debatable and just requires a simple majority to succeed with Cheney being able to break a tie vote.",
        "So if it happens, and when it happens, that's how it'll unfold.",
        "And it looks like either Janice Rogers Brown or Priscilla Owen would be the critical--one of them would be the critical nominee brought to the Senate floor forcing that option.",
        "Why these two?",
        "Well, there are certain advantages.",
        "They're both women, of course, and Janice Rogers Brown is an African-American to boot, so they're attractive candidates for Republicans to force a showdown on.",
        "And they seem to be in the mode of wanting to force the showdown because there are other appellate court nominees that the Democrats would allow to be confirmed, but Frist is not putting any of them on the floor.",
        "He's choosing to go with Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown, knowing that certainly the Democrats wouldn't let both of those--the way things stand, wouldn't let both of those nominees receive up-or-down votes, according to Senate rules as they stand.",
        "And why is that?",
        "What's so controversial about them?",
        "We don't know each other.",
        "We don't know each other's hopes and dreams and fears.",
        "Our kids don't play together, we don't eat together.",
        "And so we don't know the struggles and the successes and what life is for our neighbors.",
        "Well, in both cases, the critics of Owen and Brown say that their views, both in speeches they might have given, legal articles they've written and, most importantly, their opinions from the bench--Owen right now is a Texas Supreme Court justice.",
        "She's nominated to the 5th Circuit US Appeals Court.",
        "And Brown is a California Supreme Court justice, nominated to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.",
        "The critics say that on their respective state benches, the two--the decisions the two issue and the opinions they write are too far out of the mainstream of American thought.",
        "They say Brown, for example, has a view of the federal government--has the wrong view of the federal government's right to regulate interstate commerce or things like the minimum wage or the length of working hours and so on."
