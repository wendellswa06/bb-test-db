        "As last-minute negotiations continue, the Senate is grinding toward a judicial showdown on two of President Bush's most controversial nominees to the federal bench.",
        "Without a compromise, this fight may end with historic limitations on the power of the minority party in the Senate to block judicial nominations and other legislation.",
        "Right now we're looking back on the congressional history of the filibuster and taking your questions about how this power has developed, how it may change in the future.",
        "You're invited to join the discussion by calling us at (800) 989-TALK or sending us an e-mail at totn@npr.org.",
        "Our guest is Charles Tiefer, professor of legislation at the University of Baltimore Law School.",
        "Keith Perine is with us, judicial affairs reporter for Congressional Quarterly.",
        "And, Charles, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the history of the filibuster and the fact that--tell us--first of all, the House at one point had this rule and changed it.",
        "That's right.",
        "Until 1890, for the first century that the Congress was in existence, in the House, the minority party could and did block action; indeed, the House minority paralyzed action a lot of the decades leading up to 1890, and then came a great struggle and the majority party changed the character of the House to what it has been since, quite unlike the Senate.",
        "That is, the House does not allow--does not require consensus, does not allow the minority party to get in the way of the majority's agenda.",
        "It functions, as we say, like a machine.",
        "Yeah, well, there are a lot more people in the House, and so you can imagine that that may have been what was behind the instinct to get this change.",
        "The Senate works on different operating system, as it were, doesn't it?",
        "In a sense, there's more tradition involved than rules of the game, formal rules of the game.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "The Senate has evolved with its limited number of members functioning like a club.",
        "In the old days, an exclusive men's club, and since then, membership opened up.",
        "And in the club, the people--the senators don't either assert their full powers of resistance or obstruction because that would be undignified and too militant to be a member of the club, and on the other hand, the majority does not bang the gavel and try to obtain machinelike powers that would also be inconsistent with the nature of the club.",
        "A different kind of balance of decorum and dignity in this clublike atmosphere.",
        "And, of course, the filibuster has been used on mostly controversial issues, to block the civil rights bill, for instance, and the Senate at that point didn't consider--the majority party didn't consider changing the rules about filibuster even though this was crucial legislation.",
        "Well, let me put the question a different way to Charles Tiefer, if I may.",
        "There is that question about what happens when you change the rules.",
        "Has that been a part of why these rules have stayed in place so long?",
        "Clearly, the majority party has always suffered under this rule, whatever party happened to be in the majority, and yet they sustained the rule.",
        "Is that the reason?",
        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #4: Wow, is that a piece of gold?",
        "That's right.",
        "For about three-quarters of a century, from the last decade of the 1800s until 1964, the filibuster was first and foremost used to keep civil rights legislation from going through.",
        "The last 30 years or so, it has been pretty much available for opposing controversial legislation, whether it's liberals or conservatives.",
        "Indeed, the Senate Republicans made vigorous use of the filibuster to--when they were in the minority in the first years of the Clinton administration."

        "We're talking today about judicial nominees and the nuclear option on the program.",
        "Charles Tiefer is with us, professor of legislation at the University of Baltimore Law School.",
        "And we're going to have to say goodbye to Keith Perine, judicial affairs reporter for Congressional Quarterly.",
        "He's at the Senate where one of the many news conferences are under way to talk about just this thing.",
        "Thank you, Keith.",
        "Thank you.",
        "The number to call if you want to join our conversation is (800) 989-TALK, and that is what Sy has done from New York.",
        "Hello, Sy.",
        "Hi, Mr. Stasio.",
        "I guess my question is--I'm frankly confused because there was a piece in the news in the last week or so saying that during the Clinton years there were 75 judicial appointments blocked by means other than the filibuster procedural rules within Congress, and the Republican leadership has very consistently said--and their position I think someone highlighted earlier in your show--is that a nominee is entitled to an up-or-down vote.",
        "And I don't see how we reconcile those two.",
        "If all kinds of procedural rules were used to block people then, how is using any rule inappropriate now under this administration?",
        "Charles, do you have a way to address that?",
        "Oh, Sy is pointing out one of those very interesting questions, which you get totally different answers from which side you ask.",
        "If you ask Democrats, they'll say what Sy estimates is exactly right, that nominees--large numbers of judicial nominees were blocked, and it doesn't matter the details, and there was never a mention that there was some constitutional reason that you had to get an up-or-down vote.",
        "It was simply that you had the use of Senate procedures and it was tolerated.",
        "On the other hand, if you ask Republicans, they'll say that those nominations typically were stuck in committee and they didn't come to the floor, and therefore we were not seeing filibustering on the floor, and so there's no precedent from that time period that says that filibustering on the floor has to be allowed rather, as the Republicans say, if a nominee is on the floor, a limited amount of debate is the only thing that occurs, and then an up-or-down vote."

        "The procedures were used.",
        "Thank you for your call, Sy.",
        "There are procedures that can be used, and that, I guess, gets back to this question of the Senate as a collegial body full of traditions.",
        "Are there other things the Democrats can do even after, you know, the button is pushed, to hold things up in the Senate?",
        "There are some things that can be done even on the particular nomination.",
        "It's not clear how many such things can be done because we will be in totally uncharted territory.",
        "Once Cheney has made the ruling he's made, we have a sort of right as we go along form of cloture imposed upon judicial nominees, and who knows what the rule--what can and can't be done under this--can motions be made to move to a different nominee, for example?",
        "Just to clarify, this word cloture, that is the vote to bring the filibuster to a close.",
        "That's right.",
        "For when 60 senators are available, then both parties admit and both parties understand that it's a very well-established, written rule that says that 60 senators can bring the matter to a vote.",
        "But the new thing that's being created that would be created by this Cheney ruling, this new thing doesn't have a written rule for it.",
        "It's what sort of Cheney announces from the chair as we go along, without 60 votes, with only 51 votes is all that's needed to back it up.",
        "And can the Democrats take any of this to court?",
        "Court isn't the way it goes.",
        "The way it goes in the Senate is the powers of resistance, because there are--the Senate has this creaky old set of rules, and--that functions by the consent of all the senators to let them go by.",
        "And if the Democrats are as aroused as they have been saying for a long time they would be, will be, then, for example, they can start saying, `Well, their rules say every bill that's to be voted on has to be read from beginning to end, so let's set aside three days at the beginning of consideration of even the most minor bills to hear them read aloud from beginning to end.'",
        "So this could get ugly?",
        "That's why it got the name the nuclear option.",
        "1 (800) 989-TALK is the number to call.",

        "Hi.",
        "I remember the old films like Jimmy Stewart and standing and speaking to actually--a person actually performing that filibuster, and I don't see that today, and I was told that there--no one is actually doing that, that it's just a stated filibuster, and I'm wondering, when did it change?",
        "Could such a change be rescinded?",
        "Oh, is that true?",
        "I think that would be productive.",
        "Charles, I thought you really did have to hold the floor.",

        "Technically you do have to stand and hold the floor, and the rule hasn't been changed and we may see some of that this week.",
        "But because the Senate wants to be efficient in its business, it has generally been recognized in--I would say largely from the 1970s until now--that it's sufficient to--if you can defeat a cloture petition, if there are more than 40 votes against it, you aren't obliged to stand there for long period of time to prove you've got what it takes.",

        "Pleasure to be here.",
        "How do you separate--or do you separate your own political beliefs from the rulings you make?",
        "Well, you have to understand that most cases, and much of what we deal with, is controlled by precedent one way or the other.",
        "In other words, we have cases on point, and our job is to, you know, somewhat mechanically to extrapolate the correct result based on earlier applications of the same rule of law by the Supreme Court or our court.",
        "Well...",
        "So much of the process--you know, it's not the cases that you hear so much about, but most of what we do we are unanimous on, and whether it be Democrats or Republicans or conservatives or liberals, we reach a unanimous result in the overwhelming number of cases.",
        "But for that popular or well-known minority of cases, certainly your views on the world and the views of your colleagues have to play a role, or this wouldn't be an issue, I suspect, in the Senate today.",
        "I think that's right.",
        "I think that's--but it's important to focus on the fact that there's unusual cases, and the cases that are not controlled by precedent, and the ones that really sort of hit home in terms of fundamental values, and there it seems to me that when there is no controlling authority, a part of what a judge has to look to--you have to look somewhere for guidance--has to be your own sense of life, your own sense of morality, your own sense of the proper relationship between the state and the individual."
