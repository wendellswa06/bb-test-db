        "Now that was a case that was not controlled by direct authority from the Supreme Court, or by anything else so far as I could tell.",
        "And that's a similar kind of case that, for me, properly raised the question of what kind of society do we want to live in?",

        "What kind of--do we want to live in a world where the government can keep track of individuals and thereby prevent crime?",

        "On the other hand, do we want to live in a world where the government can trace where an individual goes from birth to death by picking up little pieces of skin or blood or other sort of DNA traces that we leave behind...",
