        "And that's the same opinion of the people of this country.",
        "What do you say to the argument that Guantanamo has been a recruiting tool for al-Qaida and other terrorist groups and we can only put that behind us by shutting it down?",
        "I think the fact that you close Guantanamo Bay and move them to American soil will only create additional targets within the United States.",
        "I think you'll just transfer that anger to places like Colorado should they be moved there.",

        "I am a political activist who cares deeply about social justice issues.",
        "I am a lesbian but even I was not inspired to encourage black people to vote against the proposition.",
        "The white gay community never reached out to black voters, she argued and quote, \"\"many black gays just haven't been convinced that this movement is about anything more than the white gays who fund it.\"\" Jasmyne Cannick is a journalist and a regular contributor to NPR's News & Notes.",

        "Hi.",
        "And you wrote, \"\"at a time when blacks are still more likely than whites to be pulled over for no reason, more likely to be unemployed than whites, more likely to live at or below the poverty line, I was too busy trying to get black people registered to vote, period.",
        "I wasn't about to focus my attention on what couldn't help but feel like a secondary issue, and that points to a problem,\"\" you argue in the campaign led primarily by white gays in California.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I mean - but this has been the story of that whole movement and for people in my position who happen to be black and/or gay.",
        "It presents a problem because obviously I'm disappointed with the numbers of African-Americans who turned out and supported Proposition 8.",
        "Obviously that is a problem for me as well.",
        "But I think what really bothered me the most was that after the election, all of the anger turned towards African-Americans from the gay community as if single handedly African-American voters were the reason why Proposition 8 passed."

        "And I just thought it was time that we start to have an honest conversation about how this campaign was run and it was quite frankly, it was a poorly ran campaign based on an outdated civil rights method that they were trying to use and to the extent that anyone's listening who's a part of the planning of these movements maybe next time you know they sit down at the table they'll include more people of color, more African-American gays and lesbians as well as Latinos and Asians because we come out of these communities.",
        "We know what works and we know what doesn't work.",
        "And one thing that didn't work, you argue, was the argument that the case for gay marriage was equivalent to the case for Civil Rights.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That just doesn't go over too well in the African-American community and there are many reasons for that.",
        "I mean it doesn't even set right too much with me.",

        "And you have to remember, when you think about the movement for marriage for gays and lesbians, the faith of that movement has always been white gays and lesbians.",
        "So when you have that image telling you that your struggle for equality, your struggle to be able to use any restroom, go to school, all of that you know - when you have that person telling you that, it doesn't go over too well and I don't think they really understand that.",
        "Because at the end of the day, you know yes, they're gay and lesbian and yes, there's an issue of inequality as it relates to marriage but if it were 1955, they would still be able to go into any restroom, they'd still be able to go whatever school they wanted to and we weren't - and even me as a lesbian, I would not have been able to.",
        "So I think we need to move away from that argument at least where it relates to African-Americans because it's clear that it does not work.",

        "Do you think that this - your writing specifically about California but you think the same kind of mechanics are working elsewhere?",
        "Look if in Florida and Arizona, the folks running those campaigns were on the same campaign that they ran in California then absolutely.",
        "I can tell you that on Election Day, I was in the drawn(ph) down projects and watched to get out the vote, and I am debating the merits of Proposition 8 in the projects.",
        "It wasn't a subject that - a conversation that I brought up, it was a conversation that actually came to me while I was out there and you know, what they said to me, it said to me that proponents of Proposition 8 managed to get their message all the way into the most economically depressed parts of African-American community.",
        "However, no one from the No-on-8 campaign had done the same.",
        "Even at my own neighborhood, I received dozens of mailers from the Yes-on-8 campaign, I never received one mailer from the No-on-8 campaign.",
        "And just - people get confused, Yes-on-8 was for the gay marriage ban and No was opposed to the gay marriage ban.",
        "Right, it was one of those Yes means, no and No means yes.",
        "That just didn't help things either, but there was plenty of television advertisement use the saying the ground war that we talk about that which was so effective in Senator Obama's campaign was not waged at least in African-American communities and you also on the civil rights issue said a lot of that for African-American is associated with the church and to the degree that the No-on-8 campaign was seen as anti-church, it was not going to be effective.",
        "So maybe we can work together on registering black voters, because that way if they're registered, hmmm, maybe they can vote No on Prop 8.",
        "But if they're not registered, they can't vote anything on Prop 8.",
        "There was no cohesiveness.",
        "There was no collaboration in that area.",
        "And there never has been.",
        "And as long as it continues to be that way, again you're going to always have the separation.",

        "We still have to deal with all of those other issues which is, again, one of the reasons why, you know, I don't think that there is a huge movement on our behalf around the whole Proposition 8.",
