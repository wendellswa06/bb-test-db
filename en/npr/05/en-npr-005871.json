        "The Supreme Court five-to-four death penalty decision involved the rape of an eight-year-old girl by her stepfather.",
        "He was convicted and sentenced to death in Louisiana.",
        "Writing for the court majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy said that with only six states allowing the death penalty for non-homicide child rape, only two people on death row for the crime and 44 years since anyone has been executed in this country for the crime, there's a national consensus against the practice.",
        "In addition to consensus, Kennedy said, there's a question of what's disproportionately cruel punishment under evolving standards of decency.",
        "The death penalty, he said, must be reserved for the most heinous homicides because of its finality and the possibility of error that cannot be corrected.",
        "Though there are non-homicide crimes against the state, like treason and espionage, where the death penalty is justified, he said, crimes against individuals must involve a death if execution is to be the punishment.",
        "Kennedy's opinion acknowledged the difficulty the court has had in trying to ensure that there is some regularity in a position of the death penalty.",
        "It's difficult enough to try to ensure that execution is not imposed in an irrational or arbitrary way for homicide, he said.",
        "Child rape, with the numbers far greater and the testimony of child witnesses more unreliable and subject to influence, would present too great a chance of wrongful executions.",
        "Washington and Lee Law Professor David Bruck is a capital defense litigator.",
        "The tone of the court is quite skeptical of the use of the death penalty and expresses frank concern and awareness of the difficulties in administering it at all.",
        "Said Justice Kennedy, when the law punishes by death it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, transgressing the Constitutional commitment to decency and restraint.",
        "Writing for the four dissenters, Justice Samuel Alito said such issues are for legislatures, not courts, to decide.",

        "It was bad news - bad for them to hear, bad for me to say.",
        "A number of friends broke down in tears, and I found myself comforting them, which seemed an odd role reversal.",
        "Almost every weekday since then, Leroy has written about what he calls the roller coaster ride of cancer: the discomfort of chemotherapy, the fear and the hopefulness of waiting for test results.",
        "The My Cancer blog has thousands of devoted, daily readers.",
        "But as the blog developed, so has Leroy's disease.",

        "Just like those old advertisements, I fell, but I couldn't get up.",
        "That meant surgery, another surgery, an infection that almost killed me, and one more surgery after that.",
        "We finally thought the battle over my spine was winding down.",

        "That's about all I can do.",
        "From here on, we're going to be worried about comfort, about relieving the worst side effects.",
        "So this anniversary has been pretty stressful.",
        "But if I've learned anything over the last two years, it's that life with cancer is tough.",
        "I've learned something far more important, too.",
        "No matter what happens, we're all in this together.",
