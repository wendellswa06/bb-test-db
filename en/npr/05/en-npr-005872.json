        "That's longtime Nevada political commentator Jon Ralston.",
        "Even though the Lieutenant Governor doesn't have much power, this race has gained national attention.",
        "That's because some speculate Nevada's Republican governor, Brian Sandoval, the first Hispanic to hold statewide office here, could run against Senate Majority Leader, Harry Reid, in two years.",
        "There's going to be an immense national pressure from Republicans after he wins with 65, 70 percent of the vote - scores well with Hispanics here, they'll say he's a natural to run against Reid, assuming Reid runs.",
        "The thinking goes like this.",
        "The governor wouldn't want to run for Senate - if he knew were he to win - a Democrat like Lucy Flores would take over the governor's office.",
        "To head off that possibility, the GOP is investing heavily in its candidate for Lieutenant Governor, Mark Hutchison.",
        "He's a state senator who runs a law firm in Vegas.",
        "I've been a leader in calling for comprehensive immigration reform.",
        "I gave a speech on - about that on the floor of the Senate.",
        "He's also supported driver privilege cards and more funding for English language learners.",

        "UNIDENTIFIED MAN #5: Yeah, that's a damn nice piece of gold.",
        "I recall a skirmish taking place between the company man, the OIM, and the tool pusher and driller concerning the events of the day.",
        "The driller was outlining what was going to be taking place, whereupon the company man stood up and said, no, we have some changes to that.",
        "Now, the company man that he is talking about is the BP representative.",
        "That's the oil company that was leasing the rig.",
        "Brown said there was an argument about what to do.",
        "But the company man, quote, \"\"stood up and said, no, we have some changes to that.\"\" And the disagreement appears to be about how to shut down the well and the process of removing some mud from the drill pipe.",
        "The indication is that BP was interested in proceeding more quickly than Transocean people were.",
        "Although we are going to hear tomorrow from two of the people who are actually more intimately involved in that discussion and we'll get a lot more information about the details.",
        "Okay, and this testimony from Douglas Brown, did he go on to say what happened after that meeting where he described this - what he called a skirmish?"

        "Right.",
        "Well, he gave a very dramatic accounting of what happened.",
        "He went down into the engine room and he was just going about his business and he said all of sudden he heard a loud air leak sound and then gas alarms started to go off.",
        "And he also said he heard, like, the engines were beginning to speed up, that they were revving up.",
        "He said there was an explosion that threw him up against a control panel and that a hole opened up in the floor that he fell into.",
        "And then he explains what happened next.",
        "I was wondering what was happening.",
        "I was confused.",
        "I was hurt and I was dazed.",

        "And the second explosion happened.",
        "And I ended up falling back down in a hole and the ceiling caved in on top of me at this point.",
        "He basically described it as a chaotic situation.",
        "He says everybody was scared, some were crying and some people were even jumping overboard.",
        "And he was also asked, I gather, Pam, about other issues that might have led to problems on the Deepwater Horizon that day?",
        "Exactly.",
        "He said that there were some other safety devices that he felt would've worked, but they did some things that were supposed to stop the engines from speeding up and also to detect the possibility of gas seeping into the engine room.",
        "He said these things did not appear to work.",
