        "And I think the key phrase, as you alluded to, was, quote, \"\"The Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion,\"\" end quote.",

        "Yes, he has these personal views, but if you look at the 15 years of his opinions on the appeals court, you can't find these political views manifesting themselves in his judicial rulings.",

        "So that's going to be the central talking point, I predict, coming out of the White House today, is, you know, these people can keep those things separate and, therefore, this shouldn't be a disqualifier for Judge Alito.'"
