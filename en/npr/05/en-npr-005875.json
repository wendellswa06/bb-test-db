        "The wrestlers of Mexico City--caped, costumed, masked.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "The prints are huge, the size of a window, dry-mounted on thin sheets of aluminum.",

        "He looks like he's mad about the whole thing, too, doesn't he?",
        "You know, he's an interesting guy, Super Porky.",
        "Super Porky's fighting name was Brazo de Plata Silva, and his friend, his fighting partner, Golden Arm(ph), died in the ring from a slap to the throat."
