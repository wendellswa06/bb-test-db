        "The reason the aid hasn't gone in sufficient quantities into south and central Somalia is because al-Shabaab has prevented those most capable of delivering large quantities of aid from having access.",
        "And when they have had access, they've taxed them, harassed them, killed them, kidnapped them.",
        "So that's the problem.",
        "That is part of the problem, says Joel Charny, vice president for humanitarian policy and practice at InterAction, which represents 190 humanitarian organizations.",
