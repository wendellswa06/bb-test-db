        "And this stop in Afghanistan, and it is expected to be followed by one to Baghdad, to Iraq, it has been tacked onto the front of what had been an officially-announced campaign trip to the Middle East - to Jordan, to Israel - and then to Europe - Germany, France and Britain.",
        "But while he certainly wants to talk to commanders on the ground and meet with soldiers and meet with Iraqis and leaders in Afghanistan, he is also sending a message to voters back in the United States.",
        "And though the campaign wouldn't admit this, he is responding in some way to some chivying and some criticism from Senator John McCain that Senator Obama had not been to Iraq since January of '06, and that he had never been to Afghanistan.",
        "I noticed in the pool report thoughtfully provided by John McCormick of the Chicago Tribune, who said the senator had chicken and rice and broccoli - if you were wondering - on the air from Chicago to Andrews.",

        "Not just that, but not being as well qualified on foreign policy issues.",
        "So he does have to step up and look like he is comfortable, look like he is knowledgeable, in these trips but also in the subsequent trips with these key European allies - in Germany and in France and Britain - which will take place later next week.",
        "He does have to look presidential on the foreign stage to American voters.",
        "There's already been a controversy in Germany over - apparently, his campaign at one point wanted to have him speak in front of the Brandenburg Gate, and the German government had to say, well, that's not a stage prop.",

        "So, is this as much a linguistic question as a legal one?",
        "Well, it's partly a linguistic question and partly a question of what the founding fathers meant.",
        "Did they mean a well-regulated militia, so you have to have a gun, and you can either have it at home or the state can have depots and strategic places to keep the guns?",
        "Or does it mean, look, everybody had a gun at the time of the founding of the republic and the king tried to take them away at some point, and we mean to guarantee an individual right to own a gun?",
