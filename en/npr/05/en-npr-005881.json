        "But if you're looking for a terrorist, the main thing to think about is that this is a person who believes that they're about to die.",
        "And when you believe you're about to die, there are physiological reaction that are not within your control.",
        "And it's like sweating, being very jittery and not being able to have a normal conversation, which is why it's so important, when we think someone is suspicious or when someone else has told us that someone is suspicious, to have a conversation with them",
        "How often, in your experience, do you get tipped by a traveler who, as you analyze it, might have been motivated by racism - if not outright hatred, then at least someone who just didn't understand national and cultural differences?",
        "The incident that I wrote about in the column, I remember it because it was so rare.",
        "You know, you'll see some passengers looking at other passengers in perhaps a rude manner - like if you see someone wearing a niqab and other passengers are sort of gaping at them rudely.",
        "That happens.",
        "But for a passenger to say, this person is suspicious - and, you know, it may be for racist or Islamophobic reasons - it's extremely rare.",
        "Do you recall any stories?",
        "What happened was we were flying from south Florida to JFK.",
        "And a middle-aged white women leaned forward, and she whispered to me.",
        "She said, there is a man four people behind me in a green shirt, and he is very suspicious.",
        "And I immediately thought, this woman might be racist; I also need to take her seriously.",
        "So I asked her, what is he doing?",
        "Can you describe for me what about him is suspicious?",
        "And she just said, you'll see.",
        "And so I thought, OK, well then, I must be able to see something.",
        "When he came down, he just seemed completely normal.",
        "He was not jittery in any way.",
        "He was not looking around suspiciously.",
        "His clothing was normal.",
        "The green shirt was a Green Bay Packers shirt.",
        "It was football season.",
        "And...",
        "As a Bears fan, I would also immediately pick on the Green Bay Packers fan.",
        "Right, exactly (laughter) - and, you know, I might finger someone who was wearing a Raiders jersey.",
        "But, you know, that's just my unconscious bias, right?",
        "And so I leaned on my training, and I just looked for those signs of a potential threat.",
        "I engaged him in a conversation.",
        "He was able to respond to my questions completely normally.",
        "And then once he took his seat, I walked by and I carefully observed him again.",
        "He was completely casual.",
        "He was not sitting stiffly in any way.",
        "He had his headphones on, and he was watching the game.",
        "Someone who believes that they are about to die generally doesn't turn on football.",
        "And to recap, using football terms, this was very rare in your flights.",
        "Absolutely - absolutely.",
        "More often you'll get biases against people who are larger or mothers with crying children.",
        "There's all kinds of cultural issues that you come into contact with.",
        "And part of being a flight attendant is understanding what is and is not your job to judge.",
        "If a flight attendant's wrong about a passenger, and they turn out to be innocent, maybe the airline gets some bad publicity and perhaps a lawsuit.",
        "But if a flight attendant dismisses a traveler's complaint because they think they're being racist, and something happens on that plane, that's a catastrophe.",
        "So doesn't this encourage flight attendants just to take no chances and have the passenger removed?"

        "Paul Rogers is a professor of peace studies at the University of Bradford, which is not far from Leeds, where the bombing investigation is focused now.",
        "Now the, the, a number of cases ended up on the cutting room floor because the, the seminar's consensus was that, no, they really were fools.",
        "But then there was quite an interesting selection of cases where talking to these military professionals, and it was really quite a wonderful interchange, all of us agreed that, you know, you really couldn't say that the people in charge had been incompetent and yet, things had really become seriously unstuck.",
        "And John and I ended up writing a book trying to explain some of the ways in which that that happens.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Let's pick one example, and there are several in the book, but I picked the example of the U.S.",

        "The British Navy reluctantly had resumed convoys in the Atlantic Ocean.",
        "Of course, the U.S.",

        "declared war, and they just started sinking individual American ships silhouetted against the lights of American cities along the East Coast.",
        "That's right.",
        "And the British had learned through painful experience in the First World War that you had to have convoy, and so they instituted it right at the beginning of World War II.",
        "The thing that made that case so interesting is, it wasn't simply a case of not invented here, that the United States Navy did not want to learn from the Royal Navy.",
        "In fact, they, we had missions over there from the very beginning.",
        "We were copying all kinds of devices, particularly the British had done a lot of work on sonar as a way of detecting submerged submarines.",
        "But what we talk about in that chapter is the way in which the Navy was predisposed to learn technical lessons.",
        "That is to say, they were very eager to learn about the latest gadgets and gizmos and weapons and very narrow tactical techniques.",
        "But they thought the British had nothing to teach them about organization.",
        "And so much of the key to the success of the British in the war in the north Atlantic was superior organization, not only the convoys, but also the way they structured their intelligence system, how they managed to let it communicate.",
        "And on top of this, what makes it interesting is, the Navy had a good reason.",
        "You know, they had seen how the Royal Navy had to organize its naval aviation, which was not in very good shape at the beginning of the war.",
        "And so they said, well, we don't have any organizational lessons to learn from these people, and unfortunately, they were wrong.",
        "And the person who was in charge at the time, and this will sound strange to people, was the most obvious target to be scapegoated if anybody was going to be, was Admiral Ernest King, who later became one of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and, you know, hailed as a great strategist during the war, particularly for the Pacific campaign.",
        "It was not a question in his case of incompetence.",
        "No, not at all.",
        "And I think that, one of the things that really intrigued us in writing the book is trying to understand what military competence means, and how much tolerance you should have for mistakes, and how much realization you should have that even very, very able people can do things which, in retrospect, you just say, this, this is really dumb.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "I think one of the conclusions we came to is that the quality that you look for most in the military is the ability to adapt, and to change, and to adjust to circumstances, and to do so relatively quickly.",
        "That's the real measure of a military organization.",
        "By and large, the American military is reasonably good at that, but, of course, could always be better."

        "Well, the, that chapter on anti-submarine warfare in 1942 is titled Failure to Learn.",
        "And in your brief afterwords about the War in Iraq, you come to pretty much the same conclusion, that the American military failed to learn some important lessons.",
        "Yeah, in a somewhat different way, I think the, what, the point that I was trying to make, we were trying to make about Iraq is that the United States military had had a very rich history of doing counter-insurgency operations.",
        "We, of course, had a tremendous amount of experience in military government during the Second World War, under different circumstances, but still military government.",
        "And there was almost a self-inflicted amnesia, which was part of the reaction to the Vietnam experience.",
        "You know, there was a tremendous sense in the military that, gosh, we never wanna go through anything like that again.",

        "It was almost in some ways as much about identity as it was about strategy.",
        "And the result was that even though there was a lot of experience, including some fairly recent experience in places like El Salvador or in the Balkans in a rather different way, a lot of the lessons hadn't been absorbed.",
        "And so we went off with a kind of theory of war, which worked for the first part of the conflict, but was certainly not suited to everything that followed.",
        "You're not talking about the adaptability of individual soldiers or small units.",
        "You say they've obviously been adapting.",

        "Mm hmm.",
        "...at the end of the book.",
        "And what's interesting about that is that this critique was published in the staff journal of the Army's Command and Staff College, and, at least according to news reports, the Chief of Staff of the Army has sent it around to every general officer in the Army.",
        "So it, I think it proves that the, that quality of, ability to adapt once you're actually in the middle of a mess is still, thank goodness, something that exists in large measure in the American armed forces.",

        "He would harass.",

        "So, not an immediate whitewash.",
