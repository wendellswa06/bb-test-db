        "One thing that makes this war unique, these people have no shortage of weapons and high explosive.",
        "In most insurgencies, just getting adequate supplies of high explosive and weapons is a real challenge.",
        "In Iraq because of the truly staggering amounts of weapons and high explosive that were left scattered around by the Saddam Hussein regime, that's not a problem for them.",
        "Hmm.",
        "That already is a huge difference, I think, from other insurgencies.",
        "David, thanks for the call.",
        "Thank you.",
        "One final question for you, Eliot Cohen.",
        "Another of the mistakes you said the United States made in Iraq, post-war Iraq, or I guess, post- the fall of Baghdad, was a lack of unity of command.",
        "Right, you know, I think a lot of the debate about what some of the mistakes that were made in Iraq followed a red herring, which is the numbers issue.",
        "That was important, how many troops.",
        "But I think the history of insurgencies tells us that organization, doctrine zone matter a lot more.",
        "And of the things that matters most is to have the military and civilian functions completely integrated.",
        "Do you have, the people who are in charge of security also worrying about development, and the supply of clean water and electricity, and all the rest?",
        "Thank you.",
        "Our most successful commanders over there, for example, General Peter Corelli, who's now the Corps Commander there, as a divisional commander, he said, you know, what's gonna be important for ensuring stability in Baghdad is, do these people have sewage?",
        "Do they have water?",
        "Do they have electricity?",
        "And he made that happen, and incidents in his sector went way down.",
        "On a much larger scale, it was a terrible decision to have military leadership on the one hand and then the Coalition Provisional Authority under Ambassador Bremer.",
        "And eventually you had two competing hostile bureaucracies which were not very cooperative.",
        "And insurgency, above all kinds of war, is one where the political, the economic, the social has to be completely interlinked and interwoven with the military.",
        "And you only get that if you have one person in charge, the military or civilian."
