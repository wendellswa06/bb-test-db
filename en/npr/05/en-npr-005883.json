        "Well, we put a man on the moon, and it changed our language.",
        "Then we said, well, if we can put a man on the moon, then we can do - fill in the blank.",
        "Now we can say, well, if we can put a black man in the White House - fill in the blank.",
        "There are issues that affect all of us, and some issues affect some people more than others.",
        "Yes.",
        "Are there expectations from black America about that?",
        "You know, black folks have not been honest about our discussion either.",
        "We have tended too often to blame everything on race.",
        "And that tends to help us to hide what I call overlook the underclass.",
        "Jonetta, what's your take on the expectations?",
        "I think that there are African-Americans who are not happy with a Barack Obama as the symbol of a black politician coming to the White House.",
        "They would have much rather preferred someone who is much more tied to identity confrontational politics of the Black Power movement.",
        "My take, though, is that there are many of us who appreciate having a Barack Obama because he is emblematic of a community of African-Americans who, for some reason, we forgot about and thought they never existed.",
        "And all we thought about were the radicals that came along in the '60s and the '70s and the '80s.",
        "And so I think that you have kind of an expectation in the black community from two different perspectives.",
        "How do you think the election of Barack Obama may change, or already has changed, black America's image of itself?",
        "Well now, I think that it has not necessarily changed black America's image of itself, but I think black Americans now are able to see that that image that they had of themselves as upstanding people is now on the world stage.",
        "And so you don't evaluate us against Ludacris or 50 Cent, but you evaluate the entire community."

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, all these Clinton names, what are they doing?",
        "You know, I say, well, maybe Obama wants to avoid the problems that both Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter ran into when they first came to Washington.",
        "Jonetta, what do you think of the names so far?",
        "You are going to hear some of the black nationalists complaining about the fact that there are not enough young African-Americans that he has so far named, and, of course, our friends on the left who wanted to see a much more liberal administration.",
        "I think what we need to do is sit back, relax, and kind of let him build that base first, and then begin to evaluate.",
        "What would you like to say to one another about the conversation that's going on now in the black community about this election?",
        "The fact that Barack Obama won, playing by the rules, and America met him halfway, shows the American dream is still alive.",
        "And my question would be, you know, how do we keep it alive?",
        "How do we make it mean something for all those kids left behind out there for the next generation?",
        "How do we make hope a reality for them?",
        "I mean, because this is where I'd like to see the discussion move.",
        "I think, especially African-Americans have to reevaluate, sort of, where are you now?",
        "And that's the conversation I think I would like to see come to the public square.",

        "Dr. King, after the Civil Rights Act was passed and the Voting Rights Act was passed - and he moved on from race to economics, fighting poverty - white America responded, well, now you done stopped preaching and gone on to meddling, you know."

        "That's the limit on the country's line of credit, a limit that lawmakers have set and raised dozens of times over the years, as the federal government has spent more than it's taken in.",
        "When John Boehner and the GOP took the House majority at the beginning of 2011, the speaker laid down a new principle: Republicans would not pass an increase in the debt limit unless an equal amount of dollars were cut from the budget.",
        "And they said they would not consider tax increases on the wealthy as a way to fix the deficit.",
        "The partisan fighting that followed was among the most acrimonious, bitter, and biting debates many in Washington can remember.",
        "Now, fast forward to last week and a speech Boehner gave to the Peterson Foundation's 2012 Fiscal Summit.",
        "In my view, the debt limit exists precisely so that government is forced to address its fiscal issues.",
        "Boehner told the hundreds of economists, policy experts and political operatives present that he is sticking to those principals and, furthermore, he will demand a vote on the debt ceiling before this fall's elections.",
        "Last summer's debate was a doozy, but in many ways, the approaching crisis is much worse.",
        "Lawmakers have passed so many temporary bills in recent years that an almost unbelievable number of problems come to a head all on the same day, January 1st, 2013.",
        "If Washington doesn't act by that day, tax rates will shoot up for everyone, huge indiscriminate cuts in military and domestic programs will take place and, shortly after that, the nation will again hit the debt ceiling, putting into doubt whether the government can pay its bills."
