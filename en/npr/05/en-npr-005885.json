        "Sketch out for us how this study was organized, which, by the way, I imagine bias is a very hard thing to study and to nail down.",
        "It's very hard.",
        "Because the moment you tell your subject that you're studying bias, you're probably not going to get an honest answer.",
        "So it's what makes this study so interesting because the team from Yale had to create something essentially tricky.",
        "They recruited roughly 135 preschool teachers and had them watch video footage of four kids - a black boy, black girl, a white boy and a white girl.",
        "And they were told watch the footage.",
        "Your job is to press the enter key on your keyboard every time you see a behavior that could become a potential challenge.",
        "Now here's the tricky part.",
        "While the teachers were doing this, the researchers were using eye scan technology to measure the trajectory of their gazes to see which kids they were watching, anticipating bad behavior.",
        "And what happened?",
        "Well, they spent the most time watching the black boy.",
        "And interestingly, this is true of both white and black teachers.",
        "The researchers then asked the teachers explicitly, which child did you feel required the most attention?",
        "Forty-two percent said the black boy, 34 percent the white boy, just 13 percent the white girl and 10 percent the black girl.",
        "So teachers were not necessarily seeing bad behavior where there wasn't any, but they spent the most time watching the black boy, as you've just said, expecting bad behavior.",
        "Exactly.",
        "In fact, in the video, there was no bad behavior at all.",
        "And when I spoke with lead researcher Walter Gilliam, he told me, you know, the problem with this is if you look for something in only one place, well, that's the only place you can typically find it."

        "What is your attitude towards the Israeli government at this point, you and the other people from your community?",
        "I think people are still--feel betrayed by the government really, because we went to make our home in a place where the government encouraged us to go to, and then it's sort of changed its mind and started treating us as if we'd caused all the problems in the whole country.",
        "Do you feel that the pullout is in any way going to lead to greater possibility for peace in the region?",
        "We don't really think so.",

        "I mean, we've got mosques standing in Israel that no one would dare destroy.",
        "And the whole--even the government, as soon as they said that the graves that were in Gush Katif had to be moved, it meant that they didn't believe that there would be any peace, because otherwise, why not leave the cemetery?",
        "I mean, there's Jewish cemeteries in Europe and all sorts of places, where the Jews don't actually live anymore or where the people who--the families of the buried ones don't live.",
        "Maybe there's some Jews there, but as soon as the government talked about this one unilateral pullout, they started talking about moving the cemetery, which means that they didn't really even believe that there would be peace.",
        "Do you think you'll ever get over this, or do you think you'll always feel a certain amount of bitterness about this decision?",
        "I think we'll probably always feel badly about this decision.",
        "I mean, we'll probably go on with our lives, we'll rebuild personally, but I think it's a sore in the--for the whole country actually.",
        "It's like something's been cut off, some part of--you know, the tip of your finger or something.",

        "Maybe you could describe what it was like, first of all, in Gaza yesterday when the last Israeli troops left.",
        "Yeah, it was quite a scene.",
        "I visited about a half dozen of the former settlement areas, starting in Netzarim, which is up near the north and near Gaza City.",
        "And it was--just tens of thousands of Palestinians had been coming in since just after dawn and picking through these giant piles of rubble that were once homes just as recently as three weeks ago, and scaling the former synagogue buildings and planting partisan banners on top of them of Hamas, of Islamic Jihad, of the ruling Fatah movement, walking out of these places on roads that they've never even been allowed to walk along.",
        "They've never been allowed to get remotely close to some of these places and have been--you're just consumed by curiosity for years and years.",

        "They were looking for souvenirs and things to sell in flea markets, everything from street lights to electrical cord being torn out of walls.",
        "And so it was just sort of a giant mixture of--a giant scavenger hunt as well as a sort of venue for celebration in a number of these places, and a lot of happiness but also some unease from Palestinians who didn't like to see, I think, a lot of their fellow citizens, you know, sort of picking through rubble left by Israel.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's not a great message to be sending out and sort of, I think, hindered some of the celebration for some of the Palestinians in there.",

        "What about the burning of the synagogues?",
        "Tell us something about that, Scott.",
        "Yeah.",
        "There was sort of a tacit agreement.",
        "As your previous guest pointed out, this was a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from Gaza after 38 years.",
        "Gaza was taken in the 1967 Middle East war by Israel in fighting against Egypt and Syria and Jordan, and it had remained there and built these settlements both for defensive reasons and also to settle land that was considered part of Greater Israel.",
        "They were going to leave.",
        "Basically the agreement was that Israel would destroy all of the buildings that were not going to be of any use to the Palestinian Authority and did that to a large degree.",
        "They left behind 4,000 greenhouses that were purchased by a private foundation.",
        "They were going to be passed over to the Palestinians--that's really the most valuable asset that Israel left behind, a real backbone of the agricultural economy there--and destroyed all of the homes, largely to prevent inter-Palestinian fighting over who gets to live in them and those sorts of things.",
        "I mean, if there was some scuffling over mounds of rubble yesterday, you can only imagine what it might have been like if there were actually homes standing there in a very densely populated and poor coastal strip--how much demand there would have been for those.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Scott, we've got a lot of questions for you about security in Gaza, the economic future there.",
        "If you'll hold on, I'm going to come back to you after a short break and we'll continue the discussion.",

        "Scott, I wanted to ask you about security in Gaza now.",
        "We were talking just before the break about the fact that fires were set in these synagogues.",
        "There's also reports I've read about looting in the industrial areas.",
        "What does that say about security in Gaza now and the ability of the Palestinians to make that area secure?",
        "Yeah, it's an enormous problem and it's the most pressing problem facing the Palestinian Authority right now and the Palestinians leader, Mahmoud Abbas.",
        "Their strategy was basically to protect anything that Israel left behind that would have value to them, and those were primarily the greenhouses which employed thousands of Palestinians.",
        "They didn't have enough people essentially to guard everything.",
        "These are settlements that occupied about 20 percent of Gaza's territory, so they couldn't really guard everything.",
        "And so they chose the greenhouses and a few other sites.",
        "But there has been widespread looting.",
        "I watched Palestinians yesterday just strip from the inside out an enormous factory in the Kfar Darom settlement, where they used to make salad and sell all over Israel and employ hundreds of people, and that was just reduced to scrap metal in a very short amount of time.",
        "And so it's pretty hard to watch that, and it's really upsetting to Mahmoud Abbas, the leader, who's really hoping that, you know, there can be come economic lift and that it will help him govern the place, which is really becoming kind of a proving ground for a future Palestinian state."
