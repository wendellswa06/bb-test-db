        "Now just one other question, and that's about the borders.",
        "Israel still controls its borders with Gaza, but the border between Gaza and Egypt, it's open at this point, is it not?",
        "It is.",
        "I mean, it's largely open.",
        "The Egyptians have deployed hundreds of troops there, but they're letting a lot of Palestinians who were basically in--have been in the Sinai peninsula for months, unable to get across, they're letting them come in, and so there's a lot of passage back and forth right now, and it's really angering the Israelis who thought they had a solid deal and that this border was going to be tight.",
        "The Egyptians and the Palestinians have said they're going to allow one more day of this sort of free passage that's reuniting a lot of families, and there's a lot of trade going on, not all of it entirely legal--smuggling cigarettes and things like that--but, you know, it could become a security issue very quickly, and Israel is not going to let it happen for very long.",
        "And so they're going to--essentially they've said that they're going to crack down on that border stuff tomorrow.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks so much for joining us, Scott.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Scott Wilson is the Jerusalem bureau chief for The Washington Post.",

        "If you'd like to join our discussion, if you have any questions about the new Israeli pullout from Gaza, the number is 1 (800) 989-8255.",
        "The pullout from Gaza marks a historic step in the Middle East peace process, but as we've heard, it is riddled with problems and potential pitfalls.",
        "There's fear and suspicion on the part of both Palestinians and Israelis.",
        "Both Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon face criticisms from their parties and their constituencies.",
        "To better understand the political fallout from the Gaza pullout, we turn now to Shibley Telhami, the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland, and he joins us from his home in Maryland.",
        "Thanks for being with us.",
        "My pleasure."

        "Israel still controls utilities, power, water, also the border between Gaza and Israel.",
        "How much does the pullout then really change life within Gaza, would you say?",
        "I think it changed a lot, because, first of all, we're not there.",
        "The Israeli settlers are not there, the Israeli army is not there, and I think you could see on television that the people can roam around free, and I think it's a good sign for everybody around here.",
        "You're right, though, that because of being there and being in charge there for 38 years, we still provide electricity and water, etc. But this will have to be developed in the future.",
        "I mean, there's no way in which we can pull out and you don't want us to cut the electricity or the water.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We spoke earlier with a settler who had to leave the Gaza, obviously feeling very bitter and angry about it.",
        "But what would you say is the general feeling among most Israelis about this development?",
        "Well, it's mixed feeling.",
        "On one hand, people still, you know, lick the wounds of this traumatic event, and obviously, the sight of Palestinians setting fire to synagogues is not a heartening one.",
        "But basically, and it shows also in the public opinion polls, people are supportive of the move.",
        "There is, I would even say, some kind of sense of relief.",
        "You know, we're out, and now it's up to the Palestinians to take on from there.",
        "What a character.",
        "Are there scientists carrying on his work?",
        "Did it die with him?",
        "Professor Telhami, you know, I've read quotes from Palestinian leaders saying the fact that Israel does still control the borders, that Palestinians are still economically dependent on Israel, that in essence, this means that the occupation continues."

        "No question that if you read the statements not only of Palestinians leaders but in particularly the militant groups who are claiming victory for this are arguing that occupation isn't over, but yet at the same time, there's no question that there is so much celebration, venting, breathing fresh air.",
        "And you really have to put it in a bit of historical perspective.",
        "I think we're really not getting the full picture of this.",
        "We're focused only on the Israeli withdrawal as such.",
        "But you remember, you know, Gaza has a population with the highest density in the world.",
        "The vast majority of people, over 75 percent of the population, are refugees to begin with.",
        "Those are refugees who left their homes in '48 that were mostly around Tel Aviv and Jaffa and other places in the south, and half of those refugees still live in refugee camps today.",
        "They've been refugees since 1948.",
        "They were controlled by Egypt from '48 to '67.",
        "Egypt never annexed it, basically kept it until there was a final settlement to the issue, and then they were under occupation for--since 1967.",
        "So it's been an extraordinary period for the people of Gaza.",
        "It's been a period in which they have witnessed no freedom.",
        "The vast majority of people have been born there and in refugee camps.",
        "And so I think when you look at that and you look at this moment where there's far less control in this densely populated area, you have evacuation of 25 percent of Gaza that was occupied by, you know, less than 10,000 people, including some prime land by the beaches and so forth, you can understand the sense that--you know, of some relief and celebration, even as there was so much worry and concern about what might come next.",
        "That's the two big worries: security and the economy.",
        "Let's start with the economy because, of course, the pictures that we're seeing show a place which is really in rubble.",
        "I mean, the buildings have all been torn down.",
        "We've just been hearing that there's been some looting, particularly in some of the assets that have been left behind by the Israelis.",
        "How do you begin to rebuild this economy, Professor?",
        "It's very difficult.",
        "I mean, let's look at it.",
        "We are the most important power in the world.",
        "We have so many resources.",
        "Look at the challenge we faced in New Orleans and what happened to the population and our inability to deal with it.",
        "You can imagine when you have one of the poorest places in the world with very few resources, no national government, per-capita income of less than a thousand, how difficult and challenging it is to deal with that.",
        "I mean, we sort of don't--we can't always put it in perspective, and I think, sure, the Palestinians have to do their own--obviously they need to get their house in order.",
        "They've got a lot of sorting out to do politically, but in the end, they're almost entirely dependent on the outside world in the short term for economic aid.",
        "And that economic aid is not only for building projects but it has to also do with politics.",
        "People are talking about strengthening the authority of Mahmoud Abbas, who, in essence, put most of his eggs in the American basket and, to some extent, in the Israeli basket.",
        "He's dependent on both.",
        "And for him to win politically in an environment where he had nothing to do with Israeli withdrawal--this is a decision that happened before he came to power.",
        "Palestinians don't give him credit for it.",
        "Hamas is claiming the credit for it.",
        "And for him to show anything to strengthen himself against the rising power of Hamas politically, he's going to have to show something, at least on the economy, on corruption, on the peace process, and on all of these things he's dependent on the outside world.",
        "All right.",
        "We are discussing the Gaza after the Israeli pullout.",

        "And it seems like they were flexing their muscle a bit.",

        "Well, first of all, apart from the Hamas is the Islamic Jihad, which blatantly says it's going to continue the armed struggle and the terrorist attacks.",
        "But the Hamas is playing a double game here.",
        "On one hand, they're participating in the political arena and they're going to join the--take part in the elections, the coming elections in January.",
        "But at the same time, they keep their militaristic apparatus and they say openly that when the time arises, the opportunity arises, they're going to use it.",
        "And I think I understand what the--Professor Telhami said about the need for Mahmoud Abbas to show--if he tackles the--he takes on the Hamas, he needs to at least show some kind of a reward, economic reward or incentive.",
        "But there is, I think, a basic principle here that you can't play it both ways.",
        "You can't--and I'm talking about the Hamas.",
        "You can't on one hand pretend you're a political or civic organization and, on the other hand, keep a terrorist and still be an armed militia.",
        "At one point, there should be one authority and one armed forces and, therefore, there is no point in prolonging it forever.",
        "Professor Telhami...",
        "Yes.",
        "...why has Hamas gained support among Palestinians?",
        "President Obama has had so many crises to deal with since he was elected.",
        "The latest is swine flu, which is spreading around the world and may soon be classified a pandemic.",
        "Mr. Obama repeated his message that the flu is a cause for deep concern but not panic.",
        "And he offered this reassuring bit of public health advice.",
        "And that helps make sense of what we already know about preschool suspensions, which is that black children make up about 19 percent of preschoolers in the U.S., but make up nearly half of preschoolers who get suspended.",
        "That second part often left off.",
        "Well, there are a couple of things.",
        "First of all, if you look at the ineffectiveness of the Palestinian Authority in delivering after Oslo--I mean, first there was the economic promise and, second, there was the promise of independence.",
        "When the Oslo agreement collapsed in 2000, there was no alternative for the Palestinian Authority to deliver, and people had paid a price.",
        "And so Hamas picked up the slack, at least on that, and certainly it had claimed that its militancy is what drove the Israelis out.",
        "And in some ways, the Israeli internal discourse reflected the realization that it was the heavy cost they were paying that is, in essence, pushing them out, although obviously there was very little incentive to stay, unlike in some places in the West Bank, where many Israelis really want to lay claim to those territories.",
        "So it's both of these things.",
        "But for that reason, Hamas is strong.",
        "But the second reason is corruption, no question.",
        "I think the Palestinian Authority, prior to Mahmoud Abbas and since Mahmoud Abbas had taken over, has been plagued with accusations of corruptions, particularly in Gaza, and Hamas has portrayed itself as being cleaner.",
        "And frankly, when you look at the local elections, you find that Hamas candidates win by virtue of portraying themselves as being outside of this power circle.",
        "And part of the problem for Mahmoud Abbas now is that, in order for him to gain the broadest support among the Palestinian public, he really has three areas: economics, peace process and the corruption issue.",
        "And...",
        "All right.",

        "Go ahead, Professor Telhami.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And on the corruption issue, I think here's the dilemma.",
        "I think, obviously, if you look at what has transpired over the past few weeks, when a very important figure in the PLO, the former intelligence chief, Moussa Arafat, cousin--former cousin--the cousin of former Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, was assassinated.",
        "And clearly the authority had no answer to it, couldn't control it, couldn't stop it, and that was almost entirely over accusation of corruption, not dealing with corruption.",
        "But for Mahmoud Abbas, who wants to deal with this issue, his dilemma is at the same time he needs to confront the militants--and as Mr. Dromi was saying, to show that there's only one Palestinian Authority--and, therefore, at some point be able to disarm Hamas, he needs allies.",
        "And those allies who are around him, who could in the short term stand with him if he wants to take some action, are many of the same people being accused of corruption, so it's a dilemma.",

        "It's one he cannot on his own pull himself out of.",

        "But support will not come because of the corruption.",
        "So it's a vicious cycle and at one point you have to stop it.",

        "And now we're out of Gaza, so it's up to them.",
        "But we shouldn't look at it as if from now on the Palestinians are left alone.",
        "I think it's in the best interest of Israel to help if the Palestinians want.",
        "And we should start thinking about the situation as a win-win situation rather than a zero-sum game.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Well, I mean...",
        "Briefly.",
        "...now it's all about domestic politics in the short term, and clearly Mahmoud Abbas needs to revive the support within Fatah first and foremost, and then get the public on his side.",
        "It's a tall order, but in the short term, he needs an infusion of funds that will go directly into economic projects.",
        "Certainly he needs transparency.",
        "I think the Palestinian Authority has come a long way with Mr. Fayed, who has credibility internationally.",
        "They need the help.",
        "I think realistically in the next six months, both Israel and the Palestinian areas will be highly focused on domestic politics before they engage in real negotiations."
