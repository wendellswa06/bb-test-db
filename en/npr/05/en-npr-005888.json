        "But you're hearing there are others who actually saw Omar Mateen at Pulse and not on the night that the killings took place.",

        "And yet, another man said Mateen had been a customer at Pulse for years.",

        "And, you know, just kind of stepping back from all this, you have to wonder a little bit, a lot of us have been assuming his religion was the reason he did this.",
        "But already, there are some questions about what role his Muslim faith played in all this.",
