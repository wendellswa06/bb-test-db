        "Now, outside police had grabbed some guy, and as he was being taken to the police car, he said, in French, Anglos - which English people are called here - Anglos wake up.",
        "And then in English he said, it's payback time.",
        "Wow.",
        "OK.",
        "So - what do we know about this shooter so far?",
        "You said he was yelling something like English wake up.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We don't know anything other than the fact he was 50, he's been arrested, he'll be arraigned - that means formally charged.",
        "Yeah.",
        "So, as the police were leading him to the police car he yelled, in French, you know, Anglophones(ph) wake up, and, it's payback time.",
        "We understand that the separatist party ran a pretty divisive campaign, as they won a minority government last night.",
        "Is there a lot of anxiety among the English minority in Quebec about this victory?",
        "I mean, could this shooting represent some kind of mood in the province?",
        "Well, I'm hoping that it's an isolated incident and this person is mentally ill, which is usually the case when you have a shooting like this.",
        "But I would be lying if I said there wasn't anxiety among the community.",
        "For sure there is.",
        "We've been going through this for many, many years, a fear of separation, fear of referendum.",
        "The last referendum we had was in 1995.",
        "And we barely came out of that alive.",
        "So, you know, people are worried about the financial situation here.",
        "Quebec is one of the most indebted provinces in the country.",
        "And I think that this separatist party is just going to add to the insecurity in the province and the financial woes.",
        "And when the led their campaign, they came out with things like they wanted to ban religious symbols in the public service, except for the Roman Catholic crucifix.",
        "They wanted to extend the charter of the French language so businesses with very low number of employees would have to operate completely in French.",
        "So there were all these rules that were going to be coming in.",
        "That created a feeling among the Anglophone community, which is a minority here, that perhaps they would not be welcomed.",
        "Sue, you just used the term barely came out of it alive last time that there was a referendum tried.",
        "And, I mean, unfortunately we should say there has been street violence in the past when this issue has come up.",
        "Well, in 1995, there was.",
        "But, I mean, we haven't really seen violence since the 1970s when there was a crisis.",
        "But despite the differences between Anglophones and Francophones here, it has been peaceful.",
        "But I have to say, I've been living here for 26 years and I haven't felt this kind of anxiety among the English community since I've lived here, like I did during this election campaign."

        "In 1982, President Bush's former top Policy Domestic Advisor Claude Allen embarrassed the GOP with his slurs against gays and feminists and two decades later during the Senate Conformation Hearing he didn't back away from them.",
        "He oddly claimed the dictionary defined them as odd or unusual and he saw no reason to retract his slur.",
        "And now there's the allegation that he is a two-bit thief.",
        "Conservatives desperately need blacks such as Allen to maintain the public illusion that black conservatives have real clout and a popular following in black communities.",
        "Their great value is that they promote the myth that a big segment of blacks support political conservative principles.",
        "In the last presidential election, Bush, Republican National Committee Head Ken Melman and Strategist Karl Rove spent millions on outreach efforts to attract African-American voters.",
        "Melman has since barnstormed the country with conservative blacks in tow to primp the GOP's message to black groups.",
        "Allen and a handful of other blacks have relentlessly pumped Bush's policies on TV and radio talk shows, in Op Ed columns and in debates with civil rights leaders and liberal democrats."

        "Allen did not make the same bold and brash claim as Brown, but he is every bit the conservative idealogue as Brown.",
        "None of their efforts touting GOP policies have helped much.",
        "Bush still got only a marginal bump up overall in the black vote in 2004 and with his Katrina bumbling, his poll ratings are stuck even deeper in the tank with blacks.",

        "Allen may not be as lucky.",
