        "That sort of disproves the notion that oil always floats.",
        "This may partly be because it's getting sort of mixed up with the dispersants and able to dissolve a little bit in the water.",
        "I also talked to some fluid dynamics experts at the University of North Carolina, and they've showed that actually, if you make small enough oil particles, they can actually get trapped as they try to rise up through the ocean when they encounter denser layers of ocean water.",
        "Also talked to scientists from the University of South Florida, who took a boat out earlier this week and found a substantial amount of hydrocarbons about 20 miles away from the blowout site.",
        "And so this is now the second one of these invisible plumes under water that's detected in the gulf.",
        "They think it may be six miles wide and 20 miles long.",
        "They can't really measure it with detail.",
        "But I asked David Hollander, from the University of South Florida, what that could mean for the ocean's ecology.",
        "He said that depends on how concentrated the material turns out to be.",
        "So, if the concentrations indeed are high enough, then you could have a toxic effect.",
        "And those would, of course, affect small organisms like plankton, but it could also affect very severely affect small larval fish."
