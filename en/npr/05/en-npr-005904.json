        "President Obama plans to keep his foot on the economic gas pedal this year, trying to rev up a still sputtering job creation machine.",
        "Riding shotgun in that effort will be Gene Sperling, Mr. Obama's choice to replace Larry Summers as director of his economic policy team.",
        "He's a public servant who has devoted his life to making this economy work and making it work specifically for middle-class families.",
        "Now, one of the reasons I selected Gene is he's done this before.",
        "Sperling held the same position in the Clinton administration when he worked with a Republican Congress to help balance the federal budget.",
        "Clinton-era colleague Laura Tyson thinks that experience will be valuable in the Obama White House as the president turns his attention to controlling runaway deficits.",

        "Daley's also a board member for The Third Way think-tank in Washington, which advocates centrist policies on the economy and national security.",
        "Third Way President Jonathan Cowan calls Daley a good choice at an important pivot point for the president.",
        "Bringing in someone who is a tremendous manager, who has a private sector background and is a true moderate Democrat is exactly the trifecta that will enable them to position themselves best for 2012 and get big things done in the next two years."
