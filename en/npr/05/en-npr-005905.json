        "There's got to be some way to deal with this, and I just had this Eureka moment because I thought about it for a couple years.",
        "The Eureka moment involved a class of chemicals known as nitroxides.",
        "Braslau studies nitroxides and she developed a nitroxide based solution that would only react with the oil in poison ivy.",
        "Then she added a fluorescent dye that switched on when the reaction occurred and bingo, she had a poison ivy detection system.",
        "She describes her work in the Journal of Organic Chemistry.",
        "Braslau says it will take a lot of safety testing before she'd be confident enough to use her spray of someone's skin.",
        "Right now we're talking about maybe spraying it on your hiking boots, or your firefighting equipment, or your backpacking equipment or your chain saw, or inert objects where we wouldn't have to worry about applications onto human skin.",
        "Ultimately, I would love to be able to spray it on my arm, or my husband or my dog, and find out where this stuff is.",
        "OK, so her spray tells you the oil got on your hiking boots, but then what do you do.",
        "TecNu is a water-free cleanser.",

        "I asked Christensen why TecNu was so good at removing poison ivy oil from someone's skin and he said it was because it contains a benzene ring which has ortho hydroxyls.",
        "And then para to that, off of that benzene ring it has a long alkyl unsaturated chain, 15 to 18 carbons.",

        "Your informal adviser, Samantha Power, who was dismissed for a much publicized remark, also said something else in recent days about your plan for getting out of Iraq.",
        "She said that your discussion of spending 16 months or so to get troops out was only a best-case scenario, and that you would not follow some plan that you developed as a presidential candidate.",
        "Is that accurate?",
        "You know, I don't think that is necessarily an accurate quote of hers.",
        "But let me tell you very clearly what I've said, which is that I will begin withdrawing immediately.",
        "I will do so in consultation with the joint chiefs of staff and the commanders on the field.",
        "My best understanding at this point is that we can safely remove our combat troops out at the pace of one to two brigades per month.",

        "So is your plan a best-case scenario, which she did say twice?",
        "I don't think that it's necessarily a best-case scenario.",

        "The tactical issues involve how do we remove our troops in a way that's safe and maintains stability in Iraq.",
        "There's a broader strategic issue, which is the wisdom of perpetuating an occupation in Iraq for potentially 100 years as John McCain has said.",
        "I've been very clear on the strategic issue.",
        "I think Iraq was a mistake from the start, I think it continues to be a mistake, I think it distracts us from Afghanistan.",

        "The tactical issues in terms of how best to remove our troops in a way that's safe is one that I will constantly monitor, based on the best information that I get from the commanders in the field.",
        "But I am very clear that I want to set a timetable and send a clear message to the Iraqi government that we are not going to be there in perpetuity.",
        "And can you think in your past of a decision where it was difficult, where you had to pause for a while and consider what was right and what was wrong?",
        "Well, absolutely.",
        "The problem I had was that you said earlier in your earlier iteration of the question, excluding Iraq and Iran - those are pretty big things to exclude.",
        "But I'll give you an example that does deal with what we were just talking about, Iraq and withdrawing troops.",
        "Okay."
