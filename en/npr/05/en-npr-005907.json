        "There was lots of economic news this week, of course, most of them involving the Federal Reserve and its chairman, Ben Bernanke.",
        "First, the Fed negotiated the emergency sale of Bear Stearns which was on the verge of bankruptcy.",
        "The Fed also became the lender of last resort for other investment banks.",
        "In the past, only commercial banks could get loans and the Fed.",
        "Also this week, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates by three-quarters of a percent.",
        "So, all in all it's a big week for Mr. Bernanke and we thought we would get an assessment from two experts."

        "What do you think?",
        "Well, I think all the way along, he has been doing an excellent job simply because he's had no other choices - none of this was of his doing.",

        "Robert Shiller, the plumber analogy comes to mind here - it's when you have a new plumber coming in your house and he looks at the old stuff and says, who in the world was your last plumber?",
        "Do you think that's the right situation for Bernanke to be reflecting on Alan Greenspan's work, the previous chairman?",
        "Well, I think that Bernanke does share some of the responsibility because he was chair of the council under Bush.",
        "And I don't think that he showed much reaction to the current crisis, which is developing over a period of years.",
        "Am I hearing this properly?",
        "Both of you are saying that he could have acted faster and more assertively, Bernanke.",
        "I think probably, the biggest problem is he's faced with a couple of things.",
        "First of all, if you do that, you're creating a moral hazard.",
        "You're encouraging the bad guys to continue with their bad behavior.",
        "Well, that's a risk unfortunately that we have to take now because the alternative will be absolutely intolerable.",
        "The other thing is inflation , and very clearly the dollar and commodities are all reflecting the fact that these moves are inherently inflationary, but the Fed has to basically make the decision - do you look for the financial collapse or do you go for fighting inflation later?",
        "They've telegraphed that message: first the economy, then we'll fight the inflation.",
        "This is an unusual indictment.",
        "You know, this is what prosecutors call a speaking indictment.",
        "Rather than simply letting the defendants know about the nature of the charges against them and giving them bare-bones allegations, this goes on in some detail, almost like a novella, in 37 pages.",
        "It's always dangerous to guess at the motives of prosecutors.",
        "It could simply be an effort to be very clear about what's going on here.",
        "But it could also be a little bit of an exercise in letting the Russians know how detailed the information special counsel has access to is."

        "Were they unwitting dupes, or were they somehow intentionally involved?",
        "And, of course, we have what's become public - this knowledge about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Towers where there was really a very surprising amount of interest between members of the campaign and the president's own family in interacting with Russians, we're told, in an effort to gain Hillary Clinton's emails or perhaps other derogatory information about her.",
        "You know, I don't want to ask you to speculate, but I would like to ask if - do you draw any clues from this document about what else it is likely that the special counsel is investigating?",
        "It's dangerous to try to think about, you know, what the likely outcome will be.",
        "But it seems very likely that the special counsel will proceed with his charge and will very thoroughly investigate whether or not there was knowing collusion between American citizens, potentially members of the campaign, with Russians.",
        "You know, here's what we know.",
        "We have two buckets of potentially unrelated information.",
        "On the one hand, we do know that Trump and the Trump business entities had a lot of involvement with Russia.",
        "There is everything from Miss Universe to a lot of real estate sales, a lot of condo sales.",
        "So that's sort of one bucket of knowledge.",
        "And then, on the other hand, we know now pretty clearly that Russia was involved in efforts to interfere with our election.",
        "What we don't know is whether those two separate buckets somehow merged during this campaign.",
