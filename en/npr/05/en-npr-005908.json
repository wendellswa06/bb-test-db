        "Though Donoghue poses the book as a mystery, who killed Jenny Bonnet, it's as much a celebration of love despite hardships galore, and the rising call of motherhood against near impossible odds, a jaunty historical novel about crime and love and, I should add, with the soundtrack on the page of vintage dance hall songs, some of which are the raunchiest you'll ever hear.",
