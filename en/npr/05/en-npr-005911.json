        "So you really need to have an attorney even early in your career when you think it's not important because believe me, you can get a television show and be a feature on a show and all of a sudden, if you don't have it looked at by an attorney, they can have you sewn up for seven, eight years with the lowest kind of money you can imagine.",

        "How much do you get paid for an appearance at a comedy club in North Carolina?",

        "or New York, quite frankly, from my estimation, and really be seen by some of the movers and shakers out here, whether you want to be an actor or not, you know, it's really difficult to move up the financial scale because the club owners are going to say, well, you didn't do this show, you didn't do that show, and we're not going to give you diddly.",
        "So on one hand they're right because if you don't draw people in, they have the right not to pay the actors much.",

        "OK.",
        "And if you have a manager - I would always hang out, buddy, with people who were ahead of me and way more successful and liked me and watched my back, and then I wouldn't burn any bridges.",
        "The thing I learned early as a comedian, Esther knows this, too, is that open mic night, like in 1971, man, that's a long time ago, before I did the Improv, which was a big club back then in New York.",
        "It's no longer there, I don't believe, and it was for free, of course.",
        "I did the Village for six months until David Brenner, who was a legendary comedian, said, I'll come see you and when I think you're ready, then you'll do open mic night and I did.",
        "And I blew the roof off because 99 percent of the other acts never went on stage before.",
        "They brought a couple of friends down and they stunk.",
        "But I was like almost like a seasoned vet.",
        "So I always tell young comedians like, go to a deli.",
        "Just practice, get a good half hour and then go to the Comedy Story and the Improv and the other clubs in the big cities, and you'll be 99 percent ahead of everybody else because most people don't do that.",
        "They just think they got to get on stage first, and then they'll never get back to that club in years, sometimes.",
        "Good luck, T.L.",
