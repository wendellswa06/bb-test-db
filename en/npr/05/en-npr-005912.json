        "I agree with Richard that if you're looking for the TV and all the rest of it, you got to be in New York or L.A., but I've done this for 25 years, nobody knows who I am.",
        "I headline every club I work and I make a fairly decent living out of it.",

        "That's their right, but you know, there's a lot of people who don't have to have, you know, don't have to headline, have HBO specials and consider themselves failures if they don't.",

        "So, you know, that's the problem with a lot of people in the business.",

        "I mean, it's almost like, and I don't mean to say this disrespectfully, Carrot Top, you know, became Brando, you know?",
        "I mean, that's almost how much of a change Carlin did in his own persona, which to me was astonishing.",
