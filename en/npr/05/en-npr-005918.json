        "The New York Times reported recently that for some teens, the password has become a measure of trust, the digital version of a promise ring or a letterman's jacket.",
        "A Pew study last year found that roughly a third of teens report sharing passwords, most of them girls, but the phenomenon is hardly limited to females or the young or to romantic relationships.",
        "But what might seem like an innocent expression of love and trust can have some risky consequences, especially if the relationship sours.",

        "Hi, yeah, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "My girlfriend and I have shared all of our passwords for Facebook, email, and I think it adds a certain level of trust to our relationship.",
        "So you can be aware of every message she sends and vice versa?",
        "Correct, and then it also helps if she needs to pay a bill online for me, she can access my email and my credit card account, or if I need to help, like, with her the DMV or other things like that, also.",
        "And I can understand to some degree what you're talking about is the convenience.",

        "Credit card numbers are less easily changed.",
        "Correct, but there's other recourse for that, as well, too.",
        "Is part of it - and forgive me, but - is part of this idea that you've got her email account, she's got yours, so if she did something terrible, you could do something terrible back, mutually assured destruction, if you will?",

        "Yeah, I really wish Kirk the best of luck, but everything seems like a good idea when you're in the relationship, and, you know, you love each other, and you trust each other, and it can seem like this pure symbol, but once it's over, it's a huge liability.",
        "Well, give us some examples.",

        "And then once it's over, they go in and start deleting things and reading things, and, you know, your - the worst of you comes out, and you have unmitigated access to someone else's personal life, and an ex's personal life at that.",
        "But what about that argument Kirk also made, these passwords are easily changed?",

        "You know, not all passwords are created equally, and they allow for much, much different levels of access.",

        "But he also talked about the admiration that the country had for the people of Joplin, for their courage and perseverance.",
