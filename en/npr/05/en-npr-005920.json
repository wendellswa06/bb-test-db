        "You know, the password, I think, you know, despite the horror stories you might be hearing, is one of those last few hesitant areas in intimacy, at least when it comes to something beyond - Netflix is usually fair game, but something like Facebook or an email account, that's a serious, serious gesture.",
        "A listener who asked to remain anonymous emailed: I think the entire issue of social networks carries relationship tensions that have come on us fast and furious.",

        "Now with constant access to us via smartphones, Twitter, Facebook and the like, we are put upon to explain or put up boundaries that never had to be mentioned before."

        "So there are varying degrees of severity with regard to punishment, but most major email providers and most social network sites all explicitly prohibit sharing your user name and password.",
        "They also explicitly prohibit using someone - logging in with someone else's user name and password, and so the person giving away the password stands to lose access to their account, and the person using someone else's user name and password could also lose their account.",
        "And under some theories, if you're using - if you're accessing someone else's website using their user name and password, you might actually violate federal law."
