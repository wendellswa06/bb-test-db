        "It is remarkable.",
        "And the police, I think, were quite dismayed not to have caught any of them before.",
        "So they're very relieved with what happened today, and obviously they're hoping that one will lead them to another.",
        "There's a report coming in just now, unconfirmed, that one of them may have been trying to slip out to Amsterdam by bus.",
        "We had a plane stopped on the runway at Luton.",

        "The amount of activity that's going on--I think they're hoping that they will get at least one of the others very soon.",
        "What do the police now make of the possible links between the attempted bombings of July 21st and the bombings in London that did occur on July 7th?",
        "There seem to be some links in some telephone contacts between the two sets.",
        "But in terms of background, we've got a Somalian, an Eritrean who are being sought in connection with the bombs that didn't go off, whereas the background of the other ones who were from Leeds was very much of Pakistani origin and from Asian background up in Leeds.",
        "So I think one of the things that detectives find disturbing is that it's not a homogeneous group.",
        "You've got people from different nationalities, different backgrounds, different parts of the country, all of them involved.",
        "And the other find that is alarming them is the car left behind by the suicide bombers who did carry out their bombings.",
        "And there's about 16 different contraptions, some of them bombs, which would seem to indicate that they were either being left there for somebody else to pick up, which would indicate possibly a third group of bombers involved.",
        "Have you heard, to you, a persuasive explanation of the simultaneous failure of, say, four explosive devices in the same morning?"
