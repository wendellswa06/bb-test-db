        "You know when you have a goal and you're nowhere near meeting that goal?",
        "Well, that's where the world is right now with reducing carbon emissions.",
        "Scientists have said emissions from fossil fuels must fall to zero by mid-century to avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
        "Now, if we're going to get to zero, it will take some dramatic measures, including much better ways to capture carbon dioxide.",
        "NPR's Jeff Brady is here to help us understand all this.",
        "Jeff, let's start with the basics.",
        "What do we mean when we say carbon capture?",
        "Well, it could be two things - either capturing it, say, from a smokestack before it's released into the air or pulling it out of the air after it's already there.",
        "And you can capture CO2 before it's released from a smokestack using a chemical process.",
        "There are examples of this.",
        "There's one in Texas at a coal power plant.",
        "About 10% of that plant's emissions are captured.",
        "There's another that I've seen up in Alberta, Canada, that's reducing emissions from a fossil fuel plant.",
        "But both of these projects - they're expensive.",
        "They're heavily subsidized, so we haven't seen many plans for more plants like those.",
        "One was recently announced for an existing coal plant in New Mexico, but that's at the very beginning development stages.",
        "And the carbon dioxide that's already in the atmosphere - talk about how you capture that.",
        "This a lot trickier because the CO2 isn't concentrated like it is at a smokestack.",
        "I visited a plant north of Vancouver, British Columbia, to see how this is done.",
        "There's this big machine.",
        "It's called an air contactor, and it looks sort of like an oversized semi-trailer with a huge fan on top.",
        "At the front, it sounds like a waterfall.",
        "Chemist and engineer Jenny McCahill told me the liquid is a chemical solution, and as the fan pulls air through the falling solution, it sucks carbon dioxide from the air.",
        "The air contactor is a workhorse.",
        "So we're taking the CO2 in the atmosphere, which is about 400 PPM - parts per million...",
        "OK.",
        "...Which is about .04%.",
        "And this figure of about 400 parts per million - that's important because that's high enough to change the climate but it's just a fraction of 1% of what's in the air.",
        "So you have to move a lot of air through this machine to have any effect on the environment.",
        "Jeff, it sounds like you would need many, many more of these machines."

        "Yeah, thousands and thousands of them - and there is a really large plant that's going to be built in Texas, but it would take so many of them, and it's so expensive.",
        "And these plants - they create more problems because each plant requires a lot of energy.",
        "So, you know, it can be tempting to think that this could be a solution to removing CO2 from the atmosphere and still burn fossil fuels, but it's really not.",

        "Republicans had a few stern questions, but for the most part, they seemed impressed.",
        "Some of that may be because so many Republicans in law enforcement have endorsed Holder, including ones who disagreed with him about controversial pardons.",
        "And some may be because Republicans, too, are tired of being stiffed by the Bush administration.",
        "If what most senators wanted was a new day, they got it right out of the starting gate, when Chairman Patrick Leahy asked about waterboarding, the interrogation technique of controlled drowning begun in the Spanish Inquisition and authorized for use against some terror suspects after 9/11 by the Bush administration.",

        "His position on the pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich, he said, was a mistake.",
        "He told the Clinton White House he was neutral, leaning towards favorable.",
        "Holder said he'd been unaware that Rich's ex-wife had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Democratic Party, but more important, he said he did not know the details of the charges against Rich.",
        "That was one of the mistakes I made.",
        "I did not acquaint myself in a way that I should have about all that existed in the files about Mr. Rich.",
        "I think if I had done that, I would have come up with a different determination.",
        "Holder, however, did not back away from his recommendation of a pardon for Puerto Rican nationals convicted of terrorism-related crimes.",
        "The men, he noted, had served almost 20 years.",
        "Their pardon was supported by leading religious figures, and their sentences were out of whack with other sentences for similar crimes.",
        "They did not directly harm anyone.",
        "They were not responsible directly for any murders.",
        "But I think another factor is that we deal with a world now that is different than the one that existed then.",
