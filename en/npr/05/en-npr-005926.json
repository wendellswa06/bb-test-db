        "Well, this is interesting, because the person that was first put forward as President-elect Obama's choice for his Senate seat was Valerie Jarrett, his counsel, very close friend, and that's the person that I think Rahm Emanuel was pushing with Blagojevich.",
        "Also on that list is Reverend Jesse Jackson's son, Jesse Jackson Jr., who is a congressman from Illinois, and he has been identified in the criminal complaint that the U.S.",
        "attorney, Patrick Fitzgerald, has filed against Blagojevich as candidate number five, and candidate number five is someone who's backers were willing to raise substantial amounts of money for Blagojevich in exchange for having Jackson put in the Senate."
