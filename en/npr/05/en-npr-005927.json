        "We were looking for a person who could carve into stone.",
        "But we kept finding out was that there were plenty of artists out here, including Mr. Dwight and others, who used the medium of bronze.",
        "This is going to be a stone piece and they selected Master Lei.",
        "But I'm pleased to let your listeners know that it's not Master Lei alone.",
        "We're doing everything in the team kind of effort with the memorial.",
        "Who do I mean by that?",
        "Ed - Master Lei, Lei will be working with two other African Americans working in conjunction to build this memorial, to carve it into granite.",
        "We have Ed Hamilton and also Dr. Jon Lockhart, two African-American artists, who'll be working with Lei to insure that we have the proper perspectives in terms of African-American involvement with that process.",
        "Now, there's a whole bunch of financial considerations that go into this project.",
        "You are raising $100 million.",

        "So I think there's a confluence of events where there are serious efforts to make spending less in the federal government, and this renewed effort to cut Planned Parenthood.",
        "But the effort to defund Planned Parenthood goes back at least 25 years.",
        "This is the beginning of my 26th year covering Congress, and it was -one of the first stories I wrote was about efforts in the mid-1980s to defund Planned Parenthood.",
