        "When you hear proposals like the various sonogram bills - this would be pieces of legislation that would require women seeking an abortion to take a look at a sonogram of their fetus before just making the decision - what effect would that have do you think?",
        "Last week, the Office of the U.S.",
        "Trade Representative announced it was investigating complaints that China is unfairly favoring some of its own green industry sector.",
        "Well, those laws exist in some parts of the country.",
        "And, in fact, in South Dakota, women are offered a chance to view a sonogram if they would like to.",
        "Of course, that's utterly up to them, and they can.",
        "I just think that we ought to respect women, and that's what Planned Parenthood really stands for and that's why so many women trust us.",
        "We respect them to make the decisions that are right for them and in consultations with their own families and, you know, pastors and so on and so forth.",
        "We are entirely in favor of making all information available to women and then trusting them to make the best decision for themselves.",
        "We're speaking with Sarah Stoesz, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood for Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.",
        "Also with us is Julie Rovner, NPR health policy correspondent.",
        "We're talking about the effect, if it should be adopted, of the Pence Amendment, which has been voted by the House.",
        "It's not been voted on yet by the United States Senate.",
        "So we're going to have to see what happens.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION, from NPR News.",
        "Let's see if we can go next to - this is Sue, Sue with us from Tuscaloosa.",
        "Yes.",
        "Thank you very much for taking my call.",
        "It was in 1980, I had some problems.",
        "And I was just over here studying, barely could speak English.",
        "I was very nervous.",
        "And a friend of mine took me to Planned Parenthood.",
        "And I had some exams and found out it was something very, very minor.",
        "And so - but I remember it, after all these years, what an excellent service I received free of charge, and somebody that I could confide in and got the explanations that was good for me at that time.",
        "Now, if I were 18 again and if I were in the shoe that I walked, and if there wasn't a Planned Parenthood - I don't think there is one here in Tuscaloosa - where would these young women go?",
        "Could they go anywhere and receive a similar service that is free to them?",
        "I guess that - you know, that is my question.",
        "And the other thing is, you know, the lady from Susan B.",
        "Anthony, she spoke with conviction and she had an agenda.",
        "She had some ideals.",
        "And I don't understand that.",
        "But, you know, poor people have to be taken care of, and that's what attracted me to this country.",
        "And I've become a very productive professional because of what this country stands for.",
        "I mean, surely, we're the richest nation.",
        "Can we afford to cut out all these services for the poor?"

        "Sue, thanks very much for the call.",

        "Julie Rovner, is there an answer to her question?",
        "If the federal funds for Title X and the family planning services are approved - again, that's not happened yet - but if they are, where would a poor woman in her circumstances go?",
        "Well, it's two different questions.",
        "If the Pence Amendment defunding Planned Parenthood go through, about 60 percent of the money for Title X goes to state and local health department.",
        "So there are other - there are many other Title X clinics that are not Planned Parenthoods.",
        "So presumably, and as the woman was saying, there might not be a Planned Parenthood in her community, cut there may well be another Title X clinic where someone could go.",
        "And, again, they all have the same types of rules.",
        "In fact, I might add, in relation to the other caller who said that she'd go and didn't get counseling about adoption.",
        "That is a Title X requirement that every woman with an unintended pregnancy get.",
        "It's called non-directional counseling on all options, including abortion.",
        "That's one of the things that the anti-abortion people are so upset about, that they're supposed to get a list - here are your options.",
        "They include abortion.",
        "They also include adoption and referrals.",
        "So if someone says I want to keep my baby, they should get a referral to an agency that will help them.",
        "You know, as a low-income person, what do I do with this new baby?",
        "But, yes.",
        "So there would be other Title X clinics.",
        "If the money for Title X goes away, then comes the question of where do you go, and then the answer is not entirely clear.",
        "Sarah Stoesz, Planned Parenthood, about a third of its budget, as we understand, comes from various forms of the federal government, but that leaves two-thirds of the budget.",
        "Perhaps, one of the places that woman could go would be a Planned Parenthood clinic.",
        "Well, yes.",
        "It's true that part of our funds do - that we use to provide care for patients.",
        "So I just want to make that distinction.",
        "It's not money to Planned Parenthood.",
        "It's money that goes for patients who come to Planned Parenthood.",
        "So it's money that funds direct patient services.",
        "And, again, as Julie was saying, they are services such as basic family planning, cancer screening, so on and so forth.",
        "We also accept insurance.",
        "And for women who are above the poverty level and have some capacity to pay, some of them pay their own - or part - for part of their own services.",
        "We're talking about Planned Parenthood and planned cuts by the House of Representatives.",
        "Again, the United States Senate has not weighed in, nor has the President of the United States, so we'll have to see what happens there.",
        "We're going to continue to take your calls after a short break."

        "No, that's not correct.",
        "That's a made-up number.",

        "The rest of our patients are there for basic reproductive health services, family planning, cancer screenings and treatment, so on and so forth.",
        "So she's completely wrong about that.",
        "She said that three percent number is made up, including references to those patients who also get abortions.",
        "Well, she can say that all she wants, but that doesn't make it true.",

        "And that's the thing.",
        "If they cut this, this is actually for those services.",
        "They're going to cut these, and it's going to cut away the things that have kept me from getting someone pregnant all these years.",
        "And, you know, then we're just going to compound the problem.",
        "That's going to increase what they're trying to stop, ultimately.",
        "And I feel that - one other thing is that the numbers being accurate, as you just had that discussion, are very important.",

        "That is certainly one of the arguments, that if you don't give people contraception, that more - there will be more unintended pregnancies.",
        "And we know that almost half of unintended pregnancies do end up in abortion so that you will end up with more abortions.",
        "So that certainly is one of the arguments, and this goes back to, you know, as I said at the beginning, the continuing argument over whether or not to defund Planned Parenthood and defund the family planning program.",

        "But I think there's something to be said for being on the right side of history here.",
