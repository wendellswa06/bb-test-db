        "The Chinese government loudly objected, and then yesterday the New York Times cited industry sources saying China has now cut back on rare earth shipments to the United States.",
        "That led some to wonder whether China was again using its rare earth export practices as a weapon against a rival.",
        "Yukon Huang, now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, says it would not be surprising.",
        "One could also imagine that you were a ministry of commerce official supervising the export of limited supplies, and you have buyers who want them, and you have a choice between serving buyers where you feel the countries' diplomatic relationships are very strong, you might be more willing to be flexible in those cases.",
        "And where you have political problems, you might very well say, well, why should we actually do anything for you?",
        "The concern over China's policies comes at a time when its role in the global economy is dramatically increasing.",
        "Kenneth Lieberthal, who served on the National Security Council under President Clinton, says one of the big questions right now is what rules China is going to play by.",
        "My hope certainly is that the Chinese will end up being very constructive participants in the global arena.",
        "But where they have a tendency to leap easily to using, for example, trade policy to make political points, I think that all of us have some work to do to try to get that back in a more constructive framework.",
        "Of course, to the extent China will now be using trade policy in part for political purposes, it would not be alone.",
        "The United States routinely does the same thing every time it imposes trade sanctions on an adversary.",

        "invaded.",
        "In fact, journalist Ron Suskind suggests that President Bush sent the nation to war knowing there were no weapons to find.",
        "The book is called \"\"The Way of the World,\"\" and as we're going to hear, the White House is dismissing its conclusions.",
        "Pulitzer Prize-winning author Ron Suskind contends his reporting changes are understanding of what went wrong.",
        "What evidence do you think you've uncovered that suggests that the problem with WMD intelligence in Iraq was more than an honest mistake?",
        "What we now know from this investigation is that a secret mission was conducted in which a British manager, intelligence agent, met with the head of Iraqi intelligence in a secret location in Amman, Jordan.",
        "And what the Iraq intelligence chief told the British and essentially the Americans - 'cause we're all in it together - is that there were no WMD in Iraq.",
        "And what that meant is that we knew everything that became so obvious by the summer after the invasion and the president made a decision essentially to ignore that intelligence.",
        "I want to figure out what made this seem so credible to you.",
        "Because we are still in the neighborhood of trying to prove a negative.",
        "You're trying to establish that Iraq doesn't have any weapons of mass destruction.",
        "That was discussed.",
        "It was a great controversy that roiled in the upper reaches of Washington, D.C.",
        "The president, the vice president, Condi Rice, they talk about the difficulty of the Iraq intelligence chief having to prove that weapons that he said didn't exist were in fact not there.",
        "They also recognized how credible he was, and largely that he was telling them things that clearly Saddam Hussein would not authorize.",
        "Do you know that President Bush personally was apprised that there had been this meeting with an Iraqi intelligence chief and that he had given this credible-sounding explanation of how Iraq had no WMD?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "It's all on the record from the participants.",
        "Are you alleging that the president didn't just screw up, or that his people didn't just screw up, but the president himself knowingly lied about what Iraq's situation was?"

        "The evidence is clear that the president knew that there were no weapons or certainly had plenty of evidence that there were weapons in Iraq prior to the invasion.",
        "Let me ask, though, you're talking about one high-level Iraqi official - very high-level, credible sounding - but he's one official, and I wonder if you as a reporter would be willing to base your entire book, say, much less a matter of life and death, on a single source like that?",
        "Well, you know, what's interesting about this, Steve, as one of the folks involved said, you know, we probably should've pressed harder.",
        "Ultimately though what's clear is that once the final report is briefed to the president, Condi Rice and others, the United States then cut off the channel to Habbush, the Iraqi intelligence chief, and then we move forward.",
        "What other interactions did the U.S.",
        "or the British governments have with this man in these crucial months before the war or after?",
        "Well, here's what happens in sum: We have the back channel meetings with Habbush; he tells us there are no WMD; we agree to resettle him and we agree to pay him $5 million that I think almost anyone would consider hush money.",
        "And then in the fall we make a decision...",
        "This is the fall of 2003 now.",
        "That's right - the White House, they decide that a letter should be fabricated, dated July 2001 - a handwritten letter from Habbush to Saddam Hussein.",
        "And the letter should say that in fact Mohamed Atta, the 9/11 hijacker, trained in Iraq prior to 9/11, showing a connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida, and the letter should as well say that Saddam Hussein has been actively buying yellowcake uranium from Niger with the help of al-Qaida.",
        "Are you saying the White House ordered the CIA to fabricate evidence, even after the invasion of Iraq, fabricate evidence linking Iraq to 9/11 in effect?",
