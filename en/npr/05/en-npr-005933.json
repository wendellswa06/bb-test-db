        "But I think what we're seeing is if you look at Tunisia, a country that has one of the highest per capita GDPs of any country in the region, and then you look at Egypt, which is the largest country in the region, has one of the strongest militaries, and in both of these places - very different countries - you see these massive uprisings that the authorities really are incapable of putting down.",

        "I just wanted to make the comment that I think that by supporting the autocratic regimes in the area, what we really have done is created a situation that is inherently unstable and it could lead to what we've seen in Tunis, which is a rapid collapse of government.",
        "And then we really wouldn't know what was going to happen.",

        "That is a very interesting point.",

        "Unclear as yet as to which group will be identified or any leader being identified by the opposition.",
        "There's supposed to be a meeting in Cairo tomorrow morning to talk about that.",
        "But, of course, Romesh Ratnesar, the -Mohamed ElBaradei is the former head of the IAEA and a Nobel laureate for his efforts with the International Atomic Energy Agency and very familiar to a lot of people regarding the situation in Iraq and then later after that with Iran.",

        "And I think has a lot of respect.",
        "But I think you're right, has very little sort of popular support at the grassroots level.",
        "On the other hand, I do think that he could be the kind of figure who could be a kind of unifying individual who might be able to serve in a sort of transition period until you get to an election, which probably would bring into power a group like the Muslim Brotherhood that does have views that are, in many ways, inimical to our traditional policies in the Middle East.",
        "But, again, I think ElBaradei is a figure who has credibility in part because he has been critical of the United States in the past when he was at the IAEA.",
        "And I think that helps him despite the fact that he's been out of the country as long as he has helps him sort of unify some of these other forces that have been working within Egypt for the last several years.",
