        "Ralph, thanks very much for the call.",
        "And you mentioned the Muslim Brotherhood, probably the best organized of the opposition groups in part because it has been so routinely cracked down upon by the Mubarak regime, and before it the Sadat regime.",
        "And this is the organization that spawned some of the ideologues who inspired Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawihiri, whos his number two and some would argue the brains of al-Qaida.",
        "And youre okay with the idea that they might be elected come September?",
        "Well, I think the Muslim Brotherhood, in Egypt at least, I think, has evolved from some of its more radical positions that it held even, you know, a decade ago, in part because the Brotherhood now does have a presence in the Egyptian parliament.",
        "They have had to enter, to some extent, the political mainstream.",
        "And that tends to moderate some of the positions of these kinds of groups once they actually have some responsibility and have to deliver on their promises.",
        "I think there would be a rocky period; I think theres no question.",
        "But the alternative is a continued situation of basic unrest and potentially an even more dangerous outcome if Mubarak or folks associated with Mubarak continue to stay in power and use force to preserve it.",

        "Thank you so much.",
        "I think one of the things we sometimes lack in our situation is clarity.",
        "I think our best interest is served when we say, hey, listen, we support an open and democratic process thats reasonably done, that meets reasonable expectations for the representation of the people come what may, right?",
        "I think we have to say were open to whatever you decide is your future.",
        "But that said, I think we can be clear and say, here are some things we can support, here are some things we cant.",
        "We cant support you if youre going to be oppressive, if youre going to come down on freedom of the press, on freedom of speech, on freedom of religion.",
        "I think we all too often draw a line in the sand that say well support this government, but I think were never really clear about what parts of it were okay with and what parts were not okay, because were unwilling to draw a line in the sand and say this is whats important to us as a nation, and we cant support you and wont support if you start to take on those attributes that the Mubarak government already obviously has and who's created this situation.",
        "Egypt is the number two recipient of U.S.",
        "foreign aid, behind the state of Israel.",
        "A great percentage of that almost all of it, in fact is a direct result of the Camp David peace agreement with Israel.",
        "And of course both governments get about I think $1 billion a year as a result of that agreement to keep it in place.",
        "And I think what happens is we dont foresee the consequences of our support, and then when they show up we sit there surprised, going, boy, this isnt what we asked for.",
        "We didnt think Hamas would come to power.",
        "We didnt think the Brotherhood would come to power.",
        "I think we need to say you can have anybody you want in power, but were not going to play the same game on the same terms with different governments.",
        "Theres going to be consequences for your decisions, and we simply need to be clear about what they are as a nation.",

        "Well, a couple of points.",
        "One is that I think the caller is right that when you are seen to be supporting a regime that is autocratic, thats suppressing basic liberties and political freedoms, you tend to be guilty by association.",
        "And I think what were seeing in Egypt today is that despite the fact that the Obama administration is making an attempt to reach out to the people and say that we are on the side of reform and openness in democracy, until there is a clear break from Mubarak, I think people assume that we are still hedging our bets and basically still supporting him.",
        "And that is a real problem for us going forward.",
        "I think the other point is also correct, which is that the stability that we ostensibly have tried to promote in the region has been a illusion, because the regimes like the Mubarak regime have maintained their power in part by suppressing opposition groups and fueling exactly the kind of radicalization that we want to avoid.",
        "Joseph, thanks very much for the call.",

        "dollars for oil.",
        "If in fact we dont back that up, theyre going to change they could easily change to a different currency.",
        "Once they do that, the United States has no value left at all for their currency.",
        "So I just want to I dont know the answer to anything for that, but I just know that its a fact about this stuff.",
        "You follow what Im saying?",
        "The oil is demarcated in dollars, not in euros or anything else.",
        "But is that a factor?",
        "Everywhere in the world you want to buy oil, youve got to transfer it for U.S.",
        "dollars.",
