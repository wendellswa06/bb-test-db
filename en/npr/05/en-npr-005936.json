        "But everybody thought that he would run again in the February 2011 elections.",
        "His poll numbers, while not as good as they had been, and of course, he has won the last, he was first elected in 1989.",
        "His last three elections, he got over 70 percent of the vote.",
        "But his numbers have gone down.",
        "There are hiring scandals in Chicago.",
        "There is some corruption.",
        "But I think by all accounts, Chicago is a much better place since he was first elected in '89, you know, than it was before.",
        "So he's done really considered a good job.",
        "Time magazine once said that of all the big-city mayors, he is the best, the most effective, but his numbers are down.",
        "The first time we got an inkling of some kind of a change was back I guess in April, when Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, talked about, well, you know, my real dream job is to be mayor of Chicago.",
        "And then you wondered whether Daley would run again.",
        "But the whole - the announcement yesterday was a big surprise.",
        "Well, there is a lot of speculation that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel will attempt to replace Mayor Daley.",
        "That's being fed by what Emanuel himself said to Charlie Rose in April of this year.",
        "First of all, let me say it this way: I hope Mayor Daley seeks reelection.",
        "I will work and support him if he seeks reelection.",
        "But if Mayor Daley doesn't, one day I would like to run for mayor of the city of Chicago.",
        "That's always been an aspiration of mine, even when I was in the House of Representatives.",
        "So does anyone think he will?",
        "Well, he certainly has the opportunity.",
        "I mean, he said he would not run against Daley, and of course, Daley is not going to run again.",
        "There are other strong candidates.",
        "The Cook County sheriff, Tom Dart, is considered perhaps another very strong candidate.",
        "But here's the thing.",
        "There's always a thought that there might be some changes in the White House after November 2nd, especially if the Republicans pick up a sizable number of House and Senate seats and gubernatorial seats, which still looks likely some 55 days out before the election.",
        "So one of the casualties, or one of the departures, could have been, may have been, thought to be, was Rahm Emanuel.",
        "Whether he walks in, waltzes into the Chicago City Hall is a good question because he is not the most beloved person, shall we say.",
        "And, you know, he's a kind of a tyrannical figure.",
        "He's..."

        "It's a very powerful mayoralty.",
        "But again, it won't be a cakewalk.",
        "But he's got to decide, right?",
        "He's got to decide by mid-November.",
        "Mid-November.",

        "The Times said November 30th.",
        "Whatever it is, it is a November deadline to get on the February 22nd ballot, and the guessing is, is that Emanuel does it, does it, yes.",

        "Senator Lisa Murkowski had conceded the Republican primary there to her rival, Joe Miller, who was backed by the Tea Party Express.",
        "Now it sounds, though, like Murkowski might have a plan B?",
        "Well, she did say, she did say that - first of all, she said I'm not a quitter.",
        "And a lot of us wondered whether that meant she's going to still try to keep her seat, or she was trying to give a little jab at Sarah Palin, who of course everybody is reminded was a quitter by leaving the governorship because there is a rivalry, as you know, between the Murkowski family and Sarah Palin.",
        "But she did say that she's not - a lot of her supporters do not want her to, you know, to drop out of the race completely.",
        "There is an opportunity perhaps as the Libertarian candidate.",
        "There's a guy by the name of David Haase, who Lisa Murkowski met with yesterday, and while the Libertarian Party, and Lisa Murkowski, the views of the two are not exactly in synch - Lisa Murkowski's more of an establishment Republican, far less Libertarian than some Libertarians would like - there is an opportunity, they think, for her if she wanted to keep her seat or at least an attempt to keep her seat would be for David Haase to drop out and then Lisa Murkowski taking his place.",
        "All right.",
        "So tell us, why should Delaware Republicans support Mike Castle as he tries to move from the House to the Senate?",
        "She has, or Haase has, until September 15th to withdraw as a candidate, and then of course the party has to accept her, and that's still to be determined."
