        "And what we're doing is we are educating the people on the issues and empowering them so that when they go to the polls, they'll make the right decision.",
        "There's been a storyline advanced here that the Republican establishment never saw it coming in Alaska, and they're determined not to let it be repeated in Delaware.",
