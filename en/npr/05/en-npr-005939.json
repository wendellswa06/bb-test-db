        "And it's time that the church see that, you know, not everybody is Catholic in Ireland anymore, like I suppose they thought they used to be.",
        "Is this a specific response to the many cases of abuse of people by clergy that have come out in recent years, or is it a broader point that you're trying to make?",
        "Yeah, it's a much broader point.",
