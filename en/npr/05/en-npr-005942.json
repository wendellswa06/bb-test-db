        "In his new book, \"\"The Invention of Air,\"\" Steven Johnson traces oxygen's path from that early algae soup to Priestley's 18th-century experiments, and he tells the story of his deep scientific and religious influence and those influences on many of the American founding fathers.",
        "Joining me now to talk more about Priestley, oxygen and the rich science culture of early America, here's Steven Johnson, author of \"\"The Invention of Air: A Story of Science, Faith, Revolution and the Birth of America.\"\" He's here in our New York studios.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I think that was one of the kind of dominant initial questions that I had, was, how was someone like Priestley - how did he managed to be so innovative in so many different fields at the same time?",
        "It's just - his story is really an extraordinary one, and if you look back at this period that the book kind of traces from basically '65 to when he dies in 1804, he manages to make all these amazing breakthroughs in all these different fields.",
        "And it's that kind of connective thinking, connective intelligence, that the book is really celebrating.",
        "(As Spark) Yeah.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "That's right.",
        "He was a compulsive sharer.",
        "It's another one of the themes of the book.",

        "He was a great popularizer of ideas.",

        "Well, he was very close to Franklin, and in some ways - one of the ways I got to this story and one of the key themes of it is his connection to the American founding fathers.",
        "I'd known a little bit about Priestley and his investigations into oxygen and a few things, but when I found out that he was as close as he was to Franklin - Franklin was in London, you know, for many years, and he struck up this extraordinary friendship with Priestley.",
        "Franklin spent his last day, before kind of being exiled from his second home in London to go back to support the Revolutionary War, he spent that last day with Priestley.",
        "And when I found out that Priestley had this connection to the founders and to Franklin, I realized that this was a story not just about scientific breakthrough, but about politics and about the American experience as well.",

        "And Priestley supported the American Revolution.",

        "I'm sure that the British didn't take it so kindly.",
        "Well, he grew - you know, it's interesting.",
        "Priestley, he was an enormously kind of generous and optimistic guy, who, by the 1790s, became in some ways the most hated man in England, in part for his support of the American cause, in part for his radical religious beliefs, and in part for his eventual support for the French Revolution.",
        "So, he had this very unusual kind of evolution of his positions and his kind of relationship with the general public over that period.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And he kept up his writings, and he wrote the Thomas Jefferson and people like that about his views?",
        "(Laughing) He was an unbelievably prolific guy.",
        "I mean, he wrote something like 500 books and pamphlets over the course of his life.",
        "Amazing."

        "It's just incredible to think about.",
        "And apparently, he had - Jefferson wrote, actually, that Priestley was one of his great heroes and that, in fact, Priestly had had the most significant impact on Jefferson's religious views.",
        "In what way?",
        "Well, Priestley had kind of co-founded the Unitarian Church in England and had written extensively on the history of Christianity.",
        "And basically, he'd written this, kind of, empirical version of Christianity, where he went through and said, listen, the original message is Christ is this very important thing, and there's great merit in that, and he considered himself a devout Christian.",
        "But Priestley believed that the faith had been kind of distorted by the addition of, kind of, supernatural materials over the years, and so, he wrote this book, \"\"A History of the Corruptions of Christianity,\"\" and that book transformed Jefferson's life.",
        "And Jefferson wrote - created this famous Jefferson's Bible, where he edited out all these supernatural elements, and that was directly influenced by Priestley's vision of the world.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Talking with us, Steven Johnson, author of the \"\"Invention of Air,\"\" on Science Friday from NPR News.",
        "Did he separate science from religion?",
        "Was he able to do that?",
        "I think part of what makes him important to us now is that he - not only did he not do it, he didn't want to do it, and that he saw those worlds as related to each other and as reconcilable on some level.",
        "He believed that the great march of progress over the preceding years, the centuries of the Enlightenment, were really, you know, the great emblem of, kind of, God's will on Earth that we were able to see more and more.",
        "He never totally persuaded Franklin of that, who was less religious than either Jefferson or Priestley.",
        "But I think that was the model of, kind of, reconciliation between the two that really influenced Jefferson a great deal.",

        "All three of them were sort of renaissance people, weren't they?",
        "Yeah, I mean, absolutely.",
        "Although, in a funny way, I think we shouldn't use the word \"\"renaissance,\"\" because what's important about - one of the things that's important about what Priestley introduced is that he introduced in many ways this idea of enlightenment progress, this idea that society was on this kind of permanent movement upwards in science and technology, and we were just going to learn more and more and more about the world.",
        "And if you go back and look at kind of the Renaissance, the view of the world at that point was much more cyclical.",
        "There was this kind of new flowering of intellectual activity that was happening, but no doubt, it was going to go away and there would be another Dark Ages.",
        "And it was really only with the Enlightenment that we start to see this idea that we're on this permanent, kind of, escalator upwards and we're going to understand - each generation will understand more about the world than the generation before it.",

        "Well, one way was the coffee house, a very important, you know, player in enlightenment culture, particularly in London.",
        "It became this interesting, kind of, melting-pot space, where people would come together with very different backgrounds and hang out in this, kind of, public space, drinking coffee."

        "And so, he decided that he would start conducting experiments, and the people at the brewery were very nice and let this kind of strange minister come over and do these things.",
        "And he found that if he passed, kind of, water back and forth between two glasses over the beer, he would get this, kind of, delightful taste of, like, certain mountain spring waters that people had experienced.",

        "What Priestly needed was leisure time; he needed leisure time to kind of pursuit these, you know, eccentric investigations that he had, and in a sense, the price of leisure time is paid in energy.",
        "When you have a society that has a lot of energy flowing through it, as England did at that point - thanks to industrialization, there was a lot of money being made because of that energy - and he managed to fall in with these folks in Birmingham called the Lunar Society, a bunch of rising industrialists, who basically said, this guy is a genius; we should just, you know, pay his bills and occasionally ask him questions and invite him over for dinner, and it will be worth our time just to keep him going.",
