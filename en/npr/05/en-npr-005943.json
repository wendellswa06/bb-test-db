        "Did he understand, or did scientists understand, at the time how important oxygen was in the history of the world?",
        "No, not at all, certainly before he started looking into it.",
        "I mean, you have to go back and think about air as a problem.",
        "I mean, you had to - you had to have a major breakthrough to think that there was anything to study there on the first place, right?",
        "I mean, if you just look around and you see lots of things worth studying - that tree over there and that animal over there - but the stuff - the invisible stuff between all those things doesn't seem like there's actually anything there.",
        "So, the first thing that happened is that people proved that there was this anti-air, a vacuum, and so that somehow, air was different from anti-air, even though it didn't look any different.",
        "And then people started to think, well, maybe the air is a mixture of different gases, and so, that's kind of where Priestly got into the question.",
        "And the great breakthrough that he had that - he's most famous for isolating oxygen, which - he kind of gets it wrong, because he wasn't really the first person to isolate it, and he made some mistakes along the way.",
        "The thing that I think is so fantastic and that I think he deserves more credit for, as you mentioned, is that he was the first person to realize that plants were creating oxygen, so that the natural, kind of, makeup of the Earth's atmosphere would be, basically, about one-percent oxygen.",
        "But in fact, for millions of millions of years, it's been 20-percent oxygen, and that's because we have these amazing little machines of...",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "Photosynthetic machines of plants that are pumping our atmosphere field full with oxygen.",
        "And so, Priestley was the first guy that kind of stumbled upon that.",
        "And importantly, the first person he really shared this breakthrough with was Ben Franklin, and it was Franklin who suggested that perhaps it was a broader, kind of, global pattern.",
        "And so, it was a real collaboration between the two of them, and Franklin even said, well, I hope this will stop people from this latest trend of cutting down trees near where people live, because the trees make the air unwholesome.",
        "You know, back in America, we have lots of trees and we're very healthy.",
        "And so, right there, it's almost the beginning of an environmental view of the world, a kind of a green view of the world, that our atmosphere is created by other organisms around us and that we have to be careful what we do with it because it's fragile.",
        "Interesting.",

        "Yep, well, he wasn't the Nobel laureate; his partner was; and the conceit is that a fictional committee at the hundredth anniversary decides to award a posthumous Nobel Prize to the person who had the greatest discovery, and they decided that oxygen was the greatest discovery.",
        "Problem was when they reconvened, they had three names.",
        "Your guest probably knows the other two...",
        "Yep, Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Lavoisier, yeah.",
        "Scheele, yep, and so, the conceit is to try to decide amongst the committee which one really did discover oxygen first.",

        "Had a lot more technical facility than I did, but it was a wonderful play to create a collaboration between the science division and the theater department.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We've had - Djerassi's been on talking about the play.",
        "That's great.",
        "You know, one of the things that was fun for me writing this book is I hadn't realized, until I was about a month or two into researching it, that the story of oxygen shows up in one of the very early chapters in \"\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\"\" by Thomas Kuhn, one of the most influential books of the last 50 years, which I had read many years ago and just had kind of forgotten that he tells the story very early on, and he - and so, that becomes one of the issues that the book kind of deals with is how change happens, how breakthrough ideas happen.",
        "And Kuhn tells the story precisely to show how blurry it often is at the boundaries, that it's very - when you actually have the transition (unintelligible), that it's very hard to say who really was first, because the definitions haven't been, kind of, set up.",
        "I mean - and this is just a great case study in that.",
        "But I feel that he did - the one thing that is much clearer is that he did - he does seem to be the first person to realize the connection between plants and breathable air.",
        "So, we need to give them more props for that, I think.",
        "Thanks for calling, Scott.",
        "Have a good weekend.",
        "Thank you.",
        "You, too.",
        "Yes, how are you?",
        "And my questions just kind of changed since I've listened.",
        "At first I was more into the American Revolution, and I was going to ask about Adams, Franklin and Jefferson and the amazing thing that Adams and Jefferson died within hours of each other on July 4th, of all things.",
        "But this amazing oxygen discussion is incredible.",
        "I was wondering what the guest thinks - I've read a lot of places that said oxygen is actually a very dangerous, you know, thing, to put it very simply.",
        "Is that true?",
        "I mean, in certain forms, is oxygen a very dangerous?",
        "Ah, absolutely, and in fact, one way you can think about the global emergence of photosynthesis, which produced oxygen as a waste product, is that it was the first great case of planetary pollution.",
        "It was - oxygen was lethal on contact for many of the organisms that existed on the planet at that point, and it took, you know, millions of billions, really, of years for organism to kind of stumble across a way to make a living off of it and to survive, and we are the descendants of those organisms.",
        "But initially, it was a catastrophe, and it took a long time for evolution to, kind of, shape a response.",
        "But I'd say one other thing, since you brought up the Adams and Jefferson connection as well; one of the things I love about this story is that Priestley shows up right at the epicenter of the Adams/Jefferson letters.",
        "He really is the, kind of, turning point in that famous conversation between those two men, and he's a turning point, strangely enough, about eight years after he died.",
        "Jefferson - Adams uncovers a letter that Jefferson had written to Priestley, where he'd said all these, kind of, nasty things about Adams, including suggesting that Adams was anti-science and was resistant to the innovations of the day and wasn't as forward-thinking as Jefferson and Priestley were.",
        "And Adams just, you know, got completely outraged by this, as he sometimes would do, and writes this kind of angry letter, and it's that angry, kind of, initial response that starts the real substantive conversation of the Adams/Jefferson letters.",
        "But I think it's interesting in our own climate to think that the thing that Adams was most outraged by was the accusation that in some way he was anti-science."

        "If there's a message of this book, is that to be anti-science is not just in some sense to be anti-intellectual.",
        "But if you go back and look at the story the founders through the lens of Priestley's life, on some basic level, it's un-American; it's a betrayal of kind an intellectual sensibility that the founders have.",
        "We had presidential candidates raising their hand, being proud to be anti-science.",
        "Well, I did - the book has a little prologue, where I start with this very funny line, actually, that Mike Huckabee had - although I don't name him in the book - during one of the debates, when he was asked about evolution, and he said - and they asked him if he believed in evolution, and he said, I don't - I think it's funny that I'm being asked that question; I'm running for president.",
        "I'm not asking to write an 8th-grade science textbook.",
        "And the idea that those worlds could be kept that separate, that science is just the thing for the guys in their lab coats - you know, I'm concerned with important issues as president - given how many important issues of this day revolve around science and technology, it's just...",

        "Exactly.",
        "And I think we have had this divide, in some ways - if there's a common theme of most of my books, it's been trying to bridge the, kind of, the culture of humanities and the culture of sciences.",
        "And there's a lot of kind of productive - so, this is a book about politics and about American history and British history, but it's also about scientific discovery.",
        "And I think that there's a great opportunity for, kind of, dialogue between those different worlds."

        "I mean, it's, like, there was a revolution because of the things that he wrote about electricity.",
        "But one of the things about this Age of Enlightenment, and Priestley in particular, until this Age of Enlightenment, people didn't experiment; they just had thoughts.",
        "Oh, well, we'll observe this, and you know, we'll say that that's the rule.",
        "And Aristotle was one of the proponents of most of that.",

        "And the experimentation is what I wanted to point out is - you know, you don't just look and observe; you experiment.",
        "That's a great, great point.",
        "You know, part of what I do in the book is, kind of, celebrate this idea of amateurs dabbling in new fields and the fact that Priestley was able to do so many innovative things in different fields.",
        "And the truth is, it's hard to do that now, because you have to specialize because science has made so much progress over the preceding 200 years.",
        "But the - it was possible for people like Priestley and Franklin - who had no real training in this, because there's really nowhere to go to school for these things at that point - they were able to do it because there was a whole world of data out there that had not yet had the scientific method applied to it.",
        "And so, somebody could be sitting there in their, you know, home kitchen and discover, you know, how oxygen was produced or isolate oxygen for the first time.",
        "It's a lot harder to do that in your home labs today for understandable and for good reasons.",
        "That's a sign of progress.",

        "And then, America sort of followed Great Britain in terms of science.",
        "They were sort of on the coattails.",
        "Yeah, and - that's exactly right.",
        "And Priestley ended up - an angry mob burns down his house, and he ends up emigrating and ends up dying in American Northumberland, Pennsylvania.",
        "And really, when he came over, it's important to remember another way in which it's important to the American tradition, is he was the first great scientist exile.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "He was the beginning of a long, venerable - one of the most laudable traditions in, you know, in American society of someone whose ideas had driven him out of his own country, and the one place he could think of to go was America."
