        "Did Fink explain in this letter what he means by social responsibility or making a positive contribution to society?",
        "Well, what he said was that many governments are failing to prepare for the future on issues ranging from retirement and automation and worker training, so society is now turning to the private sector, to companies to respond to these challenges.",
        "And he notes that a big part of the polarization we see in the U.S.",

        "But Hubbard says it requires companies and boards of directors to take a long-run approach, and that's the point of Fink's letter, too.",
        "He says firms have to understand that not responding to long-term trends like slow wage growth and climate change can negatively affect a company's potential growth.",
        "Do you think we are actually going to see BlackRock stop investing in companies that are not socially responsible or companies change their policies because of this letter?",
        "Well, I think the response will be mixed, but Hubbard believes it will move the needle in the direction of more corporate social initiatives.",
        "But he does have one cautionary warning from a study he did for CEOs who decide to push social responsibility.",
        "The study showed that if firms and CEOs choose to invest in corporate social responsibility and then perform poorly, they are much more likely to be dismissed."
