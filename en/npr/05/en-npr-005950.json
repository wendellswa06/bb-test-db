        "What is the message that president Obama wants to send?",
        "Well, it's partly personal.",
        "The president said he held and hugged the grieving family members in Orlando today, but it is, as you say, also symbolic.",
        "He is sort of standing in for all the people in this country who have been moved by what happened in Orlando and who want to, in some way, show their support for that city and those families that are grieving.",
        "And Scott, this is sadly a kind of visit that the president is all too familiar with.",
        "I have accompanied the president when he's made these kinds of trips many times, you know - Aurora, Colo., Newtown, Conn., Charleston, S.C.",
        "The list goes on and on.",
        "The president has been personally touched by those visit, and he certainly shares the grief of those who've lost loved ones.",
        "Also, as a president and a policymaker, he has to think seriously about what we might do as a country to respond to these attacks and make them more difficult.",
        "I say, you could have told me.",
        "Four to six months has passed.",
        "Next month is five years.",
        "So we thought if we could go from home to home and try and find these clocks and find out when they stopped, and then measure the height of the clock above the ground, we would be able to get an estimate of when the breaches actually did occur and how quickly the water rose.",
        "To track down the clocks, the team set up a hotline; interviewers asked around.",
        "One researcher who is mapping fatalities also chipped in.",
        "So he's been going from death site to death site and getting clocks where he could at those homes.",
        "The researchers took pictures of the clocks where they sat.",
        "Dirty dried out clocks, small alarm clocks by the bed, on the wall, all marking the moment of destruction.",
        "Van Heerden says many of the stopped clocks were battery operated.",
        "The salty water apparently caused them to short circuit."

        "The biggest difficulty is being grandfather clocks, where it was an actual pendulum motion, and those we assume that they stopped when the water got up to the pendulum.",
        "So far, they have about 60 clocks, and they reveal the terrible timeline.",
        "In St. Bernard Parish, the clocks stopped around 6:00 or 6:30 in the morning as the storm surge crashed over a long stretch of earthen levees.",
        "In the neighboring Ninth Ward, the clocks ran a little longer until 7:30 or so, when a nearby wall holding back a canal gave way.",
        "Downtown flooded later.",
        "The clocks indicate the London Avenue canal broke in one spot at around 9:00, then in another place around 10:15.",
        "The 17th Street canal gave way also around 10:15, ripping houses off their foundations.",
        "The water was steady and unstoppable.",
        "Van Heerden's team has already concluded that two of these canals failed because of design flaws, and he says the clocks give new evidence that the third canal, the industrial canal by the Ninth Ward, also broke before it should have.",
        "That's interesting because the industrial canal was one instance where it seemed as if the city's defenses were simply overwhelmed.",
        "The conventional wisdom was that floodwaters poured over the top of the canal and carved out a huge trench that undermined its walls.",
        "But Van Heerden says the clocks show there was not time enough for that to happen.",
        "It would only have overtopped for maximum of 45 minutes.",
        "And given that there was only a foot of water coming over the top of it, we felt that that wasn't enough time to scour a very large trench.",
        "Not everyone is sure that's right.",
        "The Army Corps of Engineers has been conducting its own investigation into why its levees failed.",
        "Ed Link is leading that effort.",
        "He says he surveyed the industrial canal, and the water over the top definitely carved out a significant ditch.",
        "There's very significant physical evidence that there was significant overtopping there.",
        "I'm not going to tell you how many feet or for how long, but it was very significant.",
        "Would you agree there were design flaws somewhere?",
        "No.",
        "I don't know.",
        "I don't know.",
        "If there were, we will report them.",
        "The clock information is very useful.",
        "I would welcome the opportunity to incorporate that in our analysis, because it would be valuable information.",
        "Link says at least 150 people are working on the investigation.",
        "They're inspecting the levees and canals, testing the soil, building models and going through hundreds of boxes of documents.",
        "He says he wants the work to be definitive and says they should have more answers in a couple of months."

        "That was critical for her.",

        "Mm-hmm.",

        "She brought out a lot of women.",
        "It looks as though the vote in Nevada on the Democratic side was 60 percent women, virtually 60 percent women.",
        "And, of course, that's a strong group for her.",
        "She also did well among older voters.",
        "And people turned out in greater numbers as they got older.",

        "And he has said repeatedly that one thing for us to think about as a country is how easy it is for people who are bent on this kind of mayhem to get their hands on dangerous weapons.",
        "And Corey Ealons, I want to turn to you.",
        "How have you seen the president change over time as he responds to these attacks?",
        "Well, the first response he had was after the Fort Hood incident.",
        "And because that was on a military base, even though it was a tragic incident, he was responding to folks who were serving in the military, so that takes on a very different vibe.",
        "You could actually see him physically and mentally begin to shift, emotionally begin to shift when the Sandy Hook incident occurred.",
        "I mean, we all remember him standing at that podium, wiping back the tears from his eyes, trying not to cry, trying to collect himself as he was giving his comments from the briefing room in the White House.",
        "And then of course just last year in Charleston, he just simply broke down.",
        "He just simply decided he could not contain the emotion he felt because he's moved from a period of trying to console the nation and console the families to also being visibly angry about these situations each time they occur.",
        "And you saw that again just this week."

        "So Corey, as you describe that progression, you know, it's hard not to notice that these were also different targets, whether you talk about a school, a black church, a gay nightclub.",
        "What are you going to be listening for in the president's comments in Orlando today?",
        "Well, I think today is unique because it is an attack on one community, on the LGBT community.",
        "And we know how much tremendous progress we've made in civil rights for that community over the past several years, so I think we're going to hear a specific message for those folks as well and how - recognizing how they've come together as a community not just in Orlando but all over the country.",
        "We've seen them embrace each other and decide that they're going to do something about this.",
        "And I think you're going to see the president acknowledge that today.",

        "How do you think that colors this visit?",
        "Yes, so there's a lot of different cross currents in this particular incident.",
        "But the president was very quick to acknowledge that this was a particular community that was targeted.",
        "He said on Sunday that this was particularly heartbreaking for our fellow Americans who are gay and lesbian.",
        "And in simply recognizing that and describing the LGBT community as our friends and fellow Americans, the president was making a statement about the place that community now has in the American community - not always true when gay bars have come under attack in the past.",
        "And then you're absolutely right.",
        "The fact that this is - that the gunman in this case pledged, in the midst of the attack, his allegiance to ISIS adds another wrinkle and certainly provides sort of another boogey man for the country to focus on as we try to wrestle with how to deal with these sorts of attacks.",
        "Let's listen to a little bit of the president's remarks from earlier this week.",
        "We have that tape.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "This is a sobering reminder that attacks on any American regardless of race, ethnicity, religion or sexual orientation is an attack on all of us and on the fundamental values of equality and dignity that define us as a country.",
        "No act of hate or terror will ever change who we are or the values that make us Americans.",
        "And Scott, the president also met with law enforcement during this Orlando visit.",
        "Again, it's not the first time he's made that a priority, right?",
        "That's right.",
        "He wanted to express his thanks for the folks who rushed into the club and, in this case, did help to rescue dozens of people who were being held hostage there.",
        "We also expect the president to pay tribute to the doctors and nurses who cared for the wounded and the ordinary people - the friends who were in the club, perhaps, or the folks who came out to the club later to help their neighbors and their friends."
