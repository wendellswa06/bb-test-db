        "He'll talk about how communities rally at times like this, the outpouring of support we've seen from people who were in the club, around the club, the numerous people in Orlando who stood in the hot sun for hours to donate blood.",
        "As the president's motorcade made its way through Orlando today, you could see some of the symbols of that community support - large rainbow flags and a sign outside a Harley-Davidson dealer saying simply, pray for Orlando.",
        "You know, Corey, you talked about how the president actually feels very emotionally connected to these events, and he also has a role to play as the country's leader when Congress is debating policies surrounding guns and so forth.",
        "How does he balance those two roles?",
        "Well, I mean, that's exactly right.",
        "I mean, the first priority in these speeches is to console the families and the communities - the local communities - and to give them solace.",
        "The second point is to console the nation, to give them some sense of hope coming out of tragedies like this.",
        "But then the final thing - and I think that you're going to hear this today as well more overtly - a political message that this is something that we can do.",
        "We can fix this if we decide to act in Washington.",
        "So I think you're going to hear that overt message coming from the president today as well.",
        "That's Corey Ealons, senior vice president at the PR firm VOX Global who was a communications adviser to President Obama earlier in the administration - as well as NPR's Scott Horsley.",

        "A cancer prognosis is excruciating to receive and to give.",
        "As part of our series Living Cancer, produced with member station WNYC, reporter Amanda Aronczyk looks at how some doctors are trying to make this conversation a little easier for everyone.",

        "Well, here again, it's really a good thing for Mitt Romney.",
        "It's a big confirmation of his momentum coming out the Michigan win that he just got and he's going to say, hey, I've got three golds and two silvers so far, referring to Michigan and Nevada and the earlier caucuses in Wyoming, and then, of course, the two silvers from Iowa and New Hampshire."

        "And assuming that he doesn't, he's going to have to have an alternative scenario for his nomination because as we know every Republican nominee since 1980 has won South Carolina.",
        "South Carolina.",
        "Democrats go to South Carolina.",
