        "We also remove any indication of age.",
        "And so we're actually removing data as opposed to building algorithms to circumvent bias in recognition that there are certain things like gender, the way name sounds or how it's spelled, which can contribute to response rate.",
        "Why did you do this?",
        "What made you decide to make this happen?",
        "So I came up with the idea the fall after many of the companies in Silicon Valley released their employee diversity numbers.",
        "And their argument was that there just aren't enough women - qualified women and people of color to hire, which I knew wasn't completely the case.",
        "And so I wanted to create a platform - and we would actually have data to validate that this is not just a pipeline problem."
