        "That is amazing to have arrived at that point where European countries feel like Putin is the most stable potential ally.",
        "So that's really what Merkel's trying to get from Putin, some sort of promise that he's going to work with Europe in a progressive way, in a productive way?",
        "Well, maybe not as an ally, but, I mean, he's not going away.",
        "He's been, you know, in power since 2000.",
        "The only other leader is Merkel that's been around that long.",
        "But I think it's - it's, as I said, it was more - it's more of a recognition that you're going to have to deal with him if you're going to reach a resolution in Ukraine or in Syria.",
        "He has become the indispensable leader.",
        "And I think that's why Merkel is also - is going and is ready to talk to him."
