        "Yes, indeed, even the previous election in 2003 was assessed by the European monitors as free but not fair.",
        "The same is true today, but this trend that was true even about four years ago has strengthened a great deal.",
        "And in fact, I think the authorities, administrative authorities, law enforcement authorities, state-controlled media all have cut a lot of corners in ensuring a totally beneficial environment for the United Russia, the main pro-Kremlin force, and basically ignoring or quite often vilifying those forces, much weaker forces that may qualify as opposition in Russia.",
        "Have opposition parties been able to get their message out at all?",
        "But, in Russia, of course, the main outlet that has the capacity to influence the public opinion is national television networks.",
        "It is these networks that have an audience of about 100 percent of the Russian households.",
        "And those central television networks work in close cooperation with the Kremlin, so that their coverage would fit the designs of the Kremlin 100 percent.",
        "Now, President Putin's United Russia Party seems certain to have won without all of these tactics from the president.",
        "Why these drastic measures that make democracy look a bit coerced?",
        "Now two months ago, what technically remains a parliamentary election in Russia has been transformed into a vote of confidence to Putin.",
        "And when you're talking about a referendum, lukewarm support is not enough.",
        "Whereas in election, all that matters is whether you gain a majority, in a referendum, you want an emotional support which will then be somehow translated into a way for Putin to stay in charge even after he steps down as president in spring of the next year.",
        "Has President Putin given any indication who he'll appoint to succeed him as president when he steps down?",
        "Absolutely not.",
        "Putin said that he will interpret this vote for the United Russia as a moral right for himself to hold the government, the Cabinet and the legislative branch into account.",
        "But he didn't say in what capacity he would do this or who he would nominate or recommended for president for Russia.",

        "They went wild.",
        "They were so happy for the simple reason that it put our country, the United States of America, which we all love, at a very, very big economic disadvantage.",
        "And he posed the questions - at what point does America get demeaned; at what point do they start laughing at us as a country?",
        "First, E.J.",
        "Dionne, thoughts on Donald Trump's action yesterday and his argument for taking it?",
        "Well, I think it was astonishing.",
        "It was kind of the paranoid style of the American president that he is treating all of our leaders and, by the way, all these CEOs - General Electric, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft on and on - as stupid and easily duped - as not the shapers of our own fate, as the victims of invidious foreign leaders.",
        "It was a profound insult not only to Barack Obama, which he obviously intended, but to the whole country that somehow we can be taken advantage of like this.",
        "And it was very bad for us in the world.",
        "Trump himself had to concede that this is a nonbinding agreement.",
        "And doing something like this can only weaken our standing in the world, which he already did a pretty good job of at the NATO summit.",
        "David, what do you make of this - the U.S.",
        "not so much as world leader, it seemed, but as sucker on the global stage in this deal?",

        "Because Europe's economy is struggling, the euro has gotten weaker, and now countries like France and Italy are buying a $20 Big Mac whenever they fill up their gas tanks.",
