        "Good.",
        "Now give me a really quick hit on what these two entities are and how they've worked with the government until now?",
        "Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac are basically publicly traded companies that have been backed by the government for some time.",
        "And their mission is basically to keep fluidity in the mortgage market by buying mortgages from banks, thus allowing them to continue to lend money to people who need to borrow money to buy a house.",
        "In other words, if I'm a bank, I know that if I - excuse me - if I give you a mortgage,.",
        "Fannie and Freddy will buy that mortgage from me and thus I'll get cash that I can then lend out to somebody else.",
        "So that's what Fannie and Freddy's mission has always been.",
        "So what prompted this bailout?",
        "And what's it going to do for people on the ground?",
        "Not just people in the government and people in business?",
        "Well what prompted the bailout - well initially, this kind of goes back to about a year.",
        "Fannie and Freddy have lost about 14 billion dollars over the last year.",
        "Again, these are publicly traded companies so shareholders have been worried about the companies for a while.",
        "But the bigger impact on the national economy is really what prompted the bailout.",
        "When you take a look at the fact that Fannie and Freddy actually purchased about half the nation's mortgages, that can have a huge impact if that company fails on the national economy.",
        "What happened over this past weekend was that the Treasury actually discovered that some accounting irregularities in the books of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac to make it - that made it look like their books were actually stronger than they were, when in fact their books were weaker.",
        "Their financials were a lot weaker than anyone suspected.",
        "And the federal government stepped in to take over both of those entities.",
        "So when you think about -particularly African-American neighborhoods you've got a lot of neighborhoods - and you know not just black neighborhoods where you'll see for sale signs.",
        "Sometimes now you are starting to see abandoned houses.",
        "We've even heard stories about how abandoned houses then produce crime, because people will base out of those houses.",
        "Is this going to really help people at the grassroots level?",
        "It's going to help some people at the grassroots level.",
        "As with anything in the economy, it's going to take a long time or at least some months for the real fallout from this to be known.",
        "What it does mean in the immediate term is that some banks will be able to lend more money, again, because Fannie and Freddy is going to get a cash infusion from the government to continue their work of buying mortgages from the banks, and so that should ease up credit.",
        "It should also make it potentially a little bit easier and a little bit cheaper to borrow because banks- when they're not taking as much risk then they can lower some mortgage rates things like that.",
        "I don't know that it's necessarily going to clean up any neighborhood where you've got people going into an abandoned house and free basing or selling drugs or, you know, abandoned houses, that sort of thing.",
        "I don't know that this move is going to have that immediate impact on the ground in neighborhoods that are already blighted.",
        "What about at this upper level?",
        "What about what's happened in the stock markets and in the international communities?",
        "The ramifications of this?",
        "Well actually, there's two sort of interesting or almost ironic impacts from this.",
        "Investors broadly, both in the U.S.",
        "and around the world, are happy about this.",
        "Again, because the federal backing - or the federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac brings a little bit - brings some liquidity back to the U.S.",
        "lending markets.",
        "Will also bring - bring some- it will make that mortgage market a little bit more solid and give some clarity to what might happen to the housing picture over the next, say, you know, 12 to 18 months and going from there."
