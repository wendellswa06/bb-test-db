        "But individual investors - I talked to a friend of mine up in Boston this morning who owns shares of Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac are not going to be happy, because they are going to be in a position where, you know, these stocks have lost a ton of value.",

        "I mean, when you start to get into these economic cycles, the economy sort of goes into a tailspin where low productivity, where higher interest rates, where mortgages aren't being made.",
        "Those things start to begat lesser investments by companies, which begets lower wages, which begets inflation, which begets higher unemployment.",
        "And the cycle starts to repeat, because then when you have higher unemployment, people can't buy, then they can't borrow, then they can't purchase houses, they can't build.",
        "That sort of thing.",
        "I think we're just sort of in the middle of that swirling, circling kind of - to use an unfortunate sort of hurricane kind of analogy.",
        "We're in the middle.",
        "We're sort of at the eye of the storm where all of these things are just swirling around each other and we're not sure when any one of them is going to show enough signs of life to make that stop.",
