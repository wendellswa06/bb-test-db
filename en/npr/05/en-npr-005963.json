        "So you may have had a house that was destroyed by a flood, and discovered that your hurricane insurance policy only covered wind damage but didn't have a rider for flood damage.",
        "So that would be number one.",
        "The reason why I would say it may be too late to do that is that even in a case where someone could now afford the maximum premiums for all the riders that they need to take care of their property in the event of a storm, is that many of these insurance companies have simply stopped writing the kinds of policies that people really need to be protected.",
        "They took so many losses in the insurance business with Hurricanes Katrina and Rita - this is going to be - appears to be another big season for storms, and we're not out of the woods yet, there is another one bearing down potentially on Florida and the Gulf - that many of these insurance companies simply stopped writing policies for hurricanes that can protect people who live in these areas.",

        "And so as Dan Drezner said in the setup piece was that he did it specifically to thumb - stick his middle finger in the eye of every other world leader.",
