        "But there's one industrialized country that doesn't produce much CO2, and that's New Zealand.",
        "Its most troublesome greenhouse gas is methane, and that comes from a decidedly non-industrial source, cows and sheep.",
        "Snowquester fizzled.",
        "Wednesday was more or less canceled this week in official Washington, D.C.",
        "An enormous winter storm bore down on the region, threatening ice, a foot of snow in the city, more in the suburbs, and wind and misery throughout the region.",
        "Most of the federal government was closed.",
        "I know, I know.",
        "How could they tell?",
        "Local governments and schools, too.",
        "Flights were canceled, planes diverted, and throngs descended on grocery stores, picking the shelves clean of bread, milk, and toilet tissue.",
        "North Korea doesn't need to threaten Washington, D.C.",
        "with nuclear attack - just a little snow.",
        "Big fat snowflakes fell, but mostly fizzled on the ground.",
        "While there was pelting rain and a stiff wind, in the end there was just enough snow most places to maybe make a Slurpee.",
        "With wincing cuts being made to government services, it would seem to be a bad time for federal agencies to look too timid to come to work in just a teensy-widdle-bit of snow.",
        "The Washington Post asked did they pull the plug too early?",
        "As a Chicagoan, I'm always tempted to ridicule the wary way in which Washingtonians shut schools and agencies when snow is simply in the forecast.",
        "But the area hasn't had a major snow for two years.",
        "Most municipalities don't have the equipment on hand to dig out of one.",
        "With radar and satellite imagery so detailed and persuasive, you might see why officials would try to close down before a snow, to avoid stranding and endangering people, especially schoolchildren.",
        "Jeffrey Platenberg, who heads school transportation in Fairfax County, Virginia, said that he didn't want a lot of teenage drivers slipping and sliding on the roads to get to school or see chockfull school busses spin their wheels.",
        "But if schools close down, what do working parents do, park their children at Starbucks?",
        "Modern technology makes it possible for people with desk jobs of one kind or another to work electronically for a day or two.",
        "Government workers were cooped up in their homes with frisky kids in a storm, not off getting seaweed pedicures.",
        "A spokesman for D.C.",
        "Mayor Vincent Gray told the Washington Post: You can't really blame government officials for using the data the scientists gave them.",
        "And in a way, the snow forecasts falling so flat is a sound reminder during a time of national debate that experts can be wrong.",
        "As a former president of Harvard, Lawrence Lowell, once warned, there's a Harvard man - or a scientist, economist, and meteorologist - on the wrong side of every question.",

        "I saw a documentary about the lake and at the end of the documentary someone was asking, where could you stay if you wanted to visit the lake?",

        "There's also a group in Texas called Texas Toxic Tour and they've found some of the hot spots for pollution in Texas.",
        "So what you did was assemble a list of areas that you might want to go and see just because maybe you've heard about them, or they are interesting in their way.",
        "Although one wouldn't normally think of them of desirable places to go to.",
        "But there's something fascinating about them.",
        "I don't think just in a morbid sort of cynical way, but I think they could be popular destinations.",
        "For example, the Berkeley pit that's full of toxic water in Butte, Montana.",

        "Bush Presidential Library opened up this week and, David, to you, kind of along the lines of what E.J.'s talking about here, are there callbacks, echoes of this legacy especially when it comes to the intelligence community?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, Bush forever altered our epistemology, as we knew he would.",
        "And that means, he makes us think about our own thinking and be more skeptical of confidence levels of intelligence.",

        "Second, we've learned from the chaos in Iraq that chaos can happen and the choice in the Middle East is often between autocracy and chaos.",
        "And so that's a horrible choice, but it's a classic one in Syria.",
        "I would say, on President Bush's behalf, he did keep us safe and he created a domestic security state that President Obama has basically endorsed.",
        "Now, turning to the domestic news now, the investigation following the bombings at the Boston Marathon, the prime suspects turned out to be immigrant brothers, ethnic Chechens.",

        "E.J., I see you raising your finger there.",
        "Yeah, no, I thought it was first of all remarkable that Grassley just lashed out like that, even though Schumer hadn't mentioned his name, which showed he was a bit on the defensive.",
        "And I think there is a difference here, which is that Newtown had to do with actual weapons used, whereas what does this have to do with immigration reform one way or another?",

        "It was very significant at that Bush event, that President Obama praised Bush for those things he agreed with him on, and one was immigration reform, and he was trying to turn this into Bush's legacy as well as his own.",

        "And I would put immigration passage at about 50-50 right now.",
        "The reason I disagree with that is that I still think there are - there's a substantial number of people in the Republican Party who know that the party has to get right with Latinos.",
        "And so I agree it's probably more complicated today than it was a couple weeks ago, but I still think there's a lot of sentiment inside the Republican Party to get this done."
