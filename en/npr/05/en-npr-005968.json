        "In the late 1990s and now into this century, the trend is reversing.",
        "Blacks moving South, especially to the suburbs of major cities; Hispanics, meanwhile, have spread out well beyond California, Texas and Arizona.",
        "If you're African-American or Hispanic and you've joined this trend, even if you don't necessarily see it as a trend, call and tell us your story.",

        "Mr. Frey?",
        "Well, let me see.",
        "I memorize these, but I'll have some numbers in front of me here.",
        "It's growing its African-American population by about 6 percent over the last four years, which is reasonably fast.",
        "And as far as the Hispanic population, it's grown about 23 percent.",
        "So it's fast-growing in terms of both of those groups, and I would say a lot of that movement into Oregon, as with the whites, is coming from California, where there's just a spreading out of minorities beyond the state lines.",
        "Of course, I'm a native Californian, so I guess you're right.",
        "Thank you, gentlemen.",
        "Well, Joyce, when did you move to Oregon?",
        "I actually moved to Oregon by way of Arizona in '99.",

        "What's the factor there?",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)",
        "Well, I think especially with New York, there are two things going on.",
        "There's an out-migration of whites just because of a variety of reasons, the very--the pricey housing market in the New York metropolitan area and just--in the other part of New York state where job opportunities aren't that very strong, there's this movement to the Sun Belt.",
        "And then of course there's a continued immigration to New York, which is the major melting pot of the United States and has been for a long time.",
        "So, you know, this is kind of more of the same.",
        "I think the new ingredient is a decline or the out-migration of the white population there.",
        "Now for Maryland, you know, Maryland is sitting on the cusp of a major metropolitan area that's one of our melting pot places, which is Washington, DC.",
        "So there's this spill-over of the Hispanic and other immigrant groups into the suburbs of Washington, DC, which are in Maryland.",
        "And then there, of course, has been the longtime suburbanization of blacks from DC into the Maryland suburbs.",
        "And this is also going on around Baltimore, too, but I think the juxtaposition within Washington, DC, has a lot to do with Maryland's change.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "Sophia.",
        "Sophia calling from Oakland, California.",
        "Good morning, gentlemen.",
        "I just wanted to say that--particularly in the Bay area in California, I feel like in Oakland, I mean, a lot of the traditionally ghetto areas where the poor communities are, a lot of young white people are moving in, you know, to be in close proximity to San Francisco.",
        "And I just wanted to hear a comment about African-American and Hispanic low-income people being pushed out of their traditional neighborhoods.",
        "Well, if I can address that a little bit.",
        "We've seen something here in the Washington, DC, area that addresses that to some degree, maybe the other end of the spectrum, in that there's this very high, hot housing market in the District of Columbia and in the inner suburbs.",
        "And these new estimates have shown that, in fact, the white percentage of population in the District and in two of the inner suburbs has gone up as a result of this kind of gentrification phenomenon.",
        "The longer-term residents, many of them African-Americans, are selling their homes for a nice profit and moving somewhere else.",
        "Now the traditional way of looking at this is maybe as a displacement phenomenon, which may be going on in Oakland as well.",
        "So it's not an unusual occurrence, but it means that there needs to be some more affordable housing around for the people who aren't able to live in those locations."

        "I have one quick question: Do you feel that when the communities are pushed out, do you think the same problems follow them?",
        "I mean, if we're being pushed out into more farmland-type areas like Stockton, out towards Sacramento--so, I mean, do you think we're still going to have the same problems that are plagued by lower-income communities out in these different communities?",
        "That are less dense but--well, let me ask you, William Frey.",
        "You're the expert.",
        "Well, you know, there--it's a new community; it's a new environment, but I think there will be some of the same kinds of issues that will be accompanying those movements because, you know, you're talking about a tax base which is not as strong as in the places that other people live and it means that, you know, the services won't be available as well and it could be then, as these other communities get hot and especially in California, we know that the housing prices are highest on the coast, but they're filtering into the inland part of California rather rapidly, and it may be this kind of displacement may also filter further into the center of the state.",

        "But as an Allied Health worker, I see the impact on the health system, for one thing, and the constant time that it takes just in translations.",
        "And just in the ER alone, the time that it takes us to take care of a patient because of language barriers, then of course, also, as time goes in I'm seeing the economic impact on the African-American community and I am--oh, I--I'm really conflicted because it feels strange to have--to not be for the underdog."

        "Well, William Frey, these changes seem glacial, but all of a sudden you talk to somebody like Ken and they happen very quickly in communities.",

        "That's absolutely true, especially in a localized labor force when you have a lot of new people coming in who are, you know, suitable for the kinds of jobs that are available and it sort of changes the supply-demand relationship and the longer-term residents see they aren't going to have the jobs available that they had before or maybe not at the same wages.",
        "We do see and have seen this even during the '90s that there's been an out-migration from California of people that are--have less-than-college degrees.",
        "They have some college or maybe high school degrees and even less in high school.",
        "In other words, there is some suggestion that there is a labor displacement of those longer-term residents to other states where they may be able to get those jobs more easily.",
        "So, you know, I think there is something to this.",
        "Not everybody can pick up and move, which is a pretty drastic step.",
