        "Yeah, tremendous opportunity, and what we see is that clearly, you know, the parties are spending more money, both parties.",
        "In the last election combined, you know, more money was spent on Hispanics than anytime before.",
        "In our case, the bulk of our national fund raising went to Hispanics and we targeted precisely two of the states you mentioned: Colorado, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada, were the central places where we put down campaign and fought hard.",
        "And also we found that, you know, the president knows about these new communities, he knows about--how important they are.",
        "He comes from a state that has a lot of Mexican-Americans.",
        "His brother built his political reputation among Cuban-Americans in south Florida, so they know how to speak to these new migrants and many of them are Hispanics and clearly they're Spanish dominant.",
        "It's been a good thing for Univision because they've gotten a lot of advertising from both parties.",
        "It's going to be quite a challenge.",
        "A cynic might point out Colorado, New Mexico, Nevada and Florida.",
        "And you lost all four.",
        "Yes.",
        "But believe it or not, we made increases in the Hispanic community in three of the four.",
        "In particular, one of the things that the network focused on was new immigrants.",
        "Forty-seven percent of Hispanics in the United States are Spanish-dominant.",
        "And so you've got to speak in their language.",
        "Clearly, President Bush presents a great challenge, his brother Jeb also, because they both speak Spanish quite fluently, and so we ran campaigns, and in those markets we made significant increases.",
        "In Florida, for example, we made almost a 20-point difference from the last election.",
        "In other words, if you add what we gained and what they lost, we almost were 20 points ahead.",
        "The problem is, we lost in other areas.",
        "In Colorado, we had the first Hispanic senator, a Democrat, in over 40 years enter the United States Senate, which is Ken Salazar, which is very good.",
        "And of course Senator Reid from Nevada is particularly adept at dealing with Hispanics.",
        "You know, he's known them; they're on his staff for many years; he's grown up in that community.",
        "And so we had significant gains in all three of those states in the Hispanic community, which clearly--but it showed.",
        "It was a strategy.",
        "We worked on it, we had--for the first time ever, both parties had national polls trying to identify the issues that were important to Hispanics.",
        "And I have to say here that President Bush is particularly adept at talking about those issues of the heart, those emotional issues that Hispanics who believe, as all first-generation immigrants do, in the American Dream, in ways that made them do quite risky things to get to the United States, he knows how to speak to them.",
        "I mean, there are commercials that President Bush shot that almost imply that we're going to give you back the Southwest if you vote for the Republicans.",
        "Clearly those are run in Spanish; clearly those are targeted to the Hispanic voters and not--you don't have same message in English.",
        "But clearly it's a challenge because he knows how to speak in the language of emotion that is so important to many voters and in particular Hispanics and first generation which want to be known and and feel very rewarded by the fact that the president knows, he's out there and he's speaking to them.",
        "And...",
        "Joe...",
        "...it's a particular challenge with us in the Democratic Party because in many respects many of the programs that have made it possible for Hispanics to have a piece of the American Dream, to enter the American system, to have health care, to be able to be full-fledged citizens, to have the laws that make it possible...",

        "The standards have worked and they do mean something, and the fact is that the federal organic label is one of the only food labels backed by nationally enforceable regulations and efforts to weaken it have generally so far have been pushed back.",

        "Because no matter what anybody says, our figures show that he earned 44 percent of the Hispanic vote.",
        "That can only come at the expense of Democrats losing the Hispanic vote or losing the amount of votes that they had had at one point in time.",
        "Clearly, the president understands that.",

        "Well, I think that it will take a little while for the Hispanic vote to emerge in some of these newer states.",

        "But of the data we've had from the census, the 2000 census and since, have shown that the people coming to the newer states, the North Carolinas and Georgias--take them a while to get registered, take them a while to get involved in the electoral process.",
        "So I think it's in the more established states where Hispanics already have a very strong foothold where they'll have the biggest short-term inference.",

        "So this is jointly decided by the government of the affected country, agencies of the United Nations.",
        "And then there's this special famine early warnings system network - it's called FEWSNET for short - that was created by the U.S.",
        "government in the mid-1980s to collect and analyze data from a whole range of sources to monitor the situations in countries.",

        "And there was this feeling that the international community wanted to make sure that this never happened again by creating an early warning system.",
        "And the idea is not just to monitor how severe a food-crisis situation is but what needs to be done to make sure it doesn't reach the next level.",
        "So the data comes in, and then it's ranked according to this five-point scale kind of like categories that we use to judge the severity of a coming hurricane.",
