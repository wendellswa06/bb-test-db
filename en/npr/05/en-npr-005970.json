        "Well, it's a very sensible vehicle for China.",
        "China has a lot of dense, flat cities where there's no space for parking, not really enough space for roadways, perhaps tens of thousands of people per square kilometer living in a very small space.",
        "So air pollution, quiet, compact size, and they're inexpensive.",
        "They're a substantial upgrade or step up from a normal bicycle for the Chinese citizen, but they are nowhere near as expensive or as resource-consuming as an automobile.",
        "So it is a very timely and appropriate vehicle for China.",
        "And it's also part of their culture, riding a bike to work.",
        "They often refer to themselves as the kingdom of the bicycle.",
        "And so that would be a natural progression from just a foot-operated one to a foot- and motor-operated one.",
        "Absolutely.",

        "For example, I think electric bicycles are a very practical vehicle for a dense, flat city like New York City, and maybe we'll hear some thoughts about that from Bert."

        "That means that they are skipping meals.",

        "Number 2 - more than 30 percent of people in the area are suffering what's called acute malnutrition.",

        "They might not even be able to move very well.",
        "They start suffering organ failure.",
        "And then criteria number three for it being a famine is at least 2 people per 10,000 in the population are actually dying every day of the effects of the malnutrition.",
        "So there's one region of the country where they declared already in January that there was famine.",
        "Now they're saying there's a second part of the country where this is happening, and they're warning that there are other areas that are also at risk.",
        "Does a declaration of famine trigger specific things from the global community or from aid groups?",
        "So it doesn't actually mandate a response.",
        "You know, there's no legal requirement, but it's a clear call to action that if immediate and major steps aren't taken, we're going to start to see a lot of death, widespread death.",
        "And the tragedy here is that it shouldn't have even gotten to this point because the whole idea of this early warning system is that before we get to that level-five famine, there are steps that could be taken to keep us from getting to that point, and those warnings weren't heeded."
