        "Earlier today, the Teamsters and the SEIU, the Service Employees International Union, announced plans to disaffiliate with the AF of L-CIO.",
        "This is a major rift for the group, whose annual meeting in Chicago this week also marked the 50th anniversary of the labor merger which created it.",
        "The two unions walk out with 1.8 million members, and there are several other major groups that may be poised to leave as well.",
        "For more we turn now to Thomas Edsall of The Washington Post, who's in Chicago right now to cover the convention.",
        "Good to have you on the program.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "I imagine the mood there must be pretty tense about right now.",
        "There's a mood of warfare here, I would say.",
        "The forces supporting John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, and Sweeney himself have been very critical of the dissident unions and the dissident unions actually are fairly boisterous at this point, and are acting as if they're going to be pretty tough.",
        "Mr.",
        "Sweeney said even before the official departure was announced, `At a time when our corporate and conservative adversaries have created the most powerful anti-worker political machine in the history of our country, a divided movement hurts the hopes of working families for a better life.",
        "He described the departure of these two unions as a grievous insult to working families.",
        "All right.",
        "Strong rhetoric.",
        "Is there anything they can do about it?",
        "There's really nothing he can do about it.",
        "They both this morning gave him letters of disaffiliation with the AFL-CIO, and together they represent $20 million a year in dues, roughly 20 percent of the AFL's total budget, which is already in trouble.",
        "There are two real schools on what's going to happen to organized labor now.",
        "One argues that with competition and with a real fight going on it may actually result in more vitality and energy.",
        "The other school is that a divided labor movement will just further weaken and collapse, and the erosion will continue."

        "How are they addressing this issue?",
        "Very cautiously.",

        "Well, among the things that--and we're talking mostly about Andy Stern, the president of the SEIU--James B.",
        "Hoffa, no shrinking violet, either, is also involved in this.",
        "Yes, they're both two outspoken guys--very different people, but both very outspoken, and both very critical of Sweeney.",
        "One of the issues that Andy Stern has been very critical about and said that he may address in the future is the lack of political activism from the AF of L-CIO.",
        "He's even proposed the idea of backing separate candidates in Democratic primaries.",
        "He has proposed--one, he says that he's also willing to support Republicans, and he, in fact, was the single largest supporter of the Republican Governors' Association.",
        "The SEIU gave it over half a million dollars in the last election cycle.",
        "He also thinks that the part that unions ought to be backing, the primary challengers, two Democrats, in cases where the Democrat does not support the union position.",
        "It's a much tougher stand than the Sweeney administration has taken."

        "It's not just that.",
        "It's really also a much broader argument that Stern and his allies make, which is that the AFL-CIO should force its own members to start merging so that you'll have very big unions able to take on the very big international corporations and chains that we have now like Wal-Mart or Federal Express.",
        "Stern's argument is that with 56 different unions from large to small, all competing amongst each other, they just cannot deal with companies that are international or cover the entire country, and it takes a whole different organizing strategy.",
