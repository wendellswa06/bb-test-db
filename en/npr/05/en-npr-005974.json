        "Yeah.",

        "He goes by the name of Marwan Hisham.",
        "Said he would send you photographs from places that are basically controlled by ISIS, places like Raqqah, Syria, Mosul, Iraq.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you would draw from those photographs.",
        "Exactly, exactly.",
        "And it was a way both of getting around, you know, ISIS's censorship of that.",
        "But also, I wanted to do something that got beyond the numbness that a lot of people feel with imagery coming out of the Syrian war.",
        "And where I used all of my skill and all of my own craft as an artist - to show that these things are really, really important.",
        "I would ask you a few questions.",
        "I would find out, you know, first of all see your height and all that.",
        "Most bikes are made to fit most riders, but we can adjust, you know, handlebars, seat posts.",
        "But basically I would find out how far you have to commute, obviously what your budget is, can you park it safely, or do you have to carry it upstairs, which means it would have to become more portable.",
        "I would ask you if you can charge it, roll the bike up to an outlet or if you have to remove the battery.",
        "Most bikes now have a removable battery.",
        "So there's a few things we go through, and then I can pick, probably out of the 20 bikes, I can probably pick two or three bikes that you can test ride and then just pick the one that you absolutely love.",
        "And do most people expect to push a button and just ride it, or do they expect to do some pedaling with it?",
        "Usually discourage that.",
        "We don't want to sell motorcycles.",
        "All our bikes have pedals on them, and they're supposed to help you, assist you, not take away the exercise, just make it a little bit easier for you so you don't arrive at work, you know, exhausted or sweating, but not just to go for a joyride, although you can do it.",
        "It's just you will drain your battery a little bit quicker."

        "They're using a lithium manganese battery.",
        "I think you'll find thats very satisfactory, and you'll also find that there are, there must be 25 people in the kit business now with a number of excellent selections at descending prices.",

        "Oh yes, and you know, bicycling is actually very popular in the United States.",
        "One of the things to know is that America is perhaps the world leader in the consumption of high-quality bicycles."
