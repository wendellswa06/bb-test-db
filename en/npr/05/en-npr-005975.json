        "But we are a when it comes to transportation, we don't think bicycle.",
        "We think automobile, and this is the result of, what is it, maybe 70, 80 years now of a love affair with the automobile.",
        "We all know this very well - also a lot of marketing about, you know, how the automobile should be your only transportation.",
        "And there are first of all, the electric bike has many advantages, but one of its strongest advantages is it doesn't burn petroleum-based fuels, and this is going to become a bigger and bigger issue.",
        "I think you've visited before on issues such as alternative fuel and the future limitation of the fuel supply and the effects that this will have on fuel price.",
        "Americans are very responsive to price, and we are in the earliest or we are in the early days of discovering that we probably can't afford to keep being in love with the automobile, that it's just going to take too much of our personal and national resources.",
        "And electric bikes are one of the tools or part of the tool kit for transportation of the future.",
        "And it's going to be trains and metros and buses and electric buses and normal bicycles and the electric scooters and electric bikes.",
        "All of these have a place.",
        "But we also need to make you feel safe when you're driving one, or riding one, don't you?",
        "Yes.",
        "I mean, a lot of other countries have, they have places to store your bike so it doesn't get stolen, or they have better bike paths than we do.",
        "Yes, but again, America is a big, complicated place.",
        "In my hometown in Fort Myers, we have a glorious bike path system that has more than 400 miles of bike paths and extra-wide roadways, and that's something that's been installed relatively recently.",
        "That's roughly over the last 10 years.",
        "But this is an ordinary story in America today.",
        "America has been quietly and persistently investing in bike paths, but we have a long ways to go.",
        "You know, the Dutch can get around on the bike path more readily than they can by automobile.",
        "And one of the nice things about the electric bike is this is by federal mandate or federal law, this is a bicycle.",
        "You can use the bike path.",
        "You can use the roadway.",
        "You have all the privileges of a bicycle, and a bicycle is a very privileged vehicle.",
        "We can use the roadways without a license plate or an insurance card.",
        "We don't need to have a driver's license.",
        "We have all of the rights of any vehicle and then some rights that other vehicles don't have.",
        "So this is a very sweet situation for the electric bicycle.",
