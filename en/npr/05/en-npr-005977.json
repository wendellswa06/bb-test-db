        "What is accurate is that the Republican Party put out a mailing on my behalf, which was what I considered to be on the darker side of American political argumentation and I asked them to cease and desist and they started to put out another mailing.",
        "They were quite frustrated that I didn't raise enough money for my campaign.",
        "The only way I knew to stop them was I called the national chairman, Ken Mehlman and explained that if they wanted to proceed in a negative light that they could not count on me, caucusing with the Republican Party.",

        "That's a possibility but I would stress that those are the types of circumstances that only the executive controls.",
        "I'm in a particularly awkward personal position because I'm so close to the Rumsfeld family and at the same time have probably differed with the secretary on the decisions that he's made in the last five or six years as much as any member of congress.",
        "From the country's perspective, the secretary probably is going to be perceived a bit like Bob McNamara was in the Vietnam War.",
        "As mistake ridden as some of the policies in Vietnam may have been at the political level in Washington, the character of Bob McNamara is absolutely extraordinary.",
        "And frankly, the integrity of Don Rumsfeld is very, very high.",
        "Whether his judgment is correct is something that each of us as individuals might have doubts about.",
        "It's interesting that both you and Donald Rumsfeld lost your jobs over the Iraq War and yet you came at it from entirely different perspective.",
        "Well that is an irony.",
