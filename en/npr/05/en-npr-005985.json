        "That one was one of the very last stories that we wrote, and we had the idea of - that when a hose has water in it and sits out in the sun, the water is hot.",
        "So, then it became a question of, how can we turn that into a story, how can we turn that into a mystery?",
        "So, that's really a good example of how the stories came about.",
        "Are schools, Eric, actually using this book?",
        "Yes, we've heard from a number of science teachers, that they are using it in homework assignments or problem-of-the-day assignments or warm-up assignments, that sort of thing, and also, we've heard from homeschoolers and also we've heard from parents, saying that, you know, they look for stories that will reinforce something that the children are learning in school right now.",
        "Now that you have the print version, ever thought about making a video, YouTube version?",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "Hi.",
        "My question was - I'm - this seems like such a good, natural way to get students involved in science.",
        "And I am a science teacher here in Grand Rapids, and I was just curious, kind of, off what you just said, is there any way to make, like, a full textbook, where students could explore different topics but keep it within, like, the curriculum of a schooling aspect?",
        "Well, we didn't set out to write a textbook.",
        "There is a companion book, which is published by the same publisher, which is called \"\"101 Things Everyone Should Know About Science.\"\" And that would reach into the middle-school and even elementary-school level.",
        "And that book actually could be used, in some ways, as a textbook.",
        "So, we didn't set out specifically to be a textbook, but we hope that the stories can be used as supplements to what they're learning in these various categories of science.",
        "Thanks for calling, Ben.",

        "Today, their group is going on a treasure hunt for a bag of candy.",
        "They had a map with the names of the different ski trails and clues that had led them to the right ones.",
        "After going down several trails and up some ski lifts, they found a tree painted with an X.",
        "Also on the tree was a large scratch mark.",
        "X marks the spot, Carla said.",
        "They took off their skis and dug in the snow at the base of the tree, but there was only an empty box.",
        "(Reading) They skied down to the ski school, where they found Leslie Coile(ph), their instructor.",
        "We found the box but there was no candy in it, Sasha said.",
        "I asked the workers to take out the prize because of the bears, Ms. Coile said.",
        "Bears can smell food even through a box, and we don't want them going to the areas where there are skiers.",
        "Elizabeth noticed the big bag of candy on Ms. Coile's desk.",
        "Stealer, Elizabeth said laughing, you just wanted the candy for yourself, and I can prove it.",
        "So, prove it, Ms. Coile laughed.",
        "Are you saying there are no bears in this area?",
        "Or that bears couldn't smell candy through a box?",
        "That's the mystery.",
        "Answer what - this question about, did the bear steal the candy or not?",
        "Or did - I guess, was it Ms. Coile?",
        "They're accusing Ms. Coile of taking the candy - we're going to take - and is her reason for hiding a candy valid?",

        "I'd say they'd more or less came out that way.",
