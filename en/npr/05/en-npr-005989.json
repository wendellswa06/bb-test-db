        "OK, so Domenico, we're hearing the president there tap into this real moment of cultural grievance, but what does this latest poll actually tell us about why there's such an appetite, why that message resonates?",
        "Well, the survey conducted for NPR found that 55 percent of whites say they believe discrimination exists against whites generally, but only 19 percent say they personally have experienced discrimination, and that was in applying for jobs.",
        "Even fewer said they have personally experienced discrimination when it comes to promotions or college acceptance or interactions with the police or in housing.",

        "So you're making distinctions here between people who say discrimination exists and that they have personally experienced - what does all this mean for the political health of our nation going forward?"
