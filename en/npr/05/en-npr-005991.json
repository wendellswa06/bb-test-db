        "(SOUNDBITE OF MOANING)",
        "The first hour of \"\"Wall-E\"\" is a crazily inventive, deliriously engaging and almost wordless silent comedy of the sort that Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton used to make.",
        "Things turn more conventional in the last half hour, when pudgy, machine-dependent humans make an appearance, but the glow of that first part will carry you through - that and the majesty of the filmmaking: \"\"Wall-E's\"\" world, in all its epic decay, looks real.",
        "You can almost taste the dust.",
        "And it's emotionally real, too - enough so that a cautionary tale about the environment and about big corporations that don't take care of it and about getting so caught up in our gadgetry that we forget to look at the stars all takes a back seat to romance.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF WHOOSHING SOUNDS)",
        "Some specifically cinematic subtexts also take a back seat.",
        "Director Andrew Stanton and his animators have slipped in nods not just to \"\"Hello, Dolly!\"\", but to R2-D2 and \"\"Blade Runner,\"\" \"\"An Inconvenient Truth\"\" and the comedies of Jacques Tati and Chaplin.",
        "More than just a nod to Chaplin, actually - Wall-E, with his workaholic scruffiness and his yearning for someone to hold hands with, might as well be Chaplin's Little Tramp.",
        "There's actually a nice parallel between this film and Chaplin's first sound film, \"\"Modern Times.\"\" In that one, the silent clown used the soundtrack mostly for music and effects, not for speech, just as Pixar does here for most of the film.",
        "Chaplin only lets you hear a human voice a couple of times, and only on some sort of mechanical contraption - say a TV screen - to emphasize its artificiality.",
        "It was his way of saying to the sound world, okay, everybody's doing this talking thing now, but look how much more elegant our silent world is.",
        "by only letting you see them on video screens, and they look flat and washed-out compared to the digital world around them.",
        "But there's a difference.",
        "Chaplin knew he had lost the battle.",
        "Silence was finished.",
        "Sound had won.",
        "In today's Hollywood, digital is what's taking over, and Pixar's animators - bless them - are at the forefront, insisting that imagery created on computers does not have to be soulless.",
        "Wall-E's\"\" images are filled with emotion, just as silent film's images were.",
        "The film is being sold as a futuristic fantasy, but I have to say I am just as gratified that \"\"Wall-E's\"\" filmmakers looked back 70 years to silent movies as I am that they looked forward 700 years to a silent planet.",
        "I'm Bob Mondello.",
        "The incoming Democratic majority in Congress has promised to authorize the government to negotiate Medicare drug prices with manufacturers.",
        "Currently, the law expressly forbids the government to do that.",
        "The White House opposes the change, arguing that competition among private insurers lowers drug prices far more effectively than government negotiation could.",
        "NPR's Snigdha Prakash reports on what effect competition has had so far.",
        "One way of judging whether seniors have been getting a good deal on their Medicare drugs is to look at how much money drug-makers are making on those drugs.",
        "Richard Evans, pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford Bernstein and Company says the new drug benefit has added between 1 and 1.5 percent to the industry's profits, or about $2 billion.",
        "That's mostly because companies can now charge the government higher prices for drugs used by the millions of people who get both Medicare and Medicaid, the government's medical program for the poor.",
        "Until this year, Medicaid paid for their drugs.",
        "Now, Evans says, Medicare's Part D Program does."
