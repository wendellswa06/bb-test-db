        "Mitt Romney talked about big themes, individual liberty, freedom, in contrast to what he describes as President Obama's vision of a big government that controls every detail of American's lives.",
        "Here's part of what he said.",
        "Freedom is the victim of unbounded government appetite and so is economic growth and job growth and wage growth.",

        "He sent them a video-taped message in 2011.",
        "But you go back earlier than that to his years as Massachusetts governor, running for Senate in Massachusetts in the '90s and he was not what you would call an enthusiastic NRA supporter back then.",
        "He bought a lifetime membership just before starting his last presidential run in 2007, so this speech is sort of part of a pattern of Romney trying to show gun owners, I'm one of you - that he supports their point of view and that if he's elected, he'll be an advocate for their issues.",
        "Well, what sense did you get of how people at the NRA convention responded to Romney?",

        "And for comparison, President Obama's record on the Second Amendment?",
        "Well, you know, to the dismay of gun control groups, President Obama has been nearly silent on the issue of guns, but people here at the NRA convention think he may be saving his ammunition, so to speak, for a second term.",

        "You know, I've asked people what they think about it.",
        "Obviously, they say the Martin shooting was a tragedy, but they try to divorce that from the larger issue of these laws, which, on the whole, the NRA supports.",
