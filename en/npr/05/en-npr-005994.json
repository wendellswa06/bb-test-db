        "And I'll tell you, it was a little over an hour, the whole event.",
        "It took about 19 minutes before the subject of Reverend Wright came up, and it was raised by one of those working families that he was talking to about economic issues.",
        "And, Melissa, the questioner seemed sympathetic.",

        "I've made a statement yesterday that was hard to make, but it was what I believe.",
        "And you know, what we want to do now, though, is to make sure that this doesn't continue to be a perpetual distraction.",
        "Now, Don, Barack Obama's wife, Michelle, was also campaigning with her husband today, and Reverend Wright is, after all, the man who married the couple.",
        "This is very personal for both of them.",
        "What did she have to say about all this?",

        "Besides the gas tax, what else was he talking about today?",
        "He is talking about jobs.",
        "He is talking about finding tax relief for working class families and rolling back some of the Bush tax cuts on wealthier Americans.",
        "He is making a bet that that is the kind of thing that voters here in Indiana want to talk about.",
        "He knows that these attacks - the Wright controversy, the other things - these issues aren't helping him.",
        "But you can also see him trying to highlight those attacks as exactly the kind of thing that is wrong with politics in America today.",
        "And that notion has been a major theme of his campaign right from the beginning.",
        "So he's trying to turn these controversies into a kind of a tried and true campaign theme of his that has worked earlier in the campaign.",
        "Okay, Don, thanks so much."

        "The process of passing it required, number one, that it meet its own costs, and number two, that it be voluntary.",
        "That is, healthy people cannot be forced to pay in, as they would be with the individual mandate for the rest of the program.",
        "And finally the actuaries decided they could not make that equation work.",
        "That if you couldn't require healthy people to pay in when they still were not drawing from the program, then you could not set the premiums at any kind of sustainable level.",
        "The political problem is the one you also mentioned, which is the Republicans have, through the entirety of the Obama administration, very effectively used the threat of bringing almost anything to a filibuster as they've done most recently with this jobs bill.",
        "And since the administration and the Democrats don't have 60 votes in the Senate, they can't break this ongoing threat, and so you do have the kind of log jam that we've seen in the Senate.",
