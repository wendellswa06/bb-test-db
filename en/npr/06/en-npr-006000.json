        "So this planet has a very fortuitous orbit, the orbit of the planet takes it right in front of its parent star as we view the system.",
        "And the way we made these measurements is we waited until the planet was just about to cross in front of the parent star, and we started taking measurements.",
        "And we watched this event, which astronomers call the transit.",
        "And during the transit, the planet blocks a little bit of light from the star.",
        "During that blockage, a little of the starlight filters through the planet atmosphere and we're able to study that light and find the fingerprints of molecules in the exoplanet atmosphere."
