        "And after he got really rich, he became what seems to be the first public-interest lawyer in American history, and he started to take on corporations that formerly he would have been taking money from as their advocate, and thus he made a lot of enemies.",
        "And former President Taft, Harvard President Lowell, former Attorney General Wickersham, former Secretary of State Elihu Root and several former presidents of the American Bar Association all opposed his nomination.",
        "So it was so controversial, they essentially had to have hearings.",
        "Yes, they had to have hearings.",
        "And it was four months from President Wilson's nomination until the final vote on Brandeis which was, for that era, an incredible amount of time.",
        "And so, I mean, what happens, or did Lewis Brandeis sort of had to show up every day and testify at the hearings?",
        "No, Brandeis did not attend his hearings at all.",
        "There were people supporting him and obviously people opposing him.",
        "So when did nominees actually start appearing at their own confirmation hearings?",
        "The first nominee to do so was Felix Frankfurter in 1939.",
        "And Frankfurter, like Brandeis, was Jewish; and Frankfurter, like Brandeis, was a controversial appointment, especially for his defense of Sacco and Vanzetti during the '20s.",
        "The anarchists.",
        "Yes.",
        "And thus, the Senate wanted hearings and Frankfurter attended but took the not surprising position that his public record spoke for itself, and he wasn't going to add a whit to it.",
        "So essentially, he just came out there and said that?"

        "They didn't ask him any questions?",
        "They couldn't get any answers.",
        "And that was it?",
        "And what was the reaction by the members of the Judiciary Committee?",
        "They confirmed him.",
        "So, at what point did you actually have this process where the nominee would come and sit down and really start to answer the questions?",
        "I think the turning point was Potter Stewart's nomination in 1959.",
        "By that time, southern Democrats were fully hostile to the Supreme Court because of its desegregation decisions, and conservative Republicans were worried about the Supreme Court over national security issues, and Stewart got a fair grilling.",
        "But like other nominees, he didn't provide them any answers.",
        "When you say he didn't provide them any answers, he answered their questions, but they weren't particularly substantive?"

        "And of course, in late August, Hurricane Katrina arrived.",
        "We didn't even know it was coming.",
        "We didn't really watched TV or radio at the time, that much.",

        "And we did on Sunday morning, and we went 14 hours in the car to go into Houston.",
        "We learned, Monday morning, our house had been destroyed and our things, our car, everything else we owned.",
        "And that really changed a lot of things for us.",
        "It changed my social perspective as someone who now experienced the disaster, but it also changed our research perspective because we applied to FEMA soon after that, I think in early October, and didn't hear back from them until March of the next year.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "In that interval, I had a lot of time to think about what it means for our family to recover, for a neighborhood to recover and, of course, for a city to recover.",
        "And you've gone through fairly recent history and taken some examples.",
        "I was particularly struck by the example you drew from the earthquake that struck Kobe, Japan.",
        "Yes.",
        "That was an amazing experience.",
        "I was there soon afterwards, actually, doing an internship down in Kobe.",
        "And I noticed several different things.",
        "One was that, for many neighborhoods in Kobe, the one thing that saves lives have been their ability to organize and work collectively.",
        "In fact, in one neighborhood, they had self-organized a firefighting brigade that fought the fires that burned down the houses in neighboring areas.",
        "But they had somehow managed to work together to get buckets, to get a hose and put those fires out."

        "So the more time I spent talking to survivors, the more I realized that neighborhood had experienced working together on a wide variety of issues: environment, politics, cleaning up the neighborhood and old folks homes - all kind of issues.",
        "And the neighborhood that had watched their homes burned down really had very little experience working together.",
        "That was a clue to me that something bigger was going on here in these neighborhoods.",
        "So the density and the strength of these social networks, you say, are more important than, well, wealth or education?",
        "That's right.",
        "You know, the biggest difference whether it's in Japan, in India, in the Gulf Coast where I've lived in these communities, the biggest difference has been the ability of people to trust each other, to work together, to figure out plans that will benefit as many people as possible.",

        "And it's through these connections, through neighborhoods that we really get the things that we need.",

        "Exactly, and two different things in that story.",
        "You know, one is the fact that, you know, water and supplies that we need at the time are there, but also the way that organizations - whether from churches, synagogues, mosques - pull together to help people they've never met before.",
        "And I think that's a really critical part of this process, that through connections through friends of friends.",
        "In our case, for example, I had offers of housing.",
