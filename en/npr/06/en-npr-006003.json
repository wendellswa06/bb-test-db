        "What's the second kind of tape most frequently requested?",
        "Are the apologies relevant, and are they accepted?",
        "Yes.",
        "And Mr. Rogers told us many times to be a good neighbor.",
        "And we found, actually, the first question you should ask yourself is: How many neighbors do I know well?",
        "Not just their faces - which most of us hopefully do - but also their names, what medicines they might need, if they're in need of a wheelchair, for example.",
        "We found some really powerful examples from both Kobe and America, which is that in the first 72 hours after an earthquake in Japan, most survivors are saved, not by professional first responders, by firefighters or police officers, but by their neighbors who knew where they had slept the night before, knew where, in the pile of rubbles that was now their house, they should look for the bodies.",
        "That was a great powerful message to me, that those people being saved were being saved because someone knew where they were.",
        "We've also seen more recently in the Tohoku disaster up north in Japan that most people had around 40 minutes to escape the tsunami, between the sirens going off announcing its arrival and the actual wave.",
        "Forty minutes is not much time if you're older, if you're in the bed, if you're sick.",
        "But if you have a neighbor who knows what you need or a car ride out of the city, assistance from bed, those neighbors will literally save your life.",
        "So, yeah, the first message for me, at least, and from - in my mind, for the government to think about is promoting the ability to know what people around you need.",
        "Tohoku is the name of the region that was afflicted by the tsunami in north - north of Tokyo.",
        "So that's what he's referring to there.",

        "But I was rescued from the top of my house by the military helicopters.",
        "The difference for me was the fact that I was taken to San Antonio, Texas.",
        "And the people there, I must say, are the best people in the world, because the way they're treated, the people were - brought to - from new Orleans, who were brought to San Antonio, they treated us just like we were family, I mean, really family.",
        "And I heard from other people who stayed other places saying that they were considered refugees and all kinds of stuff.",
        "San Antonio, I'm giving you a big scream out.",

        "But there are certain resources that only the government can bring to bear.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And what we've found, actually, is the government can better do its job of helping citizens when they're well-organized internally, and whether this is in India, for example, where we saw that a lot of aid came in, whether it was food aid, new shelters, for example.",
        "But whether the community can self-organize and let planners, let decision makers know look, these are our community needs, as a whole, then the aid was better spent and better distributed."

        "In the communities that I visited, where people didn't have that level of self-organization, didn't have the trust, it was much more difficult, for example, for the government to get a list of people who needed help, more difficult for them to get out food to everyone who needed it, and to make sure everyone who needed shelter was available for shelter.",
        "So absolutely, we need government resources.",

        "Not normally.",
        "You know, in Indiana, we have block parties, for example.",
        "We think those kind of events, where people get out of their homes, meet new faces, learn who lives nearby, those help build what we call bonding social capital, which is a really a fancy way of saying, we get to know people and what they want and what they need.",
        "Those events in Japan, actually, are government sponsored in many cases, called matsuri, or festivals, there's money made available to local governments and to local individuals who do these kinds of activities.",
        "So, you know, whether it's an informal street fair where people get out of their homes and say, hello, a block party, a local sports festival for kids, a barbeque in the park, all of those kind of events are ones which help us build up our faith and trust in neighbors.",
        "You know, for many of us in America, Bob Putnam has shown over the last 50 years, we've really lost some of those connections.",

        "We join fewer organizations.",
        "We don't volunteer for the PTA.",
        "Not yet.",
        "Now, we've found in our studies that communities that build these kind of organizations, local festivals, events, barbeques, those are great ways of getting people out of their homes, out of their shells and to connect at a time when many people are both swamped by the Internet, by email, by Facebook and so forth, but also really busy.",

        "And when we were finally able to get out of our area, I went to a strip mall and I saw this big truck with the line of people, and I thought, I don't care what it is.",
        "I'm getting in line.",
        "And when I got up to the front, a Budweiser truck was handing out free bags of ice.",
