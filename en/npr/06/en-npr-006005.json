        "I was coming in on a cusps of computers being made with CD burners.",
        "So, of course, the big hype was compilation CDs.",
        "And in my experience of making those CDs - my secret, so to speak, was all about the varying the pace.",
        "It could take anything too fast or too slow, but I had to kind of go in peaks and valleys and end with one big crescendo.",
        "And that's usually my recipe, and it worked pretty well when I was in college.",
        "Fast and slow - that showmanship is - Frank Zappa used to say.",
        "Is that good advice, Jessica?",
        "Absolutely.",
        "You definitely don't want to go from, you know, a really, really fast song to a really slow song because that sort of jars the listener out of a sense of continuity in your tape.",
        "You really want it to flow like an album would.",
        "If you were putting together an album of your own music, you wouldn't do that.",
        "Definitely.",
        "Definitely.",
        "And it was almost - I guess it's the literary person maybe, because I was an English and philosophy major, as well.",
        "So I kind of had to go almost like a plot through a novel would go.",
        "Huh.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "Where you had your climax at the end and it was all great once it over.",
        "James, when was the last time you made a mix tape?",
        "The last time I've made a mix tape.",
        "Oh, it's been such a long time.",
        "Don't put me on the spot like that.",
        "But I would have to say, 2003 actually."

        "Well, one thing that I do when I make mix tapes is sometimes I try and find a theme.",
        "Or you find songs that have kind of the same word and title, like, you might put a tree set together where there's a song like the \"\"The Two Trees\"\" or \"\"The Little Tree\"\" or the bark on the tree, and they kind of float together that way.",
        "But again, I also agree with the previous caller.",
        "You have to watch the tempo and the pacing because if everything was fast that the mix tape a little too phonetic.",
        "And then if you have everything slow, it becomes kind of trance-like, and you have to be careful with those things as well.",
        "Is that good advice, do you think, Jessica?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "One thing that I would be really careful of - and I see this as a huge pitfall, especially the format of our Web site is people send in a theme and we make a mix tape based on the theme.",
        "Aha.",
        "But people fall into the trap where, like - where they pick songs based on their titles more than based on their content.",
        "And you have to be really careful.",
        "I mean, being cute and being silly is fun, but a lot of people fall into that (unintelligible) pitfall where you sort of pick songs based on their title, every song on their subject matter, and the tape doesn't really have any sort of meat to it.",
        "(Unintelligible) at picking songs, especially with the thing of Valentine's Day, songs that would mean something to whoever you're them to, you know.",
        "Often, if we have a shared experience, I'll pick a song that either reminds of that shared experience or was a part of that shared experience.",
        "And that will bring up a whole new range of emotions as well.",
        "Nadia, thanks for the call.",
        "No problem.",

        "Now, I had a conversation an entire breakup conversation with a girl using only Beatles songs.",
        "I would play a love song, and she would play a song of love lost.",

        "And that's really a terrible way to go about it.",
        "I would say for beginners, you want to stick under 12, which I noticed that your mix tape was not.",
        "You didn't stick to that, which - I mean, you can make a good longer mix tape, but it's really - you end up trimming the fat a lot more if you stick to certain amount of tracks that you like to put on.",
        "I like to do seven.",
        "Seven?",
        "Seven.",
        "It's a nice, long - it ends up being more like an album.",
