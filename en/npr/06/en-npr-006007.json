        "Yeah.",
        "You know, John Stewart was passing off the show to Stephen Colbert, and a week ago, Saturday's crossword, one across was truthiness which is a word that Stephen Colbert coined.",

        "So the real victims, here, I think, are traditional families, and here is where Democrats and Republicans have allowed this issue to be polarized, and polarizing for political gain, and they don't sit down and say, these are the civil rights issues that gays are talking about, here are the ways we can deal with them.",
        "As opposed to that, we are fighting over the relevancy of a major institution called marriage.",

        "Some of the worst track records for the survival of marriages, some of the highest divorce rates are in states that are considered Bible Belt.",

        "I've recently co-authored a book called \"\"Personal Faith, Public Policy\"\" with Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council, and we are advocating a revival of marriage.",
        "And there are a lot of pro-marriage policies and practices that we should attempt to institute.",
        "And I think, in some ways, we should make it harder to get divorces, because in the wake of a divorce, you have issues such as children who are alienated from parents.",
        "And there is a fracture, if you will, not only the family, but the psyche of the child.",
        "So I think churches are partially responsible, because the relational skills needed to have a good marriage aren't always being taught in the church or those places where people are kind of coached along in life skills.",
        "Bishop, let me ask you about something very specific.",
        "There is a national gay rights group called Soulforce that is going to protest outside your church, and you actually invited them to debate homosexual rights, gay marriage, with church elders.",
        "Did they take you up on the offer?",
        "Well, they are coming, and they say that this is going to be more of a discussion than a debate.",
        "But they told us they were coming, invited themselves into our house, so to speak.",
        "But we are going to talk on a Saturday night, and then Sunday morning they are going to come to service.",
        "I don't know whether they are going to have placards out, or what they are going to do.",
        "But we welcome the opportunity, in my view, to present the gospel, which I believe is transformative, and the gospel is open to any person, the gospel can change anyone's life.",
        "And I think we are going to hear what they have to say, questions they have to ask, and we are going to ask some of our own questions, and I thoroughly look forward to Saturday night, and then they'll come and hear us preach on Sunday morning.",

        "It's biodegradable, made from things in your diet, that is activated by acids in your stomach to send out a very super-low-power, digital signal that's picked up by a patch that's worn on your arm, that might look like a nicotine patch.",
        "They say it could also be picked up by a device that you would put under your skin, I guess if you were really committed to this regimen.",
