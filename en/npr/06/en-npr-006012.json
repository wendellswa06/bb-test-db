        "The NFL likes its men in stripes to be seen and not heard.",

        "Explain that to us, please.",
        "Well, one of the things we wanted to explore in this report is how the various pieces of the pie are adding up.",
        "You know, what's the impact of the cutbacks that we've seen year after year after year across the industry of the financial structures in the media are facing?",
        "So we asked the public if they had abandoned or stopped going to a news outlet because it was no longer giving them what they were accustomed to getting from that news outlet.",
        "And, indeed, 31 percent said they had left an outlet for that reason.",
        "Now, what strikes me about that finding, Amy, is it suggests that maybe that those of us in the news business can't simply, you know, say that economic changes or this loss of advertising revenue is causing us trouble.",
        "Maybe we're just not providing the programming, the news that people are demanding.",
        "Well, and certainly, those two things are likely connected.",
        "You know, it's difficult to provide the same level of news with many fewer people than perhaps you had in the past, less ability to go out, less ability to stay on a story longer, to be following a story that's slow-moving, that's not one that's jumped out in the news.",
        "How do you balance, as a news organization, the ability to work with fewer resources, to continue to look for the financial means to support your organization, while also delivering to your audiences, to your consumers the product that they're counting on you for?",

        "Well, indeed, we did.",
        "We see that those who are the most likely to have abandoned a news outlet are those that tend to be more highly educated, tend to have higher income levels in the house, more male than female.",
        "And many of these attributes are tied also to the kinds of consumers and Americans that we see as heavier news consumers overall.",
        "So, in likelihood, those that are the most engaged in the news product that they're turning to day in and day out.",
        "Have you found, Amy, that there might be some alternative way to finance the newsgathering that people clearly still want and still demand?",
        "You know, there's been talk recently about nonprofits getting involved in supporting, foundations getting involved in supporting newsgathering.",
        "Are there any sort of models out there or thinking about models that might sort of bring a revival of old-fashioned newsgathering?",
        "Well, one of the areas of activity, of strong activity over the last year, was exactly that, was trying - was many in the news industry, particularly the newspaper industry, in saying we've got to not just do little experiments here and there, but try some real innovation to find some new revenue streams that may not even be connected to our news product.",
        "There are certain companies that are now serving as Web analytics, consultants for businesses in their local area to help, you know, advise them on how they build their websites, revamping entirely their ad sales departments, rethinking their print product.",
        "What is it that we want to have in our print product, and is that different from our digital product?",
        "Another thing that newspapers are doing is beginning more and more to charge for their digital product, ask people to pay for the content that they're getting online, often in that metered kind of model that the New York Times began itself a couple of years ago.",
        "And they're starting to see some success from that.",
        "You know, it's interesting, Amy, it seems to me that this is a complex phenomenon, not a simple phenomenon, and I'm saying that as I look at Page B4 of the New York Times today.",
        "B4 is - they carry the story of your report coming out, says local TV news is following print's path.",
        "Study says channels cut back, despite the public's desire for news.",
        "Now, just to the right of this story about your report, there's a story about HLN - I think that used to be Headline News, a CNN offshoot - saying that their coverage of a murder trial has bolstered ratings at that network.",
        "Apparently, they have found that their viewers really turn on to coverage of sensational trials, and now there is a new trial underway, and this is bringing a boost in ratings.",
        "Well, that doesn't sound like the kind of news coverage that people are demanding.",
        "But on the other - at least the kind that you're talking about.",
        "But on the other side of this page, there's a story about the recent issue in Time magazine, a 36-page article about why medical bills are killing us, 25,000 words written by Steven Brill, and this article says that this issue of Time magazine is on course to become its bestselling cover in nearly two years.",
        "So clearly, there is still - on the one hand there may be a market for TV coverage of sensational trials, but there is still a market for in-depth, investigative, hard-hitting coverage that really takes a long time and a lot of resources to produce.",
        "That is a fascinating juxtaposition there.",
        "And, indeed, it does seem that there are both.",
        "And one of the things we've seen with the development of the mobile market in particular is a moving back to long-form reading, sort of reinvigoration or re-interest in actually sitting down and reading something out of enjoyment, coming across articles that you weren't looking for and choosing to read those, reading two or three articles at a time, which is not at all the way that the desktop realm of the earlier digital era was working, where it was very much built around search and find and then run off to the next thing - so this re-acquaintance with long-form reading in a way that people are finding enjoyable and are now tying to personal interest."

        "But the trick is to find a way to finance that kind of reporting.",
        "And I would suggest, absolutely, it's a legitimate investigative lead.",
        "As much as, you know, we know the guy's last name is so and so and such and such, would you ignore that because you didn't have the person, but rather you had the person's brother?",

        "Absolutely.",
        "And there are more and more news organizations that are beginning - as I think you mentioned earlier - to partner with certain specialty news-producing organizations like the Kaiser Health News Service or Inside Science, where they're, in many cases, being written and reported by longtime journalists who are doing in-depth pieces that that news organization may not be able to do on their own anymore, and they're running them as bylined pieces with full attribution to that original source.",
        "So there are opportunities there.",
        "We have an email, Amy, from Jared(ph), who says something that you've already alluded to.",
        "He says, he writes us: I no longer use cable news channels for my news.",
        "I frequently use my smartphone to read news from various news outlets.",
        "OK, two questions, here: One, is this change in technology and the way people access their news?",
        "But when they read news on the smartphone, what outlets are they reading?",
        "What are the outlets, do you think, that Jared is talking about here?",
        "Well, when we ask people the outlets that they tend to go to most, you do end up with many of the big sort of nationally known names like CNN, New York Times and others, partly because when you're going to a local outlet, there aren't as many people across the country that go to that same local outlet.",
        "So it does tend to balance things in the direction of national outlets.",
        "But people are going to a range of things on their smartphones.",
        "And one of the things that we saw - and this is particularly true among the younger generations - is that they're happy to read long-form on their phones, to watch a video on their phone.",
        "So the idea of this small screen isn't something that's inhibiting their ability to go deep with news.",
        "That's really amazing, isn't it?",
        "I mean, I certainly don't read - I don't have the patience to read long-form journalism on my smartphone, but evidently other people do.",
        "Amy Mitchell is the acting director of the Pew Research Project for Excellence in Journalism, and they have a new State of the Media news report out today.",
        "Now, a somewhat more alarming trend that you have detected, Amy, is that as news organizations find they don't have the money to produce reports on their own, they are taking pre-produced reports or reports that are actually paid for by somebody else.",
        "Can you tell us about that trend?",
        "One of the things that's happening as technology is growing, and the ability to work in technology is crossing into all different kinds of sectors, is that there's more opportunity for newsmakers to reach Americans, to reach consumers directly in a way that really wasn't possible in the pre-digital era."
