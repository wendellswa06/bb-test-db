        "Newsmakers have always been working to try to get their messages in, and there's sort of been this, you know, this pull-and-tug with the news industry in terms of, you know, news industry needing people as sources, and the sources wanting it to be their message.",
        "But there's more and more ability on the part of the newsmakers - whether it's people in politics or government agencies or corporations - to either bypass the media altogether and go directly - we certainly saw that in the 2012 campaign, with all of the different social networking that the campaigns did - but also to be able to work to get their messages more directly into the media itself, because, in many cases, those reporters aren't able to stay on top of a story in the same way or to take one particular piece of information from a newsmaker and then use that to go do a fuller report, to go do deeper analysis and deeper reporting.",
        "And you say that there are actually some companies that are dedicated exclusively to this practice of producing content for news media.",

        "Well, absolutely, according to the data that we gathered here.",
        "We looked at a mix of local stations and compared what we saw in 2012 to what we saw in 2005.",
        "And among these stations, 40 percent of the air time - that's not just stories, but of the air time, was devoted to weather, traffic and sports.",
        "That's a big increase compared with 2005, and one of the areas that increased the most was actually coverage of sports, where it looks in these stations like there's almost a third leg to what they're packaging as the primary areas of focus in these newscasts.",

        "Are news organizations, you know, as they sort of move away from print, from the print media, are news outlets sort of devoting more resources, perhaps to their online, their digital version?",
        "Well, it's sort of a yes and no question.",
        "When the transition to digital was really beginning to sort of move strongly three or four years ago, we heard again and again from news outlets, from newspaper organizations, that they had hit a point where the digital came first.",
        "So digital was not only first place of publication, but was the orientation around which stories were being written, stories were being reported.",
        "What was in their mind first was the digital version, and then the paper ended up sort of being the place of record, you know, what came out the next day.",
        "Now, more and more, we are seeing newspapers and newspaper organizations going to three-day-a-week or four-day-a-week print publications and just being online in those other areas.",
        "And some of the early indicators of papers that have gone that route suggest there isn't a whole lot more in what they're producing on the Web, and that it may be more out of a cost efficiency, a cost savings, as opposed to a way to serve their customer better.",
        "It's still very early in those days, and that is an area that we'll be doing further research into in the coming year.",
        "Let's shift a little bit to international news, the national and international news now, Amy.",
        "We mentioned briefly before how some interested parties are actually producing news content and giving it to stretch news organizations, which then run that content without always making clear who has paid for the reporting.",

        "Fortune magazine took the step of launching a program that they call the Fortune TOC, which is trusted original content, where Fortune writers create original Fortune-branded editorial content for the marketers to then put on their websites.",

        "Do you think that readers are sort of narrowing their interests too much by looking for what interests them on the Web?",
        "It's a serious question to consider.",
        "And if news outlets aren't going to be covering the broad range, if you can't find the politics that you used to turn to your local outlet for, then you're naturally going to be searching for it and be drawn to something that's specifically devoted on that area of interest where you can find it digitally, which means you're not going to come across that other incidental news that might not be exactly up your stream, but you'd say, oh.",

        "And local TV was still first, but the primary place people were turning to it for, even a couple years back, was for weather and breaking news, to a certain degree, and traffic.",
        "And as we see that also increasing in what they're devoting their time to, those are things that, in many cases - whether it's a smartphone or a tablet or your desktop - are replaceable by any number of different on-demand outlets that may or may not actually be a news organization itself.",
        "And so as news companies are thinking of what is it that we can offer that is unique and is valuable content that others can't produce, even within our - the resources that we have, news, weather, sports, traffic, breaking news are things that many of us are in the realm of.",

        "You know, BBC, you know, NPR, PBS have a little bit of government subsidy and really, this isn't a surprise, and I think that's the answer to what you guys are talking about with the market and the content.",
        "You know, if United States subsidized it's media to the extent that Great Britain does or event to the extent that they did when the nation was founded - because, by the way, there's a very long history of government subsidy of early newspapers for the Pony Express.",
        "I was lucky enough to take a class from Mr. Robert McChesney, the media scholar in undergrad.",

        "You'd think so?",

        "media was completely bought into the closed case, by Colin Powell, the only dissenting voice was PBS and NPR.",
