        "Yup.",
        "Do you see much of that, Amy?",
        "Where I have problems is the creation of these large databanks that are, you know, expanding now to innocent people, and law enforcement employing these other techniques that really undermine the inherent notion that one should have privacy in their DNA.",

        "Well, you know, what's interesting is when the blog era was sort of getting off the ground and these very small, kind of, citizen websites.",
        "There was a concern in news organizations that these one or two person shops would supplant the work that news organizations were doing, because they were connected to the community and they could focus in on particular things.",
        "But what happened was actually many of these citizen-journalists, if you will, found that it was actually pretty difficult to report the news, to actually go out and do stories.",
        "And the pure amount of reporting that they were able to do was, you know, naturally far, far less than what any news entity could produce on its own, and it was also difficult.",
        "So they - it turned into a little bit more, in most cases, of a auxiliary effort, if you will, where citizens are commenting on or adding to or sharing and linking together reports that in most - in many cases are coming originally from a more established news outlet.",

        "This week, The Hollywood Reporter had an affectionate cover interview with Woody Allen.",
        "Boy, did it get a backlash.",
        "The interview stirred resentment because it didn't focus more directly on allegations from the early 1990s that Woody Allen had sexually abused his young daughter.",
        "And it provoked an angry essay from Woody Allen's estranged son about how the media often handles celebrities who are accused of serious transgressions.",

        "Lets remind ourselves what Woody Allen allegedly did.",
        "Well, what he was accused of doing amid a custody battle with his wife, Mia Farrow, was of abusing his young daughter, Dylan, taking her into the attic and sexually molesting her.",
        "This had played out because of - there was a scandal that had happened just weeks, months before where Mia Farrow had discovered that Woody Allen had taken nude pictures of her daughter with her former husband, Andre Previn, Soon-Yi.",
        "To whom Mr. Allen's now married, yeah.",
        "To whom Mr. Allen has now been married for many years.",
        "And that tore the family apart.",
        "And so it was this sort of twin scandal, a Greek tragedy if you will, that played out at that time and has had these repercussions ever since.",
        "How did The Hollywood Reporter - the features editor, Stephen Galloway, handle that part of the story?",
        "Well, he walked up to the edge of dealing with the question of Dylan Farrow's allegations and then never acknowledged them.",
        "What he did was he focused on the question of the scandal of Woody Allen's involvement with Soon-Yi and really asked him a question or two about how that scandal had affected him and the way in which her involvement in his life had changed him.",
        "But The Reporter never really dealt with the question of the abuse allegations themselves.",
        "Yeah, and Ronan Farrow then wrote an angry - and I thought quite eloquent - opinion piece in The Hollywood Reporter.",
        "He, of course, is the son of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow.",

        "He says it's incumbent on the press and on the media not to make it easy for celebrities to have these terribly serious transgressions alleged and be able to skate by on their charm, on their fame, on their accomplishments outside the arena of these allegations.",
        "He said, you know, it is precisely the inconvenient moment where you have all these stars - and Woody Allen is in South of France because of the debut of his new film.",
        "And you have stars like Blake Lively, Jesse Eisenberg and others who are there, Steve Carell.",

        "My guess is if they could go back and do it again, they would.",
