        "Rajiv, is it relevant to the future of this thing, at this point, do you think, with the two-year window-frame before the troops are due to come home that the president is under pressure to get out faster?",
        "Do you think speed is likely to happen, the speeding-up of the process?",
        "Well, I certainly think this incident is fueling a discussion in some quarters of the government about the pace of the drawdown and whether that should be accelerated or not.",
        "You know, for the Republican Party, it puts them in a very awkward position because to criticize the president for apologizing, which is essentially what is a necessary step to try to diffuse the tensions, at the same time saying that you want to continue on with the mission, there's a contradiction there.",
        "And perhaps Newt Gingrich and some other Republicans who have been critical of the president have a different view from others in the party about where, you know - how the conflict should proceed.",
        "But if the Republican Party position is that you need to keep on fighting there, you've got to make amends.",
        "All right, we have callers who are waiting to talk with us about that.",
        "We've asked callers to call in if they've actually served in Afghanistan to tell us, in their experience, how these - how incidents like this complicate the job.",
        "Our number is 800-989-8255.",

        "NATO and Afghan officials are nearly done with their investigation into the circumstances that led to the accidental burning of several Qurans and other Islamic texts.",
        "The materials were confiscated because they contained handwritten extremist messages inside them, and military officials believe that detainees were using those to exchange messages.",
        "Afghan workers saw the holy books in the garbage, which was burning, and tried to save them.",
        "As the news of that incident spread, violent protests broke out, and more than 30 people have died since then, including four U.S.",
        "soldiers.",
        "If you have served in Afghanistan, we want to ask you if you've seen incidents like this blow up the situation, complicate your job.",

        "Have you been over yourself?",
        "Yeah, I was over there during the elections a couple years ago, and there was an issue in our region where some of the ballots were misprinted.",
        "And the population in that area - just giant backlash.",
        "Interesting that you say that they're eating it up, as in they're almost waiting for these things to happen.",

        "And when we do mess up or have some situation where we err, they just take it and run with it.",
        "And some of the extremist parties, I think they use it to their advantage to try and get people to follow their side instead of follow us or however, you know, it's playing out.",
        "How did that all settle down in the work that you were doing?",
        "Did it impact what you were trying to do?",
        "Yeah, it made - it definitely made boots on the ground a little bit more dangerous.",
        "It was - you know, a lot of telling your buddies and everyone around you, hey, you need to mind your p's and q's, don't do this, do that.",

        "Do - you know, bouncing off what Rajiv had said is the sense that the apology isn't really well-accepted.",
        "Do you think that it becomes more dangerous for the troops in a situation like this if there is not even an attempt at an apology made?",
        "If you're there, do you want that to come from Washington, or is it irrelevant?",
        "The apology yes because I do believe that it reaches some of the Afghan public.",

        "We've been fighting there for more than a decade, and in that decade, there have been a lot of unfortunate incidents.",
        "There have been a lot of civilians who have been killed by errant bombings, by errant night raids.",
        "Yes, top commanders in recent years have tried to reduce civilian casualties, and they've made marked strides in doing so.",
        "But the Afghan public, by and large, they're pretty burnt out on this.",
        "And they're also coming at this from decades of earlier conflict.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I understand that things can happen, but at the same time, I think what the Afghan people are going to be looking for is accountability.",
        "And I think when we brush it under the rug and call it a mistake, that's not going to be satisfactory to the Afghans.",
        "But we've been there for a decade-plus, and so when they look at it, they're sort of, in my cases, done forgiving us.",
        "They've give us the benefit of the doubt for several years, and we keep saying we're going to reduce civilian casualties, yet every few months brings another incident of a couple of young boys or girls getting killed in an inadvertent airstrike or some - you know, somebody getting run over by a convoy.",
        "And so this feed into it so that when they hear that now some Qurans have been burned, it becomes much harder for them to accept that this was simply an accident.",
        "They think: Look, you guys, you keep doing things like this.",
        "You should be smarter than that.",

        "John Nagl?",
        "We call this the man-on-the-moon problem when we were fighting in Iraq.",
        "So a country that could put a man on the moon ought to be able, in the eyes of the Iraqi people, now in the eyes of the Afghan people, to deal with these fairly low-level insurgencies, to deal with this problem, to get the economy back going again, to get electricity flowing.",
        "And so they had an exaggerated belief in our technological capabilities and in our ability to make their lives better, and if we were not doing it, they viewed that as a sign that we didn't want to.",
        "Yeah, but what's the solution, tell them that we're not so good at things?",
        "I mean, we really don't want that to be the message, either.",
        "No, and it is, I think, an inevitable problem of foreign powers conducting counterinsurgency campaigns.",

        "My team developed a very close relationship with the Afghan police.",
        "When incidents like this took place, we found the solution was to get closer, not back away.",
        "We found we could sit, talk, explain and cooperate.",
        "We found our very dangerous work was safer when we were closer to the Afghans, working among the people and their Afghan forces.",
        "Hiding behind base walls or in armored vehicles made things worse?",
        "Rajiv?",
        "I think that John and other counterinsurgency experts would make that very same argument, that you can build bigger walls and put thicker metal sheeting on your vehicles to try to prevent the roadside bomb from causing casualties, but the only way you're going to prevent that bomb from getting placed in the ground in the first place is to be out with the people building trust, convincing the people that there's a better alternative than supporting the insurgency.",
        "The problem is, you know, when - you know, you can do that at the local level, when you're with a little advisory team.",
        "It becomes a much bigger issue when you look at this at a national level, and you say: Is the Afghan government, from on high, taking the necessary steps to really be faithful partners?",
        "It's a big leap of faith, John Nagl.",
        "I mean, you did this work in Iraq.",
        "It's a big leap of faith to be the guy who goes out there because you may not be the one who comes back.",
        "And can you talk about - and in fact in talking about what Ben's email is about, there's a very, very - there's an art to this, it sounds like, making this communication and making this work, but it requires an enormous amount of risk and trust that you're going to not mess it up and that the guy on the other side isn't out to get you right away."

        "And it's worth putting this in the context of the broader American strategy, which is to draw down American forces and embed small American advisory teams inside Afghan army and police units and hand over primary responsibility to the Afghan forces.",
        "For that to work, we have to have those kind of personal relationships.",
        "It's something that not everybody can do.",
        "It's enormously risky, and I think we all owe a great debt of thanks to those like the person who just emailed us, who have built those trust relationships across cultures.",
        "Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing, a guy like that took a very big risk for the rest of us.",

        "And James(ph) - I'm sorry, Eric, let me ask you: What would be accountability for you in this case, in the case of the Quran burning?",
