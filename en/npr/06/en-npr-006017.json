        "And transcribed them from others who had done these same sort of fights before back to Lawrence of Arabia and beyond.",
        "The problem Eric describes is very real, and it was noted by no less a figure than Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, who set up a program in the Pentagon called the Minerva Program to try to incorporate more cultural awareness and understanding of the very things that Eric is talking about to try to make sure that things like this don't happen.",

        "But a case like this, could you see court martial for cultural offense, John Nagl?",
        "I can't.",
        "I would have to be convinced that they were doing it on purpose, even in a more egregious case, which we saw in Iraq when a Marine sniper used a Quran for target practice, clearly an active act of cultural defiance and despoiling of a cultural artifact.",
        "That, I think, is a court martialable offense.",
        "This one, I don't think is.",
        "And I again think that the president making the apology carries great weight in Afghanistan.",
        "We should not underestimate how many lives, Afghan and American, were saved by the president making that statement.",
        "Rajiv Chandrasekaran.",
        "Well, what this underscores is counterinsurgency is hard.",
        "It's really difficult, and difficult in terms of training all your forces to do this right, you know?",

        "And, you know, I went from being one of these kids in these gunfights in places like Ramadi in 2006 and in Sangin in 2008, 2009, to this most recent, you know, arena that we're fighting in in Afghanistan, where we transitioned from this assault to this sort of, like, partnership thing.",

        "And James is certainly right that, in a firefight, you rely on instinct and on muscle memory, and we have training to help people in those situations.",
        "But in other cases that James - it sounds like James was a rifleman in the fight, in the mud.",
        "Somebody working in a prison, as was the case here, isn't under those kind of time pressures, has the ability to step back and think a little bit and decide that maybe instead of throwing the Qurans in the garbage, perhaps we could send them back to Arizona for additional study and get them out of there and put them someplace safe.",
        "So I respect what James is saying from his position on the battlefield.",
        "And I think we're actually doing a pretty good job of training our riflemen what to do and the laws of land warfare and the rules of engagement.",

        "Well, I think that there will be - you know, there are investigations ongoing, and I think the results of that will be important and communicating that to the Afghan people.",

        "Some people will say it's a justified reaction.",
        "But I think it will have an - what I mean to say is that the killing of those two officers at the Ministry of Interior will have a much larger impact on the thinking of the future of the mission and the role of the partnership than, perhaps, the killing of other U.S.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I agree with Rajiv.",
        "I think we are going to see Americans back in the ministries within the next several weeks.",
        "I think we'll see different security procedures inside those buildings.",
        "I think you'll see more guards, probably more Americans in those buildings.",
        "I think the basic strategy is going to continue.",
        "We are going to continue to try to hand off responsibility to the Afghans as rapidly as we can.",
        "I think this will put more pressure on that strategy.",
        "There will be people trying to do it even more rapidly.",

        "Yesterday, the Senate confirmed Judge Leslie Southwick to the 5th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals.",
        "But is Judge Southwick the right man for the job?",
        "The court serves the states of Missouri, Louisiana and Texas, a region shadowed by civil rights struggles.",
        "Opponents argue the judge doesn't have a track record on civil rights that makes him a good steward of the law.",

        "He's also been a personal friend of Judge Southwick's for over 20 years.",

        "Well, Judge Southwick and I have been friends, really, for almost 30 years.",
        "We first met in 1980 in Jackson, Mississippi where he's lived since 1976, I have for really all my adult life as well.",
        "The simple fact of the matter is I hope I could be more like Leslie Southwick when I grow up.",
        "He's exactly the kind of man that I would like to be and that I would like for my three sons to grow up to be.",
        "Well, opponents of his confirmation point to his civil rights record.",
        "One ruling called into question was his 1998 decision to give a social worker his job back after using a racial slur towards a co-worker.",
        "And in another case, he joined a ruling against a bisexual mother in a custody case.",
        "So what do you make of those decisions?",
        "Well, first of all, I think that it is a grave, grave danger ever to pick out 2 out of 7,000 opinions in which a judge participated and try to make some sweeping characterization of his lifetime of service or his character.",
        "And I guess you could just as well say, couldn't you, that if those two cases are some indications of bad judgment on his part, then 6,998 times he was right, and those seem like pretty decent odds.",
        "But even more importantly to me is the fact that you really ought to be considering the lifetime of service and the career - both the public and personal - of this man.",
        "He has lived his entire life as a man of honor and integrity and character.",
        "He served our nation in the United States Department of Justice.",
        "He served in Iraq.",
        "He served as the judge staff adjutant of his brigade.",
        "He is the kind of man who, when you consider who ought to be sitting on a federal court of appeals, what kind of temperament, what kind of character do we want?",
        "The photograph of Leslie Southwick ought to show up next to that question."
