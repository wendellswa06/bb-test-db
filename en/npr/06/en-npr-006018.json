        "So I have no qualms whatever in telling folks who don't have the privilege of knowing him personally that this man is going to serve with great honor and dignity.",
        "Some people would say that certainly the kind of leadership that you would build being in the military is one thing, but that personality cannot be taken into account when you look at his qualifications as a man.",
        "Do you think you're putting too much emphasis on his personal qualities as opposed to his judicial qualities?",
        "Well, quite to the contrary, it seems to me that they are two very valid factors to consider when a determination is made about whether a person should sit on a federal court.",
        "The first is just raw legal competence.",
        "Is this person of the intelligent and intellectual brainpower and legal prowess that would qualify him or her for the role?",
        "And clearly, Judge Southwick very easily passes muster in that respect.",
        "Then the second question is: Is this a person of the sort of character and integrity and judicial temperament that we would want to see sitting on the federal bench?",
        "And again, Judge Southwick is exactly that kind of person.",
        "And it's really a tribute to the bipartisan view of the United States Senate that both of those factors were recognized and that he was, in fact, confirmed by a significant margin.",
        "Now, you talk about the confirmation process, how closely did you follow it?",
        "And were you surprised by some of the criticisms of Judge Southwick?",
        "I followed it very closely.",
        "And thanks for your question, I was very much surprised by the criticisms of Judge Southwick notwithstanding that I'm certainly aware that there is sort of a beginning bid that any conservative from Mississippi must be somehow a suspect, but even with that, I knew that Leslie Southwick was such a gentle man and gentleman and a man of such integrity in character that I really believed that he would not be subject to the same sort of pillory process that had occurred with some previous nominees, and so I was surprised and disappointed by the process, but delighted by the strong margin of support that he got when he was, in fact, confirmed.",
        "Let's pull out just a little bit.",
        "You're an attorney.",
        "There has been a lot of conversation in the political world and the judicial world about what people sometimes call activist judges.",
        "How do you think that a judge's politics should or should not fit into how a person is evaluated as a jurist and how the nation evaluates jurists?",
        "That was Reza Aslan.",
        "He's a professor and author on the subject of Islam and Christianity.",
        "He's also host of the upcoming CNN original series \"\"Believer,\"\" which explores religious communities around the world.",
        "We reached him in Los Angeles.",
        "Reza Aslan, thanks so much for speaking with us.",

        "Good afternoon, this is the Booneville Chamber of Commerce.",

        "Pat Jackson has lived in Booneville since the 1950's.",

        "Late word from authorities in Greece, the co-pilot of a Cypriot airliner was alive when his plane crashed, killing all 121 aboard.",
        "That's according to the chief coroner of the investigation, who said all the autopsies on victims carried out so far showed the victims were alive, but not necessarily conscious when the plane crashed.",
        "Investigators believe a rapid loss of cabin pressure led to crew and passengers quickly losing consciousness; that despite the fact that the Boeing 737's oxygen masks were deployed."

        "Well, it wasn't that they weren't able to get to it.",
        "It was that the oxygen equipment itself--it had malfunctioned.",
        "The crew probably tried to get the masks on, but the fact that there wasn't any oxygen available to them, they passed out relatively quickly, and from that point on, the aircraft was in a climb autopilot mode, so they just went up to the sort of ceiling of the airplane--and their absolute ceiling of the airplane and flew on for three, three and a half hours."

        "I believe that the local commander of the People's Armed Police, the group that carried this out, has now been put under arrest for investigation.",

        "So the peasants are really in a very difficult situation, where they are increasingly aware of their rights but generally unable to exercise those rights through the systems.",
        "And one way to get higher-level attention, if the normal processes of appeal and negotiation fail, is to then block highways, if necessary even resort to violence.",
        "Do you figure that they're becoming more and more aware of the rights they have through technology, through cell phones, the Internet, things like that?",
        "Absolutely, the spread of cell phone use, of text messaging, of the Internet.",
        "And then, also, we've seen rapid development of a kind of activist community in China.",
        "There are lawyers and others who now travel around to different places to explain to peasants what their rights are.",
