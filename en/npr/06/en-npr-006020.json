        "Jim, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "Let me ask you again, William Waldock, ordinarily, what happens to cause decompression, I gather--you're saying this kind of explosive decompression is extremely rare.",
        "Under most circumstances when there is decompression, it's a very small hole in the fuselage somewhere.",
        "It can be a small hole.",
        "It can be a leak in a seal.",
        "It can be problems with the pressurization system itself.",
        "In all of those cases, the crew should have plenty of warning that it's developing.",
        "And again, the procedures are very straightforward.",
        "Get the emergency oxygen on, and the pilots' masks are different than the passengers' masks.",
        "Sometimes it's a misconception that what the pilots have is exactly what the passengers have in the back, but the pilots have--they're called quick-don masks, meaning literally, you're supposed to be able, with one hand, to get the thing over your head and in place.",
        "And it's a positive pressure mask.",
        "It feeds you the oxygen.",
        "Whereas the masks in the back are passive masks.",
        "They feed oxygen into the mask that's not under pressure.",
        "Would it matter where in the aircraft the hole was?",
        "I mean, if, for example, it was in the cockpit, would it affect the pilots more quickly than if it was in the back of the plane?",
        "Well, until the pressure equalizes, you probably wouldn't have a whole lot of difference.",
        "You might have a second or two difference in how it affected people, but again, with an explosive decompression, it's going to happen suddenly.",
        "This does not sound like that.",
        "It sounds like more of a--some sort of a rapid decompression, but not explosive.",
        "So it took some time for the pressure to change.",
        "Here's an e-mail from Jude in Cleveland.",
        "`Is it possible to design an autopilot system that can sense decompression in an aircraft and automatically send the plane down to a breathable level, even if the pilots pass out?",
        "It seems such a system might have averted tragedy in Greece.'",
        "It's possible.",
        "Part of the problem you've got there is once you take it out of the altitude, where does it go if there's nobody to fly it?",
        "I guess theoretically, you could design a flight management system that was capable of--in the event you have a pressurization system and the crew's not there anymore, predesignated emergency landing sites.",
        "You know, certainly we have auto-flight capabilities that can land the airplane, roll it out, stop it and taxi to the gate.",
        "Those have been around for years.",
        "But you can't just send it down to 10,000 feet.",
        "There's a fair number of mountains that are higher than 10,000 feet.",
        "Well, not only mountains, but you've got an--usually a lot of other air traffic that you have to worry about, too.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Scott.",
        "Scott calling from Miami.",
        "Hi.",
        "I may be lacking an understanding of the chemistry here, but if you dive underwater, I think most people can hold their breath for 20 or 30 seconds.",
        "What prevents pilots or folks from doing that when there's a decompression in a plane?",
        "Why would they lose consciousness so quickly?",
        "And I can take that off the air."

        "Thanks for the call, Scott.",
        "Well, what happens when you're diving, the pressure is increasing.",
        "When you change the pressure suddenly violently from about 8,000 feet, which is where most airline cabins are pressurized to, up to 35,000 feet, you'd almost feel like you're surrounded by a vacuum, and it's not so much the holding your breath.",
        "It's when you try to breathe.",
        "There's just--really, the air's too thin to do much good.",
        "So that's why the eight to 10 second useful consciousness.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You also know when you're going beneath the water oftentimes, and if it's decompressing quickly, you may not get any warning to hold your breath.",
        "Hi, Blake.",
        "Hey, I'm a military pilot.",
        "I've flown with the Air Force for 25 years, and we routinely have every five years altitude chamber training, where we go in and we drop our masks at 18,000 feet, with another pilot still on oxygen, to feel our--you know, the loss of oxygen, how our fingernails turn blue, how we begin to lose--you know, we begin to kind of feel goofy.",
        "Usually, we'll do some kind of a written exercise, and we do that routinely, and we have a lot of other aerospace physiology training.",
        "But what kind of training are civilian pilots required to do, particularly in light of the Payne Stewart accident?",
        "You know, they didn't have probably about a couple hundred hours of flying experience in the front cockpit.",
        "Yeah.",
        "On the civilian side with the airline industry, at least, pilots are trained how to use the systems.",
        "I don't think there's any specific requirement they go through an altitude chamber.",
        "I've been through it a couple of times myself, and it just really impresses you as to how fast that stuff happens.",
        "I mean, for me, I--and I'm sorry to interrupt.",
        "I've gone through probably, in my career, five chambers now and, you know, as you age, your time of useful consciousness also decreases or, based on your physical conditioning, it could increase.",
        "And, you know, it's the old picture worth a thousand words, when you sit there and you start writing out the test, and 15 seconds into it, you're writing gibberish.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Well, usually, they're being videotaped, too, so you get to see yourself being goofy."

        "Absolutely.",
        "And, I mean, it's a very valuable training.",
        "And not only that, at different altitudes, we're required to have the oxygen more readily available.",
        "And above a certain altitude, one pilot has to be on an oxygen mask when the other one is not.",
        "Well, that's one of the questions I think right now.",
