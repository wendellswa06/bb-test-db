        "He has talked about putting together an all-out Muslim ban.",
        "He's talked about creating a database for Muslims in the United States.",
        "He has threatened to send American citizens to the prison at Guantanamo Bay.",
        "He has stacked his Cabinet and his advisers with avowed anti-Muslim zealots, some of whom are - belong to actually officially designated hate groups.",
        "This is part of a process that he has vowed to put in place as president.",

        "It has already affected me and my relatives.",
        "I have numerous relatives in the United States who are green card holders.",
        "They are in a state of confusion, unsure whether they can leave the country and come back, visit family.",
        "And then, of course, I have family in Iran, including an uncle who has a visa, who was on his way to the United States, who cleared all of the legal hurdles necessary to reunite with his family here in America, and who is now stuck in limbo, unsure whether he'll be allowed in or not.",
        "How do you feel that persons of like minds such as yourself should address this, given that a number of people do support him, given that he is the president of the United States, given the fact that many people think he's right?",
        "I think first and foremost, we need to respond to those people with the facts of the situation.",
        "You have almost zero chance of being killed by a refugee in this country.",
        "That you have almost no chance of being killed in a terrorist attack by an immigrant - by any kind of immigrant, let alone an Islamic immigrant.",
        "But more importantly than that, we need to actually address the fear that is at the heart of President Trump's support.",
        "You know, authoritarians tend to consolidate support by using fear, but more importantly by driving a wedge among the people that he wants to control."

        "Well, it's an interesting question.",
        "It's one that people are just starting to ask, although I have to say that most people are still focused on kind of immediate survival needs, although I will say that you do get plenty of anger out there in the villages and in Muzaffarabad about the government response.",
        "Now some of that, I think, is just, you know, people reacting out of understandable emotion under the circumstances.",
