        "The difference is that the current inside a leaf has no wires.",
        "It's a wireless current.",

        "That's why you give a tree water.",
        "It then takes that water and with this wireless current converted from the sun, it splits water to hydrogen and oxygen.",
        "And what we did is the same fundamental, functional principles.",
        "We take silicon in place of the leaf, and then that can produce the wireless current, and we've created two new compounds or what are called catalysts that then split water to hydrogen and oxygen just like a leaf, and that's why we call it an artificial leaf.",
        "Then theoretically you could store the hydrogen and use it to run a fuel cell and the oxygen for a fuel cell.",

        "That's where all the energy is stored.",
        "But there's a big push now in the United States in the research community to take hydrogen and combine it with carbon dioxide and make a liquid fuel.",
        "So there's a lot of options to burn hydrogen or use hydrogen, once you get it from water.",
        "Now, how efficient is your leaf compared to a natural leaf?",
        "Yeah, my leaf right now, just the one I'm running, is 10 times more efficient than a leaf.",
        "But my efficiency isn't being limited by anything I've done.",
        "It's being limited by the silicon that catches the sun.",
        "So in this paper that I presented last week, the silicon operates at seven percent, and then if you look at what I'm doing, the total efficiency is five percent.",
        "So I'm basically running at around 80 percent of the input of the silicon.",
        "If I took a 20 percent silicon solar cell, then 80 percent of 20 percent, I should be able to run at 15 or 16 percent, and then that's even another factor of - that's almost 50 times, 100 times better than a leaf."

        "And he showed that you could do what we did which is take light and then make this wireless current and then split water to hydrogen and oxygen.",
        "But he used basically space-age materials, literally materials that NASA uses when they send things up into space to harvest the sun.",
