        "Most of the cost of a solar panel is the wiring of it and all the other stuff, not the blood and guts, the silicon costs.",
        "So now we've sort of ripped out the inner core of a solar panel.",
        "We're just using the silicon.",
        "The catalysts that are cheap and Earth-abundant are on that silicon.",
        "But I'm making gases, hydrogen and oxygen, over the surface of the silicon.",
        "So what needs to be done now, specifically, in next steps is to engineering a gas collection system so that those gases can be collected and then used, as you mentioned, later on when the sun goes down to power your house or do what you need to do.",
        "So you have the cell that has bubbling gas, oxygen, hydrogen, and you need to find a way to separate the two and collect them individually.",
        "Yeah, the separation happens - so this is another great thing about this discovery.",
        "It's working in just regular water.",
        "So you don't have to engineer.",
        "A lot of things work in concentrated base or a concentrated acid.",
        "That means really harsh conditions.",
        "And you get big engineering costs.",
        "So what I showed at the meeting and the movies that people have shown or pictures, it's just basically a card, a piece of silicon the size of a card with my catalyst sitting in a glass of water bubbling away.",
        "On one side of the card, oxygen is made.",
        "On the other side of the poker card, hydrogen is being made.",
        "So the gases right up front are separated.",
        "So that's not a big problem.",
        "But you've got to collect them because right now the picture just shows them bubbling off into the atmosphere.",
        "Is there for - you know, when we talk about new alternative energies in cars and vehicles, it's always for some underdeveloped country, a third-world country where they would take this, but not good enough for we in this country.",
        "Is this something to be sold here or abroad?",
        "So I'm right with you.",
        "I'm going into the developing world, and there's two reasons for that.",
        "One is at least to get your feet on the ground, make something so you can kick the tires and see how it works.",
        "It's a lot easier to do there because they don't have as big an energy need as we do here in America or in what I call the developed or legacy world.",
        "So it's easier as an entry point to impact the developing world because this sort of - it's snow with no footprints in it, and it's the snow with no footprints which is the real bugaboo.",
        "You guys and myself, we have a thing called the grid.",
        "And so we've invested in an energy infrastructure already, and we're going to be the slowest to accept change because we're tied like a lead weight to what we've had for the last hundred years, while when you go into the developing world, people without anything - no grid, especially India, rural China and Africa - a lot of those people have nothing in the ground.",
        "There are no wires.",
        "So they're much more quick to adapt."

        "You just leapfrog 100 years.",
        "Yeah, and my feeling has always been: Do it there, and then we'll all get jealous and want it.",
        "And I will tell you, I probably get 10 to 20 emails a day from people in America saying: Please do it at my house.",
        "So people in this country, there's an extra value added that I don't think we have figured out as a country of being energy independent.",
        "And I think that goes with the spirit of America, being independent.",
        "So I think it could go a lot faster.",
        "It doesn't have to just beat the price of coal - remember, coal is pretty inexpensive, and that's what you're battling with in the United States - because of this extra value of energy independence.",
