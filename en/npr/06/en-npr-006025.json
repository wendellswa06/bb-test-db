        "You went through a transition from a Democratic administration to a Republican one.",
        "Is what you're hearing familiar, as par for the course or something unusual and different?",
        "Well, I would say that actually during the transition between Clinton and Bush, there wasn't a general announcement that people should not put out scientific information, but we did actually experience some questioning about some work that we were doing related to children's health and the environment.",
        "And we actually got a lot of pushback from the White House about some information that we had been trying to publish.",
        "So I don't think it's unusual that the administration might take a look and see what the scientists are doing at EPA, but I think the experience makes some of the scientists worried at EPA that they might see a return to that.",
        "I mean I think there's a difference between science and policy that's in some way related the science.",
        "I mean if you were asked to do a particular project, were you to say, no, that's a minefield; I don't want to do that; I know it's going to happen to it?",
        "Yeah, that's a really good point because we have science, which is the pursuit of information, whereas public policy is really about taking the science we have at hand and then using it with the other factors that are important for making a decision.",
        "How do people feel about the decision?",
        "What are the costs and benefit?",
        "Who's going to be impacted?",
        "The policymaker should factor in those other factors in addition to the science when they make a decision.",
        "But I think sometimes what ends up happening is science becomes a crutch in making decisions in terms of, well, we're going to wait until we have the absolute definitive proof from the science before we make a decision.",
        "The challenge with that for an agency like EPA is that, for example, in air pollution, people will be continued to be exposed to air pollution while we're waiting for more and more science to come in."
