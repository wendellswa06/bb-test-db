        "He began with Charlottesville and President Trump's response to white supremacist violence there two years ago.",
        "Biden said there is a battle for the soul of this country.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "I believe history will look back on four years of this president and all he embraces as an abhorrent moment in time.",
        "But if we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation - who we are - and I cannot stand by and watch that happen.",

        "Hi, Mara.",
        "Hi, Ari.",
        "Biden is the 20th Democratic candidate to jump in the race.",
        "Is he the last one?",
        "Are we done now?",
        "I can't think of another person who would be a major Democratic candidate who hasn't gotten in yet, so I think we are just about done.",
        "And in terms of the shape of the field right now, we see that Joe Biden is at the top of the polls, even though they don't matter that much this early, second - close second, Bernie Sanders.",
        "And what's really interesting is there doesn't seem to be an ideological battle going on because 75%-plus of Democrats say they'd be fine with either Sanders or Biden.",
        "And an Iowa poll recently showed that they were the second choice of each other's supporters.",
        "In other words, if you think that there's not much difference between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden, ideology is not high on the list for Democrats.",
        "How do President Trump and his allies view Biden?",
        "Well, it's interesting.",
        "The conversations I used to have with White House advisers were, the only candidate we worry about is Joe Biden, but he'll never get the nomination.",
        "He's too much of a centrist.",
        "The new conversation with Trump advisers is, any Democrat who wins the nomination will have to have moved so far to the left to get the nomination that we will be able to disqualify them as a socialist.",
        "And there's also, I think, a lot of disdain for Joe Biden's abilities as a candidate.",
        "I think the Trump campaign thinks that he is not very formidable.",
        "People have been pretty insulting about him privately, and you can see the president being pretty insulting about him in his tweets - sleepy Joe, I don't know if you're smart enough to get the nomination."

        "He has a record that Democrats can say, do you like this or not?",
        "The message Joe Biden sent today had two parts - one, for general election - I'm the strongest Democrat to beat Trump - because he knows that's what Democrats want more than anything else.",
