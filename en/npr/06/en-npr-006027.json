        "As you probably know, babies are prepared at birth to learn language or languages.",
        "And in previous work, we have shown that babies can discriminate languages just by watching silent talking faces.",
        "So they see a bilingual speaker, you turn the sound off, and they can tell when it changes from one language, English, to when the person stops speaking English and starts speaking French, even with no sound.",
        "But we had shown in previous work that by seven or eight months of age, babies who are growing up monolingual in English can't do that anymore, whereas babies who are growing up bilingual in French and English can.",
        "Are bilingual infants learning the characteristics of each of their native languages?",
        "I mean, clearly they are.",
        "The bilingual English-French babies could maintain this sensitivity, which might help them keep English and French apart as they're acquiring them.",
        "Is this a specific sensitivity just to the two languages that the baby is being exposed to?",
        "Or as a function of having to pay attention to the cues that will distinguish the two languages in their world, if they're growing up bilingual, do bilingual babies learn something more general?",
        "Do they learn to pay attention to the cues in language that might allow them to keep any two languages apart?",
        "So again, we filmed bilingual English and French speakers, and the babies saw the speakers one at a time.",
        "They saw a videotape of, let's say Speaker A reciting a sentence in English, and then again another sentence in English, Speaker B a sentence in English, et cetera.",

        "Erikka Loftfield of the National Cancer Institute is a study author.",
        "We found that people who drank two to three cups per day had about a 12 percent lower risk of death compared to non-coffee drinkers.",
        "And drinking more than three cups was tied to an even slightly lower risk of death during the 10-year study.",
        "This was true of all coffee drinkers, even those who were determined to be slow metabolizers of caffeine.",
        "These are people who tend to be more sensitive to caffeine.",
        "And it held up among people who drank decaffeinated too.",
        "And this may suggest that it's non-caffeine components in coffee...",
        "...That could be driving a benefit.",
        "Now, this study does not prove that coffee extends life.",
        "So researchers want to better understand why they keep seeing this association.",
        "Stanford's Christopher Gardner says coffee beans are loaded with interesting compounds.",
        "Coffee, with its thousand chemicals, includes a number of polyphenol-like, antioxidant-rich compounds.",
        "Some of coffee's bioactive compounds have anti-inflammatory properties too.",
        "But Gardner says figuring out how they work together to produce a benefit is complicated.",
        "So he's got another theory about what may help explain coffee's ties to longevity - coffee can bring people joy."
