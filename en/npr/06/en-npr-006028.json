        "Well, and you know, Judge Walton compared this to Wen Ho Lee.",
        "In that case several news organizations did end up contributing towards the government payment to Wen Ho Lee for damages.",
        "It was a very unusual case.",
        "And it indicates how this a sort of a three-side struggle between a person who feels aggrieved between the government that leaked and the press that was leaked to.",
        "David, it's the same judge in this case - Judge Reggie Walton - who president over the Valerie Plame case.",
        "In that case, also journalists were compelled to reveal their sources.",
        "Well, the key lesson of what was, you know, ultimately a trial involving Scooter Libby and others, Patrick Fitzgerald's investigation of who leaked the name Valerie Plame Wilson, the key lesson of that is that a determined prosecutor in a criminal case can pretty much get what he wants, when he wants, from the press, and there are not federal protections there.",
        "Walton and others have ruled that there is no common law protections that journalists so very much want to have.",
        "The federal shield law.",
        "Well, a federal shield law, but also the notion of, hey, look, this is a tradition that 31 states have protections of some kind in law and a bunch of others have it in common law, the evolution.",
        "They say, look, there is this principle that exists, you know, the media is one of I think only two professions enshrined in the Constitution, Bill of Rights.",
        "This is something that needs to be protected because of the greater principles.",
        "And judges essentially have said that's well and good.",
        "We may even be sympathetic to such things but they don't really exist.",
        "It's kind of ironic, David, don't you think, that the government is actually filing arguments in this case on behalf of the journalists.",
        "Well, the government in this case is protecting its own interest.",
        "It's not really looking out for the press here.",
        "The government doesn't want its own current and former officials at the FBI and the Justice Department who handed this information out to be punished for what they see was part of their official duties."

        "And what we found is at eight months of age, monolingual Spanish babies and monolingual Catalan babies can't tell the difference, just like the English monolingual babies.",
        "However, the bilingual Spanish-Catalan babies, so babies who are growing up with two languages, Spanish and Catalan from birth, could distinguish spoken visual English from spoken visual French, even though neither of the languages was familiar.",
        "They showed an interest in the language change and started looking longer again.",
        "So they were - they paid attention, even as the language was changed.",
        "That's right.",
        "And so if they can't discriminate the language change, what happens is they see these same three women reciting yet new sentences in a new language, but it's the same women.",
        "And if they haven't pulled out something about the language, they'll continue to get bored, and their looking time will continue to be lower and lower.",
        "However, if they can tell the difference between the two languages -hey, she's doing something different than she was before - then they will be interested again, just like all of us are interested in novelty, and their looking time, their attention gets longer."

        "Now, can we generalize from here to, you know, suggest that bilinguals are more perceptive in general or better at paying attention or more alert to other things besides just the speech?",
        "Right.",
        "I mean I think that's one of the really interesting questions.",
        "So as a function of keeping two languages apart, are bilinguals just learning about the characteristics of languages - that in itself would be quite a substantial thing to learn - but in addition, are they learning something more general?",
        "And in the realm of perception, in my lab, we haven't really addressed that question yet.",
        "We haven't answered that question yet.",
        "But there is work from a lot of other labs that suggests that as a function of growing up bilingual, babies are learning something more general.",
        "So we should not try to teach them just one language.",
        "Having a bilingual family is an advantage.",
        "Well, I think that's what the work shows.",
        "And I don't think it's the case that if you are monolingual you should run out tomorrow and try to learn a new language so that you can grow - you know, so you can speak two languages to your child and give them the opportunity to grow up bilingual.",
        "I think what the work shows is that if you - if in your home more than one languages is spoken, that that's something to be comfortable with, and it's an opportunity to provide your infant with both languages because there may be advantages that accrue.",
        "So I could tell you a little about some of the other advantages, if you wanted to hear about them.",
        "Sure, give us one.",
        "Give us one or two.",
        "Sure, and so a claim that's made is that people who speak two languages have to have both of them active all the time.",
        "So if they're bilingual with French and English, both French and English are active all the time, but that they have to inhibit one of those languages when they're speaking the other one, and that this may confer some more general advantages in cognitive processes.",
        "And so, for example, even in infancy, there's work that shows, this is by Agie Covax(ph) and Jacques Maylor(ph), that even at seven months of age, a baby who's growing up bilingual is - all babies are able to learn, like if they hear a particular sound, to turn their head to the right.",
        "That's easy enough, and that they'll be rewarded with something."

        "So they can locate the source rather than just turning their head in one direction.",

        "It's that they're learning one rule and then substituting that with a second rule.",
