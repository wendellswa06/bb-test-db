        "Oh, my goodness.",
        "Oh my -not only can we have another Clinton in the White House, we could have another two Clintons in the White House on the same ticket.",
        "All of this speculations is all wonderful and fanciful.",
        "But I will say two serious points here.",
        "After having President Bush I, Bill Clinton, President Bush II, I really just, in the context of being a small-d Democrat, don't really want another Clinton in the White House under any circumstances.",
        "Because this isn't supposed to be a royalty where the two big royal families take turns each time.",

        "And in fact he was on the Meet the Press where I think began the undoing of John Edwards in terms of folks saying he didn't have the electoral experience, he didn't have the other kind of experience.",

        "SUAREZ-OROZCO (Professor of Globalization and Education, New York University): Well, as Callie said, the danger is in the more we are post the glamour and post the romance of the first, let's say, introduction to the national media, the more likely it is that the wrinkles will begin to appear.",
        "On the other hand, I think that the level of incompetence we've seen in government over the last eight years, by the time of the next election, suggests that a very smart, very charismatic, highly-articulate individual with rock appeal, as Robert said earlier, would make a formidable candidate.",
        "But it's too early to tell.",
        "Though, you know, I would also say to - well, first of all I thought that Bill Clinton was the first black president, but we'll put that aside for the time being.",

        "It is almost seems as if one of the reactions to the last eight years of, you know, the last of a presidency that has been shaky led by a kind of two traditional white men, is a look at the untraditional and saying hey, maybe it is time to give a chance to put people in office who, you know, who don't look like the usual type.",

        "The money that immigrant workers in the U.S.",
        "send back home throughout the Caribbean, throughout Latin America is, in most instances, the largest source of foreign exchange for these economies.",

        "It's a very big country.",
        "Now the money sent by immigrants in the United States is the largest source of foreign exchange into the Mexican economy.",
        "So in a way it really is the Americas as a kind of a hemisphere that are increasingly bridged by these long-term relationships between folk who need to leave Latin America because the economic condition simply are not viable to sustain certain standard of living and the behavior of the immigrants once they come to the United States.",

        "and you may be stretched already, you know, say a family with kids, what does it do to people here to have to feel obligated to send money home all the time?",
        "Well, that's why people migrate.",
        "People migrate to be able to be in a position to send money back home.",
        "Every million Latin Americans in the U.S.",

        "and even to Cuba, to Mexico, to Ecuador, to Columbia, all over Latin America.",
        "Robert, is there any opportunity here for the U.S.",
        "to, you know, reach out to immigrants and say okay, well, you know, for example, there are issues like kind of shady wire transfer services that charge a lot of money.",
        "Should there be more of a government interest in how this money is being transacted?",
        "Well, I think there should be.",

        "But the immigrant issue, though, I think that this issue raises has to be looked at in the controversy over the levels of immigration both legal and illegal.",
        "Because on the one hand, you've got many of those people who feel that there should be more restrictions on immigration feeling - well, look, you know, these people are coming here and many of them feel - many anti-immigrant folks feel that they're taking American jobs.",

        "Sixty billion dollars is a lot going down to Latin America and Central America, and if that seriously gets cut down and those economies start to suffer, you're going to see reverberations throughout the region.",

        "Now there are - the AP did a bit of research and found that the number has increased steadily since 2002 but it also wasn't able to get the full figures from the Army.",
        "Should we be concerned that with the Army and other branches of the military are already being really stretched in places like Iraq and Afghanistan that people with credit card debt are now going to be, you know - I mean it's kind of ironic that the military seems to be looking for new recruits and at the same time the financial issues that many Americans face are barring some people from serving.",
        "This is absolutely something that has to be looked at very closely.",
        "I mean I think this is a really strong security risk.",
        "If you are worrying about money, worrying about sending money home as a matter of fact, all of those things, you are so susceptible to a bribe and you're far from home and you're thinking to yourself I might not make it.",
        "I know what the numbers are until Wednesday and I'm not going to take this money.",
        "Of course, you're going to think about it real hard.",
        "I'm not suggesting that, you know, a lot the troops over there are doing that.",
        "I'm just saying that it's a real, real risk.",
        "And I think that this is something that can resonate with any American who's ever had to try to make ends meet.",
