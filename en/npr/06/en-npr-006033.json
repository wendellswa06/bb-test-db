        "One of the things that, you know, I've heard the attorney general say - it is not - in his estimation, it is not equitable or fair to simply, like I said, wave a wand over an entire population of crossers just because they come in in a family unit or they have a child with them and we simply ignore them on the criminal prosecution.",

        "Are the parents who are detained - as well as the children who are detained - are they entitled to legal representation as you prepare to prosecute them?",
        "So once we are done with our piece of it - with the Department of Justice - they've come to court, they've been given a federal public defender.",

        "The judge is there overseeing this entire process.",
        "One of the other things we did this week in our office is we had a judge in Brownsville raise some serious concerns on some of these situations and anecdotal stories like you mentioned, and we facilitated HHS and DHS making sure we got the information to the judge that he wanted.",
        "So when apprehended, if they're a family unit, they're given a card in English and in Spanish that has different 1-800 numbers for them to be able to contact.",
        "And there's also a text line.",

        "Well, it is - the whole process, as a dad, as a human, it is heartbreaking.",
        "But like I said - the Walmart you're referring to that's been in the news recently is the - is a facility in Brownsville.",
        "What is surprising, I think, to many people is 70 percent of those kids in that facility came here by themselves, not even with a family.",

        "But at the same time, it also is difficult to wrap my mind around - and I'm not in their situation - but they're also taking incredible risk to their own life and safety on crossing the border illegally in the way that they do, with their children, and putting them in danger.",
