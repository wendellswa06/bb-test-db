        "I forgot to change that.",
        "...when you were 19?",
        "Yes.",
        "Yeah, actually, whenever I get together with friends of mine who don't work for newspapers, I realize how much more fun I have than they do.",
        "There are a lot more pressures.",
        "I have to worry about budgets.",
        "I have to worry about the careers of other people.",
        "But the reality is I come into the newsroom every morning with about 10 things that I want to get done in terms of coverage.",
        "I can influence coverage of everything from how we write about music, to how we write about Supreme Court nominees, to how we cover the most interesting city in America.",
        "That's a blast.",
        "You can't complain too much about that.",
        "Do you believe--and you talked about this briefly, but I'm curious in terms of how you see the general public and their perception of the media and newspapers.",
        "Do you believe that newspapers, television news, etc., now sit in the seat of having to win the confidence of the viewer, the listener, the reader back?",
        "Yeah, we do.",
        "As I said earlier, I think that we were a little arrogant.",
        "I think that we didn't pay enough attention to readers and, I guess, the television equivalent would be viewers.",
        "We were monopolies.",
        "We were almost like public utilities.",
        "I think that we have to pay a lot more attention to what people want, but I don't think we can give people everything they want.",
        "I think, by and large, we have to win people back, but I think the way we have to do it is by doing what we do best, which is being aggressive, which is sometimes telling people not just what they want to know, but sometimes what we all agree are some of the things maybe they should know to make decisions as informed citizens.",
        "It's a tricky balancing act because, on the one hand, we have to win them back.",
        "On the other hand, I don't want to pander to readers and I don't think readers want to be pandered to either.",
        "I think they want to be interested.",
        "I think they want to be excited.",
        "I think they want to read stuff in my paper that they can't find anyplace else.",
        "Let me ask you before we let you go, the obligatory question when one is starting out in a position like this, whether you retire here or whether you move on to yet another lofty position.",
        "At the end of the day when this is over for you, what would you like people to have said about your tenure?",
        "I would like people to say that he figured out a way to get the newspaper through a difficult period for newspapers.",
        "But then I would like people to say he figured out a way to run a newspaper that was really of its place, that he really helped figure out a way to make the Los Angeles Times really a newspaper of California.",
        "And I have no intention of doing anything other than being editor the LA Times.",
        "This is the end of my ambitions, I think.",
        "Well, we'll see if that holds true.",
        "But we thank you for your time and, again, we wish you luck with everything and...",
        "Thank you."

        "Can you bring us - tell us what you guys were doing in that room that night?",
        "Well, we were about to experiment with the first connection between two computers on this fledgling Internet, and in order to do so, we needed to send a message from Machine 1 to Machine B, 400 miles away, as you said, to the north of us.",
        "We basically - all we wanted to do was to log in from our computer to the second computer on the Internet, and in order to do that, you have to type L-O-G, and the remote computer will type the I-N for you because it knows what you're doing.",
        "So we also had a telephone connection, as well as the data connection of this new network, and we sat there, and we typed the L.",
        "And we asked the fellow at the other end, we said, you get the L?",
        "And the response was yup, got the L.",

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And do you, do most computer experts now consider that to be the moment, you know, the Mary-had-a-little-lamb moment for the Internet?",
        "Well, there's a few other times when you could think about the Internet coming to life.",
        "A month before that, in September, on September 2, the first packet switch - we now call these things routers - was connected to that computer I referred to in our laboratory at UCLA over a 15-foot cable, and bits began to move back and forth.",
        "So I like to say that's the day when the infant Internet took its first breath of life.",
        "But it was not yet doing what it was planned to do, namely to connect computers together.",
        "It's on that October 29th date when I like to say the infant Internet uttered its first words.",
        "The first message went, just as we say that the telegraph was invented when Samuel Morse sent that wonderful Biblical message: What hath God wrought?",
        "And sequence - that sort of sequence has occurred many time in new-technology emergence.",
        "Tell us what this new technology of packet-switching was compared to the old technology.",
        "Well, it began when I was a graduate student at MIT.",
        "I was surrounded by computers, and I recognized one day, those computers would need to talk to each other.",
        "The only network that could support communications at that time in any sense of the way was the telephone network run by AT&T.",
        "And it uses a technology called circuit switching, as opposed to what we're about to describe as packet switching.",
        "In the circuit switching, the problem is it holds the connection between the two communicating parties, you and me for example, for the entire duration of that conversation.",
        "And even if I take a coffee break or you decide to step out for a moment, the line - communication path is still reserved for our use and it's being wasted.",
        "In voice communications, that happens about a third of the time, and that's quite acceptable.",
        "But with data communications, the communications path is idle perhaps 99.99 percent of the time.",
        "I recognized we could not afford to use such a network as inefficiently as that.",
        "So we had to find a way - and I did as a student at MIT - find a way to share those resources.",
        "When you take your coffee break, then in fact someone else can use the line.",
        "The idea of demand access, where it's only being used when you have data to send, and when you're not, someone else can grab it.",
        "So the way we did that was to present this data message that you want to send to the system, the system chops it up into little pieces called packets, and each packet hops its way through the network until it finds its destination.",
        "Each packet may take a separate path.",
        "At the other end, those packets are put together, and the message is delivered, as if a letter were chopped up into a number of postcards and each one sent through the U.S.",
        "mail system separately."

        "The key idea here is that if there's no packet to be sent at a particular part of the path, other packets from other users can use that particular part of the path.",
        "No portion is wasted if there's some work to be done, and that's called packet switching.",
        "And how does - how do the packets know where to go, and how do they know how to be reassembled on the other end?",
        "So each packet has an address.",
        "It says I want to go from New York to Los Angeles, and I'm going to go through Chicago and Denver, perhaps.",
        "And how does it know to go through Chicago and Denver?",
        "Because there is in the network a control procedure, which is constantly checking which links are giving good performance.",
        "And when a packet arrives in Chicago, Chicago will say well, the best next hop is to Denver and not to Dallas.",
        "So there's intelligence in the network, which is constantly probing where the good paths are, and it selects them on a demand basis, which one can take this packet best next.",
        "That's why there's some delay when you're loading your computer - you're loading your Web browser, trying to reassemble all those packages?",
        "Well, no. The packets, as you say, are - they're reassembled at the destination.",
        "That's not where the delay is.",
        "The delay typically is in the speed of the line from the end of the network to your device or, more often, in your operating system.",
        "And what does the router do?",
        "Is that what you helped invent, the modern-day router?",
        "Yes.",
        "I invented the concept of demand access, one example of which is packet switching, and along with that this idea of distributed control, distributed responsibility for deciding which are the good paths, and let's select them on a dynamic basis.",
        "Right now, where's the best way to go?",
        "And the interesting thing is, when I started looking at this problem, I said, I want to build large networks, not small ones.",
        "So we cannot give the control of this large network in the hands of a single node or a single location.",
        "I had to distribute that function across the entire network.",
        "So everybody's smart, everybody's looking for good paths, and they're constantly being found as traffic arrives to be re-sent and re-upped.",
