        "In fact, the original purpose was simply to share resources between computers so that if you had an excellent graphics-processing capability and I wanted to use it, I would log onto your system through the network and use your graphics by logging on.",
        "This was data exchange.",
        "It was also there for people-to-computer exchange, so I could reach out.",
        "What I never anticipated - and by the way, there is a written, published press release that came out before this network was deployed in which I do provide and articulate a vision - I never anticipated it would come to be that this was a network of people communicating with each other, the social networking.",
        "And email didn't come in until 1972.",
        "Once it did, it was clear to me, ah, this is about people communicating, not about machines talking to each other.",

        "These exchanges were between scientists who were conducting research in computer science and other areas of interest.",
        "Is there any way to predict where this is all heading?",
        "So there's two parts to that question.",
        "One is what are the applications going to be.",
        "And the best thing we can do, we can predict that it will be impossible to predict those new applications that are coming because we've had a sequence of surprising applications throughout the history of the Internet.",

        "Nobody saw those applications coming.",
        "They hit us on the side of the head.",
