        "He has been talking about it a lot.",
        "He keeps bringing it up - brought it up yesterday, brought it up again today.",
        "He sees it as a deterrent.",
        "But he also talks about how with these mass shootings the killing happens very quickly, that there isn't enough time for law enforcement to scramble.",
        "So he is saying that he wants teachers and others to have weapons, but he does want them to be highly trained.",
        "He says it could be anywhere from 10 to 40 percent of people on campus, adults on campus.",
        "And, you know, he talks in that very same language that the NRA used about hardening schools, that schools shouldn't be a soft target.",
        "You know, this is not a new concept, actually, the idea of a good guy with a gun versus a bad guy with a gun.",
        "And several states after Sandy Hook - all red states and kind of more like a handful - did pass legislation allowing adults to have guns on campus.",
        "Well, that leads to my question, which is, how much power either politically or legally does the president have here?",
        "If laws on guns are going to change in this country, that's of course the remit of Congress.",
        "So how much can he actually do?",
        "It's a good question.",
        "He can't do much through executive action.",
        "He has to do it through Congress.",
        "He did on bump stocks, which is another thing he's talked about.",
        "That's the device that goes on a semiautomatic weapon that would make it fire more rapidly, more like a machine gun.",
        "Right.",
        "He's asking ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, to do it through regulatory action.",
        "ATF has determined in the past that it can't do it through regulations, that legislation is the only way to do it.",
        "At this point, the White House and the president aren't proposing legislation on that.",
        "And briefly, Tam, on some of the other issues that are getting a lot of play right now - how this country should look at mental health, background checks - any specific proposals on the table from the president there?",
        "No specific proposals yet.",
        "He is also talking a lot about the idea of raising the age for purchasing a rifle from 18 to 21.",
        "Again, that is something that would require legislation.",
        "And although it's getting some traction now, especially in the Florida Statehouse, it's not clear in the light of day in Congress how that would pass.",
        "How it's all going to play out.",

        "He had done some consulting work for Oleg Deripaska.",
        "He's a person who's also considered one of the go-to people.",
        "If you wanted Putin's ear, Deripaska could be an ally-slash-go between for the president of Russia.",
        "And in this case, you have the campaign chairman of the 2016 GOP nominee for the White House wanting to get in good financial graces with that Russian billionaire while he was running Donald Trump's campaign.",
        "Is there any evidence that there ever was a briefing?",
        "No.",
        "There's no evidence that it ever happened.",
        "And, actually, a spokesperson for Oleg Deripaska told us yesterday that there absolutely was never anything like that.",
        "However, what we know about is one side of the conversation, one side which is in the United States where at least Paul Manafort hoped very much to figure out a way to make financial use or - or benefit from his campaign role working for Donald Trump.",
        "And I'm sure you reached out to Paul Manafort for comment.",
        "What does he say?",
        "His spokespeople said yesterday that he did have indeed a number of debts, a lot of people owed him money who worked for him in foreign countries - I'm sorry, who he worked for in foreign countries - and that he has made no secret of that.",
        "And, you know, the - the salaciousness of the quotes in the emails that we reviewed are, in the words of Manafort's spokespeople, quite innocuous because he was simply trying to get some of those old debts repaid, some of the bills that he was owed.",
        "He expected folks to repay him, and that's all that these emails suggest."
