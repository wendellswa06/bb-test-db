        "By making small adjustments in the shape of the nose or canopy or wings, you can sort of smear out that shock wave so it has less of a punch.",
        "Aeronautical engineer Doug Hunsaker says you don't have to make dramatic adjustments.",
        "Very small changes to the aircraft can have actually a very significant impact on the sound that you hear on the earth.",
        "Hunsaker is at Utah State University.",

        "He says weather has a big impact on that movement.",
        "In fact, humidity affects it a lot.",
        "Hunsaker says his colleagues at Texas A&M University are testing metal alloys that would allow a plane to change shape in the air.",
        "That would mitigate the sonic boom depending on changing weather conditions.",
        "The new plane is the first experimental jet NASA has built in more than a decade.",
        "The thing that I'm most excited about actually is that NASA is moving back to this hexplane concept.",

        "He says experimental planes have been crucial to advancing aviation.",
        "It wouldn't surprise me at all if, say, 10 years from now that we're back flying supersonically."
