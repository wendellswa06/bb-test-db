        "To release the American journalist, Isis wanted cash.",
        "They also wanted the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani woman serving an 86-year sentence in a Texas prison.",
        "In 2004, this Siddiqui appeared on the FBI's list of most wanted terrorists.",
        "But shortly before that, she seemed to be living a normal life in America, with a husband, three children and a PhD from Brandeis University.",
        "Shane Harris wrote about Siddiqui for the latest issue of Foreign Policy magazine, where he's a senior staff writer.",
        "He says Siddiqui is one of the most mysterious figures in the American war on terrorism.",
        "Well, interestingly, she was not convicted of terrorism.",
        "She was taken into custody in Afghanistan in 2008.",
        "And when American officials went to go interrogate her, they stepped into a room that she was being held in.",
        "And apparently, we're not told that she was actually in the room and that she was not handcuffed and not secured.",
        "And she jumped out, the FBI says in an affidavit, from behind a curtain, grabbed a rifle that had been left on the floor and shot at her American interrogators.",
        "So she was arrested and tried and convicted for attempted murder of U.S.",
        "officials.",
        "And her supporters have a very different version of what happened.",
        "Can you explain that?",
        "Yeah - extremely different.",
        "By the time that she was arrested in 2008 in Afghanistan, she had been missing from Pakistan for about five years.",
        "And there is an alternate story here about Siddiqui that is very widely held, I think, in Pakistan that she was disappeared by Pakistani intelligence and handed over to the American CIA and that she was possibly held in prison at the airbase in Bagram in Afghanistan for as long as five years.",
        "And people allege that she was tortured and brutalized while she was there.",
        "How often has Siddiqui's release come up as a demand from radical or terrorist groups?",
        "Mary Louise, you know, what is the question everybody asks all the time?",
        "The reason we found this so startling is that central question has been, is there a connection amid all the investigations, is there a connection between Donald Trump's campaign in 2016 and Russian officials or Russian individuals who really had a connection to the Kremlin?",
        "You've seen ways in which there have been meetings.",
        "You've seen, you know, Donald Trump, Jr. meeting with somebody who was connected in some way.",
        "And this is one more link.",
