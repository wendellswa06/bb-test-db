        "Yeah, it changed my life tremendously, I mean - but at the same time - like, OK, because I was with her for a few years before we got taken away from her, so that's where I feel like I really developed my comedy chops because I figured if I make her laugh, you know, she won't - she won't hit me.",
        "Because, you know, when you have a brain injury, it's very hard and especially if you were - before the injury, you were very intellectual, intelligent person that has an excellent vocabulary and then you can't pull your words anymore and you get frustrated.",
        "And she would hit and stuff.",
        "And, like, I was just trying to - if I could make her laugh, then I probably won't get hit.",
