        "And now she, you know, she's almost gone to the other extreme, where she doesn't believe anything that's being told to her by her own country.",
        "And I guess my question for your guest is, given the fact that the Chinese government can control the media sources even down to the Internet websites as closely as they can, what real hope is there that the Chinese people are ever going to really know the truth of what's going on in their country?",
        "Well, I think first of all, nowadays, many people can travel freely abroad.",
        "And I came to Canada as an international student, and that was really a good chance for me to know the world and know the truth.",
        "And even as long as - I know, even within China, people who cannot travel outside they have tools to break the Internet block.",
        "For example, our newspaper, the Epoch Times, is very critical of the Chinese human-rights situation, and we receive responses from inside China from people who have got the tools and could break the Internet block, and we were really surprised by how many people actually could read our articles.",
        "However, given that, still, I think the latest number I heard, only about 250 million people in China have access to the Internet.",
        "That still leaves well over a billion who do not.",
        "How on Earth are those people ever going to learn what's really going on, absent having a computer in their own home?",
        "Well, I think it's - that's also something that we should work on.",
        "It's not just some job that journalists should do, but also, for example, this time at the chance of the Olympic Games, Westerners, they can go to China and they - some people protest against the oppression, human rights, and they are hurt by Chinese people, so I think it's a long way to go.",

        "And putting that aside, much has been also said about human rights and integrity of issues, this, that and the other, and I agree with all that.",
        "I do want to just comment on, you know, kind of how this little girl might feel.",
        "It's just kind of from the Chinese cultural standpoint.",
        "The reality is, in China, looks are very important.",
        "I mean, it might have come from thousands of years ago where, you know, if you had better looks, you were probably blessed by the gods and this, that, the other, and you are just most favored among people.",
        "And in fact, even today, a lot of decisions are made based on looks.",
        "I mean, I can tell you some job applications will flat out ask for photos to be pasted on the job application, or you know, some people are rejected because of - maybe they are not tall enough, maybe they are not pretty enough, their teeth are crooked, this, that, the other.",
        "So, I really think that it's possible, and earlier on your guests have mentioned that, you know, this girl will probably cried in private, maybe.",
        "But it's also possible that this little kid is totally OK with it ,because she, you know, I think she, personally, I think she's adorable.",
        "I think she is very cute, but funny - by some standards, she is not cute enough, doesn't measure up quite the same, you know.",

        "I'm going just have to accept that and we have to look good as China, da, da, da, da.",
        "And that's what they go with, and I think, you know, I honestly think, in most Chinese minds, again, putting aside the integrity issue, this deception issue.",
        "I think just promoting the looks, this, that, the other, I think that's, by and large, acceptable in the Chinese society.",
        "Katie, I am afraid we're going to have to leave it there.",

        "Sure.",
