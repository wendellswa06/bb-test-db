        "Yes.",
        "Because scientific reasoning is really addressing the learning process, so it has to be developed through the process of discovering knowledge.",
        "You cannot just give students a certain way to learn the method.",
        "They have to really do it themselves.",
        "And so, I think in the U.S.",
        "school curriculum, although it's a little weak on the content side, but the emphasis on scientific method and scientific ways of knowing is very high.",
        "So, we need to keep doing what we already are strong in and - but we can think about putting a little bit more content in it.",
        "So, I think that's what American system should do.",
        "And you have been experimenting with this more interactive teaching style at OSU?",
        "Yes.",
        "Can you explain how it works a little bit?",
        "You have a little clicker, a remote control thing that you use.",
        "Yeah.",
        "For example, in a college lecture - because still, lecturing is the most cost-effective method, we have to use it - usually, you get couple hundred students sitting in a lecture hall and the professor just talking to them, and a lot of kids will get tired and bored and just not focus on anything.",
        "And so, we actually try to actually be - interact, so we give them a little remote controller type of thing, and we have a receiver.",
        "And so that we give them several questions during the one hour classroom session, and these are carefully designed questions, so they will trigger student into thinking different kind of ideas.",
        "Then we guide student into group discussion, and try to discover why they actually answer wrong or why they answered it correctly and what other ideas can be explored.",
        "And so, this would kind of create a mini-inquiry little session within the lecture system.",
        "Yeah, this...",
        "Quiz as they're doing the stuff?",
        "No, they use the remote controller just to beep their answer back right into the computer, and then you display the answer in real time, so they can see it - their own answers on the screen, so they get very motivated and very excited.",
        "And I guess kids grow up with this kind of interaction now, and they must expect it and like it in college."

        "You just can't sit them in a classroom anymore and have them be happy.",
        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "Better to give them a Xbox or something to play with physics or whatever (Laughing).",
        "Then they'll get them learning.",
        "Mm hmm.",
        "And do we need to retrain the teachers then to be better kinds of teachers?",
        "Yeah, definitely.",
        "And the most important thing is that teacher need to think about a different perspective, because they need to learn a totally new way of thinking today's kids and teaching them.",
        "So, basically this study is trying to help them to realize that.",
        "And - because there is really a common belief that by just training student with content, they can actually develop reasoning.",

        "I'm a technology teacher in New York state, and we've been teaching the project with WAVE curriculum, and it's helping out students that are going into engineering.",
        "It's basically pretty much - it's the open-ended.",
        "It's college-level curriculum, but it's open-ended and you're giving kids problems to solve in - that they - and you're teaching students how to solve problems, not so much the vocabulary that goes with it, but that goes along with it.",
        "And I think we need to move that way in the sciences as well.",
        "You don't find them deficient in their knowledge of the facts and it doesn't matter.",
        "Well, if you apply - if the kids are applying it - for instance, we'll do a project with - in computer-integrated manufacturing with CNC machines, and if the kids need to do geometry to come up with a solution, then they do it because they have a need to, not because, here's geometry.",
        "Learn it because you're going to need it.",
        "Right.",
        "No one ever needs an upstream-downstream problem, do they?",
        "No, and also, the project, with the way it works out, there's intensive training for teachers because teachers really need to understand how to teach.",
        "It's like your other guest has said, it's a totally different methodology of teaching when you're trying to teach applied items, such as - like you were saying - like science and the scientific method.",
        "You can teach kids the scientific method through a lecture, but for them to really understand it, I think they need to actually use that scientific method and use it successfully.",
        "All right, Chris, thanks for calling.",
        "Lao, what do you think of that?",
        "Yeah, this is really in the right direction, because in physics we're actually experimenting for a long time.",
        "This inquiry-based education, it basically asks students to think about a scenario, explore the situation, design your experiment.",
        "So, everything is open to them, and so in this way actually, the kids learn quantum much better because each quantum piece is actually connected - well-connected to other things they have learned.",
        "And also, they know how to apply them, and it makes it more meaningful for them.",
        "And the methodology gained through doing this hands-on and the group-learning environment kind of experience will really carrying them out into future, because basically, there's no text book teach you how to exactly build the future.",
        "You have to be really to build it yourself.",
        "And this kind of methodology thing is really, really important."

        "But you wouldn't throw out the factual teaching, like the kind they do in China?",
        "No, no, I wouldn't, but I would say, just as I repeat, it's like we want the fact learned in a way so that it become an integral part of your knowledge system and can support your reasoning application.",
        "And if you have the ability - and most people can gain certain knowledge quickly, and they have motivation to do so - and so, I think we need to come a balanced method, like educating both content and the scientific method.",
        "So, this is actually the big question that we have to invest into research.",
        "And what would you - exactly would you be looking at in your next research?",
