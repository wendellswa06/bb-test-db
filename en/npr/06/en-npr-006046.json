        "There's no precise, universally accepted definition of artificial intelligence.",
        "But basically, it's about getting a computer to be smart, getting it to do something that in the past, only humans could do.",
        "One key to artificial intelligence is machine learning.",
        "Instead of telling a computer how to do something, you write a program that lets the computer figure out how to do something all on its own.",
        "For example, let's say you'd like a computer to be able to pick out one conversation at a crowded restaurant.",
        "This is a problem that's been around for a long time.",
        "That's John Hershey.",
        "He's a computer scientist.",
        "When people start to lose their hearing, this is one of the first things to go, it's the ability to separate one voice from another.",
        "Hershey says nobody knows how our brains are able to separate voices, so he can't tell a computer exactly how to do it.",
        "But at the Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory in Massachusetts, he and a colleague used a kind of machine learning called deep learning to let a computer learn how to separate voices.",
        "Deep learning is all the rage in AI at the moment.",
        "It works something like this.",
        "You give the computer some input, in this case, the sound of people talking.",
        "At first to the computer, this is just meaningless noise.",
        "But then you tell the computer what people are saying.",
        "Like a baby learning new words, the computer figures out what sounds go with what words.",
        "Once it's practiced and practiced and practiced, it can apply what it's learned to voices it's never heard before.",
        "Hershey invited me to send him voices and he'd see if his program could separate them.",
        "So I sent him this.",
        "The two voices belong to NPR's Kelly McEvers and Ari Shapiro.",

        "We usually see butterflies hanging out around flowers and drinking nectar.",

        "President Trump is at Camp David for a weekend retreat with republican congressional leaders and some members of his cabinet.",
        "The goal is to plot out the GOP policy agenda for this year ahead.",

        "Hershey says it's possible that Kelly and Ari's voices are quite different from the voices the computer trained on.",
        "And that's a problem, according to critics of the deep learning approach.",
        "You need a lot of data to make this kind of technique work.",
        "Gary Marcus is a psychologist who works on artificial intelligence at New York University.",
        "In some ways, deep learning resembles how scientists think the brain learns.",
        "The brain is made up of about 100 billion or so neurons.",
        "Scientists think the connections among these neurons change as people learn a new task.",
        "Something similar is going on inside a computer.",
        "But human brains learn a lot of stuff on their own.",
        "Marcus says for deep learning, you need a lot of data to train the computer.",
        "And sometimes you can't find that data.",
        "Marcus worries people may be too enthralled with this approach to see its limitations.",
        "One of the key questions about AI right now in practical terms is how risky is it if I make a crazy error?",
        "So let's say the computer in a driverless cars sees someone wearing a T-shirt with a picture on it of a highway receding into the distance.",
        "It's just possible the computer would be misled that the road on the shirt was a real road.",
        "They make a mistake.",
        "They're not perfect.",

        "He says if you're using artificial intelligence to pick songs people might like, an error is hardly catastrophic.",
        "But if you made a pedestrian detector that's 99 percent correct, that sounds good but then you do the math and think about how many people would die every day if you had, you know, a fleet of those cars and it's really not very good at all.",
        "In a memoir called \"\"The Beautiful Struggle,\"\" Coates writes about his father, Paul Coates, a Vietnam veteran and one-time leader of the local chapter of the Black Panthers, one of the relatively few fathers who stayed in that neighborhood to help raise his seven children.",
        "He tells the story of how he and his older brother, Big Bill, dealt very differently with the challenges and temptations of the street and he explains two very different kinds of knowledge, the language of the street corner and the political consciousness he learned from his father and from his father's books.",
