        "As I have said before, I was basically dragged across the finish line by my parents and by my wider community.",
        "It's completely corny to say, but I desperately believe that, in fact, it does take a village to raise a child, and no matter how cliche that sounds, I mean, that doesn't have anything to do whether it's true or not.",
        "I say all that to say I simply marvel at people who sort of just emerge from the Earth and who of their own volition and their own decisions sort of make their way out.",
        "And again, it was again once of the reasons why I started doing this story on my father, because I just had no understanding for how he could be so different as far as I was concerned from where he came from.",
