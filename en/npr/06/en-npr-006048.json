        "Maybe we'll get some Baldwin in here, but I have to say, the one thing I regret, because as much as this book is a love song to my dad, it's a love note also to hip-hop, which, I will always say, taught me how to think, taught me how to write.",
        "It just taught me to love language.",
        "And I wish someone had told me when I was 14 or 15 that, son, one day this is going to become a racket, too, because I was young and naive and was like, wow, it's going to be like this forever.",

        "You said he exchanged some rhymes with your brother at one point and then you don't write about him again, not part of the flowering or part of the collapse.",
        "Right, well, there are a couple of reasons for that.",
        "I mean, the most - the first reason is that they left Baltimore, and so it was, like, in the story.",
        "I was deeply tempted to not put that in the story at all, and my editor actually made me put it in.",
        "And the reason was not out of any sort disrespect for him or his family, quite the opposite.",
        "I didn't want to feel like I was name-dropping.",

        "It was quite shocking - I did, and I must say, with great sadness, I mean, when it went down that path and when it looked like he was headed that way, and for the ultimate result, it was - is, completely heartbreaking to me, both him and Big.",
        "It' just, I mean, deeply depressing and deeply heartbreaking.",

        "Well it's a whole different ballgame now.",
        "I think in the '80s, like the gentleman said, crack came out, HIV was coming out.",
        "I think that the education wasn't as prevalent as it is now in regard to drugs, and you know, and everything that happened with my cousins, they were all boys, but they all got molested.",
        "So, you know, there was a lot of information that wasn't given to us as kids.",
        "Whereas the kids nowadays, I think, there's a lot of information available to them.",
        "There are books.",
        "There are self-help books, counselors and just a lot of more awareness.",
        "So I'm not sure if it's harder, but I will say that the awareness is more prevalent now.",

        "Appreciate the phone call.",
        "Can I just say - I just want to say I think she really hit on something there I hadn't even thought of, and that being the education piece.",
        "I - you know, even as a child, I think the violence, the gun violence in the cities was just completely shocking to so many people.",
        "There was no precedent for that many guns being available in the street for children.",
        "Essentially children so young to having guns available to them to being able to kill people over the smallest things, over hats, jackets.",
        "And I think people just went into a sort of shock.",
        "I mean, again, even as a child, you know, who had no previous experience, I knew that something was deeply wrong.",
        "Something was deeply, deeply strong.",
        "And even for people who did not have relatives who didn't get killed, the very presence of - the idea that maybe you might get shot, it just haunted everything, and it really corrupted everything.",
        "And your brother, at one point, got himself a gun.",
