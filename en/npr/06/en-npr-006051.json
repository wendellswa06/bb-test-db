        "He's got this tall, paternal warmth with this really sweet kind of feminine caring side.",
        "He's got a sort of lyricism in the way he speaks and the way he moves.",

        "There's a certain flavor of misogyny that is only saved for transwomen.",

        "They stick out more than transmen.",
        "They're more vulnerable.",
        "That visibility and visual difference might also be why we're seeing so many more transwomen than transmen on television right now.",
        "Some transgender activists are criticizing \"\"Transparent\"\" because it's cast a non-transgender actor, Jeffrey Tambor, in the role.",

        "And so it was through this family, this distant family connection that I was contacted.",
        "Before we can contact the authorities, we have to gather proof.",
        "And so we had to go to Rwanda to seek out witnesses because it's through the witnesses that we are able to build our cases.",

        "This is a legal case or criminal case, but the French government hasn't proceeded with it.",
        "So it would be very interesting to get an answer to this question.",
        "Why do you think the French government is reluctant to prosecute these cases?",
        "(Through translator) I think it's because at the time in 1994, the French government was absolutely complicit in these events.",
        "They trained the soldiers.",
        "They provided the killers with weapons.",
        "And so for this reason, the fact that they are completely implicated in what happened, they're very reluctant to proceed.",
        "In 2010, the president of France at the time, Nicolas Sarkozy, visited Rwanda and admitted to grave errors of judgment by France during the genocide, and said France would seek out those responsible.",
