        "They're adding a second shift.",

        "The easy numbers first - $53 million raised in March to re-elect Obama, and $12.6 million raised by the Romney campaign to win the Republican primaries.",
        "But those easy numbers don't give a complete picture.",
        "For one thing, the Obama number is the total for a rather complex campaign structure: the president's campaign committee; the Democratic National Committee; and something called the Swing State Victory Fund, which sends money to state Democratic parties in the dozen or so battlegrounds.",
        "The legal limit for anyone giving to the Obama campaign committee is $5,000.",
        "The limit for all those entities is nearly 76,000.",
        "Romney is building a similar structure, now that he's finishing up the GOP primary season.",

        "The superPACs, with their ability to raise unlimited contributions.",
        "The pro-Republican Crossroads organization, co-founded by strategist Karl Rove, says it's raised just under $100 million since January 2011.",
        "Only some of that is disclosed.",
        "American Crossroads, the superPAC, files monthly reports.",
        "Crossroads GPS, a 501(c)(4) advocacy group, isn't required to.",
        "There's also a superPAC supporting Romney, which raised $50 million to carpet-bomb the other primary candidates.",
