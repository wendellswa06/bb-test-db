        "The London Met Police commissioner, Cressida Dick, she said London is a city of many faiths and many nationalities.",
        "And an attack on one community is an attack on all of us.",
        "Terrorists will not succeed in their attempt to divide us and make us live in fear.",
        "Have you been able to talk to more people who just live in the area in this community?",

        "They don't want to speculate because we don't know anything about this guy.",
        "But their concern is this is retaliation for all the attacks that have been coming really in the last three months or so.",
        "We had the attack on the Westminster Bridge, the Manchester attack, the bombing outside the Ariana Grande concert and the London Bridge attack.",
        "And people here, of course, feel this is totally unfair, that they're innocent worshippers.",
        "They're not behind this, and they're also scared.",

        "And she says now, living in London, she's really frightened and doesn't want to go back to the mosque.",

        "Yeah, the U.S.",
        "military said it was acting in, quote, \"\"collective self-defense.\"\" The Syrian plane was shot down after it had dropped bombs on local forces who get support from the United States, a reminder that this conflict in Syria has just become more complicated.",
        "I mean, not only is the country locked in this civil war, as it's been for six years, but there's also the fight against the Islamic State.",

        "So is Iran.",

        "Hey, how are you?",

        "So the U.S.",

        "But the U.S.",

        "But the Syrian military and its allies also want to be the ones to retake some of this critical eastern territory from ISIS.",
        "So these U.S.",
        "partners are coming into contact now with the Syrian regime forces.",
        "And that is the issue we have today.",

        "Well, indeed, Iran just launched missiles from - from Iran into Syria against ISIS.",
        "Now, this struck an area a bit away from the Raqqa front.",
        "But again, it shows how many different players are operating.",

        "Yes.",
        "Essentially, the way that the budget rules work, you can only work on one of these bills at one time.",
