        "The business community didn't much like Mr. Obama during the campaign.",
        "He was viewed by many as anti-business.",
        "The president attempted to disabuse the CEOs of that notion as he began his remarks.",
        "I am passionately rooting for your success.",
        "Because if the companies in this room are doing well, then small businesses and medium-size businesses up and down the chain are doing well.",
        "If companies in this room are doing well, then folks get jobs, consumers get confidence, and we're going to be able to compete around the world.",
        "But the president and this powerful business group still have differences.",
        "The Roundtable is on the record urging the extension of the Bush era tax cuts for everyone, including the wealthy, despite the president's argument that the wealthy need to pay more.",
        "The president made his case for why rate hikes for the wealthy are necessary.",
        "It is not possible for us to raise the amount of revenue that's required for a balanced package if all you're relying on is closing deductions and loopholes."

        "He agrees avoiding another debt ceiling fight is critical.",

        "Yes.",
        "He fell ill while on the plane, and the people who were hosting him took him basically from the airport to a hospital.",
        "But the truth is that at the beginning, the hospital didn't know that they were dealing with a possible case of Ebola.",
        "And they were actually treating him for malaria because a lot of the early symptoms of Ebola look a lot like malaria and other very common illnesses in this part of the world.",
        "So yes, there was a window period.",
        "And the Lagos State Government has said that during that window period, a few people were exposed without having the proper protection.",
        "So Yinka, the only people who are showing symptoms right now, that we know of in Nigeria, are medical personnel who were actually treating Patrick Sawyer.",
        "Yes, we do know that most, if not all of them, are hospital staff from the hospital where he was taken initially.",
        "A nurse who treated Patrick Sawyer died two days ago, and a doctor who treated him is also one of the five confirmed Ebola cases that are still alive.",
        "Now, Yinka, the big concern here in Lagos is that if this started to spread, it could spread very quickly because this is a large city with a lot of people in close quarters.",
        "Do health officials feel like they have control of this?",
        "Have they figured out the people who might have been in contact with Patrick Sawyer, and they're able to stop this from spreading?",
        "So yes, Lagos is a mega-city of more than 20 million people.",
        "That makes it quite different in how to handle it as it has been in rural areas where Ebola has thrived.",
        "And Lagos State Government has said that they're taking it very seriously, that they need to trace every single contact of Patrick Sawyer.",
        "And they brought that list down to 70 people.",
        "And they're now doing secondary contact tracing.",
        "So that's even more complex.",
        "They're trying to make a list of all the people who were in touch with everyone who was in touch with Patrick Sawyer.",
        "One of the problems has been, in other countries, that people don't immediately go to a hospital to seek medical attention if they think they have Ebola.",

        "Well, is the government trying to get the message out that you have to seek medical attention pretty quickly if you want a chance of survival?",
        "Exactly, so that's the main message of the government - and that if you do get help quickly, even though there is no cure, they're going to do everything possible to give you the supportive care, which means that they're going to basically keep you hydrated because Ebola kills you because you lose all your body fluids.",
        "So the messages that the government is sending, are they getting through?",
        "I mean, are people cooperating with the government?",
        "Well, the cities are very big, so there are some people who, as of today, have never heard Ebola.",
