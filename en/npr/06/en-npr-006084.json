        "She had questions, of course, about conflicts in the Bible or the role of women, but she set her concerns aside.",
        "When she became a United Methodist pastor nine years ago, she started asking sharper questions.",
        "She thought they'd make her faith stronger.",
        "In reality, as I worked through them, I found that religion had so many holes in it that I just progressed through stages where I couldn't believe it.",

        "I don't believe.",
        "And in the moment that I uttered that word, I stumbled and choked on that word, atheist.",
        "But it felt right.",
        "Online, MacBain found the Clergy Project, an anonymous community of clergy who have lost their faith.",
        "Now she had allies, but no easy escape.",
        "She began applying for jobs.",

        "She worried about this as she drove around.",
        "She didn't know what to say.",
        "So what the hell am I supposed to do?",
        "Man, really, the options are work at something like Starbucks or McDonald's.",
        "And even there, they're going to ask those questions.",
        "And I could even clean houses and not make a great amount of money, but at least nobody would be asking me questions.",
        "One Sunday on her way to church, MacBain realized she could no longer bear her double life.",
        "I've got to come out - I've got to get out of it.",
        "It used to terrify me of what people's reaction would be.",
        "But it's been so long now, and I've done this for so long, I don't even care.",
        "The sermon she gave that day was her last.",
        "I'm here at the American Atheist convention, where in just about two and a half hours, I will be standing before a group, sharing my story, and coming out officially as an atheist."

        "Now, I think that many people will be surprised to learn that Rube Goldberg won a Pulitzer Prize as an editorial cartoonist.",
        "What was the cartoon that won the prize?",
        "It was a cartoon called \"\"Peace Today\"\" and it shows a giant atomic bomb teetering on the edge of a cliff with a lovely little picket fence around a little house with a few people sitting on the lawn.",
        "And below, it's written, world destruction.",

        "It seems to me, as I look through this book, that there are a lot of cartoonists working today who owe a big debt to your grandfather.",
        "Well, it's funny, when you win sort of the Academy Award of cartooning, you win a Reuben, and it's named after Rube.",
        "And so when he was getting on in years, he was very upset that he had now won a Reuben.",
        "And my father had to explain to him, but, you know, Rube, it's named after you.",
        "That didn't' really go over too well with him and ultimately he was awarded his own Reuben.",
        "But, yes, the drawings themselves, you know, I make a distinction the early drawings versus the middle period drawings and the later drawings.",
        "Really, it's that early and middle period that are so extraordinary and you see his hand on every page.",
        "By the later period, he had kind of lost his fine motor skills.",
        "The lines are thicker.",
        "The other thing is he drew funny.",

        "Adam Gopnik, what do you think is his legacy today?",
        "We live at the end of the great age of the mechanism, and so we look back and then not so much with the bemusement but with a certain longing for a world as neat, as sharp as black and white and lucid as Goldberg's world was.",
        "And so I think as long as we have a fascination with machines, with mechanisms, Goldberg's work will go on.",
        "Any Rube Goldberg machine worth its salt goes viral on the web today.",
        "So, I think that people are just, they're love Rube Goldberg machines.",
        "They love to actually - oh, I get how that words.",
        "I mean, we are so hostage to our iPhones and our technology and really truly how does that work, this at least you can figure out when you take a look at it.",
        "And we're all delighted by the idea that there is an insanely complicated way of achieving something extremely simple."

        "Indeed.",
        "I think what's insidious about Stand Your Ground laws is that in every jurisdiction that has them, they tilt the balance of power in any street encounter in favor of the person who has a gun.",
