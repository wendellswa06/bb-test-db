        "Is he saying they don't know what they're getting into, or is he saying that the desperation of their situation, their poverty, makes any offer, well, too good to turn down?",
        "He's saying both, because I think it's naive for us to think that everyone who is trafficked was unaware of the existence of prostitution and forced prostitution.",
        "There are women who know that the place that they're going to, this is what they would be."
