        "Well, I want to start by reiterating what you already said.",
        "The statement ends with four recommendations, and none of those mention this compromise.",
        "The recommendations are that the American Academy of Pediatrics opposes all forms of female genital cutting that pose risks of physical or psychological harm, encourages its members to educate themselves about the practice, recommends that members actively seek to dissuade families from carrying out harmful forms of FGC and recommends compassionate education of the parents of patients.",
        "Having said that, the controversial part, as you made mention, is a discussion toward the end of the possibility of pediatricians offering what would literally be a nick.",
        "And in the statement, we analogize it to ear piercing.",
        "And the idea here was that we knew that some pediatricians in Seattle a number of years ago who had a good relationship with the Somali immigrant community around their hospital had been asked by mothers of girls for this kind of compromise.",
        "And they had gone down the road of - they'd had meetings with mothers and so on, and they were about to do that...",
        "So this was mothers from some of these cultures where this is practiced had suggested that...",
        "Right, were Somali immigrant mothers.",
        "Okay, so it was their idea?"

        "Well, I'm not sure whose idea it was, but they embraced it to the extent that they held off on doing something worse until the doctors could get set up to start offering this.",
        "But before that could happen, Congresswoman Pat Schroeder wrote to tell the hospital that it would be criminal under her new law that had recently passed in Congress.",
        "The concern is that we know that in many cases, when pediatricians turn down parents, girls are taken back to Africa for the worst possible procedures done, you know, with no painkilling and no, you know, no infection control and extremely severe forms of these procedures where girls' labia are scraped away, for example.",
        "This last idea made quite a stir when it was raised five years ago.",
        "But separating government powers and having them check and balance each other apparently sounded too much like Western democracy for some leaders' tastes, and the idea was scrapped.",
