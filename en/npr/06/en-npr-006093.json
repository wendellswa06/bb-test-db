        "And there are other non-Muslim countries that do it.",
        "But what about the idea that nicking itself is already across some line, that whether you do that or not, there's a big education issue here and that if you do that, you either medicalize it or somehow legitimize the process, even if not the specific procedure.",
        "I know, and obviously that is a serious concern.",
        "I think one way to think about this and one reason why it is so controversial is in terms of other kinds of harm reductions that have also been controversial.",
        "For example, we'd like to eradicate heroin addiction entirely, but we can't at the present time, and we give clean needles instead to protect people from HIV, for example.",
        "So we hope to reduce harm, and of course, the critique is: Aren't we just condoning, you know, people shooting up?",

        "But a part of this discussion I think should be whether or not there's evidence that the, you know, the ritual nick would in fact displace the other procedure, would satisfy the families and improve the situation.",
        "Do we have any evidence that that's the case?",
        "We have a little bit of evidence.",
        "It's not a lot because it was not legal for that to happen in the U.S.",

        "For example, it's common to hear people say oh, they think, you know, the religion calls for it, but they're wrong, as if, you know, somebody in Philadelphia can tell, you know, an entire population of Egypt what their religion calls for.",
