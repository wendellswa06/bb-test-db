        "And joining us to talk about the latest developments from Tokyo is NPR science correspondent Richard Harris.",
        "And Richard, what can you tell us about this fire?",
        "Well, Michele, there would be a risk to anyone who's standing right at the plant boundary, according to the measurements that we've seen.",
        "But the general public is actually at a considerable distance.",
        "You mentioned the 12 miles exclusion.",
        "There's even a farther distance where people are supposed to stay indoors.",
        "And I have not seen any radiation readings suggesting serious exposures to the public from this latest release of radiation at least, and certainly not at those distances.",
        "However, readings were very high at the plant itself and that means potentially, hundreds of workers there are at risk.",
        "The utility evacuated all but about 50 of its most essential workers after the radiation levels spiked.",
        "The senior government spokesman I talked to said he does not know what doses those workers have received.",
        "Richard, can you tell us more about the situation with these two events we mentioned, the fire at one unit and the explosion at another?",
        "Sure.",
        "The fire was in an area of one reactor that was containing old nuclear fuel that had been removed from the plant and was cooling down, according to information provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
        "It was a plant that wasn't operating at the time of the tsunami, and people weren't particularly worried about it until this incident, I guess.",
        "The fire burned for about two hours and during that time, radiation levels were high.",
        "They spiked around the area, and the prime minister came out and told the public this is a serious situation and it could get worse, but everyone should just remain calm.",
        "And in fact, the radiation levels have been falling since that fire was put out.",
        "There's not a lot of hard information about the fire.",
        "Officials believe it was triggered by hydrogen gas, potentially from spent fuel that had overheated.",
        "And it's not clear what condition the fuel is in now or what measures they're taking to cool it down to prevent this from overheating again.",
        "And what of the explosion?",
        "Again, we're hearing lots of speculation from experts about this.",
        "But we don't really know what has actually happened.",
        "Yesterday, engineers working in reactor unit two heard an explosion coming from a part of the plant that helped carry heat away from the reactor.",
        "There was also a reported drop in water pressure, and that led some people to conclude that this important part of the plant, called the suppression pool, had cracked.",
        "And we have heard from numerous outside experts that the damage there could have caused a breach in the steel and concrete vessel that contains the reactor.",
        "That's sort of the last line of defense to hold all that nuclear material in place.",
        "But again, the International Atomic Energy Agency officials at a briefing today stressed they don't actually - people don't really, clearly, know what has gone on there.",
        "So there's a lot of speculation; not so much fact."

        "But Richard, I do have to ask you the what-if question.",
        "What if there was a breach in the containment vessel?",
        "Well, that would provide an avenue for radioactive material to get into the environment.",
        "If it's in the form of steam explosions, that would spread it into the air, or it could instead contaminate the ground around the plant.",
        "Nobody we've talked to is suggesting we could have an explosive release on the scale of Chernobyl in 1986 or anything like that, though.",
        "And in perspective, let's not forget, this accident is clearly alarming, but it's part of a vastly larger event that has had huge impact on human life and human health - of course, the tsunami and the earthquake.",
        "And what happens next, then, in trying to bring the situation under control?",
        "Well, the challenge now is simply to cool off these reactors.",
        "And the trouble remains getting water to them without electricity to run pumps.",
        "And the electricity grid is still down; the diesel generators they have at the plant are still not functioning.",
        "And so they're still having major struggles getting water to these facilities, to pour on them and cool them down.",
        "Once they are cooled down, there will be a radioactive mess at this plant, it appears at this point.",
        "But once those reactor cores are cooled, it dramatically reduces the chance that the material will spread offsite.",
        "The best case is that this could happen in the next day or two.",
        "But I must say that we've been following this event for many, many days, and the best case has not yet happened.",
        "Richard Harris, thank you very much.",
        "My pleasure.",
        "That's NPR's Richard Harris, reporting from Tokyo.",
