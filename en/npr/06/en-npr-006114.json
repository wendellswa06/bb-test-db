        "Within hours the Egyptian army was on the run, and basically it called into question the whole Arab nationalist and socialist ideology, which was underpinning the region at the time.",
        "And that led to something called the sahwa, the Islamic awakening, that was really provoked by the defeat in the war, which was seen as almost a civilizational defeat.",
        "And then the execution of Sayyid Qutb, who's sort of the Lenin of this movement, happened.",
        "It had happened just before the war or the 1968-'67 War in 1966.",
        "I think that also energized this movement because Sayyid Qutb's martyrdom helped fuel this religious awakening, which, like the hippie revolution in the '60s in America, was a movement of the young against the old.",
        "Basically, the old ideas--of course, they had very different ideological underpinnings, but it seemed that the old ideas didn't work.",
        "And they turned towards religion, and a much more aggressive sort of Islamist interpretation of it was a solution to the region's ills.",
        "Sure, but that's the paradox, where it's young and old in this case.",
        "In the Muslim world, the young are turning back to religion, whereas in the West the young are quite pointedly turning away from it."
