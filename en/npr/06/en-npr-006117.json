        "Azam wanted no truck with, you know, overthrowing Middle Eastern governments or founding this kind of al-Qaeda-type organization.",
        "Bin Laden went ahead against the advice of his mentor, Abdullah Azam, and also many of his family and friends to set up al-Qaeda, which was aimed to sort of an Arab military force that would bring jihad to other places in the world.",
