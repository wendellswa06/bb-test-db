        "Hi, Kathleen.",
        "Yeah, thanks for taking my call.",
        "Sure.",
        "Peter, I've heard numerous interviews with you, and you often bring up the root causes of Osama bin Laden's attitude towards the US.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, do you think those root causes are being addressed, and how angry was Osama after Afghanistan fell off the US radar screen after the Russians were driven out of Afghanistan?",
        "I don't think he really cared about Afghanistan falling off the US radar screen, which would have happened in 1989 when we closed our embassy there.",
        "I mean, he was basically angry about the introduction of US troops into Saudi Arabia, which he saw as, you know, quote, unquote, \"\"defiling the holy land.\"\" He saw it as a permanent US military occupation.",
        "The forces weren't really drawn down in the numbers that he would have liked.",
        "You know, the root causes of the man's attitude towards the United States are its foreign policy.",
        "When I say that, I'm not suggesting we change it.",
        "I'm just saying that's what he is targeting us for.",
        "He's never talked about our freedoms or Hollywood or Madonna or these kinds of cultural issues.",
        "You know, Ayatollah Khameini had a cultural critique of the United States, called us the great Satan.",
        "Bin Laden has really a foreign policy critique.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And we talk about the fact that, well, here in the United States we didn't see Osama bin Laden coming.",
        "Maybe we didn't take him seriously enough.",
        "Was he seen--because we know and you document in the book that there were certainly fractures within the Muslim world and controversy about his rise to power.",
        "Did other Arab leaders and other Muslim leaders see him as a threat and see him as becoming as powerful as he did?",
        "Well, one of the perhaps unexpected things--discoveries in the book is the extent to which there was intense debate within the Taliban.",
        "Most senior--a lot of senior Taliban leaders did not want bin Laden to be in Afghanistan.",
        "And basically he only had one real important ally, which, of course Mullah Omar, the leader of the Taliban.",
        "But there were a number of Taliban officials telling things--you know, some of the--one of the reasons I could write the book at all is post-9/11 you could talk to people in the Taliban, and they would instead of sort of--you know, the official line about Osama is the world's greatest guy and he's got nothing to do with terrorism.",
        "They were actually saying, `Well, in fact, there were intense debates about getting rid of him.",
        "We wanted to be recognized by the international community.",
        "He was bad for business,' and that they rejected the al-Qaeda and the Arabs in many cases.",
        "The other part of the controversy was that he didn't seem to have much of a strategy.",
        "He had tactics and he could certainly attract followers because of this bravura, but the fact is there didn't seem to be a real overaching strategy."

        "I mean, his strategy is, you know, attack the far enemy, i.e. the United States, and that'll destabilize the near enemy, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.",
        "Well, that's--you know, I'm certain he thinks strategically, but I think I try and outline in the book that he kept--he keeps putting his--he keeps making these big mistakes.",
        "And the biggest mistake, it turns out, was 9/11.",
        "Many--one of his sons left him as a result of 9/11, a guy called Omar.",
        "He's in his mid-20s.",
        "Jihadists who had fought with bin Laden said that 9/11 was against Islam, and also it destroyed the Taliban and anybody who's ever sort of uttered the word jihad is now on the run.",
        "And they say that while it may be a tactical success against the United States, it was a strategic disaster.",
        "And so bin Laden completely misread the United States.",
        "He thought of the United States as a paper tiger, `Attack them on 9/11, it'll be like Somalia in the '90s.",
        "We'll sort of change all our policies.",
        "Well, it turned out to be quite the opposite, and the paper tiger emerged rather enraged.",
        "One of the things I found amazing in this book was the fact there is a Jihad magazine, once all this gets under way after the Soviet invasion, and that the jihadis are--you know, this is de rigueur.",
        "Everybody's got their copy of Jihad, and a lot of the material you have in the book comes from Jihad magazine.",
        "Yeah, this was sort of the in-flight magazine of bin Laden's and Abdullah Azam's Services Office.",
        "And, you know, one of the places it was most widely distributed was the United States.",
        "It had, you know, places like Tucson, Arizona; Brooklyn; Atlanta, Georgia.",

        "Ayman al-Zawahiri, the number two of al-Qaeda, actually came here on a fund-raising trip in the early '90s.",

        "What i--I'd like you to just comment real quick if you could on bin Laden's appeal--his message and how it spreads in light of the fact that as a person bin Laden isn't terribly charismatic in the sense of a Hitler or a Lenin or any of those other revolutionary leaders.",
        "He doesn't have the same fiery rhetoric, and I was just wondering if you'd comment on how the message spread the way that it did...",
        "Thanks, Jeff.",

        "...and how his personality figures in.",
        "Well, I think that's a good question.",
        "I mean, charisma may be in the eye of the beholder.",
        "I'm sure if you were in some beer hall meeting in 1923 and saw Hitler you may not have thought that he was such a great guy.",
        "So the same with bin Laden.",
        "One of the scenes I have in the book is a Belgian fundamentalist, female, by the name of Malika, who sees bin Laden on television with her husband and is so moved by this experience that they decide to move to Afghanistan in 2000.",
        "And in fact, her husband becomes the assassin of Ahmad Shah Masoud, who, of course, was bin Laden's great rival who was killed two days before 9/11.",
        "In Afghanistan.",
        "In Afghanistan.",
        "So you know, one of the methods that--I mean, there are a lot of different ways that I think bin Laden was able to recruit.",
        "One was, you know, appearances on television, through the Internet.",
        "You know, the guy has a very large media profile, and after the '98 embassy bombings and our rather ineffective US military response two weeks later, I think bin Laden was turned from a sort of, you know, somewhat marginal figure into a global celebrity, and that produced a wave of recruitment and some of the recruits talk about how exciting it is to meet bin Laden or what a moving experience it was.",
        "So again, charisma's in the eye of the beholder.",
        "For some people he certainly does have some form of charisma.",
        "Hi.",
        "I wondered if you would speak about Osama bin Laden's education and why he seemed to be very anti-education, especially for all the people in the Taliban in Afghanistan.",
        "Thank you, Jessica.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "But let's examine the premise.",
        "You lay it out in your book.",
        "Jeff just restated it.",
        "And that's the idea that you can't really understand the movement without understanding the personality.",
        "You know there's a historical critique that says personalities are always among us; they're just waiting for the opportunity for the conditions so that they gain credibility and power.",
        "Well, it's--I have an unfashionable view of history then because my view of history is that people change it, and you can't explain the Holocaust without Hitler and you can't explain the fact that the French were in Moscow in 1812 without Napoleon; it's just not possible.",
        "And you can't explain al-Qaeda without bin Laden.",
        "He founded it with nine other people.",
        "He was the leader from the beginning.",
        "He and Ayman al-Zawahiri his--I think, you know, instrumental in founding this.",
        "They've been instrumental in the ideology of al-Qaeda.",
        "They've had--they created a somewhat coherent world view, which unfortunately a number of people have signed up for.",
        "I guess the counter to that is that if you do that you suggest without Osama bin Laden there wouldn't have been this, and that the resentments of Muslim people wouldn't find some kind of an outlet that might be violent and dangerous, so we wouldn't have to worry if it only weren't for Osama and Adolf Hitler."

        "OK.",
        "Well, the only experiment we can run is the history that actually happened.",
        "And 9/11 was--you know, al-Qaeda did it.",
        "It wasn't the Animal Liberation Front or some Islamic group from Kashmir.",
        "To what extent is al-Qaeda now broken up and has the movement lost energy?",
        "We keep hearing that in fact the--whether or not al-Qaeda is still central there is quite a resistance movement.",
        "Well, I think there are three metrics for judging it--I mean, certainly al-Qaeda the organization has taken a huge hit since 9/11.",
        "Al-Qaeda the ideological movement, I think, remains pretty active and I think the Iraq War gave it a big boost, and I think there are three metrics for that.",

        "Peter, what is the--you talk a little bit in the book about this notion of blowback, the fact that the CIA really created al-Qaeda or the entire--this sort of Muslim fundamentalism network that we're now facing and more or less put lie to that, or at least minimized the impact of the CIA and say that Osama bin Laden had a bigger part in that.",
        "Well, I mean, I--just for clarity's purposes, the CIA, you know, obviously had a big role in the Afghan resistance, $3 billion they supplied, but they were basically signing checks.",
        "And it's interesting--it's a widely held view on the left that somehow CIA was involved in the founding of al-Qaeda or helped bin Laden, and conspiracy theorists around the world believe this, but there's just no evidence for it.",
        "Surprisingly, there are very few things that the US government and bin Laden agree upon, but Ayman al-Zawahiri has released statements that there was no backing from the United States.",
        "Other people within al-Qaeda--there really is just simply no evidence for that.",
        "The real story is not that the CIA knew who--you know, was helping out bin Laden 'cause they had no idea who he was until about 1995 when they first set up a unit in--specially looking at him directly in January of 1996.",
        "So really the story is not one of CIA complicity in the rise of bin Laden; it's actually ignoring the problem before it was too late.",
        "Yeah, and the blowback story is not so much that there was some kind of dark conspiracy to lead this guy to become suddenly the pariah he's become in the United States, but that they wanted a foil for the Soviet Union in Afghanistan; this became a problem later on, one that the CIA hadn't anticipated.",
