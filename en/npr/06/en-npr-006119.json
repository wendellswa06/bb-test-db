        "Yeah, I think so.",
        "I've been puzzled.",
        "I was puzzled by the fact that he never attacked Israel or Jewish targets before 9/11.",
        "But as I was thinking it through, these people are pathological anti-Semites, and for them the Pentagon was a Jewish target.",
        "I mean, they really believe their own propaganda that the Pentagon is entirely run by Jews.",
        "And so for them, 9/11 was an attack on an Israeli target if you enter their world view.",
        "But certainly bin Laden has repeatedly said that one of his motivations for attacking the United States is its relationship with Israel.",
        "Let's go to Ali, who's on the line from Princeton, New Jersey.",
        "Hello, Ali.",
        "Yes, hi.",
        "I just want to make a comment and if Peter can comment on it as well--is the fact that Osama bin Laden, being a Wahhabi, has a strong animosity towards the Shiite Muslims.",
        "After the mujaheddin were supported by the US, there was a lot of Shia-Sunni violence happening in neighboring Pakistan because of that, and now--I mean, he's stated out repeatedly how he hates the Shiites, and we now even say that the Iranians, who are predominantly Shiite Muslims, have harboring al-Qaeda.",
        "How could that be possible?",
        "Well, I would just disagree with you that bin Laden--bin Laden's really never said--I mean, I think bin Laden privately regards Shias as heretics, but he's been careful never to sort of denigrate them or talk about Shias as somebody to attack.",
        "You know, Zarqawi wrote bin Laden that rather famous letter saying, `Let's foment a civil war in Iraq.",
        "Let's kill the Shias as scorpions.",
        "Bin Laden really never replied to that.",
        "He has no interest in commanding such a civil war, partly because senior members of al-Qaeda are living under some form of house arrest in Iran.",
        "In fact, Saad bin Laden, one of bin Laden's sons, is in Iran, and I just think that bin Laden--that's just not a road he's ever chosen to go down.",
        "Let's talk about al-Qaeda in Iraq and Osama bin Laden's relationship with Mahmoud Zarqawi.",
        "Well, you know, their relationship in the past has been as much competitive as cooperative.",
        "Zarqawi, who's sort of a thug--he came out of the Jordanian prison system--went to Afghanistan, set up a training camp several hundred miles away from al-Qaeda's camps, maybe with some al-Qaeda help, but it was designed to be a separate organization with separate goals.",
        "Zarqawi really wanted to attack Jewish and Israeli targets and also the Jordanian government.",
        "Bin Laden wanted to attack the United States and by extension authoritarian governments in the Middle East.",
        "So they had sort of philosophical differences and they had--they competed for money.",
        "Some of the people--one of the persons in the book that I--whose interrogation I quote worked for--you know, talks about how they competed for resources.",
        "They really only came together as the Iraq War, you know, heated up.",
        "And Zarqawi never swore an oath of allegiance to bin Laden until 2004, two years into the war.",
        "So you know, Colin Powell had at his famous UN presentation said Zarqawi was the best evidence for this sort of al-Qaeda/Saddam Hussein nexus.",
        "Well, I just think that's nonsense, and in fact, I'm sure Colin Powell is regretting some of the statements he made there because the--you know, the evidence shows that Zarqawi was actually--sort of had a competitive relationship with al-Qaeda and it's only recently that he's entered into the spirit of cooperation and finally changed the name of his group to al-Qaeda in Iraq and finally sworn allegiance to bin Laden.",
        "So it's the invasion and occupation of Iraq that invites al-Qaeda in and gives it a grounding, a footing.",
        "Saddam Hussein didn't tolerate dissent of any kind.",
        "He wouldn't have wanted an opposition group whether it's called al-Qaeda or whatever the name of the group.",
        "You know, he was a totalitarian dictator.",
        "One of the most stunning things about this book, too, is the notion--the paradox.",
        "I mean, here is Osama bin Laden's greatest victory, the attacks on New York and in Washington, in effect being his downfall.",
        "That the most criticism he's received, and of course, it ends really in disaster.",
        "You lose Afghanistan; you lose Iraq.",
        "And then the United States goes into Iraq and you've got--maybe I could ask you to read this paragraph that I have outlined here in your book.",
        "Peter Bergen.",
        "(Reading) The United States' war in Iraq has energized al-Qaeda, its affiliated groups and like-minded jihadists around the world.",
        "What has happened in Iraq is what bin Laden could not have hoped for in his wildest dreams.",
        "The United States invaded an oil-rich Muslim nation in the heart of the Middle East, the very type of imperial adventure that bin Laden has long predicted is the, quote, unquote, \"\"Crusaders' long-term goal in the region."

        "Yeah, so that makes that Sammy Sosa deal, you know, look like an act of genius.",
        "And so what I'm thinking is it's the paradox.",
        "It's the victories.",
        "The victory in Iraq, the victory in Afghanistan becomes in a sense the president's downfall, if we can characterize it that way.",
        "And certainly Osama bin Laden loses at the moment of his greatest victory.",
        "Certainly 9/11 turned out to be a kamikaze mission for al-Qaeda.",
        "And I think that is was--there's something that I report upon in the book is this internal debate that was going on amongst jihadists--even old allies of bin Laden--about what a disaster the 9/11 attacks were.",
        "Let's go to the phones.",
        "Jessica is on the line from Reno, Nevada.",
        "Hello, Jessica.",
        "...in the history of the U.S.",
        "economy.",
        "Well, you know, Osama bin Laden's education is interesting actually because he didn't go to a madrassah.",
        "He went to a rather, sort of relatively speaking progressive European-inflected school in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",
        "He learned reasonable English, a language he chooses not to speak in.",
        "He then went to university, studied economics and public administration.",
        "He views on education for his own kids is that they should grow up, you know, memorizing the Koran and not really go and have formal educations.",
        "And Omar--the son I mentioned earlier who left bin Laden after 9/11--is apparently really feeling his lack of education.",
        "When he sees the other bin Ladens, of which he has 200 first cousins, they've all tended to have--be highly educated.",
        "But I think one other point I'd like to make is bin Laden's views, not just on education but on his family life in general, which is sort of interesting.",
        "Bin Laden had a discussion with one of his closest friends at the university, and who became his brother-in-law, about polygamy.",
        "And bin Laden said that, you know, `Our fathers married 20 times.",
        "We're going to do polygamy the, quote, unquote, \"\"right way,\"\" which is we're only going to marry four wives.",
        "We're not constantly going to divorce them.",
        "And he gave his wives a deal at a certain point when they were living in Sudan.",
        "Bin Laden's always led a very ascetic life, living, sleeping on the floor, no air conditioning, no refrigerator.",
        "And he said to his wives, `Life is going to be hard, and basically now is the time to leave if you want to leave,' and one of them left, along with his oldest son, Abdullah, who also left him and basically saying, `Look, we have all this money in the bank.",
        "Why are we living like peasants?",
        "So bin Laden's--his family life is sort of an interesting one--it's one I was able to delve into to some degree with the caveat that, of course, information about his family is hard to come by.",
        "Saudi Arabia is a very closed society and bin Laden has been very careful to reveal little about his personal life.",
        "Well, and that also raises the question about this first-person testimony.",
        "On the one hand, quite authentic.",
        "These are the words of people who knew him personally, but these people have a way of--or at least an interest in shading the truth and shading how they come out in this story.",
        "Are you concerned about that?",
        "Well, that's true.",
        "I--you know, if something was a bold-faced lie I think you can tell.",
        "You know, people at Guantanamo--I have some of their testimony in there and you can make your own judgments if somebody at Guantanamo is telling the whole truth about why they were, let's say, around Tora Bora as the Taliban fell.",
        "But in terms of their observations about Osama bin Laden characterizations, their role, their relationship with him...",
        "You know, I used my own judgment about whether I thought, you know, if people were being straight with me.",
        "Maybe I'm a hopelessly credulous person but I try to, you know, exclude things that I thought were totally, you know, were false or incorrect."

        "Good afternoon.",
        "I got a two-part question involving Al-Jazeera and the Taliban.",
        "First, part is do you think Al-Jazeera is assisting US support in Afghanistan with fighting the Taliban and in Iraq with fighting the insurgents, and the second part of the question is if the US were to capture Osama bin Laden alive, would that broadcast on Al-Jazeera grow support for the US or would it hurt our attempts to reform in Afghanistan and Iraq?",
        "Yeah, the best--it might be the best public diplomacy we ever did was parading Saddam Hussein on camera and checking for head lice, and that was brilliant propaganda.",
        "And that's what--we should capture bin Laden, we should do the same thing to him because we're dealing with a mythic figure whose mythic persona must be punctured in the same way we're doing with a mythic figure with Saddam.",
        "Unfortunately, I don't think we're going to capture bin Laden.",
        "By his own account, he wants to be--you know, die in the struggle.",
        "I take that sort of at face value.",
        "Is Al-Jazeera sort of a stooge for al-Qaeda or sort of anti-American?",
        "My view is Al-Jazeera is essentially largely a news organization with its own biases and has done some remarkable reporting around the world, including the only interviews with the operational commanders of 9/11, like Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Ramzi Binalshibh, where they laid out the whole plan a year after 9/11.",
        "And also Al-Jazeera--this sort of debate about whether Al-Jazeera's a good thing or a bad thing I think is basically dead because there are so many other Arab news satellite competitors, some conservative.",
        "You know, we have our own one called al-Hurra, which is the US government 24-hour news channel.",
        "And with the Internet, you know, no one has a monopoly of information.",
        "So I think that--I see Al-Jazeera as basically a news channel with perhaps some biases that are different from, let's say, the US government's view of the world, but I see them basically as a rather good group of journalists doing jobs in difficult places.",
        "They've been banned from a lot of Middle Eastern countries, for instance, Iraq; for instance, Saudi Arabia because of their reporting.",
        "Let's go back to the first part of Steven's question.",
        "What would be the impact of a martyred Osama bin Laden--martyred, say, in the process of trying to catch him.",
        "Oh, I think it would be bad.",
        "I mean, I think that within the short term, it would provoke a lot of anti-American attacks and in the longer term, it would really--I mean, he's already a pretty large figure.",
        "I think it would pump him up even more.",
        "If you think about Sayyid Qutb, who is really the ideological godfather of this movement who was executed in 1966, it was his, quote, unquote, \"\"martyrdom\"\" that really turned him in--as much as his writings, that turned him into a very significant figure.",
        "And bin Laden is a much more well-known person than Sayyid Qutb, and I think in death, he would take on even greater presence than in life.",
        "And that's not just my opinion; it's the opinion of a number of people who know him and that I interviewed in the book.",
        "Well, I mean, he's got a lot of statements.",
        "I mean, we've got, you know--by the way, there have been 18 videotapes and audiotapes from bin Laden since 9/11.",
        "And one of the questions you asked--I think it was implicit--was, `Well, why is he even important now?",
        "And my argument would be, `Look, these videotapes and audiotapes which have been released--you know, 18 of them since 9/11--have, you know, broad, pump-up-the-base kind of messages--kill Westerners, kill Jews'--and they also sometimes have specific instructions.",
