        "And then recorded the directions that they moved in response to those magnetic fields.",

        "If eels really do navigate this way, says Naisbett-Jones, then they'd join sea turtles, salmon and homing pigeons on a growing list of animals that can navigate using the planet's magnetism.",
        "The next research question, he says, is how about a decade after that first journey adult eels find their way all the way back to that same spot in the ocean to begin the cycle again.",
