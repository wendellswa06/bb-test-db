        "Every citizen gets a guaranteed government job if they want.",
        "And it's in Kuwait where you have thousands of people now for the last three months, four months, have been out in the street demonstrating.",
        "Again, they're not calling for the overthrow of the regime, but they're publicly calling out the emir's name, saying we will not let you run an autocratic system and abuse power.",
        "They want more representation, the more equitable representation of parliament, less corruption and more citizen involvement or engagement in public life.",
        "They haven't articulated their demands very clearly, but these are - this is what they're talking about.",
        "They just want to feel that they're not, they're not simply living in a shopping mall where they can go and buy six cell phones and have no other rights.",
        "They have rights more than material rights, that's what they're saying.",
        "So Kuwait is fascinating because it's wealthy, the government gives them everything, and they're still out there demonstrating for political change.",
        "And I think these sentiments run throughout the whole region, including Saudi Arabia and other places, to some extent.",
        "None of them are revolutionary in the monarchies, but none of the citizens of these countries either will accept total and permanent acquiescence in the existing power structure.",
        "I know you're on your way from here back to the airport and back home, and I don't mean to send you there early, but a report today from the Bulgarian investigation into that terrible bombing, and, well, clearly that's going to be a development that's going to be - we're going to keep an eye on.",

        "What mainly happened was I had grown up just listening to my mom and what she had told me and just assumed that was the case - that I wasn't vaccinated because vaccines are bad, and they cause all these bad effects.",
        "And - but as I grew up and spoke to friends and saw how online, there was a large debate and heated argument between both sides of this issue, I saw that this was not as much of a black-and-white universal truth.",
        "And when I started to look into it myself, it became very apparent there was a lot more evidence, you know, in defense of vaccinations - in their favor.",
        "Was there a moment when you said to your mother and/or father, look; it's not safe not to get vaccinations?",
        "For sure.",
        "I remember I approached my mom with an article by the CDC and asked why, according to the CDC, vaccines don't cause autism and why mercury is not this extremely dangerous substance and poison found in vaccines that, you know, some people like herself would claim.",
        "And her response was simply, that's what they want you to think.",
        "And I was just blown away that, you know, the largest health organization in the entire world would be written off with a conspiracy theory-like statement like that.",
        "And so moments like that I can recall back to, where I just thought, like, the concern with the evidence is not here.",
        "When did you get vaccinated?",
        "When did you start?",
        "I had two vaccines when I was 2 years old.",
        "My mom claims that one of those did not happen, or it happened against her will, and the only vaccine I should have gotten was a tetanus shot when I was 2.",
        "And that was it.",
        "Alongside that, I've never got any other vaccines - hepatitis, polio - anything.",
        "And the vaccines I did get were hepatitis A, hepatitis B and a few other vaccines, including a tetanus shot.",
        "And I have more this month.",
        "How are things at home?",
        "Strange.",
        "When I got my vaccinations, my mom had always known I disagreed with her and figured that that was going to pass, but it didn't.",
        "And once I actually had finally went out and got vaccinations, it caused some stress in the house where she looked at it as me getting vaccines for a gesture of rebellion and not for my own sake and for the sake of people around me."

        "But just a few minutes ago, the smoke stopped coming out of the building.",
        "Once again, this is a 50 storey residential building right on the East River, 72nd and York, a very expensive apartment building here, and this impact from a fixed-wing aircraft was around the 40th floor, counting up.",
        "Well, just a few moments ago, the smoke stopped from there.",

        "I talked to people who actually were here for the crash and say that, you know, it was a huge fireball that came out of it, and of course, they had this sort of sickening feeling that this should happen again in New York City.",
        "Obviously, memories are stirred by that.",
        "As of yet, no indication from the U.S.",
        "government or from officials in New York City that any element of terrorism was involved.",
        "No, and you know, in fact, although there's a massive, massive police presence here, which you would see in a terrorism event, and in fact the police would be in charge in many terrorism events, it still looks like this is the Fire Department's show, meaning that they haven't sort of evacuated the greater area in the kind of thing you might see in a terrorism event.",
        "Of course, we do now know, but so far this looks like it's a Fire Department and a fire issue.",
        "I'm standing here by the bank of ambulances and I haven't seen anyone taken out of the building sick - I'm sorry, injured or dead, and I haven't seen any ambulance gone away yet, but it doesn't mean that there aren't still casualties up there."
