        "So, in a sense, is this being a referendum on the French government?",
        "Well, the `yes' campaigners very much say that the two issues have been mixed up, that the constitutional treaty referendum should be solely a question on Europe's future.",
        "Is Europe better governed by the existing treaties, or would it be better run by the constitutional treaty that will come into force if all 25 members ratify it?",
        "But it has got mixed up with the general discontent with the French government, and the economic situation in particular, with unemployment running now at 10.2 percent.",
        "There's slow economic growth in the euro zone in general, and a sense that the world is passing France by, that the center of gravity in the world is moving to Asia's economies, and that France is struggling to redefine its role in Europe and the world.",
        "As you mentioned, if this constitution is to take effect, it must be ratified by all 25 members of the European Union, of which France clearly is a very major country.",
        "What happens if the French vote no?",
        "That's a very good question.",
        "For the moment, the leaders of the European Union are saying that they will have to continue with the ratification process, and that, so far, I think it's nine countries...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...have ratified the constitution, either by parliamentary vote or by referendum; that the remaining countries should continue to do so, but at the end of that process the leaders would have to sit down and think about how to implement this constitution, if it was implementable.",
        "That would either be--the French would be asked to vote a second time in the hope of getting a right answer, as it were, or that they would have to modify the treaty and come up with a plan B.",
        "And, again, if they modify the treaty, all 25 countries would presumably have to ratify again.",
        "Exactly, and that would be an extremely cumbersome procedure because it would mean that countries that have already ratified it would have to re-ratify it.",
        "And it's also very difficult to see that you could get a treaty that was acceptable to all the countries.",
        "If the French think that this treaty, as it is, is too liberal in an economic sense and that the British and the Anglo-Saxons, as they're called here, are too dominant an influence over the--which they've had over the constitutional treaty.",
        "But yet the debate in Britain is that the constitution is too French, it's too socialist, it's too centrally dominated, it's too statist.",
        "So I think the constitutional treaty, as it exists, is probably about the highest common denominator that you could get amongst all the European countries, and it's difficult to imagine that it could be rewritten to come up with a better version that would be acceptable to everyone.",
        "Well, if the constitutional process stumbles, if the French vote no on Sunday and there are major hurdles elsewhere, including in Britain, where there's--I guess Tony Blair has vowed to have a referendum--What?--later this year, maybe next year?--but how important is this constitution to the process of the formation of the EU and the development of the EU?",
        "Well, I don't think there would be any great crisis or crashing ideas if the constitutional treaty was voted down.",
        "Europe is operating as it is, at the moment, on the existing treaties, and could continue to do so for a while.",
        "And it is possible that those treaties could, in themselves, be modified by parliamentary votes in the countries and that the EU would continue to function.",
        "But the great hope of the constitutional treaty was that it would enable Europe to operate a lot more effectively, that it would create the post of a more permanent EU president, for example, who would serve for two and a half years and would be a better representative of the European Union; similarly, the creation of a foreign minister, and greater harmonization and integration in some other economic areas, and that the EU would work less well in the future, especially given that it has now gone from 15 to 25 members last year and could expand further with the addition of other members next year."

        "Well, it all begins, Ira, before January 1st, by making realistic, attainable goals.",

        "But 40 to 46 percent is pretty impressive.",
        "Particularly when you compare it to the people who don't try and therefore have, in our research, 0 to 4 percent chance.",
        "Do people start fast and then just peter out?",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "When you look at what we call the survival curves, about 75 percent of resolvers will be successful for one week, and then that just gradually drops down to about the 40 to 46 percent at six months.",
        "Interesting note from your papers: You report that the success rate of resolutions is 10 times higher than the success rate of adults desiring to change behavior but not making a resolution to do it.",
        "That was our last study, that's exactly right.",
        "You know, I was tired of people saying resolutions never succeed, we shouldn't even try them.",
        "And I said, well, wait a minute, these are life-sustaining behaviors.",
        "What's the alternative?",
        "So, the alternative was to track people starting before January 1st with the same behavioral goals, with the same motivation to stop or to take the resolutions but who just weren't going to do anything then.",
        "And that's - and only 4 percent of them were successful at six months.",
        "So you go from 4 percent, all the way up to 44, 46 percent by taking a New Year's resolution seriously and trying to do something about it.",
        "So it almost seems like the people who make the resolution are more serious about completing it than the people who just say I'll do it."
