        "But they discovered that a slip, a momentary lapse in a resolution, need not be a fall.",
        "They picked themselves up and they recommitted themselves to the resolution after a slip.",
        "For example, 71 percent of our successful resolvers said their first slip had actually strengthened their efforts.",
        "But they know a slip didn't need to become a fall or, as we say it in the scientific research, a lapse didn't need to become a relapse.",
        "And the successful resolvers slipped just as much in early January as the unsuccessful resolvers.",
