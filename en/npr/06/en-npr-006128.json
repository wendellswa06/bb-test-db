        "So many people are told, you know, be successful, but very few people give you the how to's.",
        "So, unless someone takes the time to mentor you and give you the simple strategies, and they are very simple.",

        "Timing is important.",
        "You have to have a strategy for your life, a plan for your life.",
        "It doesn't just happen, but if you put these steps in the order that works for you, then life can be meaningful and wonderful.",

        "You know, I don't care how dull it's been, but when I walk into the room, the atmosphere is going to change because I bring in me a spirit of joy, of thankfulness, and intention about being nice.",
        "You know, Suzan, at the end of the book, you write that there are many other ups that people can use which aren't fully addressed in the main body of the book.",
