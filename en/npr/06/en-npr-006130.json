        "There was a very small portion of it.",

        "I mean, in no small part because during the conflict, a lot of those sex crimes that we're talking about were homophobic.",
        "I mean, the brunt of the war was definitely on not just women and children, but if you were, you know, a member of the LGBT community, you were in serious trouble.",
        "There was also a really important clause about women, about advancing the justice of women who had been victims of war crimes and also returning women's land rights, you know, giving land to women who had been destituted.",
        "Could you talk more about how women were targeted during the war and how LGBT people were targeted during the war?",
        "Yes.",

        "And in that article, I used the term white supremacist terrorism.",
        "And I said, why will Donald Trump not use the term white supremacist terrorism?",
        "Because this is three months before Charlottesville.",

        "OK.",
        "But I'm just curious about why, if you feel that these people are promoting and fomenting violence, why isn't this a criminal matter as opposed to a civil matter?",
        "I mean, a civil matter is between two private parties, and the only consequence could be money, right?",
        "That's the only way it can be a remedy.",
        "But if you feel that this group is actually encouraging violence, why isn't this a criminal complaint?",
        "It would be a harder case to prove from a criminal point of view because the direct - just as a lawyer, I can say, I mean, speech is protected and has more protections in the criminal setting.",

        "I mean, was at least that moment in court when the judge ruled in your favor, like, how did that feel?",
        "No, that felt great.",
        "Did it make up?",
        "I can't go back to my life pre-June 1, 2017, where I'm getting smeared.",
        "And as a Muslim, being attacked with the worst anti-Muslim trope you can say is that I'm a Muslim and I'm a terrorist.",
        "So it was very painful.",
        "It was painful to have friends and family express concerns.",
