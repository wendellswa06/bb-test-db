        "It's the latest in a string of fires that have plagued California as it battles a five-year drought.",
        "Firefighters there say there used to be a fire season in the state, but now they have to be on alert all year round.",

        "Well, even though Northern California did have some precipitation this winter, five years of drought, the fuel moistures are no longer there, meaning that there's no moisture in the actual vegetation.",
        "And when we get these fires now, we are seeing what we call now explosive fire growth.",
        "And now the explosive fire growth statewide is unfortunately the new normal.",
        "We're seeing fire conditions that are unprecedented.",
        "In my 22 years, I haven't seen fire move like I have this year.",

        "But I think for your listeners to know that in the state of California there's always going to be funding and there will always be firefighting equipment there if we do have a large fire.",

        "The East has different water rights, legally, and Gil could probably speak to that.",
        "But basically, the thing that causes communities to fight over water is that they are not managed based on their watersheds.",
        "They are actually managed based on their municipal boundaries.",
        "And so, unfortunately, what that does is, when you see growth, and when you see urban sprawl, in some cases, you cause a strain on that finite water source.",
        "Gil, what do you think about the politicization, or I guess, the \"\"turf war\"\" over water?",
        "Well, these wars have been going on here in the Southeast now for 18 years.",
        "We have been fighting with Alabama and Florida over the Chattahoochee River and some of the other river basins in this area.",
        "And again, as Darryl said, water doesn't follow political boundaries.",
        "It follows natural basins, and when you have a city that is the size of Atlanta that straddles five different river basins and you have all this political lines in play, then it makes it very difficult to manage the water in a sustainable way.",
        "What are we actually talking about?",
        "If you have - for example, getting down to a three-month reserve sounds pretty tough.",

        "No.",
        "At the local level, Atlantans were very pro-active and, it was significant water savings and water conservations.",
        "I think that's the problem with addressing some of the recent legislation is that, you know, once the residents stepped up, and met the need and met the Governor's call for a closer to a ten-percent reduction, some feel as though they were penalized in that revenue, that hoped to come from business as usual was not there, and so now we are looking at infrastructure costs, and how can we pay for them?"

        "Are these municipalities, including Atlanta, really trapped, in terms of making improvements in infrastructure?",
        "Well, one of the big losses of water that we see throughout the Southeast, and certainly here in Atlanta, is water that is lost out of these aging infrastructures systems.",
        "You have leaky pipes and aging treatment facilities, and it does require a conscious allocation of money to fix those, and you have utilities that rely on water-rate charges coming in to help offset that cost.",
        "And so there is an effect that these utilities can feel.",
        "But it is a preventable problem, if you have state level policies, and the willingness from leadership to reallocate funding and restructure pricing, so that you can continue to conserve and still fix you infrastructure.",
        "It is - it can be a win-win situation, but unfortunately, a lot of the cities just aren't set up that way.",
        "Darryl, when people used the term \"\"Hotlanta,\"\" they are referring to culture, but it also gets very steamy here in the summer.",
        "Yes.",
        "And if you are in places like Baltimore, my hometown, or you know, in the Bronx, you see people flipping open the hydrants and all the kids having fun, but that is an incredibly inefficient way to use water.",
        "When you talked about urban communities in particular, are there attempts to do some outreach that really speak to folks in urban communities?",
        "Definitely, as you pointed out, in most servicing centers, providing water is actually a public-health concern.",
        "You know, you are actually trying to take care of the fact that water or the lack thereof, access to water, provides a pathway to all kind of problems.",
        "And so, you know, definitely municipalities is going to want to have some access to water.",
        "So the governor, kind of, in that same thing, is going to allow for public pools to be filled and that kind of thing.",

        "There are a lot of things that we can do in our homes that will affect protecting our creeks, and streams, and eventually our river.",

        "Tell us about this strife between those states specifically, and how Georgia is trying to fix that issue.",
        "Well, it's - the fight has arisen over the management of several large reservoirs in Georgia, both Lake Lanier on the Chattahoochee and Lake Allatoona on the Coosa System.",
        "And Alabama and Florida are downstream states and they expect a certain amount of water to come down to sustain their ecology, and their businesses, and their public health."

        "And you know, the legislature says uh-oh, you know, we haven't done anything.",

        "It is a lot of southern Georgia, cities like Columbus, and going all the way down to Bainbridge in south Georgia, and also a lot of farm communities.",
        "And agriculture does account for a lot of water use, particularly in south Georgia, and they've had problems in the past with using too much of a finite resource and drawing down aquifers.",
        "They are making improvements, but there really is not a whole lot on the books in terms of kind of mandating a progress towards conservation in the agricultural community, and that is something we are concern about in addition to the municipal and industrial water use.",

        "And so when you look at it in terms of, you know, despite creating distribution, so that costs don't rise, that people will have access to good, clean, quality water, if we do a few simple, basic things to protect it.",

        "It is something that our government is charged with managing, so that we all have enough water to use, and that it is affordable, and plentiful.",
