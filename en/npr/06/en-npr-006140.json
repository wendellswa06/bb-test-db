        "And once they get doing something outdoors and learn they can get through the woods or down to the river, it just changes everything.",
        "But I also hunt, and I just go out and cover pretty much wherever I need to go, and when I have to, I just hop through the brush.",
        "Having lost both legs above the knee, I just kind of get down and swing through on all fours.",
        "Sometimes I wear pads on the end of my extremities to make it a little easier, in case I would step on a broken bottle or a sharp rock or something like that.",
