        "You know, it's never going to be Silicon Valley or anything like that, but it's a city that's going to have a thriving entrepreneurial community.",
        "I like to say we're kind of accidental entrepreneurs.",
        "It really came out of necessity for us, because when we first moved here, the job market was just really limited, and we didn't find a lot of opportunities.",
        "So we started them ourselves.",
        "Launch Pad co-founder Chris Schultz says there was always a baseline of this kind of talent here, but that they weren't always connected to the business community.",

        "That was washed away.",
        "The community has become so much more open and welcoming and embracing of new talent, new ideas.",

        "But is that because there aren't other jobs to get?",
        "I mean, are people basically creating their own work?",
        "Well, I think that, you know, there's evidence that in any recession, which of course we're experiencing, as is the whole country, that starting up businesses does increase.",

        "Well, it was incredibly useful for us that we had so much federal money coming to help in the rebuilding post-Katrina when the recession hit.",
        "Was it a total buffer or...",
        "It was a very strong buffer.",
        "But to give a sense, you know, we were increasing our jobs, essentially recovering our jobs, post-Katrina, and then the recession hit.",
        "And whereas the country lost 4.5 percent of all jobs, we lost just 1 percent of jobs.",
        "Wow.",
        "So that indicated the federal stimulus that we got post-Katrina, which actually was much, much larger than what the state got for the regular economic stimulus package, really, you know, continued to create jobs in construction and infrastructure building and design, et cetera, that buoyed our economy while the rest of the country was really floundering.",
        "I want to juxtapose this with poverty rates here in New Orleans and the fact that one thing your report seemed to indicate is that the income gap is larger.",
        "So how do we reconcile this sort of growth in other areas and then faltering in some other aspects?"

        "Right.",
        "New Orleans has, you know, a very high poverty rate, about 23 percent now, which actually is lower than before the storm, when it was 28 percent.",
        "And we assume that largely, that's attributable to the fact that people with fewer resources had a much harder time returning because a lot of the public housing hasn't been rebuilt yet and because it took resources to return.",
        "So we saw some real significant demographic shifts.",
        "And then, historically, we, as the whole country, have always had really large disparities in income by race and ethnicity, and, you know, that continues to be the case.",
        "And paint a picture for me.",
        "What does that mean?",
        "African-American households in the New Orleans area make $32,000, which is about 45 percent less than what white households make, and it's actually lower than what African-American households make across the U.S.",
        "That wealth gap persists in the business community as well, according to Todd Higgins.",
        "It's a false positive on many magazine articles that they're written about the entrepreneur explosion here because I guarantee the people that they talked to are people who came from somewhere else.",
        "Higgins works as a counselor for small businesses out of the Office of Community and Workforce Development at the Urban League of Greater New Orleans.",
        "When you ask a local from the area, how do you feel about it?",
        "They'll tell you they don't get the support.",
        "They don't get the help.",
        "So it's almost like I'll bring somebody in from elsewhere and give them all the resources they need, but my own people, I'll let them suffer a little longer.",
        "Women and minority-owned businesses are still struggling in New Orleans, especially the ones based in neighborhoods where the storm hit hardest.",
