        "And I'm curious, what does that mean for you?",
        "Well, it means that I have a really big responsibility to undertake in the fall, in terms of just trying to be the biggest promoter of poetry; someone who's really got to do the work of bringing poetry to the widest audience possible.",
        "What do you think poetry can do for people?",
        "I mean, do you think that people live with poetry on a day-to-day basis?",
        "Well, I think that lots of people do live with poetry on a day-to-day basis.",
        "I believe that we were reminded of that with former poet laureate Robert Pinsky's wonderful Favorite Poem Project, in which people all around the country recorded their favorite poems.",
        "And what it suggested was that there were people who still remembered poems, who still carried poems around with them and would recite them throughout the day.",
        "I certainly know that I do that.",
        "I think we also live with poetry because poetry is one of those things that people turn to when they need a way to speak the unspeakable, or what seems to be the unspeakable.",
        "And that's because poetry not only can celebrate our joys with us, but it can also mourn with us our losses.",
        "You chose to read the poem \"\"Elegy\"\" today for us, which listeners can hear on npr.org.",
        "And you chose it because you think that it's particularly appealing to a wide range of people.",
        "How so?",
        "Well, I think people like fishing in poems.",
        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "But beyond that, you know, it's a poem that I think deals with not only something that is personal and perhaps universal to all of us.",
        "And that is a relationship with a parent and the way that those relationships are constantly changing over the years.",
        "And that we are constantly sort of remaking our memory of the past and looking back at certain points of it, to make sense of where we are right now.",
        "I think that's the thing that we all do.",
        "We mentioned a lot of modifiers in our introduction to you.",

        "Well, I think it suggests the great diversity of American poetry.",

        "(LAUGHTER)",
        "...of diversity that we might not always see.",

        "Up next, if you look at all the sources of greenhouse gases out there, from cars to power plants to factories, probably one that does not immediately come to mind is concrete - concrete, yeah, you know, the stuff that they make cement out of.",
        "It's always been assumed that the cement used to make concrete could contribute as much as five percent of the global carbon footprint once the energy to make it and the carbon dioxide emitted as it is kilned are taken into account.",
        "We've always heard about - it takes - a lot of CO2 is emitted when they make concrete and the cement inside of it.",
        "But new research published in the Journal of Environmental Engineering indicates that concrete may actually act as a carbon sink, as well.",
        "That means the carbon gets absorbed into the concrete as it's sitting out there, out in the open once it's made, and the material can actually absorb carbon dioxide and lock it away inside the porous structure that we know that concrete has.",
        "And while it's not enough to cancel out the environmental cost of concrete production, that absorption does shift the balance somewhat, and joining me now to talk about this is one of the authors of the report.",

        "What happened with the thinking?",
        "Well, actually they've known for a long time that concrete absorbs carbon dioxide.",
        "It's a process they usually refer to as carbonation because when they make cement, they use limestone, and CO2 is released.",
        "But later on as you make concrete and add water and add the rocks and have the concrete, the CO2 in the air wants to go back in, and Mother Nature wants to form back the stable product, which is limestone again.",
        "So they've known for a long time that this is happening, but it doesn't usually get well into interior structure of, let's say, a concrete building or things like that.",
        "However, they've always looked at it just in case it changes the chemistry to affect the structure.",
        "Right.",

        "Along with the name of his youth, it's something Jamal says he doesn't want to be asked about, talk about, any of it.",
        "Though, by other reckonings he was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on July 2, 1930.",
        "He will talk about being 3 years old and sitting at a piano for the first time.",

        "My mother's piano - I walked by it and my Uncle Lawrence said can you do that, what I'm doing?",
        "And my uncle was quite surprised that I played everything he played, and the rest is history."
