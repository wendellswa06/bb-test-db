        "And then we flew out of Athens a couple weeks later.",
        "And I believe they're flagging people who are flying in and out of Turkey - Americans, in particular - because it's the main transit point for potential jihadists going to Syria.",
        "And so a one-way ticket is a little bit fishy-looking.",
        "Apparently that raised some alarm.",
        "And several of the TSA officers that I've spoken to since then said, yeah, that would do it.",

        "You know, it was funny.",
        "There was a gentleman who works for TSA - was not, unfortunately for me, the supervisor - who came over and said, hey, you know, I enjoy watching you on Fox News, and, nice to have you come through the airport.",
        "And I said, well, do you believe that I'm on this list.",
        "And he kind of shook his head and - nothing much I could do for you.",
        "Sorry.",
        "Have you been able to get an official response about why you're on the list?",
        "I haven't gotten an official response.",
        "In fact, I was just able - three or four days after I initially tried to get a redress number, which is something you can do through the Department of Homeland Security - I finally just got one, so I'm working on getting an official response.",
        "And of course, I'd like to know how I got on the list and importantly, how the heck I get off the list.",
        "You know, talking to people who have been through this process, it can take weeks, months or, in some cases, even years to actually be taken off the list.",
        "Needless to say, I'm hoping mine will be faster than that.",
        "Stephen, has this experience changed how you feel about the TSA and homeland security?"

        "And I think that is, in some ways, what we're seeing.",

        "Joe Averett lives in the middle of one of them, the Haynesville Shale in northern Louisiana.",
        "The oil and gas industry veteran says drilling continues there because many of the three year leases will expire soon if the producers don't drill.",
        "They're still drilling wells just to hold the lease, and them having to do that, that's continued the excess production.",
        "Averett says it's not unusual for gas production to outstrip demand at this time of the year, as stocks begin to be built for the next winter.",
