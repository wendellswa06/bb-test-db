        "And so what kind of things could you do?",
        "Well, some of it has to do with some products that we're looking into that have a lot of surface area.",

        "Well, think of all the surface area there.",

        "That I believe is - no, I think it's about a ton per ton, and the reason why it's emitted is for two reasons.",
        "One of it has to do with the fact that you're using energy when you make cement and the transportation and everything else.",

        "That's one of the first things that I hope to be looking at next year.",
        "How much is it initially when you do it?",
        "And then the other things I really like to study right now are the recycled uses of it.",
