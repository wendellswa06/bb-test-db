        "To follow the game's rules while also keeping track of all the updates, I have to hold a lot of things in my head at once.",
        "The number of things you can keep track of at any one time is shaped by something called your working memory.",
        "Scheldrup says having a good working memory is key to bouncing back from an interruption.",
        "People who are generally good at that have less of a negative effect of interruptions.",
        "And people who are not so good at it seem to be affected more.",
        "Scheldrup and her colleagues wanted to know how people could boost their working memory capacity.",
        "They decided to try some brain stimulation - specifically, run a little electrical current through the part of the brain that handles working memory, the prefrontal cortex.",
        "Very simplistically, it's like a 9-volt battery that we have electrodes attached to, and depending on where you put the electrodes on the brain, you can either make it more difficult for neurons to fire or make it more easy for them to fire.",
        "Scientists have inserted electrodes in people's brains for decades.",
        "These devices can help patients with serious disorders like Parkinson's disease.",
        "What Scheldrup's lab does and what I've signed up for is much less invasive - electrodes attached to the side of my head.",

        "Maybe I just got better with practice.",
        "But when she analyzes the results from many volunteers in her study and controls for the effects of practice, she finds the electrodes do help.",
        "Now, Scheldrup admits that running electricity through your head isn't the most practical, everyday solution to interruptions, but...",
        "It informs other techniques.",
        "So if we know that modulating working memory performance or working memory ability affects these things, then we can say, what techniques can maybe supplement your working memory?",
        "For instance, if we know that boosting working memory makes us better at handling distractions, scientists can then try to figure out what new techniques might improve working memory.",
        "A few miles from this lab, Georgetown University professor Cal Newport thinks we need fewer technological solutions to the problem of distractibility.",

        "Newport's come up with a name for this practice of thinking deeply without distraction - deep work.",
        "The opposite of deep work is, no surprise, shallow work - sending emails, answering calls - the kind of tasks that often dominate office jobs.",
        "Newport says the problem is worse than we admit.",
        "Even when people think that they're single-tasking, what they're still doing is every five or 10 minutes a just-check.",
        "Let me just do a just-check to my inbox.",
        "But even those very brief checks that switch your context even briefly can have this massive negative impact on your cognitive performance.",
        "In his book, \"\"Deep Work: Rules For Focused Success In A Distracted World,\"\" Newport describes his work habits.",
        "I work during very set hours during the day, and I plan out the day like a chess player moving the pieces around.",

        "I'm not someone that you can expect a quick answer from, and that also causes some trouble, of course.",
        "But all of this adds up to allowing me to regularly have long portions of many of my days focused on deeper thinking.",
        "No social media, limited email, strict limits on appointments - if all this structure and planning sounds like a way to turn yourself into an automaton, Newport turns this thinking on its head.",
        "And he says the U.S.",
        "can't succeed in fighting terrorism as long as Somalia has no central government and continued chaos.",
        "So to have a structured day, for example, to protect your mind from distraction, I actually think makes you more human and less robotic than what most people do, which is to sit there like a human network router and just sort of process messages and tasks all day like a blind computer processor.",
        "So there you have the options - retreat to a quiet cabin in the woods or get your head zapped with electricity.",
        "Personally, I'd prefer the cabin, but I don't have one."
