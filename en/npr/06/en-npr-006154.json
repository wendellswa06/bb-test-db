        "So where's the paradox?",
        "Well, you talk to people and they generally express admiration for her, but then come the yes, but factor.",
        "A Washington Post ABC poll indicates that as of now, about 6 in 10 Americans would consider supporting her for president and 4 in 10 have ruled her out.",
        "Does that make her the Democratic frontrunner?",

        "O'HARA: Because of the Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops assisting in a disaster leave law enforcement to the National Guard troops who serve under state authority.",

        "Paul McHale says limiting the role of federal troops does not allow for a satisfactory response in a major catastrophe.",

        "As the economy began to recover, we began to see men outpacing women in terms of the job gain.",

        "Part of it is what we call - sociologist call the gendering, right, of occupations.",

        "Two-thirds of women today are either the primary or co-breadwinner of their families.",
