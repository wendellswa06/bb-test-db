        "So this is basically a high-powered radio wave?",

        "(Laughter) Yeah, a useful preface, OK.",
        "But I think that the strongest argument they'll make to voters is that listen; we tried to prevent you - present you with a government that was functioning for American citizens, that had defense spending for American citizens, that had a new - this health care program for American citizens, and Democrats want to block it on behalf of illegal immigrants.",

        "Us or them - all right, Matthew, let me let you come back to that.",
        "We just heard there the Republican argument which David doesn't actually agree with but he's laid out neatly for us.",
        "They're arguing that this is Democrats shutting down the government to help illegal immigrants.",
        "How are Democrats not completely to blame if the government shuts down tonight?",

        "I'm struck by one point in all of this on which there appears to be a 100 percent agreement.",
        "Republicans, Democrats, the president - everybody seems to think this is a lousy way to run a government, a lousy way to run a budget.",

        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, it's hard to get here.",
        "And so there's a great deal of upset about these 30-day extensions and all the gimmickry.",
        "I think that's genuinely true on both sides.",
        "I think that - and there's - the other thing that's surreptitiously true on both sides is neither can quite figure out who's going to lose here.",
        "I think that I hear a lot of uncertainty about that.",
        "My own view is that the short term, the Republicans probably lose because they are - do control the government.",
        "The medium term, the Democrats probably lose because this is really about people in red states where the Democrats hope to defend or pick up some Senate seats.",
        "And it'll probably play pretty well for Republicans in the medium term.",
        "In the long term, of course it's ruinous for Republicans because they have really, as Matthew says - Mitch McConnell has labeled the whole party - not just part of the party, the whole party - as the anti-immigrant party.",
        "And that of course is ruinous in a country that's growing increasingly diverse.",
        "Matthew, if we were - God forbid - to put politics to the side for a moment and just discuss the substance of what is on the table - I mean, on immigration and DACA and CHIP, the insurance program for children, how far apart are all of the involved parties on the actual substance of trying - what they're trying to get done here?",
        "Well, I mean, that's part of what's interesting here.",
        "I mean, there is a bipartisan agreement with some Republican support that is I think quite generous to the DACA recipients but then in exchange make some real serious investments in border security.",
        "But then you've had Tom Cotton and some factions of the White House..."

        "So we've seen this shift further over the restrictionist side in a relatively quick period of time, and I think we're all trying to catch up to it.",
        "And in that way, this shutdown really is about something real.",
        "It's about the basic demographic shift in the country and how the two parties are reacting to it.",
