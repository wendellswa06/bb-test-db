        "Thirty-three-year-old Ashraf Abu Khurj lives in that camp, which he describes as a very small place - one kilometer square - and crowded with Palestinian residents who are desperate.",
        "There is more than 40,000 people inside this camp, and most of the people, they are children, old people.",
        "To tell you now, our camp, our children need help.",

        "There's a lot of people died, and there is no hospital inside this camp.",
        "Mr.",
        "Abu Khurj told us that the group the Lebanese Army is fighting, Fatah al-Islam, consists, he said, of many foreigners - men from other Arab countries who have taken up inside the camp.",
        "Louise Roug of the Los Angeles Times is in Beirut but was up at the camp and in Tripoli yesterday.",
        "And first of all, can you tell us whether the Lebanese Army is out to completely wipe out this group, Fatah al-Islam?",
        "Well, this is certainly a really heavy response by the army.",
        "What we saw yesterday was a heavy barrage of tank ammunitions and other types of shelling against the camp.",
        "We sustained fighting for all day yesterday and most of the day today.",
        "Were people in Lebanon well aware of Fatah al-Islam and its operations until recently?",
        "Well, it's a relatively new group.",
        "They first announced their existence in November.",
        "They then took responsibility or admitted to carrying out a bombing in February that killed three people in a Chrisian area in the mountains.",
        "And it's well known that they've had this paramilitary base within the camp.",
        "Now, their relationship to the Palestinians in the camp - do we know whether Fatah al-Islam enjoys any significant support from them, or are they merely innocent bystanders to all this?"

        "That's the arrangement.",
        "They defer to the Palestinians.",
        "Are there armed authorities inside the camp, are armed Palestinian groups that are at least responsible for order inside the camps?",
        "Well, there are about 14 different camps in Lebanon, and the security internally within these camps differ.",
        "So in this camp, apparently, security has been more lax, which is one of the reasons why Fatah al-Islam had been able to grow within the camp.",
        "In other camps, you know, there's stricter security, and such groups haven't been able to fester.",
        "Do you have any sense of whether Fatah al-Islam operating inside the camp has weaponry at all comparable to the kind of artillery that the Lebanese Army is using against them?",
        "Well, certainly, when we were there yesterday, mortars were flying above our heads, and so they were responding with force.",
        "You know, separate but related fights in Tripoli - about 10 men were barricaded inside an apartment and also had very, very heavy weaponry fighting back against the soldiers with grenades and heavy machine gunfire.",
        "Do the Lebanese authorities say how many armed men there would be from this group inside this camp?",
        "Well, I think estimates are around a couple of a hundred, but the officials and the authorities today are adamant that they've got the situation under control, that they flushed out many of the fighters and the collaborators in Tripoli.",

        "Well, if the rate is to be variable, can you be told at closing what it's going to be?",
        "Well, the essence of a variable rate is that it's hard to predict what it's going to be.",
        "The problem is the disclosures on that are really - they don't work at all, or they work very poorly.",
        "And so most people have no idea how high their loan payment could get.",

        "If you're buying a house, you're supposed to get some sort of truth in lending disclosures shortly after you apply for the loan, within three days of application.",
        "For refinances, however, you can get your truth in lending disclosures essentially right at the closing.",
        "And so as long as you get them before you sign your loan documents, it'll be assumed that you got your disclosures and you knew what you're shopping for.",
