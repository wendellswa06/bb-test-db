        "A closing typically involves initialing about nine thousand entries on multiple copies of many, many forms.",
        "Do you think that this is a problem of those forms not stating clearly what the lending terms are, or simply of consumers not having the wherewithal or the confidence or the ability to decipher what's in the forms that they're initialing?",
        "Well, I think there are actually three things going on.",
