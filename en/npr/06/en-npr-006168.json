        "(Through translator) Well, the message is that the love for fatherland has not died; that all those who tried to prevent this funeral were wrong because this is a question of citizens simply wanted it this way, and they are now expressing how much they respected him at the time he represented them in the world.",
        "The solemn event lasted two hours, then the coffin was placed in a hearse and driven 40 miles to Pozarevac, Milosevic's hometown.",
