        "How does this latest terrible event fit in?",
        "Well, I think there have been political assassinations in Pakistan, and we've never found out why they were carried out or who did them.",

        "First of all, there's Afghan Taliban who don't attack Pakistan, then the Pakistani Taliban who are attacking Pakistan since 2007.",
        "But I think the real problem is that there is still the view that no Muslim can do this.",
        "This cannot be done by Muslims.",
        "This has to be someone else doing this.",
        "So this denial, this rejection of the fact that the enemy resides within or is a product of your policy remains a problem.",

        "But I imagine it's also been going on within the army.",
