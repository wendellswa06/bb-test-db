        "That's exactly right.",
        "So why might this be?",
        "Well, we can sort of concoct different scenarios.",
        "One is that orange tends to be a custom color, and if you order an orange car, perhaps the rest of the car was made in a custom way, a little bit more care was taken into it.",
        "We don't know why, and it's frankly, it's not that important.",
        "It might just bring us down a rabbit hole for us to try to find out why.",
        "But again, if you just want to buy a car that's not going to break down, go with the correlation.",
        "When I read this book, what I read is companies finding masses of information that was previously thought to be useless and finding new uses for it.",
        "That's right.",
        "Take search queries, for example.",
        "Google stores all of its searches.",
        "What they were able to do was go through the database of previous searches to identify what was the likely predictor that there was going to be a flu outbreak in certain regions in America.",
        "Now, keep in mind, we pay for the Center of Disease Control to look at the United States and find out where flu outbreaks are taking place for the seasonal flu.",
        "But the difference is that it takes the CDC about two weeks to report the data.",
        "Google does it in real time simply on search queries.",
        "We've reported on this in the program in the past.",
        "You're saying that certain search queries are a predictor.",
        "They correlate with the spread of the flu.",
        "And it might be something obvious like people doing searches for flu remedies or flu vaccines.",
        "But whatever it is, there are search terms that can help you predict that the flu is about to spread in a certain area.",
        "That's exactly right.",
        "Those loopers were hired by Barbara Harris, as were the ones working on \"\"Bones\"\" today.",

        "Why wouldn't it be enough to have very good microphones on a set recording the principals as well as anybody who's in the background talking?",
        "Mostly because it would be too time-consuming.",
        "When they're shooting, their primary interest is everything the principals are doing.",
        "To fill in the background sounds, Barbara looks at the movie or show, takes notes, decides how many voice actors she'll need and gives them guidance on research.",
        "Say it's a scene in a police station.",
        "If they say this takes place in Atlanta, I would then instruct the actors to get some street maps, some points of interest.",
        "So when they're talking, as you would do in a police station, you know, you'd reference there's some activity over on, you know, Main St., intersections, bridges so that it sounds as if the people who are talking go to this job every day."
