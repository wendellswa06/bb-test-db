        "No.",

        "You pick any infamous group, and the LRA is right up there, except that it's still going.",
        "And what kind of atrocities are we talking about?",
        "Anything from abducting children, raping women, murdering people, perhaps the most infamously often forcing children to shoot their relatives as part of the abduction to stigmatize them and keep them from wanting to escape because they were too ashamed to go home.",
        "All right.",
        "And those elements of the story are something that the film makes very clear.",
        "In fact, I want to play a little bit of an excerpt.",
        "The filmmaker befriended several years ago a boy, a teenage boy whose brother had been killed in this way by Kony's men.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF CRYING)",
        "And he sobbed there for 10 seconds.",
        "And it's painful.",
        "It's painful to listen to.",
        "And it certainly pushes a button, and that's what this film does is push a lot of buttons.",
        "And yet, there are questions about the portrait of the situation that the film actually paints - what the actual portrait is today.",
        "And you've written about that.",
        "So what are some of the issues that you've raised about this film?",
        "Well, the biggest issue that I've raised or perhaps the easiest to understand to begin with is that the Lord's Resistance Army, led by Joseph Kony, was actually forced out of Uganda by the Ugandan military in 2006.",
        "So I came to start paying attention to this \"\"Kony 2012\"\" campaign because all of a sudden on all of the places that I monitor - things happening in Uganda - there were these hordes of people saying stop the war in northern Uganda.",
        "Let's go to northern Uganda and get rid of Kony.",
        "And there is no war in northern Uganda anymore, not since 2006.",
        "The LRA is still what I like to call a regional wrecking ball.",
        "It's still raiding and massacring and abducting in neighboring countries, but northern Uganda itself is peaceful.",
        "And only 15 minutes into this 30-minute film is it mentioned that the LRA left northern Uganda, and they don't mention the year, and it's only a few second in the 30-minute video.",
        "So it's easy to understand why people who are directed by celebrities or whatever might misunderstand this.",
        "But I think if the goal is to raise awareness and you define awareness as more than just: I know Joseph Kony's name, and I've watched this video, and I shared it on Facebook - awareness means understanding some basic facts about where the LRA is and where Kony is today.",
        "Because if you want to stop him, you have to understand that he has a tiny force scattered in a vast jungle area across three countries.",
        "And so it's not simply a matter of flicking a switch and saying, yep, we voted.",
        "Let's stop Kony now.",
        "It also says that he's - he has - over the years, that he has abducted an army of 30,000 children.",
        "And, yes, it's true that over 25 years, he's abducted 30,000 children - which is terrible - but the impression the film leaves you with, I would argue, when they show an image of 30,000 faces, it's as if there are 30,000 children in captivity now.",
        "Do you - did you read that claim the same way?",
        "Well, so again, I highlighted in my first post for Foreign Policy, a Twitter post that said Joseph Kony is Hitler and has 30,000 - an army of 30,000 mindless children, because I can see how that perception was created.",
        "I don't think that was Invisible Children's goal, I think they were trying to dramatize the size of the entirety of all these abducted children over the years.",
        "But you can see how, again, people being introduced to this for the first time might interpret it that way.",
        "And frankly, that's not bad for the - this viral and urgent nature of getting the word out there about this video.",
        "You had to go.",
        "Had to go.",
        "And that song, like a lot of your songs, is so visual.",
