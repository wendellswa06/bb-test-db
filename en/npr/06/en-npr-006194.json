        "And I'm looking out over the site, where early Monday morning, a semi-truck filled with pears flew over the guardrail of the bridge and plunged 200 feet, killing the driver immediately.",
        "The fiery accident occurred when the driver hit the S-curve, a new section of the bridge that was set up over the Labor Day weekend, as part of the project to repair and replace the bridge.",
        "And since then, there have been more than 40 accidents, although this was the first fatality.",
        "Officials say it could have been prevented.",
        "Bridgett Lott is an assistant chief with the California Highway Patrol.",
        "Preliminary information from witness statements would indicate that the driver was traveling excessive speed.",
        "That coupled with the possibility that his load shifted and weight transfer, putting that vehicle over the side.",
        "This accident follows another about two weeks ago, when a Safeway grocery big rig truck entered the S-curve too fast and flipped across four lanes, impeding traffic for many hours.",
        "The speed limit on the Bay Bridge is 50 miles per hour.",
        "But the S-curve requires drivers to slow down to 40 and many don't."

        "They used to speed relatively straight through to a tunnel on Yerba Buena Island.",
