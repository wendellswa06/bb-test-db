        "We certainly know that the Iraqis need to make progress.",
        "And I think a lot of the conversations between White House negotiators and Democrats and Republicans on the Hill are going to be designed, first, to make sure that we get money and flexibility for our forces in the field right now.",
        "So they can continue doing their job effectively.",
        "And some of these other discussions are certainly going to take place but I neither want to characterize them nor prejudge them.",
        "But is there a bright line for President Bush when it comes to attaching foreseeable consequences to Iraq's performance in meeting those benchmarks?",
        "As I said, I - you know, I warned you already I was going to frustrate you on this.",
        "One of the things that's important to realize is that you do want to have success in Iraq, and also when you're talking about what they need to do and how they need to do it you have to make sure that you're going to do it in a way that actually is going to produce constructive action as opposed to encouraging them to conclude that the United States is getting out, and as a consequence, really putting an end to effective action by the part of the United States government.",
        "When President Bush yesterday spoke of al-Qaida in Iraq as the same bunch that's causing havoc in Iraq were the ones who came and murdered our citizens.",
        "Clearly al-Qaida in Iraq is a group that is affiliated with al-Qaida.",
        "They've seemed to have gotten the franchise for operations in Iraq.",
        "But he's -let me just make this clear, he's not implying that there was a pre-9/11 link now between Iraq and al-Qaida, is he?",
        "Well, there was certainly were some al-Qaida members in Iraq before September 11th.",
        "Let me make it clearer because he said it many times as early as 2002, right after September 11th, we do not have any information about a link between Saddam Hussein and September 11th.",
        "And that is another accusation that's been placed at the doorstep of this administration that's simply false.",
        "So, there is no information about Saddam Hussein having an operational relationship with al-Qaida with respect to 9/11.",
        "But when he said, yesterday, al-Qaida has ratcheted up its campaign of high-profile attacks.",
        "Al-Qaida is the group that plotted, planned and trained killers to come and kill people in our soil.",
        "The same bunch that is causing havoc in Iraq...",
        "Yeah.",
        "...were the ones who came and murdered our citizens.",
        "So there's an attempt to...",
        "Well, he's talking about al-Qaida.",
        "You keep in mind what we are talking about here, Robert.",
        "Al-Qaida members in Iraq are not native Iraqis.",
        "They're foreign fighters who have come from abroad, who pledged fealty and then in many cases put together videos saying that in fact that this continues to be orchestrated by Ayman al-Zawahri and Osama bin Laden.",
        "So what you're looking at now is the fact that there are al-Qaida members on Iraqi soil.",
        "That does not mean that the Iraqis themselves were intimately involved in the September 11th planning, but it does mean that members of al-Qaida are now in Iraq trying to destabilize their government.",
        "And for them, this really is the central front of the war in terror.",
        "Senator Lieberman was very precise and very passionate about this in a recent op-ed piece in The Washington Post and he's been so on the floor of the Senate as well."

        "So reports have trickled out where employers are saying they just want to be sure that the person that they're going to hire is, you know, representing their organization to the best - you know, in the way that they would want, and, you know, doing a high-level check on that.",
        "So in the case - we played a cut of tape of a former Maryland corrections officer who applied to get his job back, and they asked him for his Facebook password.",
        "The explanation was they were looking to see if there were, in any of his pictures or messages on his Facebook site, evidence of gang-related, you know, that he was connected with any gangs.",
        "Yeah, that was one particular case, and there have been others, as well, where - and they typically seem - the reports that we've gotten so far is they are from, you know, government-related jobs.",
        "But even as far back as 2009, the city of Bozeman was doing similar things in asking employees to, you know, reveal their logins, and they would check for such things.",
        "And the question is, is this legitimate?",
        "The Justice Department has been asked to look into it, but I don't think either you or I know the law very well here.",
        "Yeah, that's absolutely true.",
