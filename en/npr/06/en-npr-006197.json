        "And when I talked with Facebook, they wouldn't clarify much beyond, but is, you know, the idea of ever Facebook getting involved in a legal sense.",

        "Well, they do two different things, and some folks do the reference checks internally, and some folks do reference checks externally.",
        "There are a number of firms who do this as a business, and when that happens, there is a very strict requirement that the applicant for a role give their permission to the external agent that they understand that they're going to be subject to all kinds of questioning, et cetera.",
