        "I suspect that the employees there understand that she is doing this, and she has some form of approval for that, and I think that were there is an approval, there is a very different situation than if an employer is in secret trying to gain information about an applicant or a current employee."

        "Again, yeah, I think that if the business necessity suggests that this is really a job requirement that the employees ensure that nothing in their conduct would result in their parents, customers, et cetera, being unhappy, I think that it makes sense.",

        "OK, but in that case, might this be something for the union to make clear in its contract with the employer that, no, you can't have this?",
        "I think that that would be very good because, you know, the unions are there to fight for the rights of employees that are being abused, and right now, we do have a hiring market where you can just fire somebody if they're not holding up to your expectations and expect to find someone to fill it pretty quickly.",
        "And so these job seekers are really at the mercy of their employer, and, you know, they're taking a lot of liberties right now.",
        "I'm - like I said, I'm very careful about my posts, but I also have to have a public Facebook profile because I'm also an independent author.",
        "And so I'm not going to be posting pictures of me drinking at roller-derby after-parties, but I am, you know, I might have a private-message conversation with a friend who's having marital troubles or a friend who has some kind of issue that they don't want broadcast to the world, and I think that's my right to keep that private.",

        "To my surprise, I caught several applicants in lies regarding their driving record and work history.",
        "One applicant had posted on his Twitter account that he'd run a stop sign and received a ticket with a you-know-me comment after he'd claimed a clean driving record on his cover letter.",

        "There are also any number of cases, and we've all heard about the high-profile ones, from football coaches at Notre Dame to various other places, people who fudge their qualifications on their resume.",
        "Those seem to go sometimes undetected for quite a while.",
        "Yes, that's true.",
        "Interestingly, there's an interesting legal issue about whether an individual's execution of an employment application constitutes the forever and ever ability of an employer to go back 15 years and say, oh, you lied on your employment application, that's grounds for termination.",
        "Uh-huh.",

        "Yeah, I was calling just because I think that a lot of privacy is getting invaded just even in public information.",

        "I do know that there are expungement rules with regard to many, many, many offenses in various states, and this is really a state issue.",
        "But just because there's something on a background check that's legal to show, it doesn't mean an employer could legally use that as a basis for a hiring decision.",
        "For example, if Matt were looking for a job as a - I don't know - a telecommunications operator, I'm not sure that a DWI or DUI would have any impact on that.",
