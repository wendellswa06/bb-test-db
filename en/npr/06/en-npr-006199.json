        "Exactly.",
        "But, you know, if they go - if they ask during the interview process to see my Facebook profile, you know, what do I do?",

        "But how can you prove - if they choose not to offer you the job, how can you prove that that was the reason why?",
        "That's the issue that I have.",
        "I mean, I think you're just opening a big, old can of worms when - I mean, there's nothing on there that I am ashamed to show my family because they are on my friends list.",

        "I understand.",

        "I think that's the single reference to the fact that the portrait of this mad man running around Uganda is outdated.",

        "The notion the public pressure could influence international U.S.",
        "military efforts, that most certainly would result in violence and more conflict, is troubling and dangerous, and could start us down a very slippery slope for further conflicts.",

        "Yes.",
        "I think that - well, to first just pick up on one thing that comes up often with the militarization, something that's not talked about too much is, if you want increased military pressure to go after Kony, you have to think about a lot of the potential collateral damage.",
        "In previous offensives by the Ugandan military that didn't quite catch Kony, what happens was the LRA ransacked and massacred vengefully as it fled, killing hundreds of civilians in the Congo in the winter of 2009, for example.",
        "And secondly, let's say that U.S.",
        "special forces supporting Uganda special forces cornered Kony and a bunch of the people fighting with him currently in LRA, how many of those people are abducted and brainwashed soldiers - children?",
        "Probably a lot of them.",
        "And so what if they shoot back?",
        "That's, I think, a reason you can't just say, let's just fly a drone and blow up the whole camp if we can find it.",
