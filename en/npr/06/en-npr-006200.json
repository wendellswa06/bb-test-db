        "Good.",
        "Thanks.",
        "Join the conversation.",
        "I just - I guess I watched the video and it was obviously very moving and inspiring.",
        "And with all the criticisms, the only thing that I find myself asking is, is there a better way to support the cause?",
        "Because, obviously, I think that what was really neat about it is that it's inspiring a lot of people to become involved and very quickly and especially young people.",
        "And so - and obviously, it's very easy to become overwhelmed with all of this information, and I like that people are asking deeper questions.",
        "And is there a better way that we can support the cause?",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think that's a great question.",
        "I mean, Michael and I are talking about what I would say would be journalistic, almost, problems with the film.",
        "You know, there's certainly could be an argument that it's not a bad thing to inspire people, and it's not a bad thing to make people care, and there's no question that Kony is a bad guy.",
        "And the main purpose stated in the film is to make him the most famous person on Earth.",
        "Well, he just became a great deal more famous today.",
        "But, Hailey, let me ask you, you know, we also have a situation right now in Syria, where the regime is bombarding its own people, and there's a great deal of discussion about whether or not the United States should get involved in Syria, having done so, through NATO, in Libya.",
        "And what about that?",
        "I mean, what about this challenge of one terrible situation after another, and we should do something about it?",
        "How do you - you don't have the Syria movie, but you have the Kony movie.",
        "How do we decide what moves us to action?",
        "Right.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And that's - and I mean, obviously we have a lot of - even just in our own country, there are a lot of issues that - I mean, I don't want to make this out to - not be a big deal at all, obviously, the terrible guy.",
        "And I think the video is great, but I hope - I guess I just hoped that it would inspire - and people to become aware of, you know, just more problems that are going on and just want to become more involved in general, and not...",
        "Pay attention to the news.",

        "Hi.",
        "I'm more interested, I guess, now after (technical difficulty) the website and seeing some of the comments on the website, to know about the financial aspects of \"\"Kony 2012\"\" and Invisible Children because there had been some assertions that they are not disseminating the money that they are receiving properly.",
        "So, well, I got the video, and I feel like, you know, I watched it with a discerning eye and picked up on all the things that you've already discussed.",
        "I'd like to know how the money is really being used.",
        "What about that, Michael?",
        "Well, you know, to be honest, I've been in kind of the hot seat all day as the person willing to really come out strongly against this campaign.",
        "But I think Invisible Children is getting a little bit of a tough time on this because, yes, something like 32 percent, I think, is the number of their money actually goes to projects in Uganda.",
        "And so they'd been criticized heavily over that.",
        "But I think what needs to be stated is that a lot of what their actual operations are, are doing awareness and fundraising in the United States which involved road shows, going around to show their films on university campuses and things like that.",
        "And they're really good at it.",
        "And you can see their success with the social marketing.",
        "They are really, really good at generating awareness.",
        "So if there's a criticism here, I think what it might be is that they're simply trying to do too much.",
        "And I can tell you, unfortunately, they're not that well-regarded for their on-the-ground projects by other civil society organizations that exclusively do things like education and livelihood support.",
        "So if I were to suggest anything, it might be to focus more.",
        "You know, there are other great organizations active in this area, like the Enough Project, that do solely advocacy.",
        "And so I think part of the problem is that, you know, Invisible Children was born of its founders' very first group called Invisible Children, where they accidentally found the conflict in northern Uganda and decided they want to do something about it.",
        "And so it evolves from showing their film at campuses around to raising money for scholarships, and there's a lot of other projects, you know.",
        "Right.",
        "But certainly, there's...",
        "So I don't think they're misappropriating money is the short answer.",
        "I heard(ph) an argument that they're using it well.",
        "Thanks for your call, Alison.",
        "I just want to - a little bit of time left, Joe in Lansing, Michigan.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, you know, to that last point, my only complaint I guess would be just that, is whether they realize it or not, they're targeting a much younger audience than they realized.",
        "You know, my daughter's 14 years old, and she's just enthralled with as well all of her friends.",
        "They're just all over their phones and calling each other.",
        "And so they're actually - whether they realized it or not - getting, you know, money and support from children that really don't understand that by some token this old news.",
        "But also, they really don't have an idea of the gravity of the situation itself."
