        "Well, I mean, I think that's what's really interesting about the New City School and the city public schools, is that we serve a pretty diverse population.",

        "But the remaining population is very mixed, as is the - Long Beach is one of the most diverse places in the country.",

        "You know, it's usually all - you know, our schools are very segregated, so our schools are sort of a different exception to that these days.",
        "And this was especially true with our very first young child who received a heart transplant, Lizzy, in 1984 because no one had ever transplanted a child that young before.",

        "And federal - and Fed officials said - indicated that right now, at least, they're going to keep raising them in the new year.",
