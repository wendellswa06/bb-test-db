        "People who were strongly for Giuliani, that number is now down for him.",
        "This hurts him because his campaign has to kind of survive some of these early contests and is kind of banking on the February 5th primaries.",
        "And if he's already bleeding, losses in any of those early contests will make it worse for him.",
        "The good news for Huckabee is that it's showing he basically has support outside of Iowa, and that was a crucial test for him.",
        "The numbers also a show that the support among all the candidates is still very fractured.",
