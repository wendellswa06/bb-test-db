        "Why can't you just keep her?",
        "And, you know, we're like, no, we can't.",

        "Yeah.",
        "It's really exciting.",

        "That's the way to go in California.",
        "And so, I mean, it's a lot of test scores, you know.",
        "So we're above average in English test scores but it doesn't reflect that our kids are also bilingual, which is, like, such an added benefit for the kids.",
        "And, you know, and our kids are, you know what we do with these kids is they just - there's so much reading and so many books that our kids, it's kind of like a discipline problems at schools that they won't put the books down.",
        "So, you know, we're having tremendous success with that.",

        "We have a few anchor funders that - Don and Doris Fisher Foundation, the Walton Family Foundation, the Bradley Foundation are sort of our anchor funders.",
        "And then we have several other funders coming in as well.",
        "There are a few very active national donors to the charter movement, but what's also very exciting is that there's a lot of localized funding support developing over time.",
