        "And Mary Burge, I think that word - you've used it before too - team - you're a part of one.",
        "That's one of the things that I like immensely about my job, is feeling that I'm working as part of a team with cardiologists, surgeons, physical therapists, occupational therapists, a child psychologist, child life specialists, nurses, transplant coordinators - we all have our own roles, and that's very - that's very satisfying.",
