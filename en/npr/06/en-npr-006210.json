        "I've been through the myriad of chiropractors and physical therapy and I did cortisone injections and, really, nothing has worked.",
        "And the doctor said, `Mr.",
        "Edgar, we've done everything that we can for you, so your next option is fusion.",
        "So there I was, at the age of 40, looking at getting my back fused.",
        "Spinal fusion meant a loss to his range of motion, and fusion can accelerate the deterioration of the disks just above and below where the fusion was done.",
        "That's called junctional disease, and that can lead to even more fusion; the patient becoming stiffer and stiffer with each surgery.",
        "Roger Edgar wanted no part of it, so he went to the Internet to do research and that's where he found out about Charite.",
        "Hi!",

        "Hochschuler says it was Buttner-Janz's devotion to motion and flexibility that inspired her to invent Charite.",
        "And her theory was if you replace the disk that perhaps you could still take away the pain, but allow the motion, and she was right.",
        "And she has pictures of that first patient she did, and he's still playing tennis.",
        "In Europe, thousands of patients have had this operation, but it has been Hochschuler and his partner Scott Blumenthal who have championed Charite here in the US and won FDA approval.",
        "Blumenthal has performed 250 Charite operations so far, more than anyone else in the country.",

        "I think that's enough.",
        "But here's an important point: Even in those Charite patients who have good outcomes, it is uncommon for them to have their back pain relieved completely.",
        "For most, it's like the volume has been turned down from, say, an eight to a two or a three.",
        "Still, a small percentage do walk away totally pain-free, and in the last few days before he steps to the plate, that's where Roger Edgar's thoughts are: Dreaming of a home run.",

        "Unlike a spinal fusion, where the damaged disk can be largely left in place while the bone is fused around it, putting in an insert means complete dissection and removal of the damaged disk.",
        "That's the delicate part.",
        "Two surgeons will operate on Edgar.",
        "A vascular surgeon will make the initial incision through his abdomen, gently moving his organs and blood vessels aside, carefully cutting down through Edgar to get to his back.",
