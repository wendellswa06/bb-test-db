        "And from that we learned that negative emotions before the rollercoaster are associated with breathlessness, even in patients without any airway obstruction.",
        "We also learned that positive emotions after the rollercoaster are associated with the lack of breathlessness, even in patients with a confirmed attack of airway obstructions.",
        "These findings may have dramatic implications for use of medication, because asthma patients tend to overuse medication during negative emotions but they tend to under-use medication during positive emotions.",
