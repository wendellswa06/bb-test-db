        "Yeah, I told you so.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "However, the experiments that we conducted and some field studies about 10 years ago showed that ocean currents and density differences actually cause the small droplets to leave the flume and form large, horizontal intrusions of a few hundred meters above the seafloor.",

        "Oil and water do mix?",
