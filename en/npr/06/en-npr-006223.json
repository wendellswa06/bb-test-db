        "I had just graduated from Michigan State in East Lansing and had moved to Detroit on the West Side with my husband and my two children.",
        "I had a three-year-old and a three-month-old.",
        "Of course, back in that day that was pretty unusual for a woman with kids starting med school.",
        "So, you know, I was pretty consumed with my family and starting up in school and that is right at the time that the riots took place.",
        "Now, I lived on the West Side.",
        "The riots were not immediately in my neighborhood.",
        "My next-door neighbor was a policeman, so I found out a lot about what was going on through, actually, through his wife.",
        "And on the other side of me my neighbors had attended the Detroit Tigers game that day.",
        "They were doing a double-header, which, of course, had to be called because of the violence.",
        "And then from then on there was a curfew for a very long time.",
        "You turned some of your experiences and I don't mean directly, but just sort of the general feeling into a novel that includes race, that includes violence, rape.",
        "Is that a reflection of the fear that you felt at the time?",
        "Yes.",
        "I think it is.",
        "I mean, that was such that the riots had such a profound impact on society in America, certainly, on Detroit.",
        "And then also what always haunted me was the impact on a personal level - the people, the pain, the destruction.",
        "So what I did - I wanted to really, I really wanted to expose this in a very emotional way.",
        "So I created a character, a medical student much like myself, a couple of children like myself, a white woman.",
        "And I created her family, and then also a black family and the two families became - they became very intertwined.",
        "And it was the devastation of the riots that really started this whole thing off.",
        "We don't have too much time left, but we do have enough to discuss the present.",
        "And I want to start with you, Tim.",
        "How do you think Detroit is doing?",
        "Has there been enough to recoup and do you think that this was an example of where race got in the way of a city's growth and healing?",
        "I definitely think the race was a pinnacle issue with the riots.",
        "Detroit was the fifth largest city in the country at that time and now, it's barely the 10th - between the 10th and 11th polarization.",
        "Now, this is the most polarized area in the country.",
        "Unfortunately, things are still not what they should be as far as race, education, taxes, and equal opportunity for everybody.",
        "I think that the riots left - made people leave or forced people to leave in some instances and it includes business and, you know, with a dwindling tax-based.",
        "Your city services can't do all the things it can do to make your city a pleasant place to live.",
        "And it's difficult.",
        "Patricia.",
        "Patricia, do you think race was the issue - is the issue?",
        "Well, according to the reporting at the time, this was really not a race riot per se.",
        "It was more of a rebellion of the haves and that have nots.",
        "And, of course, you were looking primarily at the black population, but in terms of eluding and the shooting and so forth, there were whites and blacks eluding and burning together.",
        "So it wasn't exclusively race but, of course, the impact on those left in the city was enormous and skewed totally toward the black population.",
        "I mean, to the point that, you know, it's almost like we have a third world country in some of the areas.",
        "And this is not just Detroit, but in a lot of the big urban cities.",
        "Tim, super, super quick.",
        "What do you hope for Detroit?",
        "Reinvestment, a new beginning, and that's what's going on right now but added more of an accelerated phase instead of a snail phase.",
        "Well, Tim and Dr. Gussin, than you so much."

        "Oliva said the change would simply ensure sheriffs were ready to provide the firearms training if, at any point, school boards decide to opt in.",
        "But when the parents first heard this, they were confused and then angry because they worried it would make it more likely that guns would end up in their kids' classrooms.",
