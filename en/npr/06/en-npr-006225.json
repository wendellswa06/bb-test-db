        "And so, if they're done well, they won't look as bad.",

        "And my son, who's now a musician - he's 19 and I'm 45 - he's a drummer and a guitar player.",
        "And he knew all along that I was very opposed to tattoos and that kind of thing.",
        "And - but now he's got a Jimi Hendrix tattoo - and let me also say that his mother is an art history major.",
        "So he's got this beautiful Jimi Hendrix tattoo on his shoulder and he's like, hey, dad, you know what, this is the music you brought me up with, and mom is the, this art stuff.",
        "So, there's a part of me that is really grieving about what he's doing with these tattoos because they're permanent and they're long-lasting.",
        "Not only that, we're Jewish.",
        "And so, I just, you know, I guess there's always this thing, you can't be buried in the cemetery with tattoos, you know?",
        "So, anyway, but there's this ongoing thing with my kids, and they even teases me about getting a Beatles tattoo on my leg because I don't like the Beatles.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "That's just to get in your head, Dave.",
        "The Jewish issue - you mentioned religion just a moment ago, Amy - that's very real for some people.",
        "It is.",
        "And in fact, my cousin, who I am mentioning, is also Jewish.",
        "And he said that when he went to Israel, the border, you know, guards, he was dealing with could not believe that he was Jewish because he did have body art.",
        "And he was - he said he was asked to recite Torah portions that he hadn't remembered since his bar mitzvah.",
