        "There's a war of ideas happening on college campuses these days.",
        "A university has an obligation to protect students from sexual assault.",
        "Professors have a right to free speech.",
        "A recent case at Northwestern University has illustrated how high the stakes are when the two ideas clash.",
        "It started when Northwestern professor Laura Kipnis published an essay in the Chronicle of Higher Education back in February.",
        "In it, she pushes back against rules at the school regulating romantic relationships between teachers and students.",
        "The response to the essay was intense.",
        "Two graduate students filed complaints against her.",
        "And the school opened a Title IX investigation.",
        "Laura Kipnis was cleared in that investigation a couple of weeks ago and spoke to us about the experience.",
        "I asked her to tell us about the original essay, which took issue with Northwestern's restrictions on student-teacher relationships.",
        "I'm a feminist, and I think women have been fighting to be treated as consenting adults for, you know, God knows how long - 150 years at least.",
        "And this seemed to take consent away from people who are consenting adults and place it in the hands of university administrators.",
        "You know, I came of age after the sexual revolution and before HIV-AIDS, and we didn't think of sex as so much of an injury as maybe like a form of freedom, as a type of experimentation.",
        "And I see a really different attitude in my students.",
        "I think the kind of sex education they get or maybe it's part of the cultural climate - I think they see sex much more as a potential harm, as a potential injury.",
        "I mean, it's not as though they're not out there experimenting.",
        "But there is a climate of, I think, a kind of panic.",
        "And it seems to also have something to do with this problem or question of intergenerational relations.",
        "You know, it's as if almost all relations are potentially incestuous.",
        "So I was just curious about that.",
        "And I talked about the use of this word survivor in this new climate of sexual assault.",
        "And, you know, it's a term that got appropriated from, you know, Holocaust survivors to talk about incest - survivors of people who had experienced incest.",
        "And so the transmission of this language, you know, as a cultural critic.",
        "That was something that interested me.",
        "So the piece stirred up a whole lot of response.",
        "Students at Northwestern staged a protest, started a petition calling for the school president to publicly denounce your essay.",
        "Two graduate students then took another step, actually filed complaints with Northwestern's Title IX coordinator.",
        "Title IX being that provision of federal law dealing with gender discrimination on campus.",
        "So this really elevated it to a completely different level.",
        "It was a crazy thing to get this letter from the Title IX officer because, you know, I was befuddled.",
        "I had no idea Title IX could cover such things as a publication.",
        "And, in fact, I don't think it does.",
        "I think it was an attempt to stretch Title IX past the issues it's meant to deal with.",
        "Not as often, and they kind of understand.",
        "I have questions that none of them can really answer.",
        "And my brother's a pastor, went to college for 10 years at a Christian college.",
        "He's a pastor, wonderful, and years ago, before my education, I asked him to marry me and my girl, and now I don't want it to be the same.",
        "Aside from the clinical activities, education is key.",
        "I mean, those of us who work in college health consider ourselves to be educators.",
        "Our students tend to be pretty receptive to health information, and so one thing you do is try to get information in the hands of students about how they can prevent themselves from coming down with the infection: cough etiquette, hand hygiene, not sharing drinking glasses, that type of things.",
        "I was in the DMV the other day, and I saw these notices posted all over the building, you know, about don't cough into your hands, things like that.",
        "Are those the kinds of things you can put up around campus?",
        "Yes, you know, posters.",
        "You put things on Web sites.",
        "Yeah, that's exactly what we're doing.",
        "and then the third thing is we're trying to figure out how we're going to give H-1-N-1 vaccine and seasonal flu vaccine to thousands of kids.",
        "Now, that H-1-N-1 isn't available yet, but I've got 21,000 students here.",
        "So we're talking 40,000 to 50,000 shots, and so that's a daunting task, but we're preparing for that as well."

        "You know, I do.",
        "I mean, I've been working with college students for 25 years.",
        "I have a tremendous amount of faith in them in terms of acting responsibly.",
        "We've been able to turn around binge drinking on our campus over the last nine years, and honestly, all we're talking about is washing hands and not sharing Solo cups when they go out partying, and I think they're going to listen.",
        "I do, and of course, this is getting so much media attention, I think they are going to listen to us.",
        "I can see the response now: more beer.",
        "Because it has alcohol in it, that'll clean the glasses that way.",
        "The beer does not sterilize the glass, Ira.",

        "You know, well, that's a great question.",
        "I have never professionally - I've been practicing medicine since the mid-1970s, and I have not ever practiced during a pandemic, and we're used to seeing seasonal flu, but what this feels like, and I hope I'm not overstating it, but it feels more explosive.",
        "With seasonal flu it kind of starts out slow, gradually builds up, lasts for four to six weeks and then kind of peters out.",
        "This is feeling, you know, faster, and I think the virus is much more transmissible, and because these young people have no natural immunity to it, we're seeing rapid, rapid transmission.",
        "So it is feeling more explosive, but again just to reassure people, it remains a mild disease.",

        "Is that going at UVA, too?",
        "Well, we actually are encouraging faculty to have very lenient attendance requirements in classes, and first of all excuse students who say they have swine flu and let them stay home, and faculty members are being encouraged to use distant learning techniques, over the Internet or whatever.",
        "And so that actually is a pretty good idea, and I would agree with that approach.",
        "Good luck, Max.",
