        "First of all, we have confirmed nationwide that the primary circulating flu virus is H-1-N-1, and so it is not necessary to test everyone who comes in with flu-like symptoms.",
        "Marie Mutsuki Mockett.",
        "Her book is \"\"Where The Dead Pause And The Japanese Say Goodbye.\"\" Thanks very much.",
        "In fact, the CDC and health departments are recommending not testing.",
        "When a patient presents with typical symptoms of the flu - fever, body aches and sore throat and a cough - and they don't have another reason for that, doctors make the decision that this meets clinical criteria for a flu-like illness, and they make the diagnosis.",
        "This is standard practice that's been done for decades.",
        "The way we're counting it in college health, is we're counting it by the students that we see in clinic and the students that we talk to over the phone who we manage over the phone.",
        "We can take a history over the phone and pretty much tell what they have.",
        "And that's the way we're counting those cases.",
        "Now, when you get a case, does a, you know, a typical college campus have room for all these sick kids?",
        "I mean, in the infirmary?",
        "What do you tell them to do?",
        "Just stay in your room or what?",
        "Well, we tell them to stay in their room.",
        "There are no infirmaries.",
        "There's very few infirmaries nationwide.",
        "They're a dying breed.",
        "I would say the vast majority of schools do not have the flexibility of moving ill or even exposed students around, so we basically are instructing them to self-isolate in their dorm room, arrange for people to bring them food, try to find a place for their well roommate to crash.",
        "If there is no place, both of them wear masks and wash hands a lot.",
        "And that's pretty much what you do.",
        "There are some schools that do have space.",
        "I know that Emory - I read Emory has a dormitory they're using.",
        "Harvard has an empty floor somewhere.",
        "And I think another school in Pittsburgh has got an empty sorority house.",
        "But most of the time, you don't have the luxury of moving people around.",
        "Well, let's go to Jean(ph).",
        "Hi, Jean in Winston.",
        "Hi.",

        "Oh, hi.",
        "Yeah.",
        "This sounds very complex.",
        "I guess, you know, this virus will be mutating all the time, so the vaccines will always be kind of behind and kind of experimental.",
        "And I wondered - what about these rumors that we'll be required to be vaccinated or else relocated to some kind of interment camp?",
        "And if they did have this, can you have a religious exemption or something?",
        "That must come in with the death panels rumor, somewhere."

        "So, I don't envision this being a requirement.",
        "There may be some hospitals or health care facilities that are requiring their employees to take it just so that they don't inadvertently expose patients.",
        "But there will be no requirement whatsoever.",
        "I'm going to get it, and I'm going to recommend my family get it, and all of our students; because I don't want to get the disease, and I don't want to place people in my family at risk of being exposed to the virus from me.",
        "I would think that it's going to be some confusion with flu shots, because, you know, the other flu, right, the seasonal flu - where they have different set of recommendations.",
        "And then, there is the swine flu.",
        "And if you go to your local drugstore or a library where they're giving out the, quote, \"\"the flu shot,\"\" there's a chance you might be confused about which shot you're getting.",
        "Excellent point.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I think it's up to vaccine providers, and clinicians, and health departments, and the CDC to make it extremely clear who need shots and when.",
        "By the way, the seasonal vaccine is now being shipped and is available.",
        "And people who would normally get a seasonal flot(ph) - shot, can go to the doctor or the Health Department and get them right now.",
