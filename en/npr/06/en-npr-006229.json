        "After arranging their marriage, he declared that his disciples would be celibate.",
        "So when Tamm's mother became pregnant, the guru declared that the baby was special and would eventually become his greatest disciple.",
        "Tamm grew up in the guru's inner circle, enjoying his special attentions and devoting her life to him.",
        "She traveled with him around the world, watched his weight lifting feats, cleaned his private zoo and saw thousands of disciples pass through his ashram, all of them yearning to be in her exulted position.",
        "As Tamm grew older, she began having doubts and rebelling against the guru's strict rules, but it was hard to leave the only life she had ever known.",
        "In the end, the guru expelled her and she had to find a way to start a new life.",
        "Now Jayanti Tamm has written a memoir about her experience: \"\"Cartwheels in a Sari.\"\" And she'll be with us to talk about it.",

        "Well, it's great to have you.",
        "So tell us how you became, even before you were born, tell us how it happened that you became a disciple - not just a disciple, but a very special disciple of the Guru Shri Chinmoy?",
        "Yes, well, my parents arrived and became disciples of Shri Chinmoy in the late 1960s.",
        "My mother had been a civil rights worker in Chicago.",
        "My father had been a graduate student at Yale University, and they both arrived to seek enlightenment and truth from this newly arrived spiritual teacher, Shri Chinmoy.",
        "And the day that my mother went first to a meditation, this Shri Chinmoy introduced her to my father and said that in order for my mother to make great spiritual progress, she should be married to my father in a divine marriage.",
        "And so that happened.",
        "Yes, but that happened after they even self left the group.",
        "When we were all in the group, we never spoke.",
        "Again one of the challenges of a group like this is that no one speaks honestly, and if you do, you're meant to be reported by being a doubter, by being someone that has suspicions.",
        "So when I spoke to them years later - and in \"\"Cartwheels In A Sari,\"\" it actually explores their own slow and eventual loss of faith in the guru - but they believed at that time and still held onto some belief that Sri Chinmoy was the person he claimed to be.",
        "He claimed to be the direct representative of God on earth.",
        "He claimed to be the last avatar, the highest soul, higher than Jesus, higher than Buddha, higher than Muhammad, the greatest avatar.",
        "In fact, I think will make people work better and smarter and harder and also be able to do things like spend time with their families 'cause we're not robots.",

        "We're designed to be in community, to volunteer, to vote, to raise our kids.",

        "But I also think one of the things that's happened in the current climate is that what is defined as assault or rape, the boundaries have really stretched and so that sexual episodes that might once have been considered ambivalent sex are now getting re-construed as assault.",
        "And these very murky situations are being presented to Title IX officers to deal with, like mutual drunkenness or someone having later, you know, re-characterized something that was, you know, a murky situation into something that was clear-cut assault.",
