        "My belief is that a cult has a number of key characteristics that really define it, and the central being that a cult is built around a single individual or small group that has complete authority and control over the members.",
        "And this authority and control, then, therefore is able to kind of ban all criticisms, doubts and critiques about the group.",
        "So people who do raise questions are attacked and demeaned.",
        "And the other sort of key characteristic of a cult, as opposed to just an alternative religion, a cult has a distinct separation between those who are inside the group and outside.",
        "And it's imperative to preserving the order and the control to have that separation.",
        "So when someone leaves the cult, there is revenge that's taken by cutting off contact, often by retracting jobs, homes and often even causing physical harm.",
        "Yeah.",

        "No.",
        "That was the norm.",

        "They were never spoken about.",
        "They were never seen.",
        "And if they did attempt to contact members or it did attempts to sort of speak out about their experience, they were routinely harassed, shunned and discredited.",

        "You were getting home very late at night, even when you were very young child.",
        "I mean, it was - he demanded that they live in Connecticut.",
        "Everything that they did was something that the guru had told them to do.",
        "Your father became a lawyer because he told him to become a lawyer.",
        "Did you ever talk to your parents later on about what made them go that route in the first place?",
        "And with that belief, they truly felt at the time that by raising their family in this, it was an opportunity to have their children learn from the greatest living spiritual master.",
        "So they believed at the time that they were doing the absolute right thing for us.",
        "You know, I don't want it to be just, you know, total, Christian, all-out, hands being laid, oil, and all this stuff.",
        "I just don't want that anymore.",
        "I have too many questions.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "And this was despite the fact that there were some odd aspects of what Sri Chinmoy - not so much what he preached, but the way he behaved, I guess I would say.",
        "Weightlifting was a big part of his life in some way, and that just - I had, of course, heard of Sri Chinmoy, but I didn't really know much about that.",
        "And at one point, he even came to your family's home to lift an elephant.",
        "Maybe you can tell us about that and the effect it had on you, at that point a middle-schooler.",
        "Right.",
        "Well, the weightlifting was one of the various hats that he wore in his efforts to gain public attention.",
        "Sri Chinmoy was always pursuing public figures for photos, comments and awards to promote himself.",
        "And to gain public attention, he positioned himself as a musician, poet, artist, philosopher and then weightlifter.",
        "And he realized that by weightlifting huge, bizarre objects, that this would garner him great press and attention."
