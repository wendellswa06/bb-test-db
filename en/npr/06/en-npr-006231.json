        "So when I - we had just moved to Greenwich, Connecticut, and I was entering middle school, and I was hoping to try to blend in to the norm.",

        "And all the sudden, that was in the front of the paper.",
        "My parents were gushing, and suddenly I was no longer the anonymous middle-schooler that I had hoped.",
        "So the weightlifting was, again, part of his spectacle to get attention.",
        "Later on, he made a claim that he lifted, with one arm, 7,000 pounds.",
        "Now this was, this time of your life when this occurred, when these sort of very public displays of weightlifting, particularly the elephant in your backyard, at a time when you were really pretty vulnerable.",
        "This is when you started having some problems.",
        "You were in middle school, and like all middle-schoolers, you just wanted everybody to like you, and, you know, to lay low and for nobody to think you were strange.",
        "Right, and well in \"\"Cartwheels in a Sari,\"\" as I get older, clearly, my doubts begin to be more intensified.",
        "So by junior high school, like most teenage girls, I was interested in boys, and I wanted to experience the quote-unquote \"\"outside world,\"\" the world that Sri Chinmoy was forbidding us to enter into.",
        "So there were many contradictions there, and there were many longings for things outside.",
        "So while my daily life and my evening life tended to, at that time, sort of create problems for me to try to figure out who I was and what I was supposed to be doing.",
        "And, of course, the big thing was you liked boys.",
        "Oh, that was a big problem.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "Family was a bad word.",

        "He's a pretty crappy boyfriend."

        "And yeah, for me I had a pretty dramatic experience getting rusticated or expelled from the group, you know, essentially just for attending a party of people who were not in the group.",
        "So that was a pretty traumatic experience.",
        "I just wanted to see, you know, how it was for Jayanti leaving the group, and, you know, how it feels now with losing so many people that you grew up with."

        "But the irony is that once you leave that group, that family is gone.",
        "They disown you, and everything you have there is banned.",
        "So it certainly was a shock when I left the group.",
        "Suddenly, you're alone, and you're in this frantic rush to build a life.",
        "I mean, leaving a cult, one leaves behind everything.",
        "So the focus is to try to figure out, well, how to build a life without having any connections and anyone from the past there with you.",
        "And also, Jayanti, as you explain in the book, you tried to leave a couple of times, and you weren't really able to.",
        "It was very hard for you because you didn't know anything else.",
        "And so - and I don't want a fake it, either, by going through the motions.",

        "Well, Ryan, thanks so much for sharing with us today.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And also, there was pressure from the group to return, and actually, this continued over the years until I finally had received sort of my last message from Sri Chinmoy back - and this was in 2001, in October, 2001, right after September 11th attacks.",
        "I was living in Manhattan, and all of the sudden, I received this message from him, saying that there was a hostile force, this demon that was trying to attack me and kill me."

        "Yeah.",
        "It was extremely difficult, you know, after being in the group for 20 years and being raised in the group, you know, essentially having education be something that was considered a bad thing.",
        "So just adapting to society and getting your career was a monumental task, but then also just having the basic emotional tools to deal with everyday life was difficult.",
        "So I had essentially a big edge, though, to a lot of other people, because I was referred an exit counselor.",
        "And at that point, I had about seven years of psychotherapy, which really helped out a lot.",

        "And my mother gave me the option of practicing or not.",
        "My mother and father divorced, and I chose not to remain a practicing Muslim.",
        "And it's because of the dogmatic approach, and I asked the questions of the imams, and I've asked questions to pastors that before there was the New Testament, the Old Testament, before the prophet Muhammad, there was God and his relationship with man, and type of questioning, and that - that's not accepted in dogmatic faiths.",

        "We were told that those who were outside the group were ignorant and were potential hostile forces, were demons there to challenge us and to rid us of our own spiritual faith.",
        "So we were told to ignore them, cut off all contact from them, and even the simplest thing like going online on the Internet was considered banned and bad.",
        "One shouldn't do that.",
        "One shouldn't enter into those spheres that might tamper with your own faith.",
        "And one thing we should mention is that although your parents left the group, so you're in touch with them, but your brother cut you off when you left the group.",
        "Yes.",
        "My brother is still a very devout member, and as a devout member, he has - he does not have any contact with me, and I also have an aunt who is still a member of the group.",
