        "And I guess the main thing that really made me kind of leave, you know, the small group of people, it was like 20 to 25, it was all the church ever had, was just getting a formal education, which, you know, and some of the other callers, and you know, with your guest today, wasn't exactly prohibited.",
        "It was kind of encouraged, but only Christian colleges.",

        "And then after about a year and a half of taking classes, it was literally about three years ago where I really sat there, and all of a sudden, I couldn't answer the questions I had anymore.",
        "Neither could anybody else.",
        "And to ask them is definitely doubting, and it's not something encouraged.",

        "I was born and raised Catholic, then kind of drifted away and became a Buddhist at 19 and really recognized this is something really beneficial to do maybe at a really young age.",
        "I just felt really compelled to, and I only managed to do it for three months because you have to, you know, wear robes and have the vows, which include things like celibacy and, you know, you can't consume any intoxicants of any kind.",
        "And I found myself not really closed off enough from the outside world to really sustain this at such a young age.",
        "And being, you know, young and gay in San Francisco three blocks from the gay district, that was also kind of a little bit difficult, you know?",
        "So, yeah, after three months, I ended up disrobing and giving back my vows, but it was an incredibly valuable experience and I'm still in close contact with the community and my lamas."
