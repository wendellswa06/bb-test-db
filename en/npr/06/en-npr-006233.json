        "Thanks for having me.",
        "Well, first of all, do you buy the argument that someone truly isn't self-aware enough to recognize that certain kinds of behavior is just wrong?",
        "And I'm thinking here about Louis C.K., who has admitted - forgive me, parents, who are sick of hearing about this - that he masturbated in front of female comedians who had sought him out for career advice.",
        "So even accounting for how different the entertainment world can be, do you really buy that he just didn't know that that was not OK?",
        "More generally, self-awareness is a remarkably-rare quality.",
        "And so my view on this is that this is one fairly disturbing manifestation of that.",
        "But even generally in the population, our research has shown that 95 percent of people think that they're self-aware, which means knowing who we are, knowing the impact we're having on others, but only 10 to 15 percent really are.",
        "And that's sort of the baseline that we all start with, which is a lack of self-awareness.",
        "Well, given that your work generally is what people at the top of the corporate food chain, as it were, I just wondered if your research indicates whether there is any pattern to people who are interested - at least interested in being self-aware and people who aren't?",
        "Time and again, research on this has shown that the more power we hold, the less self-aware we become.",
        "There's an example Megyn Kelly talked about this last week where she shared an upsetting encounter she had had with Charlie Rose on a book tour that she was on.",
        "And she was angry about the whole situation.",
        "Then she said, what did I do?",
        "I sent him a bottle of wine and a thank-you note.",
        "And I think that's so telling about how we treat people in power, that really, you know, if delusion were a fire, power is the kerosene that just can send it up in smoke.",
        "I just gave that Louis C.K.",
        "example.",
        "Can you think of another example of, like, the kind of cluelessness that we're talking about here?",
        "So I think of Matt Lauer and a couple of things that have gone on.",
        "Number one was the statement he made where he said some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized.",
        "And that's consistent with a lot of the other apologies which are not really apologies.",
        "But I did a little bit of investigating.",
        "And earlier this year in an interview with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand about her new book, he was essentially berating her for not calling out the names of her colleagues who committed harassment or who she saw commit harassment.",
        "And, you know, to condemn the behavior in others that you can't see in yourself, you know, I think it's so indicative of just how blind we are.",
        "So you delivered this TEDx Talk that had more than a million views.",
        "And in that talk, you used an example of a male boss was unaware of how his behavior was affecting his staff.",
        "And I just want to be clear that this was an anger-management issue, not a sexual-misconduct issue.",
        "But I thought the example was interesting because when you interviewed the staff before you began working with him, they all said they didn't like working with him, that he made them uncomfortable, that his behavior just was very upsetting.",
        "But then after you'd work through solutions with him, his staff was responding positively to the changes that he made.",
        "I wonder, what lessons should we draw from that?",
        "I mean, is the lesson here that you can change but somebody needs to push you to change?",
        "Despite what he said on the campaign trail, the president is playing his cards close to his chest on this one, at least until later this afternoon.",
        "This area used to be more of an industrial waterfront.",
        "Now, it's a high-tech office park.",
        "And that means the suicides have a bigger audience."

        "The data shows that, you know, they're not going to go elsewhere.",
        "Advocates of the barriers point to a 1970s study that tracked people after they'd been prevented from jumping from the Golden Gate.",
        "It found that most of them did not go on to commit suicide later.",

        "He's critical of an effort to put up a barrier on a nearby scenic bridge.",
        "He acknowledges that there are studies showing declines in a region's overall suicide rate after a barrier's installed, but he says those rates usually don't fall very much.",
        "And if I can reread those studies carefully, they explicitly say, well, we were unable to find a statistically significant change in the suicide rate, meaning a change that we can safely say isn't due a chance.",

        "By focusing on a bridge as a suicide site, we shouldn't delude ourselves into thinking we have done a real good job of reducing or preventing suicides, because you have to attack this problem in the community, not on the bridge.",
