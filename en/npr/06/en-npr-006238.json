        "Yes it is.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "And one of the things I wanted to ask, though, Bill Eskridge, is - these victories largely have been through the courts and a lot of people on the pro gay rights side celebrated the victory in Vermont - it's the first time a legislature had done this.",
        "Well, here's what's being forgotten about the Vermont story is that it started with the courts.",
        "People have forgotten that.",
        "In 1999, the Vermont Supreme Court said that it's unconstitutional under the Vermont constitution to discriminate against lesbian and gay couples.",
        "Now, the court then left it to the legislature to define the remedy.",
        "And the legislature in the year 2000 adopted the civil union statute.",
        "Then the people had an opportunity to vote for and against the legislators who adopted that statute.",
        "Some were defeated, most were reelected.",
        "We had experience in Vermont with civil unions.",
        "Lesbian and gay couples, many of them raising children, many of them neighbors, teachers, co-workers, et cetera, entered into solemn and celebrated unions.",
        "And the debate in Vermont changed because of the court, and then the legislative follow-up, because we did have these same-sex couples.",
        "And the average Vermonter thought, rather than, well, why gay marriage?",
        "This has not been traditionally recognized.",
        "The question changed to - why not?",
        "And it's very important to remember that those Vermont legislators, like the ones in California in 2005 and 2007, who also voted for gay marriage, will be up for reelection.",
        "And the people, if they care as much as Maggie Gallagher says they care, will have an opportunity to vote against them.",
        "And Maggie, we'll get back to you after a short break.",
        "With us, Bill Eskridge of Yale University, where he's a professor of law, and Maggie Gallagher, president of the National Organization for Marriage.",
        "How is this issue playing out where you live?",
        "We're talking about the campaigns for and against gay marriage, not whether you think gay marriage is good or bad.",
        "Give us a call, 800-989-8255.",
        "Email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "Stay with us.",
        "I'm Neal Conan.",
        "It's the TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "(Soundbite of music)",
        "This is TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "I'm Neal Conan in Washington.",
        "We're talking today about the campaigns for and against gay marriage are playing out in various states across the country, that after decisions in two states over the past couple of weeks to legalize gay marriage, after votes last November in three states to ban it.",
        "800-989-8255 is the phone number.",
        "Email is talk@npr.org.",
        "Our guests, William Eskridge, a professor of law at Yale, the author of many books, most recently, \"\"Gay Marriage: For Better or Worse.\"\" And also with us, Maggie Gallagher, president of the National Organization for Marriage.",
        "And Maggie, is this strictly a Republican, Democratic decision?",
        "You note that of the four states where this is legal, three in northeast - solid blue states."

        "Well, you know, if you leave it up to the American people, no. There are a large number of Democrats, a majority of Independents, as well as Republicans, who think, you know, to make a marriage you need a husband and wife.",
        "And to equate that with racism, much less, slavery or segregation is just way over the top.",
        "And I note that even in Vermont, the people did not, you know, the gay marriage movement didn't leave this up to the people of Vermont directly because they were not confident that they could win a vote of the Vermont people.",
        "And I really don't think that you could go to people in Vermont and say, well, what's my top 10 issues for the Vermont legislature to be doing right now - that gay marriage would've made that list.",
        "So this really does have to do with the way…",
        "Nevertheless, you lost in Vermont.",
        "And do you find a national sort of umbrella ad like that more effective or would you prefer more local-targeted ads that would affect the situation in New York or New Jersey or wherever?",
        "With the way that legislatures - the point I'm making is the way that legislatures that are - when the Democratic Party, this would be true of the Republican Party, as well - it's the nature of politics - when it has a strong majority, then it has a lot of incentives to play to the interests and the demands of its base, whether or not that's in the priority of the American people.",
        "And I think that's what you saw in Vermont.",
        "We're very aware, I've been saying for 18 months that it's going to shift.",
        "It's going to shift out of the courts and it's going to shift away from opportunities to pass state marriage amendments.",
        "We will still be working on that in a number of states, but it's a longer-term project because we have to get through legislatures to get it to the people.",
        "And it's going to shift to efforts to push gay marriage bills through legislatures on the grounds that even though this isn't the people's priorities, politicians, you know, don't really worry that much that they'll lose their seats over this issue.",
        "So we have to find the people who care about this and organize them.",
        "This hasn't been done in the northeast before.",
        "It's a big task, but that's what we see before us.",
        "Bill Eskridge, a piece in The Times today, New York Times, was interesting on the point of getting a bill through the New York state legislature.",
        "There is a bare majority of Democrats in the state Senate there, but some are opposed to gay marriage.",
        "There are some natural Democratic constituents, African-Americans and Hispanics among them, who don't necessarily, certainly demographically, support gay marriage.",
        "Yeah, that's correct.",
        "It just shows the heterogeneity of the strategy that both sides are going to have to follow.",
        "So, for example, in New York one might ultimately end up not with gay marriage by statute, although the governor says that they're going to recognize out-of-state gay marriages, so have them to that extent - but maybe New York will compromise for civil unions or domestic partnerships.",
        "That's often the recipe when there is division within the jurisdiction, strong support for marriage, but also strong and sincere opposition.",
        "And Maggie Gallagher is right.",
        "This cuts across partisan lines.",
        "I'll just note, however, that so does no-fault divorce.",
        "If you really want to change marriage, no-fault divorce, which has been adopted in the last 40 years, pretty much everywhere, has really changed marriage, and it went through the legislatures.",
        "It did not go through the people."
