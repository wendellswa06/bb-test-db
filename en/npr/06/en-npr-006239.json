        "The message is, instead, that I think young people will change their minds, and I think they'll change their minds toward greater support for lesbian and gay marriage.",
        "And the reason I think young people are more open to this idea is that they've grown up knowing openly gay and lesbian people and including openly gay and lesbian couples oftentimes raising children.",
        "And for them, with that template, with that base line, the question really is why not gay marriage?",
        "Why not accord the same civil state recognition to these couples who seem committed, who are raising children, who are part of the neighborhood, who are part of the community.",
        "Moreover, young people are more likely than older people to see this as a civil rights issue, as an issue of civil liberty where much, though not necessarily most of the opposition, is founded upon prejudice and stereotypes such as we saw in opposition - excuse me, Maggie.",
