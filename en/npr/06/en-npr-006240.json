        "Bye-bye.",
        "These battles of - I just want to ask you, Bill Eskridge.",
        "In the states - and there are many of them that have passed this constitutional amendments - they are going to be very difficult to overcome.",
        "That's correct.",
        "And actually the suggestion that Mike from Cleveland made is, I think, right on point.",
        "The way you overturn these anti-marriage amendments, many of which can only be overturned by a voter referendum or initiative, is by changing people's opinions at the ground level, and faith communities are very important in that.",
        "In the book I published 12 years ago, \"\"The Case for Same-Sex Marriage,\"\" we had a lengthy appendix of letters from religious leaders supporting same-sex marriage.",
        "Now, what you're going to need also in states like Ohio is coalitions.",
        "And in many of these states, you're not going to have marriage but you might be able to persuade the legislature to adopt domestic partnership or civil unions, like what Vermont had for a number of years…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…assuming that's not prohibited by the constitutional amendment.",
        "And that's an issue that has been litigated very aggressively by the anti-marriage forces.",
        "And for example, they've just prevailed in Michigan, where the anti-marriage amendment that Michigan voters did pass, and where at least some of them had been assured this will not interfere with domestic partnership rights for employers and even municipalities, the Michigan Supreme Court has just interpreted the anti-marriage amendment to preempt all state/municipal domestic partnership benefits.",
        "Hmm.",
        "Okay.",
        "So in Michigan, that's headed off.",
        "But other states, it won't be."

        "All right.",
        "I just wanted one quick question to Maggie Gallagher and that is do you see any prospect - there were a lot of people advocating for a national constitutional amendment, do you see any prospect of that at all?",
        "Well, not while the Democrats have the strong majority as they have.",
        "I think, though, that what's going to really happen with gay marriage is that later this year, President Obama is going to fulfill his campaign - or perhaps early next year - his campaign promise to try to overturn the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which is the federal law that protects marriage as one man and one woman, and that the step following that is going to be to go to the supreme court and try to impose same-sex marriage in all 50 states whether people like it or not.",

        "Who do you think you should be worrying right now about the Mueller investigation?",
        "We've seen reports already that it is Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who directed Michael Flynn to speak to the Russian ambassador and urge him not to retaliate against the United States' imposition of sanctions, to wait for President Trump to be inaugurated.",
        "But the White House is pushing back on that, saying that it was a group effort.",
        "I would say we really don't know right now.",
        "And what strikes me is administration officials I've spoke to have said it's a - it's one thing to make contact or be directed to make contact with a foreign country during the campaign.",
        "That would be deadly.",
        "The laws are a bit murkier in terms of making contact with a foreign country during the presidential transition - less clear how damning that may be.",
        "On the other hand, Bob Mueller would not have entered into a plea agreement with Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser, if he didn't think that he had something to trade.",
        "And that to me is what the White House really has to worry about.",
        "E.J., do you think it's harder at this point for Donald Trump to dismiss this investigation?",
        "Does it look like a more serious investigation with the Flynn guilty plea?",
        "Well, knowing Donald Trump, he will continue to dismiss the investigation.",
        "But those dismissals become less and less believable.",
        "I think one of the things we've seen over the last month and a half is Mr. Mueller is systematic.",
        "He's disciplined.",
        "He's tough.",
        "He knows what he's doing, and he's working his way up.",
        "It's, as we've talked about before, something very similar to an investigation of the mob as he tries to gather people below to get at people above.",
        "And so I think the White House has a lot of reason to be very concerned that this - that he is working his way up.",
        "And whether he gets to the very top, we're going to know soon.",
        "But there were reports today that President Trump was given a very, very grim accounting of what's going on out here.",
        "And I think a grim view rather than Ty Cobb's Pollyannish view is the right one for the White House to take."

        "I'm not sure the Republican Party will be running on the details of this bill.",
        "I think the Republican Party will be running on the fact that they have gotten something done in Washington and passed a major piece of legislation.",
        "And there's a distinction to be made there.",
        "I think if we see economic growth in the next two, three years, the Republican Party will reap great benefits.",

        "E.J., can Democrats credibly say that the debt was OK when it was pushing 20 trillion under a Democratic president but 22 trillion is really fiscally irresponsible?",
        "Well, what Democrats can say is that with the debt we have and when we are in relatively good economic circumstances, it's a terrible idea to cut taxes more than that and add to the deficit.",
        "More than that, this is one of the most reckless operations we've ever seen.",
        "It represents government for the few by the reckless, this tax bill does.",
        "One Democrat told me that for the first time in a tax debate that he could remember, the Democrats have the upper hand because in the past when Republicans cut taxes a lot for the very rich, they also cut taxes for the middle class and others.",
        "This bill gives this giant corporate tax cut, pulling the corporate rate down to 20 percent from a nominal 35 percent.",
        "And it actually raises taxes, especially when the middle class tax cuts expire in 2025.",
        "Somebody wrote in The New Yorker that this is like a teaser rate in mortgage, which is up front.",
        "People will see some benefits.",
        "But you're saying...",
        "But they disappear.",
        "And so I think...",
        "You're saying, E.J., that Democrats have the upper hand with public opinion.",
