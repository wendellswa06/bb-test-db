        "Now - so I mean - talking just about coal jobs, and that's what I've been mostly doing some reporting on recently, I've kind of discovered there's a big problem for coal.",
        "And that is that the coal industry is in a structural decline.",

        "I think there's a lot of different reasons for that, obviously.",
        "But if you want to draw a thread through all of them, I think a big one to draw is consistency.",
