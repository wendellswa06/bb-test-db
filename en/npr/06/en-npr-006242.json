        "He would also like to see them, the Afghan soldiers and police, get a lot more equipment as well, and that's very important.",
        "We were over there back in the spring and the police, for example, the Afghan police, are driving around in Ford Rangers with no body armor.",

        "Has he gone past the point where he can in any way change that effort, that he can pull back from sending more troops in?",
        "Is it too late to change?",

        "Now, the British media is a very - look, I am one of the British media's biggest critics and - but I think that what happens sometimes is that whole of the media finds it convenient to have this kind of Murdoch bogeyman figure out there because it then means that they don't have to sort of address other failings within the whole media infrastructure.",
