        "So the Times of London used to pride itself on being a paper or record while a newspaper that just wants to see itself as a paper or record is going to be swept away by the 24/7 Internet media revolution.",
        "So yes, it's changed.",
        "But I could take you through every single national newspaper in the U.K.",
        "and I could find those that have changed in - for technological reasons, those who have changed for political reasons, those that have changed because of other industrial changes going on.",
        "I mean, it's just - we - I think we live in a world defined by the pace of change and the media has been a very, very big part of that.",
        "And you pointed out the biggest change in the news media in the past 20 years or so has been the 24-hour, seven-day-a-week news cycle.",
        "And of course, Mr. Murdoch, through his ownership of Sky News in Britain and Fox News in this country has something to do with that, too.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "And you see the point I made in the op-ed is, look, in a sense - I made the point that it's his fortune in a sense to be seen as this bogeyman figure, because it gives him this kind of extra edge as people are slightly mesmerized by him, whatever he does.",
        "But actually - you just take the television thing.",
        "When - I mean, Murdoch in the end, he's a risk-taking entrepreneur.",
        "I can remember when Sky News was launched here.",
        "And there was a very, very prevailing opinion that it just wasn't going to survive.",
        "And likewise, I think a very similar reaction when Fox came along, that it wasn't really going to sort of be able to break into the American TV market in the way that Murdoch was suggesting that it would.",
        "Well, it seems that he appears to have been successful.",
        "Now, whenever I go to America, people talk about Fox, they may be talking about it in disparaging terms but they, you know, they seem to be watching it.",
        "And so, I just think he's used the kind of bogeyman status, in a sense, to let other people to take the eye off the ball.",
        "He doesn't take the eye off the ball, he just kind of plows on.",
        "And so I don't know.",
        "I think that - I think it's to say I think he - I'm not saying whether the judgment is harsh or not harsh.",
        "It kind of doesn't matter.",
        "What matters is that in that world of change, that is modern media, it seems to me most of the time he's just a couple of steps ahead of a lot of his rivals.",
        "Now, you cite a fascinating anecdote where some people worried that Rupert Murdoch was getting a little too old, and he's cited his examples of getting out ahead of the technological curve - things like cable television news in the Internet - and said, look, I'm afraid that you guys, his junior managers, are too old.",
        "Well, no. Apparently, I spoke at one of these conferences.",
        "Ah, I see.",
        "Okay.",
        "It wasn't that one.",
        "But I've been at those events where - in fact, I went to one with Tony Blair in 1995 or six in Australia, where you do get this.",
        "And this is the other point I make, is that, look, we are kidding ourselves if we pretend that big proprietorial figures in newspapers down the years do not exercise some kind of influence.",
        "They exercise influence with the people they appoint to the top jobs.",
        "And they exercise influence by those people knowing that ultimately they can, in a sense, they have more power than the organization.",
        "Now, Rupert Murdoch is somebody who understands and is not afraid to exercise power within his own organization.",
        "But my point is that - the point I was making there is that he was making absolutely clear that he's going to be deal-breaking and deal-making to the grave."

        "Now, and it's also the words - again, going back to the case of the Times, there were all sorts of assurances ahead of times, committees established and what not to make sure that Rupert Murdoch would not interfere in the Times' coverage - not its editorial page, owners are generally accorded some amount of freedom on their own editorial pages - but in terms of its coverage.",
        "And a lot of people would say that that agreement wasn't worth the paper it was printed on.",
        "Well, it may.",
        "Another - no, I mean, I actually do write the occasional piece for The Times.",
        "And I don't know what the guys who work there today say about indifference or non-difference.",

        "I mean, for example, I saw recently the then-editor of the News of the World, which is a big-selling Sunday tabloid.",
        "And, look, I'm out of the job that I was doing and he's now out of the job that he was doing at that time, he swore blind to me that he was the one who made the decision in 1997 to switch from Tory to Labour.",
        "And that was not as it were a direct instruction from Rupert Murdoch.",

        "-my sense is that Rupert Murdoch has always taken a pretty close and direct interest in the politics and political coverage there.",
        "But again, you talk to the people there and they say that this was them being driven by their - where they felt their readers were going.",
        "So I think in terms of - Rupert Murdoch is a - when you read the list of different media outlets and business interests that he's got, frankly, I don't think he has time to interfere directly in too many of these.",
        "But I suspect that in suffice that it is interference is because people know what he thinks.",
        "Uh-hmm.",
        "Let's get some listeners in on the conversation.",

        "Only a few companies own all the newspapers, all the TV networks and then can easily get together and pretty much convince the American public and pretty much the world public do whatever they want, pretty much.",

        "This is another example if a consolidation of the media, another independent voice being swallowed up by a large conglomerate.",

        "Well, I think it's inherently a bad thing if there is too much concentration of media ownership in a relatively small number of hands.",
        "But I -the point I was making earlier about the world being defined by the pace of change, there is now so much media out there.",
        "There is 24/7 TV and radio going around the globe all the time with an explosion of different outlets.",
        "With the newspapers, I think, there is - I would accept that I think it would be better if there were more people owning newspapers in your country, in our country.",
        "But in a sense, unless the legislators are going to legislate and regulate in a way that that were broken up more, then I - if you are the businessman, if you are the Rupert Murdoch figure or you're one of the other media owners there, in a sense, you just have to play the marketplace as it is.",
        "So, I think that - again, when I said earlier, I think that this is an argument that is more apposite and relevant to a period is now passed, because I just think there is so much media out there now.",

        "I find it hard to imagine that a man like that, who's actually admitted to something like this, be in charge of a financial news outlet that a lot of people put a lot of trust and, you know, into their decision-making based off of the reports and everything they get out of these newspapers.",
        "So, I mean, I feel that this gentleman Rupert Murdoch is, you know, he's an oligarch, he's monopolizing the prints and cable and media.",
        "And regardless of the what your guest says, he's basically saying that there's so many outlets out there for the public to have access to, but a lot of people don't have, still, access to Internet and things of that nature, and all they have is the major news organization and print media to rely upon.",

        "But isn't it interesting that you - on the one hand, you're saying, well, you got - and then if you put this call together with the previous callers - a very, very small group of media owners who can manipulate the public into thinking whatever they want them to.",
        "And so then you say that Rupert Murdoch has told all these organizations to support the war in Iraq.",
        "Well, my very, very strong impression when I was in the United States last week is that there was a lot of hostility, a lot of anger about the war in Iraq.",
        "And I was actually quite taken aback in certain cases about the extent to which the hostility was directed towards President Bush in a really very direct way.",
        "Now, I think that the reason why people should may be just get a little a bit less irated about the - some of the Murdoch ownership issues is because I just think the public now, whether in your country or in ours, are just much better at working things out for themselves.",
        "And it's like in this country, we have - and as I rage our media a lot of the time because I think we have a culture of negativity.",

        "Hmm.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks very much, Sean.",
        "Thanks.",

        "He doesn't endorse a candidate; he's paid for campaigns for a candidate.",
        "Well, I think that again that is part - look, that may be partly accurate, but I think it's, again, got to be set in the context of the world of change that I described.",
        "Because newspapers that are just kind of pervades(ph) old news, as it were, in the old fashion sense.",
