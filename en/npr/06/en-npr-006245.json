        "Well, the first thing I'm noticing is how black it is - beautifully black.",
        "Black like coal, like oil, like charcoal, because this soil is also full of carbon - organic carbon, or humus, Burras calls it.",
        "What's left from countless generations of rotting plants.",

        "Rattan Lal, a soil scientist at Ohio State University, has traveled the world studying those fields, trying to calculate how much carbon farmers have unleashed.",
        "From time immemorial when the world agriculture began, we have lost roughly 140 billion tons of carbon from trees and soil.",
        "In fact, until the 1950s, plowing had released more carbon dioxide into the air than all the burning of coal and oil.",

        "It lets the land keep its stored carbon and even adds some, because those corn stalks on the surface gradually become part of the soil.",
        "In fact by some calculations, each acre of no-till land in Iowa captures about a ton of carbon dioxide from the air each year.",
        "At that rate, a seven-acre cornfield inhales about as much of this greenhouse gas as the average American car exhales.",

        "According to Rattan Lal, from Ohio State, American soil could - at least in theory - capture more than a hundred million tons of carbon a year, enough to offset the emissions from half the cars in the country.",
        "If we want to kick the carbon habit, as our president has asked, agriculture is an important part of the solution to rehabilitating our carbon civilization.",
        "Lal says the real beauty of this is no-till farming or growing more grass and hay costs very little.",
        "Also farming this way helps the environment in lots of ways; the land becomes more of a sponge for water, less soil and fertilizer washes into nearby streams.",

        "The money comes from businesses that are trying to balance their greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Right now, those businesses aren't paying a lot, but that could change, if Congress passes strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "Then, farmers might actually earn some real money capturing carbon.",
