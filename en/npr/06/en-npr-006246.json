        "And you're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "So this round of demonstrations, which began a couple of weeks ago, seems to be doing nothing but gathering force?",
        "Yes.",
        "It's quite clear that more and more students, and more and more high school kids, are getting behind it.",
        "And next Tuesday, the unions, the big unions are joining in and planning strikes that could cause considerable disruption to public transport.",
        "I think that is what's made Mr. de Villepin offer his invitation for talks, because until now he's been saying that he's going to push this trough, regardless.",
        "And he thought there was probably some political capital to be made out of being tough.",
        "Now I think he's changed his mind.",
        "and part of the reason he may be changing his mind is that he seems to be standing alone on this.",
        "Even members of his own party, the Interior Minister, Mr. Sarkozy said the other day that he thought maybe this wasn't such a great idea.",
        "Yes, well, one of the problems with this, and indeed one of the problems with French politics in general at the moment, is that both the Prime Minister, Mr. de Villepin, and his deputy, Mr. Sarkozy, both plan to run for the presidency next year.",
        "And so any issue of national importance in French politics, has now become, and will always become for the next twelve months, a political football.",
        "And each of those two men will be trying to play the issue for the best position in regard to his rival.",
        "That's not a particularly good situation in which to seek solutions to national problems.",
        "and there seems to be some taking--Mr.",
        "de Villepin's never been elected to anything--and there seem to be some in the French parliament who are saying, taking great pleasure in his isolation here.",
        "Nobody's building a plant to build small cars in America.",

        "Yes, well Mr. Villepin is a career diplomat.",
        "He became best known before facing off the United States against the Iraq war three years ago.",
        "And he's very popular in France for having done that.",
        "But he's not a man with, perhaps sort of humility that is required in delicate political situations like the one he faces now.",
        "He is pretty sure of his own skills and of his own strength, and I think that may perhaps be coming back to haunt him now.",
        "Getting back to the broader economic picture, is this to some degree a reaction to globalization?",
        "Well it is, I mean, for us, the French economy, it faces the same challenges of every European economy--of greater competition elsewhere.",
        "And employers here say that they need to be able to move fast to react to changing market conditions, and that involves moving fast on the labor front, and sometimes hiring people and sometimes firing them without very much notice.",
        "I think that a lot of people recognize that that is a reality, that France can't get away from, but at the same time French people are very deeply attached to the traditions of, not just social security protection they get, but labor protection.",
        "And I think one thing that has not happened yet in France, which is happening elsewhere in Europe, is a distinction between job security, we value the security of the job you're doing, and that's what the French want; and employment security, which is a broader concept that says, okay, you may move the job you have, but because jobs are easy to find, you'll get another one fairly soon.",
        "That hasn't happened yet in France.",
        "Yet the French tend to look at the system in the United Kingdom or in the United States and say this is heartless.",
        "Indeed.",
        "And that's one of the things that Mr. Villepin has been accused of, is importing savage, cruel, Anglo-Saxon capitalism into France.",
        "I don't think that's his goal, but certainly there are some other European models that the French look to with a bit more interest.",
        "For example, Denmark, where the government has introduced, for the last ten to fifteen years, something that they call flex-security.",
        "And its easy to lose your job, its easy for an employer to fire you in Denmark, but then you get about 90 percent of your lost salary for quite a long time, and you are retrained under an obligatory system to make you more adaptable and more suitable for another job.",
        "And that system has brought unemployment in Denmark down from about 30 percent down to five percent in the last dozen or so years.",
        "That clearly has something to offer France, but whether any French politician to reform that deeply I think remains to be seen.",
        "And, briefly, might such a modification ultimately be the outcome of this current dispute, do you think?"

        "Conceivably.",
        "But I suspect that given the immobilisim of French politics, this standoff will end in some sort of a compromise which won't create very many more jobs, it won't do very much good to Mr. Villepin's political future, and we'll have to wait for a new government next year before any serious steps are taken.",

        "Erdogan says he wants to make that message clear to President Bush, that Turkey and Jordan believe breaking up Iraq would mean sectarian violence would just explode.",

        "But as you know, in the last day or so the situation has gotten even worse, with a lot of violence, a lot of sectarian reprisal killings.",
        "And many Shiite leaders in parliament who are loyal to the Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr have said they'll boycott the government if Mr. Bush sits down with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.",
        "That could be a major problem for Maliki and his ability to hold the government together.",
        "But the White House says Mr. Bush is not canceling his visit.",
