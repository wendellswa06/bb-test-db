        "The Department of Homeland Security banned liquids, gels and lotions from carry-on bags after the announcement this morning of a foiled terror plot in London.",
        "In the U.S., passengers faced four-hour security lines at some airports today, and the airlines saw flight delays and cancellations, especially on routes between the U.S.",
        "and London.",
        "We're going to have full coverage of the terrorist plot and the rest of the day's news.",
        "That's later today on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "But right now, a look at airport security.",
        "Across the country today, would-be passengers chugged bottled water and tossed toothpaste, lotion and soap in the trash.",
        "The federal government says items like these and other liquids and gels could be used to sneak explosives onto planes.",
        "As security checkpoints crack down, what exactly are they looking for and how do they find explosives that might be disguised as everyday products?",
        "To tell us more about airport security and how to keep one step ahead of attackers, we turn to Paul Wilkinson.",
        "He's chairman of the Center for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of St. Andrews, in Scotland, and he joins us by phone from his home there.",
        "Thanks for being with us.",
        "A pleasure.",
        "Maybe you can give a sense, we've been talking all day about the fact that airline passengers can't carry their toiletries onto an airplane, things like toothpaste.",
        "How, what could be hidden in a tube of toothpaste?",
        "What's the danger?",
        "The danger is the use of acetone-based or peroxide-based explosives, which could be used instead of the rather traditional explosives that used to be the mainstay of terrorists, the military explosives such as RDX and PENT and so on.",
        "These were the major mainstay of terrorists in the ‘70s and ‘80s.",
        "Now we have terrorists very interested in the non-nitrogenous explosives, which are very difficult to detect because the devices that were developed for the airports after Lockerby were really geared to finding plastic explosives and the military-type of explosives that I mentioned, and so we have here a challenge for aviation security.",
        "We've known it was emerging for some time.",
        "In fact, as long ago as 1995, the master bomb-maker Ramsey Usef plotted to use bombs that were assembled onboard aircraft to cause the crashing and explosion of air carriers over the Pacific.",
        "These were U.S.",
        "air carriers, and the intention was to kill all the passengers and crew, and he did a test run on a Philippine Airlines plane, leaving it of course before the explosion took place."

        "By a miracle of good fortune and really good airmanship by the pilot, on that occasion the plane did not crash with the loss of all lives on board.",
        "A Japanese passenger was sucked out of the gap in the fuselage created by the explosion, but the pilot managed to land the aircraft, which was quite remarkable.",
        "So we have known about the danger of people assembling bombs using unusual methods.",
        "Liquid explosives can be very useful for terrorists in that way, and I think the al-Qaida network or networks has been looking at vulnerabilities in aviation security, and that's one of the areas where they've decided they could perhaps succeed in bringing about massive killing and destruction.",
        "It sounds like -",
        "You know, if the nine airliners that the police say were being targeted had been blown up in mid-air over American cities, the deaths from that would've been huge.",
        "Yeah.",

        "Yes.",

        "When writer Marie Mutsuki Mockett's father died unexpectedly several years ago, she became unmoored, lost in deep depression and grief.",
        "Her father was American, her mother is Japanese, and it was in Japan's rituals of mourning that Mockett found solace.",
        "Her mother's family owns and runs a temple just 25 miles from the Fukushima nuclear power plant which melted down after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.",
        "Mockett begged her cousin - the temple's priest - to leave.",
        "He refused.",
        "He told her his community needed him.",
        "To care for the souls of the ancestors so that the living who are left behind feel at ease that the souls of their beloved departed family members are being tended to every day.",
        "It's at her family's temple that Marie Mutsuki Mockett begins her journey through grief, a journey that takes her into the radiation zone, into the homes of tsunami survivors, into Zen temples where she spends hours in meditation.",

        "Of course grief is special and private and everyone's grief is unique, and the person that we have lost is unique.",
        "But there are all of these wonderful traditions which take individual pain like that and cast it against the backdrop of human suffering, just in general.",
        "So for example, I write about something about something called Toro nagashi, which is lantern floating, where during Obon - which is this period in August when the spirits of the ancestors come home - one can go to any number of locations, purchase a paper lantern and write down the names of the people who you have lost, then go to either a river - or in my case, it was the ocean - and put the lantern in the water just as the sun is setting.",
        "So when you put your lantern out, you know, it's still sort of light.",
        "And then very quickly, it becomes dark.",
        "And then very quickly you're aware of the fact that there are hundreds of lanterns on the water and that hundreds of people are mourning their loved ones, you know, and that your loss is one of many, many losses.",
        "When I was really intensely depressed and disoriented, I would sit there and think, I just want this pain to shrink, I want it to get smaller.",
        "And what I learned was it wasn't really possible for me to miss my father less, but, kind of the world, the backdrop against which I missed him could be larger, which had the effect of making that pain feel less.",
        "And the only way to do that was to sort of open my heart up more and have more compassion for other people who had suffered similar losses.",
        "By the end of your book, Marie, you have come to an otherworldly landscape in Japan, it's called Mount Doom.",
        "And why don't you describe what it looks like and what Mount Doom is, what it represents?",
        "Mount Doom is considered one of Japan's most sacred places and it's in the very, very far north of Japan and it is an extinguished volcano.",
        "You're met with a really, really strong smell of sulfur, but it kind of signals that you're in another world.",
        "You know, you're smelling the inside of the earth.",
        "And there are these little pools of bubbling sulfuric hot water that come up in these strange rock formations.",
        "There aren't a lot of birds flying around.",
        "There's very little vegetation.",
        "So it's a very desolate, barren, dead landscape, but it's also eerily beautiful.",
        "And there's a river, Sanzu-no-Kawa, which runs from the lake down the mountain and out into the ocean, and this is considered sort of like the River Styx.",
        "And there are many stories about the souls of the dead seen walking along this river as they come to the top of Mount Doom and then pause - hence the title of my book \"\"When The Dead Pause\"\" - before they slip into the underworld.",
        "And so Mount Doom has become this place of pilgrimage where people who are mourning if they needed desperately to just go to that final spot where they could perhaps catch the person who they miss who has died and say goodbye one more time.",
        "There's something that you learn when you go to Mount Doom from the head priest that there who talks to you, and talks to you about you as a Westerner and how your need to know why things happen may not be really working, may not really help you.",
        "He was an extraordinary character, sort of severe and serious, who told me with great pride that his nickname when he had been in the monastery for 20 years was Darth Vader.",
        "(Laughter).",
        "I mean, and what do you do if someone tells you that their nickname is Darth Vader?",
        "That's what he said his name was.",
        "You listen.",
        "And - yes, I did, very intently.",
        "And I told him about my meditation training and I told him how irritated I was to have to sit there for three hours, how irritated I was because I had thought that if I wanted to understand anything about Buddhism and what Buddhism had to offer, I thought I was supposed to read sutras and texts and, you know, think, like what I did in college.",
        "And he said, oh, you Westerners.",
        "He said, you always want to know why you have to do something before you do it.",
        "And he said, in Japan we make you do something, and then you learn why afterward.",
        "He said, but sometimes you just need to do something and learn the lesson later - which is perhaps a healthier way to live because, of course you can't always know why you're doing what you're doing.",
        "Sometimes you simply have to go through an experience.",
        "When the priest told you that about that sort of having to shake off this need to know why, did it change how you were grieving for your father?"

        "I think so.",

        "He would always come to see me in my childhood room and I would have to tell him that he was dead.",
        "And he would look very disappointed and sorry that he had died and then he would go away.",

        "Now I have these dreams about him and he will occasionally show up, and it's always with some sort of very specific and important message.",
        "I had a really powerful one last summer where he showed up and he said, you need to be living your life a little bit differently than you are, this is not the way I want you to live your life.",
        "And I'm open to this idea that, you know, in however we can explain this, whether it's just a facet of my mind and he's, you know, I'm projecting this onto him when I sleep, that he is still present in a significant way.",
        "And if I pay attention to that, the things that I miss about him - his guidance and his wisdom - that's still in me.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Well of course laboratory tests would be able to detect the kind of chemicals that were contained in these vessels, but you don't have time to do that in a commercial airport where passengers expect a reasonable amount of time for check-in and security, but not spending hours waiting for the results of laboratory tests.",
        "So the solution which the British authorities have introduced seems to me to be logical and essential for public safety, given the seriousness of the threat, and that is simply to make it forbidden for passengers to carry in their hand baggage things which might contain these substances, which would be made into an improvised device onboard the aircraft.",
        "So all you can take, under the British regulations, is your travel documents in a transparent plastic bag, and if you have to take medicines en route, you can take as much medicine as is required, strictly for the time that is to elapse on the journey.",
        "You can't take other things on board.",
        "You have to put the other things in the hold luggage.",
        "The cabin has to be free of hand luggage.",
        "And it sounds like you're saying - and let me just for a moment remind our listeners that you are listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "And I just want to ask you one last question, and that is it sounds to me like you're saying this is a restriction that should be put in place for the long term, not just for the short term, not just -",
        "I believe this is necessary because the terrorists are sophisticated enough to know that this is a real vulnerability, and if they can get a step ahead of the aviation security system, they will exploit it, and the risk is that not just hundreds, but thousands of lives could be lost if they succeeded."

        "So it's very important that we adopt these measures.",
        "They may seem very draconian, particularly in your airports and our airports in the United Kingdom, because we're used to a very liberal amount of hand luggage being taken onboard, but if people get used to the fact that they have to pack all their stuff in hold luggage and that they will rely on the official catering provided on the airliner for refreshment, I think that they will get used to that.",
