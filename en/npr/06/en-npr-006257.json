        "Yeah, it was.",
        "My only number one hit, so far, was \"\"You've Got A Friend.\"\" And I've traveled around the world on that song and played it for audiences over and over again, and it never grows tired for me.",
        "It just is - I always make a connection with the tune, and I'm brought back to that moment at the Troubadour, when I stood outside the dressing room, which was on the balcony, and looked down at Carole playing her set on the stage below."

        "Yes, we are thinking about that, because we can feel that and it's just sort of one consciousness.",
        "But the thing that I continue to find astonishing - and increasingly so as this tour builds momentum - is the number of people for whom it was not the soundtrack of their lives.",

        "I think that live performance is, you know, music has become sort of - it's ubiquitous.",
        "You listen to it in the car.",
        "You listen to it on your iPod when you're on the treadmill.",
        "You listen to it in the frozen foods and in the doctor's waiting room.",
        "But when you go to a concert, that's time that you have put aside and focused on the music.",
        "And it really is a, you know, we joke and say, you know, to the audience, we're glad you came; it's not the same without you.",
        "But really, you know, it's like going to church for Carole and me.",
        "I mean, a lot of it is celebratory and some of it is, you know, irreverent and irrelevant.",
        "But it's very uplifting.",
