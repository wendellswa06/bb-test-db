        "And the latest polls suggest that the Zapatero government still enjoys the support of a majority of Spaniards.",
        "Nevertheless, the Pope is likely to continue to focus on Spain, not just because it was once Europe's strongest bastion of Catholicism, but also because Spain is seen as a role model for many societies in Latin America, where almost one-half of the world's 1.1 billion Catholics live.",
