        "So he still does face a court date in addition to a congressional swearing-in.",
        "He does, although, you know, you can be - you can face charges and still be in Congress.",

        "He did apologize in his election victory speech last night.",
        "He said, I made a mistake, and I'm sorry for it.",
        "And he apologized to the reporter.",
