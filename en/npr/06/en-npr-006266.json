        "Erickson says Irwin's point is that today's high natural gas prices make the project economic for the energy companies without the financial incentives and that the state would order those companies to produce or lose their leases.",
        "I think there's a good argument the state would be successful.",
        "You know, how you measure success, though, may be an issue here because suppose you're successful in court and 10 years from now you get your leases back, you still don't have a gas pipeline, which is probably the objective that everybody wants before that."
