        "Hi, Neal.",

        "Well, they've had a reasonable record of convicting rather minor players.",

        "They didn't actually do anything in the United States, but they were prosecuted for allegedly giving, quote, \"material support to terrorism.",

        "We're much less interested in prosecuting them.",
        "So there's been this, you know, from the public's point of view, there's been this strange dichotomy between, the big fish are sort of held somewhere and not prosecuted, and then there's a series of trials of people - Moussaoui was a good example of it - who was, in some way, you know, distant.",
        "He was in jail at the time of 9/11.",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "That's exactly right.",

        "Some of them were located in areas where checkpoints were going to be removed.",
        "Others were in areas where the checkpoints were not going to be removed.",
        "And once the checkpoints were actually removed, Canetti and her colleagues went back in, and they surveyed people in these areas once again.",
        "And the question is, are people feeling differently after the checkpoints were removed?",
        "Precisely.",
        "I reached Daphna Canetti on the phone in Israel, and she told me she was stunned at the difference removing the checkpoints made on the desire among Palestinians to make peace with Israel.",
        "In the places where checkpoints were removed, the local Palestinians expressed more support for negotiations for peace with Israel, way less support for violence, way less intention to participate in violent acts.",
        "Very different attitudes even though the overall Israeli-Palestinian situation has not changed.",
        "But let me ask you - she says people say they had less intent to commit violent acts.",
        "Did they actually commit fewer violent acts?",
        "Well, Canetti actually went back and she tracked all incidents of anti-Israel violence in the areas before and after the checkpoints were dismantled.",

        "We saw a decrease in the number of instances of Palestinian violence against Israelis in the places where checkpoints were removed.",

        "They don't like going through them.",
        "They don't like having them around.",

        "Isn't there some level on which that's kind of obvious?",
        "On one level, it is obvious, Steve.",
        "But it's important to remember, of course, that Israel placed the checkpoints in place.",
        "So in other words, Israel thought the checkpoints actually increased security.",
        "Canetti told me the checkpoints were tricky things because while they might make Israelis feel safer, they might actually be decreasing security.",

        "The message that we were trying to deliver was, hey, Israel, you have to take the risk.",

        "Wait a minute.",
        "So she's saying that at least in this instance having less security made Israelis more safe.",
        "It sounds paradoxical, Steve.",
        "But that's exactly what Canetti is finding.",
        "She also says that she's had conversations with the Israeli defense forces where they're really interested in this kind of research because Canetti thinks she's found not just the empirical finding that there's less violence, but the reason that there is less violence.",
        "The survey research tends to suggest that Palestinians respond with anger and violence not just because of the inconveniences of the checkpoint but because the checkpoints produce humiliation, and there's been a large body of scholarly work, Steve, that suggests that humiliation is often a big driver for anger and violence.",
