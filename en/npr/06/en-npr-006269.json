        "Good morning, David.",
        "Yes.",
        "President Bush said the other day, and some of the Justice Department people have talked about this, is that depending on what the Supreme Court does in the Hamdan case, you remember they have a case, right now, sort of testing the government's plans for military tribunals.",
        "If the Supreme Court were to uphold that system, I take it the government's view is that, well, now, maybe we could then possibly bring Khalid Shaikh Mohammad and some of these other people to Guantanamo and try them in a military tribunal.",
        "One of the oddities of the Moussaoui case, and, again, he confessed and his trial was a sentencing trial, whether he would get life in prison or the death penalty, but one of the witnesses against him, in an odd sort of way, was Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, who, his testimony was presented - a statement by him was presented, but he was not available to be cross-examined.",
        "I think everything regarding the Moussaoui case was an oddity.",
        "Remember he, at several times, would go to plead guilty to some conspiracy and then tell the judge, by the way, judge, I want you to know, I didn't really do the things I'm pleading guilty to today.",
        "But yes, I mean if I were a juror in the Moussaoui case, it would have been most odd to be sitting there, you're debating whether to send this guy to death for the 9/11 crime, and you're being read a 58-page statement by Khalid Shaikh Mohammad talking about how he masterminded the whole plan; he sold bin Laden on the whole plan; he planned, you know, where the planes were going to go; and, by the way, Moussaoui was sort of a non participant.",
        "We saw him as unreliable.",
        "Maybe he'd be in the second wave.",
        "So, yes, it was extremely odd to have the mastermind testifying sort of off-stage somewhere in a case involving a sort of wannabe who wasn't actually part of the 9/11 plot.",
        "Then there's the case of Jose Padilla, again, that's the right pronunciation.",
        "But Jose Padilla, who, when he was arrested, was alleged to have been involved in plots to set off a dirty bomb and blow up buildings in New York City.",
        "Yet, after a long legal wrangle - we've been through that before -but after a long legal wrangle he does get charged in civilian court, but with crimes that have nothing to do with those charges.",
        "Yes, and I think the only way to explain that is what we were talking about earlier.",
        "That is, once again, when the government saw somebody who they thought was important, they grabbed him, held him in secret, put him in a military brig; did not want to charge him with a crime; held him for three years…",
        "Did not want him to have a lawyer.",
        "Didn't want him to have a lawyer, didn't want to have anybody speak to him.",
        "Because there concern was, if there is this dirty bomb plot, we want to get the information.",
        "But having done that for three years, they basically made it impossible to then go back and prosecute him for this alleged dirty bomb plot, and now he's being tried on relatively minor - he will be tried on relatively minor terrorism charges down in Florida.",
        "So it's the same thing.",
        "The people who they think are important don't get prosecuted; the more minor figures do get prosecuted."

        "And if you think about all the mafia trials that we've become accustomed to reading about in the newspapers, or perhaps more accustomed to seeing on the television set, but anyway, it's always you get the little fish to get the big fish.",
        "This seems to be standing that on its head.",
        "Yes, at least so far.",
        "It's been the little fish and nothing more.",
        "You know, we don't know how this will play out with the people like Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, but it certainly looks like it's possible that they will never be prosecuted.",
        "At least, never be prosecuted in a standard civilian court in the United States.",
        "Conceivably, they could end up in one of these military tribunals, if they're legal, if they go ahead, if all of that happens.",
        "Yes, that's possible.",
        "And as we look at all of this, do we risk, in some senses, all the trials we've seen, again, of these relatively minor figures - and there have been also cases - the case in Florida where the defendant was acquitted of some charges, hung jury on others, hung jury on a case in Lodi, California - does that tend to somehow trivialize or de-legitimize some of these great allegations that have been against some of these terrible figures?",
        "Well, to the extent that John Ashcroft, for example, particularly tended to inflate all these cases - it was always that the government was disrupting a major terrorism cell, or breaking up some major plot; when, at the end of the day, you come up with fairly minor prosecutions, or people even being acquitted in fairly minor prosecutions.",
        "It leads you to wonder, well, wait a minute, what was going on here?",
        "Was there really a big terrorism plot in the first place?",
        "I suppose, to try to be fair to Ashcroft, is that early on, after 9/11, they really did think there were a lot of terrorism cells in the United States.",
        "Four years, five years into it, you really wonder whether there really were a lot of terrorists actually operating in the United States.",
        "And maybe that's why they don't have a lot of people to prosecute and try.",

        "And, Professor Cole, one of the things that people would immediately cite is, after the first World Trade Center bomb attack, back in 1993, the principal figures in that were arrested, were tried.",
        "Sure secrets were involved, sure it was tricky, but they were convicted, and they're doing time in prison.",
        "That's right, and I think what that shows is that you can try terrorists in civilian court with criminal charges.",
        "It's not easy, but you can do it.",
        "And we have done it.",
        "The Blind Sheikh is serving multiple, multiple life sentences for planning to -for conspiring to blow up tunnels and bridges around Manhattan.",
        "They didn't have to wait until the bridges and tunnels blew up, they brought charges on the basis of conspiracy.",
        "They convicted him and they put him away for life through a fair trial.",
        "I think what's important about that is that, if you do it through a fair trial, the world doesn't see it as illegitimate.",
        "We don't see massive protests about the fact that the Blind Sheikh is serving a life sentence without parole in the United States.",
        "We do see massive protests about what's happening at Guantanamo, what's happening in our CIA black sites and the like, where we are denying people any kind of process - any kind of fair process, whatsoever.",
        "And the difference, a lot of people would say, is, well, one was before 9/11, the rest are after.",
        "Well, that - many people would say that.",
        "But I think the rule of law applies both before and after - certainly ought to apply both before and after.",
        "And I think the rule of law gives the government quite broad leeway in how to respond to the threat of terror, which, unfortunately, our government has seen as a hindrance, as an obstacle.",
        "So, for example, we don't have to try all the al-Qaida terrorists in criminal proceedings.",
        "We can, under the laws of war, detain them.",
        "We can detain them for the duration of the conflict with al-Qaida.",

        "We have to treat them humanely once we hold them, and we can only hold them for the duration of the conflict with al-Qaida.",
        "What the administration has done is said, we're not going to abide by even those minimal restrictions.",
        "We're not going to give them any hearing, whatsoever, until the Supreme Court says you have to.",
        "We're not going to treat them humanely.",
        "Instead, we're going to subject them to the kinds of interrogation tactics that world sees as torture, even if Donald Rumsfeld doesn't.",

        "He said, until there are no longer any terrorist's organizations of global reach left in the world.",
