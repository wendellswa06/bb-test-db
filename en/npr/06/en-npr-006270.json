        "There's obviously the Anti-Torture Statute that was enacted by Congress that prohibits interrogation that's not only torturous, but inhumane, degrading, or cruel.",
        "So those are efforts, I think, that do bring the United States closer into international norms.",
        "And I think it's something to be applauded.",
        "Overall, I don't think there is any clear strategy between indefinitely detaining those who are involved in the war or trying them in criminal cases.",
        "Because, if you satisfy due process in the criminal cases, and you can, oftentimes, you must disclose intelligent sources and methods to give the defendant a fair trial.",
        "And as in the case of Theodore Hall in the stealing of the atomic secrets, it may not be worth the candle in order to do that.",
        "I think it is very clear that after 9/11, the whole idea that was attempted to be injected into the FBI is, you should no longer look at yourself as an organization that goes and captures the culprit after a crime is committed.",
        "You're primary goal is to prevent the crime at the outset…",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "…which means that's intelligence gathering and not so much concerned, as an organization, with prosecutions after the fact.",
        "That's a decision whether or not the criminal justice punishment adds something that's more important than just intelligence so that you can thwart crimes; is a decision that isn't like you could in geometry, people can disagree about the proportion you put on intelligence, as opposed to criminally punishing afterwards.",
        "Ted Hall, was allowed to emigrate, lived in Britain and worked for the rest of his life as a professor.",
        "He went (unintelligible) incommunicado, and aggressively questioned for the rest of his life.",
        "What about, as David Cole suggested, what about the rule of law?",
        "But that's different because he was not ever found to be an illegal combatant during war.",
        "If he were, then he could have been held indefinitely.",
        "The people at Guantanamo Bay, subject to the protections of the Graham Amendment to challenge the constitutionality of the Civilian Review Tribunal in Guantanamo Bay, have an opportunity to show they're not an illegal combatant, but under the law, the rule of law, if you are in that status, the governing power's entitled to detain you until the war ends, just like those Nazis that we captured and weren't' given trials, they were held until the war concluded.",
        "All right.",
        "Let's get some listeners involved in the conversation: 800-989-8255.",
        "And we'll begin with Mark(ph).",

        "I wanted to point out that Mr. Savage's suggestion that - and speculation about what the reasons for the government's behavior in this matters includes the second item, which you said was protection of secrets.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Well, the secrets are unspecified, but it seems to me that given the extreme secrecy that was enforced in even the penalty phase of the Moussaoui trial, is an indication of how desperate they are to protect an otherwise untenable position.",
        "Where, essentially, agents - that is Justice Department attorneys and potentially military prosecutors and attorneys - are prosecuting pawns: people who have been hired to carry out an overreaching policy of the United States.",
        "And, you know, they can't - the fiction that is presented to the public cannot stand the scrutiny of a trial with cross-examination.",
        "They'd do anything to prevent that from happening.",
        "David Cole, is that what you suspect?",
        "Well, I - you know, I think secrecy obviously has a role to play when you're in a military conflict.",
        "You have a legitimate interest in not telling the opponent everything you know about them.",
        "But I also think that there was a real - what really - where the rubber really hits the road, is that once you have subjected a person to water boarding as we have reportedly done with respect to Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, and presumably worse.",
        "Once you have disappeared someone for years, and at the time - which is what we've done to Khalid Shaikh Mohammad - you can't afford to bring him to any kind of public forum, because that forum will turn into a trial of the United States.",
        "And so the government fought like hell to keep Khalid Shaikh Mohammad out of the Zacarias Moussaoui trial.",
        "The issue there was that he had evidence that was exculpatory as to Moussaoui, it showed that he was a pawn, he wasn't, in fact, seriously involved or involved at all in 9/11.",
        "And the government wanted to go ahead and seek to execute Moussaoui without even allowing Mr. Mohammad to testify, whatsoever.",
        "So, you know, I think there, the desire for secrecy, which has led to secret detention centers, has led to secret torture policies, has led to thousands of secret arrests, both in the United States after 9/11 and at Guantanamo -there's some legitimate interest, but we've gone way overboard.",
        "And what we've done by employing these broad tactics, is we have undermined our credibility around the world.",

        "Over government objection.",
        "Yes, but there isn't any evidence that Moussaoui thought that Khalid would provide more favorable evidence if he was there and subject to cross-examination.",
        "Because Moussaoui was saying, I was a more prominent player.",
        "I deserve more culpability, because I was more at the center of the plot of 9/11 than Khalid was saying.",
        "But to go back to David's point, it is a matter of balance here between the need for secrecy and the need for fairness and due process.",
        "And the balance is different when you're holding someone as an illegal combatant during wartime, as opposed to criminally prosecuting them.",
        "And I think that's an enormous distinction to make…",
        "Mm-hmm.",

        "The World Court does not have automatic jurisdiction over international crimes.",
        "There's an International Criminal Court that was created, but we are not signatories to that.",
        "And moreover, even under that covenant, it's only if you are not prosecuting the crimes in an adequate way yourself, are you then required to submit a criminal defendant to the International Criminal Court."

        "David Cole, is that a realistic alternative?",
        "Well, it's not a realistic alternative under this administration, but that's part of the problem.",
        "The reason we're not willing to be a part of the International Criminal Court is we don't want to be held responsible.",
        "We don't want our people to be held responsible when they violate the laws of war and the like.",
        "And so it's all part of a pattern in which we are perceived around the world as not being willing to play by the rules that everybody else has to play by; whether they're international law, whether it's international criminal law, whether it's the laws of war.",
        "We've taken the position, we're not going to be subject to it.",

        "We're strong, we don't have to follow the rule of law.",
        "That, to me, is the biggest problem in the administration's approach to the war on terror and it is the biggest reason why we have gone from having the world's sympathy on 9/11 to a situation in which there's never been more - stronger anti-Americanism around the world than there is today.",
        "Jeff?",
        "Well, all I can say is Amen to that.",
        "All right, Jeff.",

        "It puzzles people that these people seem to be criminals who have committed criminal acts for which others have been tried in criminal court, Bruce Fein, and yet they're never - not likely to be tried at all.",
        "Well, that's because we're in this peculiar situation defining a new kind of war that's, in some sense, unprecedented, because we don't have a nation that we're fighting.",

        "And, the fact is, that if you're fighting a war, not being involved as a combatant is not a crime under international law.",
        "And the reason why they would never be subject to a trial is the same reason why we had many - hundreds of thousands of Japanese, Italian, Nazi prisoners in World War II, they were never subject to a trial, either.",
        "They were detained, no one knew whether detention would be five years, ten years, however the war was going to act.",
        "Suppose we didn't develop the atomic weapon.",

        "I think the - what's unique here is that we aren't really comfortable with defining what's going on as a war, although that's what we're doing; because our national security isn't at stake, we don't have a formal army that we're opposing, and that's why, I think, some of the thinking remains very tentative and I think a little bit disturbing.",
