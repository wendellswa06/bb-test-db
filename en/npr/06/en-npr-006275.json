        "Berger says that bad press equaling good sales applies to a lot more than just books.",

        "The market's reaction to the security breach was basically wait, there's a website that lets me cheat on my spouse?",
        "How come no one told me about that?",
        "Berger says, bad press has helped sales because there are two distinct things that happen when we read a bad review.",
        "Let's go back to the book example for this.",
        "The first thing that happens when we read that bad book review is that we become aware of the book at all.",
        "The second thing is that we learn that the reviewer thinks the book is bad.",

        "We don't always remember what we heard about a book.",
        "We may remember that we heard something, but we don't exactly remember what that something is.",
        "If we already know about the product or the author who's getting the bad press though, Berger says this whole awareness effect doesn't really help.",
        "If you're Stephen King, if you're John Grisham, you get a negative review in The New York Times, negative publicity hurts.",
        "Also, Berger says there are some products that bad publicity will definitely not help you solve.",
        "So if someone says, you know, hey, this car seat is defective or, you know, hey, eat at this restaurant and one 1 of 2 people will get a major intestinal disorder, you know, that'll be bad for you.",

        "We tend to focus on kids who weren't going to go to college and now can go to college.",
        "The reality of the impact is much more complex than that.",
        "Students are able to choose different colleges.",
        "We see this trading-up phenomenon.",
        "We sometimes see - I hate to call it trading down - but we see a shift in college preferences because of the requirement that you attend a public, in-state institution.",
        "But, you know, that's quite good for the state, that more of our top students are being driven to public, in-state institutions.",
        "But we also see a great deal of freedom that students are experiencing in being able to follow their passion, and, most importantly, graduating with either no or very low levels of debt.",
        "And that opens up a huge range of possibilities.",
        "It opens up the possibility of graduate school for a lot of students.",

        "Back when I was going to school, before the promise was announced, teachers weren't really asking, well, what school are you going to after graduation, or, you know, what are you going to major in?",
        "It was, what are your plans after graduation?",
        "Whereas now, it's teachers telling you, like, hey, what school are you going to?",
        "So it completely just changed the mindset that I think a lot of our administrators have, our educators and our kids have in our community.",
        "And I would add that...",
        "Go ahead, Michelle.",
        "That's even happening at the elementary school level.",
        "I have a daughter who's been in Kalamazoo Public Schools elementary school for about five years.",

        "The reality is that if you have things going on in your life, either academically or more importantly in your home life, that are keeping you from being successful in school, that have kept you from being with your grade level in terms of your achievement levels, the Kalamazoo Promise does not change those things.",
        "It doesn't take away a precarious home life or insecure housing or lack of access to food or really poor support in the home for your learning.",
        "But also, you know, particularly around the issue of dropping out, the data show that you can predict whether a student is going to drop out or not really quite early.",
        "It has to do with things that happen earlier in your academic career than, you know, what happens to hit in ninth grade or when you turn 16 and can drop out.",

        "In my opinion, it has completely just changed just the outlook of a lot of kids in our community, and it really teaches the kids about paying stuff forward, just doing the right thing and, you know, coming back and doing things for the community because it's the right thing to do.",
        "And I think it kind of just lets all the kids know, too, that there's somebody out here that thinks that I'm worthy of having this education, regardless of my family situation, what class we are.",
        "The stipulations for the Promise are not, you have to have a 3.5 GPA and all these extracurricular activities.",
        "And you have to just have, you know, the willpower to do it, and that's pretty much it.",
        "And I just think that that's an amazing blessing that somebody or a group of people put that much faith in this community.",
        "It's just a complete blessing.",
