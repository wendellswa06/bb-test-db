        "O'Brien's not a grand plot maker, but the lyrical turnings of her quest for truth and the deftness of her sentence-making and the clinical eye she turns on the customs and values of the country that gave birth to her harks back to James Joyce, modern Ireland's old artificer, and makes O'Brien the modern bard of the country she bitterly names as a land of shame, a land of murder and a land of sacrificial women.",
