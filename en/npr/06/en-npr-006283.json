        "I did a book about presidential golf called \"\"First Off The Tee.\"\" And I wrote a biography of Babe Didrikson.",
        "And so I was kind of a frustrated sports writer and always sort of dreamed, since I was a kid, of writing about sports and never had the opportunity to do so either at The Times or at the Miami Herald.",
        "Yet even in scratching that childhood itch, the adult Van Natta told ESPN executives his approach would not change.",
        "We had lengthy conversations about the journalism at ESPN and what kind of investigative reporting they wanted to do.",
        "They had great aspirations for doing hard looks at every aspect of sports, including leagues that they're in partnership with.",
