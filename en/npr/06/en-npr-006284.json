        "A couple years ago, he gave two groups of people a questionnaire that included some very sensitive questions, like have your tried cocaine.",
        "He told both groups they didn't have to answer anything that made them uncomfortable.",

        "At the top it had a box that said: Check here if we can use your answers in our research.",
        "And what happened, after we added the check box, was that that particular group became twice, almost twice more likely to actually not just check the box, but answer the more sensitive questions.",
