        "You know, I spend months leading up to South by Southwest trying to listen to all the bands that are playing and I got through about 1,500.",

        "So, Mother Falcon is - they're from Austin and there are 17 members.",
        "So, it's basically a sort of rock orchestra almost.",
        "Not with necessarily an orchestral vibe, but this big joyous, just - there are waves of joy are sort of emanating off this band.",
        "And so I like to look for bands that are going to do something live that they can't do on record.",
        "And is there a little bit of a trend with that?",
        "I mean, are we seeing smaller bands who are aspiring to a bigger sound?",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "I mean, I think if you're looking for prevailing trends, I think a few years ago, a lot of independent music was very inward facing.",
        "And I think now with the success of a lot of bands like Arcade Fire or even, like, even almost like a Mumford and Sons, there's this very big outward facing, stompy, clappy, bigger, brasher sound.",
        "You got a rock band, you better throw in some horns, better throw in some strings and split the money eight ways instead of four.",
        "Now, does the band The Soil and the Sun fall in that category?",
        "They are another one of your picks.",
        "Yeah, The Soil and the Sun is four men and four women and they have an album out called \"\"What Wonder Is This Universe.\"\" And, you know, I spend a lot of time listening to a lot of sad music and I'm a mopey music aficionado.",
        "But when you have a band that is that celebratory surrounding sort of life and existence, I've got a soft spot for that.",
        "And, you know, when you're seeing live music, if you can actually be uplifted, there is never anything wrong with that.",

        "It's not the first option I'm thinking about, but I've already talked to my city manager about it.",
        "One problem we would have here is to calculate the damage because I believe the damage is incalculable and it's going to ripple into the future, because it will cost us convention business and people will be a little gun shy about coming back in here if they think this could happen again.",
        "And, of course, my message is it couldn't happen again.",
        "But how do you convince people that the water supply is, in fact, safe?",
        "People want to drink water and people want to bathe in it.",
