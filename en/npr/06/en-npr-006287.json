        "billionaire Paul Singer.",
        "And (unintelligible) Capitol is another large one of these funds and these are companies that hold these defaulted bonds and they have strategically decided to pursue Argentina for full compensation on these bonds and rejected a pair of offers that Argentina has made to bond holders for discounted credit swaps.",
        "The vast majority of the people who held Argentina's defaulted bonds accepted those deals, about 93 percent, but about 7 percent of the bonds were not tendered and a large share of those are in the hands of these funds that are pursuing full compensation.",
        "Overall, Shane, how much money are we talking about?",
        "What's the scale of the default by Argentina?",
        "Well, the default in 2001 was on about - close to $100 billion worth of bonds.",
        "These hedge funds have received awards from U.S.",
        "courts for 1.6 billion.",
        "Argentina has steadfastly refused to pay up and is fighting this in every way it can and so the hedge funds on the other side are trying every way they can to try and actually collect on some of this.",
        "And the fear is that these funds would take this opportunity to seize the plane to get compensation.",
        "Not a baseless fear, it sounds like.",
        "There was an Argentine Naval ship that was seized in Ghana last year for just these reasons, right?",
        "Yes, exactly.",
        "For two and a half months, the ship was held in the Ghanaian port of Tema after NML Capital convinced a judge to seize the ship there.",
        "So, Argentina appealed that and appealed to a U.N.",
        "tribunal and the U.N.",
        "tribunal came down on Argentina's side saying that the ship couldn't be held to satisfy these kind of debts and the ship was released.",
        "And the ship is now back home?",
        "The ship is back home.",
        "It arrived on Wednesday to a big celebration with the president and military and government officials and fireworks.",
        "Shane, has President Fernandez flown charter before for just this reason?",
        "Yeah, well, there's been attempts to seize the Tango before and then the government has contracted a plane from this company before in 2010 and 2011 for trips to Guyana and Europe."

        "Is this all a point of national pride in Argentina somehow, that, yes, the president will fly charter to keep the official presidential plane from being seized?",
        "The fight with the hedge funds and her calling them the vulture funds and their commitments to not pay these companies, this is definitely an issue of national pride.",
        "I think that renting this plane is just to avoid - it would be a terrible embarrassment if the president was on a trip and in the middle of this trip, had the plane seized and she's left to scramble and try and find an alternative to get out of whichever country she's in.",
        "So I think they're just being - coming on the heels of the ship seizure, I think they're being a bit practical, saying let's not take a chance with this.",

        "Hello.",
        "What does this policy mean for people seeking a green card or a visa?",
        "It's a game changer, I would say, because, ultimately, what's happening here is that in the past, as you mentioned, if there were certain little things that were omitted or maybe certain little things that were not correct according to them, you were given an opportunity to fix them.",
        "But now the issue is that everybody's afraid that if, for some reason, the application is not perfect in the eyes of the examiner, then it's going to mean denial, and it's going to really throw their lives into a tailspin.",
        "Are small errors common on applications?",
        "Shouldn't your clients and you, their lawyers, submit scrupulous applications that are correct?",
        "Yes, we do submit them, but, sometimes, there is a lot of subjectivity in terms of what may be considered to be something that's minor not by - in the eyes of the officer."

        "For WomenonBusiness.com, I wrote a piece - basically everyone was talking online about how this mandate was such a step back for parents, for work-life home balance; but for me, what really made me annoyed about the mandate was that it was a blanket mandate, that it applied to everyone.",

        "Well, I think we've all worked at a company where you've had a boss who, one employee is doing something - maybe one employee is coming in late all the time.",
        "So the boss sends out an email basically reprimanding everyone, and reminding everyone of the policy and possibly creating a time clock - now, everyone needs to punch the time clock - when really, it's only one or two people who are ruining it.",
        "So for me, when you lay down blanket mandates instead of identifying the problem and dealing with the problem on an individual basis, or figuring out who is taking advantage of the telecommuting policy and restricting those people from telecommuting versus the people who actually are more productive when they telecommute."
