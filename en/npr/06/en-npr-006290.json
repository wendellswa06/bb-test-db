        "As I mentioned earlier, Guy Raz is away this week, but he's left us a few good stories, including this one about a one-time political foe of Abraham Lincoln who became one of his greatest allies.",
        "The race for the Republican nomination of 1860 was quite possibly the greatest political contest in American history: Abraham Lincoln versus Salmon Chase versus William Seward.",
        "It's the accepted wisdom in the early 1860s that Seward would get the nomination.",
        "That's Walter Stahr.",
        "He's the author of a new biography on William Seward.",
        "It's called \"\"Seward: Lincoln's Indispensable Man.\"\" And in his book, Stahr describes how a man who was Lincoln's fiercest and most critical opponent eventually became his most loyal and trusted adviser.",
        "And it's bad policy - well, they argue that we need everybody in the building to cross-fertilize with each other.",
        "It's going to help innovation and, well, Yahoo needs some innovation.",
        "Well, I'd argue two points on that.",
        "First of all, I don't think innovation is necessarily Yahoo's biggest problem.",
        "I think it's lack of focus.",
        "And secondly, I'd say, does anyone really think that by having everyone physically in the office it's going to turn Yahoo around?",
        "If that's what they're hedging their bets on, then Yahoo is in more trouble.",
        "And I'm a cheerleader for Yahoo; I want them to succeed.",
        "But blanket mandates that say that everyone needs to be in the office every day?",
        "That's not what's going to turn the company around.",
        "There have been some who have speculated online that in fact, this is a back-handed way of cutting staff without announcing a staff cut.",
        "Well, I think there's probably a lot of accuracy to that.",
        "I think that oftentimes, instead of firing people or letting people go, I think we see in corporate America all the time - because let's face it, it's hard to fire people in corporate America.",
        "There are all kinds of HR hoops you have to go through to get someone fired.",
        "So instead, you make their life miserable and try to force them out.",
        "So yeah, I do think that there's some truth to that.",
        "But I also think that Marissa Mayer needed to make a big, bold move.",
        "And I'm sure this wasn't just her idea.",
        "I'm sure that there were other powers-that-be who were involved in this decision.",
        "But it's a big, bold move, and it's getting a lot of backlash."

        "We want to hear from managers and employers today.",
        "How does telecommunicating work out for you and your workers - 800-989-8255; email us, talk@npr.org.",
        "And we'll start with Ray, and Ray's on the line with us from Cupertino, California.",
        "Hi, thanks a lot.",
        "I think the move that Yahoo is making here actually makes a lot of sense for who Yahoo is, in terms of the company.",
        "And it has a lot to do with the culture.",
        "A lot of times, what happened was - you know, when Yahoo was starting, you had a lot of 20-, a lot of 30-year-olds that came, and everybody knew each other.",
        "People were working there from, you know, 7 in the morning, coming home late at night, and they built those bonds.",
        "But 10 years out, 20 years out, they don't have that ability to have that same kind of interaction.",
        "And when you're competing against Facebook and Apple and everybody - and Google - and when they're busing their people in from the city, they're busing people into all the facilities, to have those kind of conversations, to have that - and spur that kind of creativity.",
        "It's something you need.",
        "And I see that even though I run a firm where we have 25 people that are, you know, disparate.",
        "We're a complete virtual firm.",
        "But at this point in time, when we look at Yahoo - I mean culturally, they don't want to become Sun, or they don't want to become HP; where folks do telecommuting but don't even have time to come to work because they're too busy doing something else besides doing work.",
        "And it can become an endemic problem.",
        "And so you how do you manage that problem, if you manage telecommuters?",
        "Well, you have to build in those interaction points, right?",
        "You try to create collaboration tools.",
        "You try to use - you know, things such as tweets and chats and social tools, to bring people together.",
        "But you still need that personal time when you need to work on ideas and products.",
        "Now, someone who talked about this earlier - like, if you're in sales, or if you're in customer service; I mean, areas where you're performing - I mean, the problem with the move is that it's completely blanket move, across the board.",
        "It doesn't take an account for individual actions.",
        "But it also underlines the seriousness, in terms of the culture at Yahoo.",
        "And I can see why she's doing that.",
        "So they needed to make a statement, that bold part that Susan Gunelis was talking about.",
        "Exactly.",
        "All right.",
        "It's bold, so - but it could lead - you will lose people.",

        "Thank you.",

        "Nice to have you back on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "Great to be back.",
        "And Yahoo made this decision and defended it today in public, in the name of increasing creativity.",
        "Do they have a point?",
        "Yeah, they do.",
        "I mean, so in our work, we actually collect hard data on communication patterns - how people talk face to face but also, how people talk digitally.",
        "And we relate that to how productive they are, how happy they are, how creative they are.",
        "And the key thing is that - you know, we have a myth, I think especially in this country, that the most productive time of the day is when you sit at your computer and don't talk to anybody.",
        "But actually, especially in fields like software development, they're incredibly collaborative fields.",
        "And it's something where, you know, if your code, the thing you're working on, depends on a lot of other people's code, and if you don't talk to those people, the probability that a bug will pop up is extremely high.",
        "It's about 12 times higher.",
        "And we've been able to show, even in software teams when you have remote workers, they're about - again, 8 percent less likely to communicate about those things, and it takes them about 32 percent longer to complete code; not to mention all the social aspects that you get by being in the same place as other people, by having a shared culture, by trusting other people, by being able to support them if they have trouble at home or at work.",
        "Now that said, there's a big difference between, you know, a couple times a month telecommuting into the office because you've got things to do at home, and every day of the year never seeing the people you work with.",
        "And I think we're sort of conflating those two issues.",
        "So there are basically two - broadly speaking, two types of telecommuters.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I mean, there's people who - again, occasionally; maybe, you know, once a week or so, you know, for various reasons, need to come in - um, you know, need to stay home.",

        "And I think that's a culture that we need to move away from, and that's what puts us back in these situations, that kind of thinking where you do - you have to be required to work a massive amount of hours to demonstrate that you're a hard worker, and that you are putting in your 100 percent.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And it's - and the data is pretty convincing that that is an effective way to work because listen, if you've got very stressful things going on in your life, you're obviously not going to be that effective at work.",
        "But, you know, on the other hand, if you never talk to the people face to face that you work with - I mean, the data shows very convincingly that just the communication tools we have today, as your previous caller was talking about, really just aren't enough to get it done.",
        "There are also - you mentioned particularly in software, creative fields - Yahoo is a big company.",
        "They've got - sure - a lot of software developers.",
        "They've got a lot of accountants, too.",
        "Is this a wise policy to say across the board, \"\"You guys can't telecommute, either\"\"?",
        "Well, I think an important point - so you know, again, there's obviously - I think just saying no one can ever telecommute in, is probably the wrong decision.",
        "But, you know, really important point is, we've even worked in places such as call centers, which are traditionally really thought of as places where face-to-face communication doesn't matter.",
        "And if you look at what actually makes people effective, still the biggest predictor is face-to-face communication.",
        "And so, you know, maybe for certain roles, it's certainly going to be easier to telecommute, and maybe it's easier to do that more, maybe, in certain fields - again, when you get to sort of this idea that managers and people themselves can understand what - sort of the tradeoffs are, you know.",
        "But I think having a general policy, which might not be - match up exactly with what Yahoo did, but this idea that you need to be in the office as much as possible, is probably - is just, the data shows, that that is sort of the correct approach.",
        "Let's get another caller in.",
        "This is Martin(ph), Martin calling us from Santa Clara, California.",
        "Hey, yeah.",
        "Thanks for taking my call.",
        "I work - currently work for a company that's got a global organization that many work remote as well as come into the office.",
        "But I can tell you that in all my experience - I've been managing remote environments since like, 1988 - and the most difficult part is there is no single metric for measuring an individual's performance.",
        "There are people that are good at it - you know, managing their life and work from home - and there are people that are not good at it.",
        "And so the lack of that, you know, can cause, you know, executive management to decide hey, we need to pull everyone in.",
        "But there is an aspect that you haven't talked about; which is, in my belief, that seeing people face to face offers more than just the communication - which is what everyone is saying; hey - you know - we can communicate the same way.",
        "But you can't.",
        "You can see facial inflections.",
        "You can see mood changes.",
        "You know, you can get the feel of a room when you're discussing, you know, projects and topics and maybe campaigns, things like that; that are completely missing that, you know, that you don't get on the phone.",
        "And video conferencing doesn't solve that.",
        "I know that might be an argument, but I've worked in this a long, long time.",
        "And I find that there are just, plain, people that are good at it and those that aren't.",
        "Susan Gunelis, I wonder if you wanted to respond to what Martin had to say.",
        "Sure.",
        "I think that it goes back to what's being said again and again, by all of our callers - is that some people are capable of self-managing and can be far more productive working remotely, while others cannot.",
        "And it's up to leadership to be able to identify the employees that can be more productive, and more effective, when they're working from home.",
        "But blanket policies that say no one can ever telecommute - is losing opportunities to enable some employees who do work better in that environment, to be able to work remotely.",
        "And that's not to say that they should never, ever come into the office.",
        "Certainly, there needs to be that flexibility; when they need to physically be in the office, they need to be able to come in.",
        "But at the same time, if they're never allowed to telecommute - and that could be something that's very important to some very, very talented people - you could be losing excellent talent because of your restrictions."
