        "I'm Alex Chadwick.",
        "Well, I think it's not even just women because these days, there are men and women who need the flexibility, whether it be to drop their kids off at school or pick their kids up after school; who can do that during the time that, say, perhaps someone in the office would be taking their lunch hour.",
        "And you can work it into your schedule.",
        "So I think it's not just women, although women certainly are the ones still, unfortunately, who are assumed to be doing more of those familial tasks.",
        "But we live in a time when one parent working - just isn't the way that the world works anymore.",
        "And to have work-life balance - and unfortunately, most of us don't have the salaries that Marissa Mayer has; and we can't afford day care and nannies, and all these kinds of things.",
        "We need to be able to get our children as well, from wherever it is that they are, and be able to watch them.",
        "So telecommuting offers that flexibility of your schedule.",
        "No one says these days, you need to be working from 9 to 5.",
        "Businesses work 24/7, and that there are many jobs - social media marketing, for example - when you should be online and working at various hours of the day, not necessarily just 9 to 5.",
        "So flexibility in scheduling, and remote working opportunities, is really just a smart move to make.",
        "And Ben Waber, other people say particularly in a high-tech industry, this may be a short-sighted policy.",
        "Well, so there's certainly some issues.",
        "I mean, certainly for the Yahoo employees who joined assuming that they could work remotely all the time, I mean, they got a raw deal.",
        "But you know, it's something where we think of productivity - right?",
        "- and we think of, you know, as the caller who just called in said, we think of productivity as, again, sitting in front of the computer and banging out emails, scheduling things; and that's what makes us productive.",
        "But it's not.",
        "This idea that your interactions with other people - you know, you give them new ideas, you get new ideas from them; and that if you even make five people a little bit more productive every day, those conversations are worth it.",
        "And that's sort of some of the things that we've been working on.",
        "And this idea that, you know, listen, it - you know, for a certain type of people, they're going to need to make - there's sort of a lifestyle decision in terms of, you know, where do you live and what sort of job do you want to work in.",
        "But we're really doing a disservice, particularly for people who are, again, I think making this a women's issue.",
        "You know, as Susan said, it's a parents' issue because you're making these parents, you know, less productive if you're sort of saying, listen, you've got to - you know, we're going to offer you this way to work from home all the time and as a consequence, when you make it, you know, a women's issue, you're sort of, you know, skipping over the real egalitarian issue; that men need to take more responsibility for dropping off their kids, for raising their kids, and doing all that stuff.",

        "Well, I manage about 20 full-, part-time and vendor groups in a team, for a higher-education consulting business.",
        "I'm actually driving home from the airport, from a client visit this week - and spending the rest of my week telecommuting; meeting with my team, using things like GoToMeeting and conference lines, occasionally Skype or Google Plus as well.",
        "And I have to tell you, I cannot imagine another way to go.",
        "I am so grateful to my company for allowing me to do this.",
        "And frankly, on the family side, it has meant for my husband and I that our children did not have to go to day care.",
        "We made arrangements so that his schedule fit with mine when I was working from home.",
        "We brought a babysitter in when we needed to cover work hours.",
        "And so they're all in school now full time but until that point, they did not have to leave the home to go to day care.",
        "And that made a significant impact, and I think a great benefit to my family, to my own mental sanity; having to leave them for airline trips, on a weekly basis - also brought me a lot of great comfort, that I knew that they weren't having that extra stress.",
        "Was there a downside?",
        "I think that the only downside that I experienced personally - and I think it's my personality - is work-life balance in that my work is with me at home almost all the time.",
        "And so if I have a free moment on the weekends, you might find me curled up with the iPad, checking email or sending notes to colleagues through our project-management system.",
        "And some folks might find that a little annoying or disturbing, from time to time, but I do try and keep it in check when I can.",
        "We, of course, are cheered by the fact that you also use whatever commuting time you do have to do, to listen to the radio.",
        "Without a doubt.",
        "You're always on.",
        "Thank you very much, Stephanie; appreciate the phone call.",
        "And I wanted to ask you, Susan Gunelis, as you look at this issue, some hoped that by coming over to Google from her previous - excuse me, coming over to Yahoo from her previous job at Google, that Ms. Mayer would be a role model, a pioneer there; and instead - that this might be a little bit retrograde.",
        "I think it's ironic that Google has employees that telecommute, and so I think that that's interesting.",
        "But I think that your previous caller actually made a really good point about how the - one potential downside is that she ends up working all the time because the right people telecommuting - the workaholics, the type-A personalities, the people who truly self-manage and truly are passionate about their work, and really love what they do - they will put in more hours when they have access to the tools to do their jobs, at their fingertips every day of the week.",
        "So again, it goes back to the right people telecommuting, who can self-manage.",
        "And as the previous caller mentioned, it creates extreme loyalty from an employee, which is something that - money can't buy that kind of loyalty.",
        "But the cost savings to Yahoo as well, for a lot of people to telecommute, is huge.",
        "And changing from that policy - research show a typical business saves $11,000 per person, per year, who telecommutes.",
        "And workers save between $2,000 and $7,000 a year.",
        "And then on top of that, you think about the amount of oil.",
        "Research shows our oil savings would equate to over 37 percent of American imports from the Persian Gulf, if every person who could telecommute did so.",
        "So you look at all these different, far-reaching effects, and it's hard to justify not allowing anyone to telecommute."

        "(Soundbite of laughter)",

        "These important social interactions have a very measurable effect, and it's something that more than pays for - again, all the space, all the desks that people have.",
        "And companies are essentially asking the wrong question.",
        "They're looking at, you know, their physical footprint, and they're saying: How can I slice 10 percent out of that small part of the budget?",
        "What they should be asking is - saying, how can I, you know, make an environment - some of this is digital, some of this is physical - but how can I make an environment where my employees can be as effective as possible?",
        "And that very well could mean - and a lot of times, does mean - spending more money on space, but that if you can see how that space translates into increased performance and increased productivity, then that's when you understand, how can I make these trade-offs between - again, for some people working from home more, and for a lot of these more creative teams where, again, these interactions are important - how can I get them to come in?",

        "It reflect a bricks-and-mortar mindset in an increasingly cyber world.",
        "How depressing this edict comes from a female CEO, albeit a seemingly bionic one.",
        "You have to worry whether this is Mayer demonstrating that she is as tough, or as boneheaded as any guy.",
        "This, from Maureen Dowd in The New York Times: Mayer has shown she is willing to do what it takes, with no coddling.",
        "She has a huge challenge in turning around Yahoo.",
        "She was the third of three CEOs at the company in 2012 alone.",
        "She had success brainstorming face-to-face during her years at Google, where she was the 20th employee, the first female engineer, and the shepherd of more than 100 products.",
        "The Times' Laura Holson wrote that when meeting with Google subordinates: Mayer came across like a meticulous art teacher correcting first-semester students.",
        "Mayer's bold move looks retro and politically incorrect, but she may feel the need to reboot the company culture, harness creativity, cut deadwood and discipline slackers, before resuming flexibility."
