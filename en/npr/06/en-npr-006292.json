        "But was there any way to adequately prepare for her record high floodwaters that inundated New York's subway and traffic tunnels, paralyzing the city, or the indescribable damage to the New Jersey and Connecticut coastlines that literally wiped out parts of the real estate, wiped them right off the map?",
        "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo may have summed it up best.",
        "It seems like we have a 100-year flood every two years, he said, and we're going to have to deal with it.",
        "This hour we'll talk about how we're going to deal with it, the inevitable rise of the oceans due to climate change and the disasters of the future.",

        "And has Sandy put global warming and climate change on the political map?",
        "In a surprise move, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed President Obama this week, citing his belief in climate change.",
        "Is the mayor's move enough to make climate change an election issue it has not been so far?",

        "We're just a couple days from election day.",
        "So there's really no opportunity to change the dynamic of the race or really even change the conversation at this point.",
        "But I do think it is sort of potentially a breakthrough moment, especially if President Obama does end up winning.",
        "If he ends up losing, I suppose it will be a breakthrough moment in a different way, and that is that someone has in my either recollection for the first time a major political figure come and out and said this is why - I am doing this because of climate change, that my position is based on the president's positions on climate change.",
        "It's interesting that just I think a day or two before, I quoted Governor Cuomo as saying that this is something we really - you know, this is serious and a major politician also, this is serious, and we have to deal with it.",
        "Yeah, that was another very interesting moment.",
        "I got that emailed to me, you know, within 30 seconds of his saying that by several people.",
        "I think that was another very important moment, though I think, you know, New York officials have - Mayor Bloomberg has had a panel out there for years looking at the effects of climate change on the cities.",
        "So it's not the first time that New York city or New York state officials have said - and New York state has had a panel looking on potential climate impacts on the state.",
        "So these - and they've testified in front of Congress on all this.",
        "So New York officials have, you know, been pretty straightforward about this.",
        "But I think in a national context, especially in a race where this has been so pointedly ignored for the whole race, it's a significant development.",
        "Do you - yeah, looking forward after this, no matter who wins, do you think because of the Midwest droughts, the extreme weather, go and name other kinds of things that have happened over the past year or so, do you think this will become part of the dialogue?",
        "Well, I unfortunately do not have a crystal ball.",
        "The only thing that I can tell you and that scientists have been warning us, you know, for 30, 40, 50 years is that these things are going to happen, and we are seeing them in a sort of accelerating - things are happening even faster than many of the models predicted.",
        "That's fast.",
        "Gas that may build up in a mine and a famous Allen.",
        "And we'll certainly see more challenges.",
        "Many Republican governors have decided not to opt in to the state exchanges or not to set up the state exchanges, which raises some questions about how the whole thing will work.",
        "So the health care law is not yet out of the woods, even though the Supreme Court, to most people's surprise, said that it was OK constitutionally."

        "You know, Walker survived because a lot of people who opposed what he did thought that even so, it was a little much to recall a governor, that he had won fair and square and that he was the governor and that that was maybe a little bit of an overreaction.",
        "I was most struck by that poll after the vote that I think 17 percent of people who voted to retain him opposed his move against the unions.",
        "The future ramification, I think, is for unions and for public employee unions, they did put up a pretty strong fight.",
        "They didn't have a great alternative candidate, but they'll have to work harder if they try something like that again, but they'll have to pursue other avenues such as in Ohio where voters voted down Governor Kasich's similar move against unions.",
        "Michael Tomasky, last year saw a number of horrific shootings.",
        "Aurora, Colorado, is just leaping to mind right now: 12 dead, scores injured.",
        "And, of course, the Newtown mass killing.",
        "What effect do you think these shootings are likely to have on the gun control debate?",
        "I think that they will and have already increased the percentages of some Americans who want some kind of action, want some kind of limitations imposed on assault weapons, perhaps on ammunition, background checks, those kinds of steps.",

        "What about gay marriage?",
        "Would you say that 2012 was the year that gay marriage turned the corner?",
        "Our polls show that most Americans - the vast majority, really - support it.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "I think that was a real watershed.",
        "And I'd say even more broadly that the election itself represented a real cultural shift in the country.",
        "Almost as if a switch was flipped.",
        "A lot of people assume Democrats and Republicans alike that 2008 was a bit of a one-off and that Obama couldn't really reassemble that coalition again in 2012.",
        "But he did, and it made itself felt not only in Obama's win, but in measures like the same-sex marriage measures in Maryland, where I live, and two other states and in those marijuana legalization referenda in Colorado and Washington.",
        "Would you say, when you look back at this year, and where we are now on the precipice of the fiscal cliff, that the country worked things out or at least voted on social issues.",
        "But that when it comes to the actual business and machinations and government, particularly at the federal level, we're really stuck."

        "And that 30 or 35 percent is frankly overrepresented in the halls of Congress where there are very, very few moderate Republicans.",
        "And most of the Republicans in the House and Senate are terrified of having a primary challenge from their right.",
        "And that governs a lot of their behavior here in this fiscal cliff negotiation.",
