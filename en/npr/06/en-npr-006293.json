        "That's - Elizabeth Kolbert is a staff writer for the New Yorker, and she was joining us by phone.",
        "I'd like to bring up our next guest and talk about our next topic, which is rebuilding, rethinking, re-engineering the city's infrastructure for rising sea levels and the storms of the future.",
        "Can we keep people safe, avoid gas shortages like the kinds we're seeing today, blackouts, crippled transport networks?",
        "Or do we just have to deal with it?",
        "Let me introduce my guest.",
        "Radley Horton is associate research scientist at Columbia University's Earth Institute.",
        "He's also a climatologist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, and he served as the climate science lead for the NYC Panel on Climate Change.",
        "He joins us by phone today.",
        "Welcome to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Dr. Horton.",
        "Thank you, it's great to be here.",

        "Andy Revkin has been writing about global warming since the '80s and nowadays writes the Dot Earth Blog for the New York Times.",
        "Welcome back to SCIENCE FRIDAY, Andy.",
        "Good to be with you.",
        "Let me ask you, Radley.",
        "As Elizabeth Kolbert said that Mayor Bloomberg had been watching this for years as part of New York City's study of climate change.",
        "Were you surprised by him coming out yesterday?",
        "I think his statement is very much in line with the perspective we saw going all the way back to 2008.",
        "The mayor showed leadership in addressing climate hazards and climate change and forming a taskforce comprised of agencies, private-sector companies and really beginning to look at the vulnerabilities, the climate hazards and develop strategies to reduce that vulnerability.",
        "Now, you served on the New York City Panel on Climate Change, and I know that Columbia, Lamont-Doherty, all the folks up there have been doing a lot of predictions I remember going back 10 years or more now about what New York would look like if climate change were real, and global warming, and the seas were rising.",
        "And you made - and if I remember reading your reports years ago, your first prediction was that the New York subways would be flooding.",
        "That's right.",
        "I mean, we've known that New York City has large vulnerabilities, being a densely populated coastal city with a lot of its infrastructure right along that coast: transportation, electrical systems, communication."

        "We've known there's this big vulnerability, and New York City is trying to take steps, I'd say, to reduce that vulnerability.",
        "So this was not surprises, the power outages, the flooded tunnels, things like that?",
        "I would say that the extent of the flooding was a surprise.",
        "And to give one example, we had a setup really where the timing where the surge, the amount of water pushed forward by the wind in the storm, really coincided so that we had the peak of the surge at almost precisely the same time that we had the natural high tide.",
        "That made the flooding worse.",
        "It made the extent of the impacts worse.",
        "But these are the type of impacts that I think, you know, coastal cities in general do face.",
        "Andy Revkin, you've talking about how it doesn't really matter whether climate change contributed to the storm because the damage to our cities is still our fault, and we need to deal with that.",
        "Well, what I was saying was that, you know, you can - there's been a lot of people fighting about was this global warming or not global warming, but that debate is a side note when you realize that the - again, as I was saying, the destruction here is our fault in the sense that we make choices about where to build, where to subsidize and then how to gird against the worst case.",
        "The post that I have right now on Dot Earth, \"\"Building With Resilience in Mind,\"\" gets at what the mayor was talking about, which is there are two issues.",
        "One is what do you do about emissions, greenhouse gases, and that's a century-scale question because again, even if you had perfect climate policy, you're not going to blunt sea-level rise more than a few inches in this century by some estimates.",
        "At the same time, in a crowding world that's building ever more stuff, if we don't get more serious about taking the worst-case scenarios into consideration when we're building them, we're really setting ourselves up for this kind of problem going forward in a big way.",
        "Let me ask both of you: But how does a political agency, any politician, look 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 years into the future?",
        "Well, they don't, that's the problem.",
        "It's - part of this is human nature.",
        "Part of it is just how our politics is all torqued toward the here and now.",
        "And that's why climate itself is such a tough issue because it's all really multi-generational, ultimately."

        "I think, you know, we're dealing with a lot of relic infrastructure.",
        "I mean, if we look at - when some of the transportation infrastructure was built, water tunnels, we're going back over 100 years.",
        "But I think we're seeing proactive leadership in trying to prepare.",
        "I mean, we know at this point, essentially, that - and we've had a foot of sea-level rise in the past century.",
        "A lower-end projection suggests we'll have two more feet over the next century.",
        "Even if storms themselves don't change, we're going to get something on the order of three times as many coastal flood eventually.",
        "Well, fortunately I think there are some strategies that can be taken to reduce that vulnerability.",
        "Such as?",
        "We had actually volumes of water that we have never seen before in Long Island Sound, and it did a fair amount of damage.",
        "If there was any saving grace, it's that the winds didn't push more water into Long Island Sound.",
        "And we have vulnerable areas.",
        "I think it's - you know, we really need a suite of strategies, everything from the federal scale down to individual levels.",
        "Some of the things we're talking about that we can do right away include elevating critical infrastructure.",
        "We look at some of these electrical systems in basements, on the first floor.",
        "We need to get those up to higher levels.",
        "We need to look at passive approaches, whereby you can have flooding of the first or second floor of some, you know, maybe newly designed building in terms of innovative designs.",
        "I think a key issue that's come up here is the need for energy redundancy, look at the ways that all of our infrastructure is interconnected.",
        "But just to sort of pick on one example, the electricity and energy system, when we saw the power go out, we see individual suffering, we see loss of revenue as businesses are unable to operate, but we also see electricity being out having impacts on other parts of the key infrastructure.",
        "It's harder to pump water out of the subway tunnels when you don't have access to electricity for pumps.",
        "It's harder to get gas for your car when so much of the distribution system is out because there's not electricity, and the pumps can't work.",
        "Electricity is also part of the story in the telecommunications, cell phones not working quite as well.",
        "So we need to build in redundancy, for example, to the electrical and energy systems so that we can get sort of up and running faster.",
        "There are a lot of other strategies we can talk about, as well, in terms of adapting."

        "You don't want to put them too high outside, right, on the other hand, because they could get hit by a tree.",
        "There are absolutely a lot of tradeoffs there.",

        "It may be other equipment you can raise.",
        "Look at the wastewater treatment plants.",
        "That's somewhere where, based on the recommendations of our panel, New York City has already begun to raise key pumps in the wastewater treatment plant, for example at the Rockaways.",
        "So it's sort of a point about raising valuable infrastructure generally.",
        "Other things we can do - green infrastructure solutions, putting in special plants, drainage systems to catch rainwater, which can be a big part of these flood events as well.",
        "Can we restore wetlands just offshore to protect and buffer against the impact of storms?",
        "And part of the discussion nationally, I think, has to be about managed retreat in some cases.",
        "We know that there are some areas where it's not going to be possible to go with sort of a hard infrastructure solution.",
        "The soils may not support it.",
        "There are places where you have limestone, where you can't build a barrier there.",

        "And then I think part of the discussion does need to be these engineering solutions as well, at least as something we should research, something, you know, maybe as simple as a small seawall, and in some cases there are cities that, you know, have gone with more elaborate systems as well.",
        "Andy, want to chip in on that?",
        "Well, yeah, and here you get into some of the systemic and political questions, because this all circles back to what we end up with as priorities.",
        "And politicians, while we call them leaders, still - are still mostly followers.",
        "And just this morning, in watching some of the news in some of the most hard-hit parts of the metropolitan region, you saw - I saw the same thing I saw in 2004 in covering Hurricane Ivan, the onslaught of that hurricane down in Alabama - people standing and saying we're going to rebuild.",
        "And that's really an issue that's - I don't know other than roots of education and really revealing some of the subsidies that we have in place that foster rebuilding in places that are fundamentally not sound, I think we have to kind of really work hard at figuring out how to make that case.",
