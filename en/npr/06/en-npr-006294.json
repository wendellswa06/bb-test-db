        "That's a problem.",

        "I mean the very same people that will tell you they've been to China, Europe, and marvel at the train systems or the new airports that are being built, then come back to this country and refuse to support those kinds of investments, and that includes the hardening of our infrastructure in vulnerable places.",
        "You know, most of our population is spread out along our shores, whether it's the Eastern Seaboard, the Western Seaboard shared by a few states, or for that matter along the Gulf Coast.",
        "We're going to have to harden infrastructure very significantly over the next, you know, two days to 20 years.",
        "I mean that's the reality.",
        "When you say harden the infrastructure, does that mean building seawalls or floodgates or...",
        "I think it's - it's floodgates, it's battling(ph) - drainage systems, it's seawalls where that's appropriate.",
        "I mean it's all of those things, every one of them.",
        "And no - and quite frankly, changing design concepts in some of our urban environments.",
        "I mean there are assets that can be sacrificed in floodwaters.",
        "Parking facilities, for instance, underneath buildings up to the third, fourth, fifth, sixth floor is a better way to handle being flooded out with boilers and electrical systems above that than having the entire, you know, entire half of Manhattan without power right now.",
        "In the Washington Post this week, three Stanford, Stanford with an N, researchers wrote that several of the East Coast nuclear plants were, quote, unprepared for high waves.",
        "And one of the plants they listed as most vulnerable to flooding is the Millstone Plant on the Connecticut coastline.",
        "Yeah, you know, there are conflicting reports on that.",
        "Obviously we kept an eye on it.",
        "I'm not sure they understand how high that facility is and how high above the water it actually is.",
        "And you know, as somebody who's just lived through, you know, the biggest attack on Connecticut since 1938, record hurricane, it came through with flying colors.",
        "Having said that, if anything more needs to be done, it should be done, and we should undertake it.",
        "But you know, because it's in my state, I follow that quite a bit, and we did power down to about 75 percent of output just because there was concern whether debris in the water might cause a difficulty at the intake, not because there was any fear of wind or wave action.",
        "And then obviously it's well-protected from a tsunami being across Long Island Sound from Long Island.",
        "So that's not a problem either."

        "There wasn't all of the construction and building that took place since, but we've been hammered before epically.",
        "And one of the things I wanted to mention just about this infrastructure investment is just the word investment.",
        "And this gets batted around by politicians all the time, but just on Dot Earth today, there's Jonathan Rose who was involved with the MTA, the Metropolitan Transportation Agency, in New York several years ago did its own climate resilience plan.",
        "And he was on that - he headed that commission, and he on Dot Earth today - Jonathan Rose - was talking about how we have to look at this as an investment, not a cost.",
        "And he says right now - he made the point that it's cheap right now, with interest rates, as he says, on the federal 30-year bonds now below 3 percent, this is an ideal time to make the case for such investments.",
        "So there's maybe an opportunity there in that sense.",
        "But as Radley says, of course, you have to know what you're building and why.",
