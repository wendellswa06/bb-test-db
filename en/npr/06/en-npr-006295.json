        "Andy Revkin, he's been writing about global warming since the '80s, and now he writes the Dot Earth blog for the New York Times.",

        "Andy, I follow your column a lot.",
        "I know that people are always trying to make - connect the dots, connection between hurricanes and climate, climate change.",
        "Can you make that dot connection in this case?",
        "Well, the thing you can make a connection to is that your exacerbating the risks that storms will be just that little bit stronger, surges just that little bit more potent to top a levee or get into the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel through the background heating of the climate system.",
        "There's no question about that.",
        "But too much of the rhetoric was this back and forth thing on was this storm caused by global warming?",
        "And that's really a distraction because it just - the realities are that there were just - the hurricanes are one of the more complicated outcomes of the climate system in general.",
        "And figuring out how the various factors that come with rising greenhouse gas emissions will shape their behavior makes them - if they're not at the right place to look for the kind of clear evidence of this is us kind of answer.",
        "Radley Horton?",
        "You know, as Andy said, sea level rise is like raising the floor of a basketball court.",
        "The rims, you know, all our infrastructure staying at the same height.",
        "We're going to get more slam dunks just by virtue of having that average sea level get higher.",
        "There's very important research going on, I'd say, looking at how warming of the oceans may impact the strength of hurricanes.",
        "There's even research, you know, more speculative, I would say, looking at how the track of this storm, which took a tilt to the west as it got to the mid-latitudes, which is very unusual, as far north as New York.",
        "Normally, they turn to the east.",
        "Could that possibly have been influenced by, say, reductions we've seen in the Arctic sea ice cover that are associated with increase in greenhouse gases and global warming?",
        "But those are in the research stage now.",
        "You know, we're not yet ready to draw those firm conclusions.",
        "But I think it's, you know, given the impact these storms have, you know, we need to keep looking at sea ice.",
        "We need to look at how warm are ocean temperatures.",
        "All things being equal can make storms stronger.",
        "What we do know, as I said, the higher sea levels - and as Andy said, higher sea levels are going to give you more coastal flooding, and we've locked in higher sea levels due to our increases in greenhouse activities, greenhouse gases through our fossil fuel burning."

        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Andy, is that a tipping point we've reached?",
        "Well, actually, but I think that tipping point may be that this raises the vital need to integrate climate change into how we're planning.",
        "And just to give you an example, I live north of the city.",
        "Actually, Radley lives up here in the Hudson Valley with me, too, whereas last year, Irene absolutely devastated our roads.",
        "And I learned about the FEMA standard.",
        "You know, when you get FEMA federal money to rebuild, for the moment, as far as I know, the rule is they give you the money to rebuild to your existing standard - to rebuild the road, not to redesign the road, with the idea that, you know, more heavy downpours are likely outcome already manifest in a human-altered climate.",
        "So that says to me that you can build a lot of support at the local level.",
        "We're getting smart about how we build so we just don't keep getting stuck in harm's way, and that's not a polarizing issue.",
        "That's just common sense.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So in other words, you can get the money, but don't go back and build in that spot again or build it better.",
        "Well, to change how you build a road so it's more - it's going to more likely to endure these no longer rare, heavy downpours, that kind of thing.",
        "One last point.",
        "I remember from reading you, the Earth Institute papers years ago was that one of the side effects that people don't think about economically is that if you have to spend all this money on constantly rebuilding, that takes away money for other infrastructures like your schools and your hospitals and things like - there's things that are falling apart that may need the money also.",
        "Yeah.",

        "I've written for years now about growing vulnerability of infrastructures, schools in Oregon to the inevitable earthquake that's going to happen when the Cascadia falls off the coast there, lurches again; this hasn't since 1700.",
        "And the issues are the same.",
        "You know, the school retrofitting money is locally raised.",
        "So you know, how do you get a school board to say, OK, let's retrofit our school against a rare disaster.",
        "Or should we hire more teachers?",
        "It's really hard.",
        "But it's something that you're saying you have to do.",
        "Oh, I think, you know, again, it all depends on what you value and, you know, our values and our reflexes are mostly about the near term.",
        "Somehow - I mean, part - a big chunk of what I do on Dot Earth is try to assess are there ways to foster more of a long-term view of things so that we don't get stuck in this - what I wrote about the other day was what they called a blah, blah, blah, bang approach to disaster policy.",
        "Yeah.",
