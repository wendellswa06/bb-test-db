        "So Marks goes after the banks with that same kind of fervor.",
        "In 1995, Marks was in Charlotte, North Carolina, to protest a bank called First Union.",
        "Across the street was the headquarters of Nation's Bank, soon to become Bank of America.",
        "It was run Hugh McCall, a famously tough and successful, military-style CEO.",
        "Marks called up McCall to ask for a meeting.",
        "Here's how Hugh McCall remembers it.",
        "There were protestors and they had on - if I remember - yellow shirts with the sharks on the front of them, and I went down, shook hands with him, said I'd meet with him.",
        "Hugh McCall was probably the most powerful banker in the country.",
        "He came up to my top floor, where we had our war room, and we sat in there together with a couple of my people, and we both speak very frankly, and we did.",
        "It was amazing, in a sense, because you know, obviously I've never been in a place like that.",
        "But Marks says he was still all fired up and in protest mode, so…",
        "It began with me saying to him that all bankers are evil, and him saying to me all nonprofits want a handout.",
        "And that's exactly how the meeting started.",
        "But McCall said Marks wasn't asking for a handout.",
        "He wanted his group to basically be the interface between the bank and lower-income borrowers.",
        "Marks's group was offering to counsel them for months, get their bank statements, and qualify them for home loans in a rigorous and sophisticated way.",
        "He wanted McCall's bank to put up the money for the loans.",
        "I just thought, hey, this guy's not nuts.",
        "Maybe I can do business with him, so we said, okay, we'll try it.",

        "Now, representation by itself is a big deal.",
        "But is there any indication that having more women is going to change the way Congress does its job?",
        "Well, I certainly hope so.",
        "I mean, you know, there's a great deal of research, certainly from the corporate side, that when you have - that better decisions get made when there's more diversity around the table.",
        "And I think we've got a lot of women and diverse women.",
        "And so - and what that means is they're going to bring different perspectives to decision-making.",
        "So I think there's not a way that it can't have an impact, frankly.",
        "And I think one of the things we're seeing that I hope - I feel like we're starting to see Nancy Pelosi and the leadership of the Democrat Party certainly trying to do this.",
        "You know, it means - when I say the decision-making table, that's really the key thing.",
        "It's got to be, let's bring in these diverse voices and faces when we're trying to make decisions on strategy of how we're going to pursue a piece of legislation or what ought to be in a piece of legislation.",
        "And certainly, I think the fact that women are - tend to be more collaborative leaders - we know that famous story from the budget impasse, where it was really the Republican and Democratic women of the Senate who kind of helped broker a deal.",
        "So I think if you just look at the nature of women's leadership, the nature of the diverse experiences and backgrounds that these women are bringing to Congress and the opportunities that I think they will have, particularly under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, to be part of decision-making - like I said, I don't see how we couldn't - it couldn't have a positive impact."

        "She's also the first Palestinian-American congressperson, one of the first Muslim women to be elected to Congress.",
        "But I find myself kind of wondering, what do you see as your role as an activist now?",

        "What do you see as your role now that these barriers to groups who haven't participated before are falling?",
        "I'm very proud of Rashida's win as the first Palestinian-American woman in Congress.",
        "And I see my role right now and as - have always seen my role as an outside activist who builds relationships with people on the inside of government.",

        "And, Destiny, really, it's the same question to you, is how do you see your role?",
        "I mean, I think many people may remember your story - that you founded the group New Wave Feminists, which opposes abortion rights and the death penalty.",
        "Then after the group became an official partner for the first Women's March, New Wave Feminists were removed from the list, but you still marched anyway.",
        "How do you see your role?",
        "I mean, you obviously agree with many of the march organizers on some issues.",
        "You disagree with others.",

        "You know, we did march back in 2017 and 2018.",

        "It's always been a wonderful experience because there are so many platforms that we absolutely do agree on.",
        "You know, the focus of our group is to fight injustice and make sure that all human beings are not being humanized from the womb to the tomb.",
        "And so we plan on continuing that message into this January with the march in D.C.",
        "and really kind of calling some of the leadership with the women's march to speak out more.",
        "You know, there has been that controversy with Louis Farrakhan, and they have said that they, you know, do not support anti-Semitism in any way.",
        "But I think we want it to go deeper than that.",
        "We want them to actually denounce Louis Farrakhan himself.",
        "Well, Linda, what about that?",
        "I mean, we don't - I apologize to listeners who are not familiar with this entire controversy, but that in a nutshell is it - is that there are people who say they can no longer participate in the Women's March because they feel that you've not gone far enough to denounce Louis Farrakhan for comments that he has made that many people say are not just anti-Semitic but misogynist, anti-woman and so forth.",
        "And, you know, and as briefly as you can - I know it's complex - what do you say about that?",
        "It's actually not very complex at all.",
        "Minister Farrakhan absolutely says anti-Semitic, misogynistic and homophobic remarks.",
        "And we have unequivocally rejected all forms of racism and hate including anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia, etc. What people need to understand - that is the organizers of the Women's March, those of us who are seasoned organizers - we are trained in Kingian (ph) nonviolence.",
        "And those are the teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, and one of the most important teachings is go after the forces of evil, not those doing evil.",
        "And it is very complex and complicated to denounce black - to ask a black woman to denounce a black man.",
        "So the votes of those three breakaway senators were crucial, and all three ended up with a considerable say in shaping the size and shape of last night's deal.",
