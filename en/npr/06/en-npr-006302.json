        "And as we look around the world, one of the fascinating things is that recently the United Kingdom passed America in terms of being viewed as a more competitive business economy.",
        "One of the reasons they did that is because they, over the last five years, have taken on regulatory reform.",
        "They've actually put in place their proposal, as they called it, One In One Out.",
        "And my approach is more an American political terminology called Regulatory Pay-Go.",

        "How do you respond to the remark about your column and your proposal that having not only been involved in crafting the financial services regulatory bill, but having supported the big health care bill, those are the biggest new regulations introduced that business and individuals have to cope with, and therefore, you have contributed to red tape, as critics of those bills would say?",
        "As I said at the outset, there is clearly a need for new regulations in a series of areas where we either confront a new crisis, as in the financial excess, or when we try to recognize the fact that if we can't get our health care costs under control, any effort at deficit reduction is basically meaningless.",
        "So I am not anti-regulatory.",
