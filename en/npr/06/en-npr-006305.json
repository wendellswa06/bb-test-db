        "It seems that the opposition has gained ground in the six months since I've been there.",
        "I was there during the elections and briefly for a few weeks immediately afterward, and it does appear by all measures really that they have gained ground.",
        "That they have expanded their horizons geographically and anyone who goes on Youtube can see that the videotapes of demonstrations that were once only from Teheran and a few other major cities are now all over the country.",

        "So, I think that's kind of a dog-bites-man story that there is a crackdown.",
        "I think it was very expected especially since the government considers the green opposition movement a kind of tool of Iran's foreign enemies.",
        "But I think what's most surprising and what the big story of the green movement is, is that the pressure does not seemed to have worked and the traditional tactics of the past, you know, using street tactics to stop protests, hurting people, putting them into prison, having what critics describe as show trials, none of that has really worked and it worked in the past.",
        "And I think that's one of the most extraordinary things we've seen about this green movement.",

        "Why not make a deal with the opposition leaders at least - Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi.",
        "And that's one option they have but it doesn't seem like they're moving in the direction of making a deal.",
        "It's often very difficult for people who represent Western news outlets to actually report from Iran.",
        "Now that you've been there, what is it that perhaps people don't know about the country that they should know?",

        "They're going to their jobs.",
        "They're going to their classes.",
