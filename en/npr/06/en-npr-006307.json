        "We're talking with Imad Moustapha, Syria's ambassador to the United States.",
        "You're listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News.",
        "Michele?",
        "Well, I was wondering.",
        "We talk about that they're terrorists, but how do you explain then the many children that have been killed in this conflict and the - just the high number of people, 2,200 according to the United Nations?",
        "Well, of course, casualties have fallen.",
        "Many of them are innocent casualties and the state does recognize that there should be accountability for any fallen person.",
        "One of the first massacres that took place was against a Syrian army colonel who was driving his two kids and his nephew to a school.",
        "They were ambushed and all four were massacred, and their bodies were dismembered.",
        "What I'm trying to tell you is it is very ugly, what is happening, but the reality is so distorted.",
        "Now, let me move to the - back to your question, because I think this is an important question.",
        "What's going on on the political scene in Syria?",
        "As I have said in the beginning, let me give you some details right now.",
        "The Syrian government has announced a major political uphold and reform of the political scene in Syria, something unprecedented in the old Arab world.",
        "Syria has always enjoyed freedom for women and freedom for religious groups in Syria.",
        "This is why the Christian community in Syria fully supports the president of Syria and also most of the minorities, as well as the intellectuals and the liberal Sunnis in Syria.",
        "I am not denying the fact that, also, a large sector of religious people oppose the government in Syria.",
        "I'm recognizing this fact.",
        "But we have announced a new multi-party law.",
        "We have announced a new freedom of media law.",
        "We have announced elections that will take place, free elections, multipartite elections that will take place next February.",
        "And we will continue to move on, but we will never allow those extremist groups to take over Syria.",
        "Syria is not Kabul.",
        "Syria is not Kandahar.",
        "Let's get another caller in.",
        "This is Michael and Michael with us from Cape Coral in Florida.",
        "Yes.",
        "Hi.",
        "Thank you for taking my call.",
        "I just wanted to ask the ambassador, given the events that have taken place in Egypt as well as in Libya, how would he explain the alienation of Syria within the Muslim world?",
        "And at what point in the revolt will he consider seeking political asylum in the United States?",
        "I'm a very proud Syrian.",
        "The only place I will live in and I would like my children to live in is Syria.",
        "I hope you know a little bit more about my country, our civilization and our history and our cultural heritage before you would decide that I should leave my country that I'm very proud of.",

        "As far as the first part of your question, Syria is a very proud secular place.",
        "As I have said, those Arab countries that criticize us, they don't even allow women to drive cars.",
        "They don't have constitutions.",
        "They don't have political parties.",
        "They don't have the cultural diversity that Syria enjoys, and yet they believe that they can lecture us.",
        "So it's not about whether Syria is alienated or not with other Islamic countries.",
        "The question is that the overwhelming majority of the Syrian people do not want for Syria to fall under the prey of extremists, the violent fundamentalist groups.",
        "We will not allow this, and Syria will keep on moving forward.",
        "Yes, we have not done a good job.",
        "I can easily recognize this on political reforms in the past, but we have committed ourselves to absolute - absolutely transparent elections.",
        "Let the elections decide who should rule Syria.",
        "Neither the armed groups nor the other alienated, as you described the Muslim nations.",
        "We just have a minute or so left with you.",
        "It's not just the Islamic countries.",
        "There are - Turkey, a secular country, yes, an Islamist party in command, but not exactly Iran by any stretch of the imagination, a multi-party state.",
        "Turkey, Syria's most important neighbor, it's most important economic trading partner, and the prime minister is denouncing what he calls savagery in your country.",
        "Well, you have described the political scene in Turkey.",
        "And let me tell you this fact.",
        "Only two days ago, the - a large parliamentarian group from Turkey, from the opposition party, the People's Party, came and visited Syria.",
        "They are siding with Syria and they are being very critical for the Erdogan party for his interference in Syrian affairs, so even the Turks are divided vis-a-vis Syria.",

        "Of course, we are being severely criticized by the - by a rainbow of Islamic parties and groups.",

        "Britain's prime minister Theresa May is facing yet another challenge to her leadership.",
        "She delivers a speech today to business leaders attempting to defend her plan to bring the United Kingdom out of the European Union.",
        "That plan has prompted fierce criticism from within her own Cabinet and from the wider British parliament, where people have been gathering letters to try to prompt a no confidence vote in her leadership.",
        "George Parker is following all this.",
        "He's political editor for the Financial Times.",
        "Welcome to the program.",
        "Hello.",
        "Does it feel like you're near the end of the crisis?",
        "It certainly feels like we're coming towards the end of this saga, which has been dragging on for more than two years since Britain voted to leave the EU.",
        "And this week, as you've just been saying, is a really critical week for the prime minister.",
        "She's going to Brussels on Sunday to hopefully get sign-off from the rest of the EU for the terms of Britain's departure from the EU.",
        "But at the same time, she's facing these sort of squalls at home, the possibility of a leadership challenge by some of her own MPs who don't like the deal that she signed, and also the possibility of a second wave of Cabinet resignations by euroskeptic Cabinet ministers who are equally unhappy.",
        "So it's a difficult domestic situation.",
        "And as usual, the more difficult negotiation for the prime minister is back at home with our own party than the talks, I think, over in Brussels.",
        "I almost wonder if the European Union approval of May's plan hurts her politically.",
        "It makes it seem like she's not being strong enough if the Europeans actually like the terms.",
        "Well, I think that's always a danger.",
        "I think there are some people in our party who think that she should have driven a much harder bargain in Brussels, and they think she's capitulated.",
        "It's not the dream of Brexit they had in mind.",
        "And basically the deal she's negotiated keeps Britain locked in to many of the EU's rules into the distant future as the price we'll have to pay for getting access to the European market.",
        "They don't like that.",
        "They had this much more sort of Churchillian idea of Britain walking off, having an independent path, trading with the world on the high seas.",
        "And it doesn't quite meet up to the sort of lyrical Brexit that they originally had in mind.",
        "I guess we've been learning here about the mechanics of a vote of no confidence.",
        "We've been told that 48 members would have to sign letters in order for there to be a vote of no confidence.",
        "Should we presume that her opponents don't have 48 because if they did we would have heard about it by now?",
        "Well, they've been talking about this for about six months, the possibility of defenestrate Theresa May, and they so far have failed to muster the 48 names.",
        "My guess is if they didn't get the 48 names last week when the terms of the deal were published, they're going to struggle a bit this week.",
        "They're in a dilemma.",
        "They can probably get just about 48 names to trigger this vote of confidence in the prime minister, but they wouldn't have anywhere near enough MPs to actually beat her.",
        "So they either end up having this vote of confidence and losing and looking rather stupid, or not having the vote of confidence this week and looking like they didn't have the numbers in the first place, in which they also look stupid."

        "Very briefly.",
        "Is part of the problem here for May's opponents that many of them might like to unseat her as prime minister, but none of them would dare try to be prime minister themselves right this minute?",
        "Who on earth would want to be prime minister of this country at the moment?",
