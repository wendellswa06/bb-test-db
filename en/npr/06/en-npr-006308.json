        "Friends' executive director Judy Stavisky says her program is successful because the mentors get intensive social work training and work with no more than eight kids at a time.",
        "The role of the mentor is both an anchor and a sail for the kids, because these kids have very little of each.",
        "We provide that grounding experience for the kids.",
        "We also open their eyes to the universe of possibilities of the way they could behave and the way their lives can be.",
        "Campbell made a fortune in timber investments.",
        "But he says measuring success as a social entrepreneur is a different calculation entirely.",

        "It takes patience.",
        "After 18 years, Campbell's creation now spans six cities, including New York and Boston.",
        "These salaried mentorships are costly, about $9,000 per child per year.",
