        "And as you heard in this worrisome present, one number that jumps out is that trillion dollar deficit for 2009.",

        "We have a contract that I believe, number one, gives our teachers the kind of supports and resources that our children need to graduate, knowing how to read, knowing how to navigate life.",
        "After a protracted three-year dispute that got so nasty few thought it would ever be resolved, Rhee and union officials made key concessions that once seemed unattainable.",
        "But it was worth it, said Rhee.",
        "We've had one goal since June 12th, 2007, and that is to build a school system that ensures that every single child in this city, regardless of where they live, has the opportunity to attain an excellent education through our public school system.",
        "Both sides gave up something and got something in return.",
        "Rhee gets to remove ineffective teachers but teachers get to keep tenure.",
        "Teachers get a 21.6 percent pay increase over five years, and Rhee gets a pay for performance plan.",
        "Rhee says it will be part of a new pay structure based not on credentials or the number of years a person has been teaching, but on whether or not students are making progress.",
        "For the amazing teachers in this district, the teachers who come into work every day and do heroic things for children, their work will be recognized and rewarded in a wholly different way.",
        "When Rhee took over in 2007, she set out to entice teachers to give up tenure in exchange for more pay - lots more pay.",
        "But the union bitterly opposed the idea.",
        "Now what the two sides have agreed to is a voluntary pay for performance plan, in which teachers could earn up to $20,000 extra for raising students' performance and test scores.",
        "The money for that plan, sixty-four and a half million dollars would come from an unprecedented arrangement, with four foundations - all involved in the city's efforts to turn around struggling schools."

        "Rotherham says if the contract is ratified by the union's rank and file and approved by the city council, it will have an impact on collective bargaining rights and negotiations across the country - especially in places where political pressure has been building to tie students' performance to teacher performance and pay.",
