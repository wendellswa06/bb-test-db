        "Johnson & Johnson now had 48 hours to pay $25.4 billion and close the deal with Guidant.",
        "Instead J&J announced it wasn't bound by the contract anymore because Guidant's business had been hurt by product recalls and government investigations.",

        "Those are devices that shock an irregularly beating heart into a regular rhythm.",
        "Their use has been fueled by improvements in technology and research that shows that they're effective in preventing sudden heart failures.",
        "A few months after the deal was negotiated, a 21-year-old died after his Guidant's defibrillator malfunctioned.",
        "It emerged that Guidant knew about the chance of malfunction and the company had actually developed a new model that fixed the problem, but it continued to sell the older one and it didn't tell doctors about the problem.",
        "Guidant eventually recalled thousands of the devices.",
        "Now it's being investigated by the Food and Drug Administration and the Justice Department.",
        "Gunderson says J&J is pushing hard for a lower price because the findings of the government investigations could result in fines or even criminal charges.",
        "He says from J&J's point of view, there's another problem with this deal.",
        "J&J, it's a bigger organization.",
        "They've been around for a very long time.",
        "They have a very polished brand name.",
        "And they want to make sure that they don't step into something that could taint J&J at some point in the future.",
        "J&J's statement said it had been talking to Guidant about a lower price but to no avail and that there was no guarantee the talks would resume, and if they did, that there would be a new agreement.",

        "Well, more than anything else, it's just the type of war that's being faced.",
