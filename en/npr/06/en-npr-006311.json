        "The compound that my company was responsible for, we actually really locked down the detainees in terms of following the rules much more closely.",
        "And we had actually got to the point where we were able to get some of the worst guys we could find in the compound.",
        "We had a very good intelligence officer to help us trying to separate the bad guys out.",
        "And by the time we left, they weren't able to have riots.",
        "You know, they'd try to stage protests periodically, but we had done a good enough job of keeping dangerous things out of their hand.",
        "They really couldnt do anything other than yell at us.",
        "Interesting.",
        "Nathan, thanks very much for the call, appreciate it.",
        "And Paul Springer, some of the points you - writes about in your book, you said they failed to learn from history.",
        "We already talked about the communist cadre in Korea.",
        "There were also the Nazis in the camps in this country, many, many camps, fanatical Nazis trying to organize the prisoners, and they did a very good job of it in the camps in this country.",
        "We see the same behavior there.",
        "And the response that the American government finally came up with was to classify every prisoner, every German prisoner, based on their political ideology.",
        "And the very worst of the fanatical Nazis were pulled aside and put into two separate maximum-security facilities.",
        "Whereas those that were the least risk or the least ideological were actually given much more privileges and much better treatment and an opportunity to educate themselves and to prepare themselves for post-War Germany.",
        "So but I think it's important to bring up a point that Nathan certainly illustrated there, and that is that the American military personnel are wonderful learners.",
        "They're very adaptive, and they're doing their very best to handle an extremely difficult job.",
        "And so Nathan certainly illustrates that they're adaptive, that they react to the situation and make the best of a bad situation.",
        "Again, I was going to point out to the lessons of history, though, when he said it was very difficult to get the big Army, as he described it, to pay attention to what we poor schmucks were doing trying to control these prisoners.",
        "Well, big Army certainly has a lot of issues in front of it while it's fighting a conflict.",
        "And I don't know which year Nathan was at Camp Bucca, but big Army was fighting a war at the same time.",
        "And so it's understandable that prisoners of war aren't the highest priority for the Army.",
        "And I'm not advocating that that should be the number one thing that we do.",
        "And you had to do that to become a Marine, which...",
        "However, I think if an enemy knows they'll be well-treated by American military personnel, if they know their time in captivity will be one of respect and one of, you know, security and safety, I think they're far more likely to surrender.",
        "And there is no faster way to remove enemy troops from the battlefield than by inducing mass surrenders of enemy formations.",
        "One of the things we've learned since the invasion of Iraq was that there were several aspects of what would happen after the fall of Baghdad that were overlooked by that big army, and prisoners was among them, nevertheless a war of choice, where you're running up to the war and making the preparations and going on your own timetable.",
        "There's not a lot of excuse here.",
        "You know, I suppose there really is a case of not really looking at the lessons of history.",
        "You could go all the way back to the Civil War and see that the fastest way to reduce the Confederate army was through mass surrenders.",
        "And that was actually the mechanism by which the Confederacy was eventually defeated."

        "If you could not get the enemy to surrender, it's almost impossible to destroy an enemy army through force of arms.",

        "You name it, the myth that could possibly be added to us was out there.",
        "However, over the course of the conflict, by 1944, 1945, the United States was engaging in tremendous efforts to compel the surrender of individual Japanese soldiers.",
        "And one of the things that we were doing was dropping millions of leaflets over Japanese positions.",
        "And these leaflets contained, basically, how to surrender.",

        "And we saw the same thing in the Gulf War.",
        "We saw the same thing in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, basically teaching the enemy how to surrender and making promises of what they could expect.",
        "Yet we read in Paul Dower's book, \"\"A War Without Mercy,\"\" and other books about the history of the Pacific war, certainly earlier in the conflict, there were many situations where, due to their experiences of Japanese who declined to surrender by rolling hand grenades at men who were trying to help them, U.S.",
        "Marines again reciprocated with that and often declined to accept surrender.",
        "Sure, and if you don't believe the enemy is actually trying to surrender, it's very hard to accept them into your midst, effectively.",
        "And so in the case of the Pacific war certainly, the United States had a fundamental problem in that whereas we believed the Japanese would not surrender due to their moral code, we thought it was in our best interest to stop asking on the individual level.",
        "However, we also found that incentives for American service personnel were very effective ways to help increase the tally of prisoners."
