        "Even ice cream, yeah.",
        "So by giving them ice cream, by giving them R&R for the entire unit if they took prisoners, these were ways to encourage the Americans to at least give the Japanese a chance to surrender, and as we increased the number of our captives, then it became easier and easier to induce further surrenders.",

        "Daddy related one that there was a riot there, and some of the Nazis actually, or they theorized, killed another prisoner because he wouldn't come under the thumb of the hard-core members of the prisoner corps there.",
        "One of the things, though, that actually did happen, he said that the food your guest had said we always treated our prisoners very well, and this story testifies to that.",
        "The food was better than the rations that the local citizens got, the American citizens.",
        "They had a better butter ration.",
        "There was almost a riot in the prisoner-of-war camp because the prisoners got a ration of corn, and they were outraged.",
        "They thought it was a provoking measure because apparently in Germany at that time, the corn was fed only to pigs, you know, and they said swine food, swine food, and they were very upset about that.",
        "And further - just one other quick vignette.",
        "At the time that daddy was there first at the fall of '43, the prisoners worked very well in different levels of there were Nazis there who were there to maintain a certain order, if you will, for their German prisoners, and they were hard-core.",
        "They were tough guys and very bad.",
        "Investors may play a role in the resolution.",
        "Yesterday, they drove down Guidant's price to a new low of around $60.",
        "If J&J were to buy Guidant at the price originally negotiated, each Guidant share would be valued at more than $75.",
        "And daddy said that by '44, the prisoner cadre had changed quite a bit, and he made them when he they would show them the newspapers about how the war was going, and they'd say propaganda, propaganda.",
        "He made them all line up when the prisoners started coming in in '44.",
        "They were bedraggled, they were in bad shape, and they said, yeah, there's your propaganda coming walking in the gates.",
        "They're a totally different, dispirited group than in '43 apparently."

        "Well, Nelson, I can tell you, I lived in Europe in the '80s and they still considered corn to be animal feed.",

        "That's correct.",
        "Actually, there were a number of incidents where prisoners held what they called kangaroo courts, where they would put people on trial for their behavior, whether it was possibly informing to the American captors of escape attempts or whether it was not conforming ideologically.",
        "So we had prisoners murdering other prisoners.",
        "When it was possible to determine who was responsible, the murderers were then put on trial by American authorities and if found guilty, they faced the possibility of execution.",

        "Well, that may have been - Paul Springer, it was interesting, you noted that in 1949 when the nations, including the United States and Great Britain, recast the Geneva Conventions and said must be released immediately upon the end of the conflict, they were still holding prisoners from the second World War.",
        "That's right.",
