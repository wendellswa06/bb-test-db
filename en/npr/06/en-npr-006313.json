        "An intriguing finding of the study - women were more likely to lower their cancer risk than men.",
        "Again, it's not known why, but McCullough says it could have something to do with female hormones.",
        "The findings of the study are an important step, says Dr. Jeffrey Meyerhardt, director of the Gastrointestinal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.",
        "Really the key question is, you have some vitamin D level.",
        "Let's say you're low.",
        "Can we increase someone's level to a different level and then lower their risk?",
        "Right now a large study at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston is working to answer exactly that question - whether adding vitamin D to the diet can lower the risk of colorectal cancer.",
        "Meyerhardt expects some answers in the coming year.",
        "In the meantime, he says the best option - talk with your doctor about getting a blood test to measure vitamin D levels.",
        "It could be supplements are needed, but the best sources of the vitamin, says researcher McCullough, are food.",
        "Salmon, trout, swordfish, tuna, sardines are naturally high in vitamin D.",
        "Then there are fortified foods.",
        "Such as milk, some cereals and some orange juices.",
        "Other types of milk like almond milk and soy milk are also often fortified with vitamin D.",
        "So you should check the label.",
        "A serving of salmon plus a glass of milk, she says, can fulfill currently recommended requirements for vitamin D.",
        "But McCullough says further investigation might point to increasing the recommended dose."
