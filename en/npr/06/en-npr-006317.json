        "Very few seem to actually be aware that he's coming because, just like in Afghanistan, the trip was being kept very secret, but those that we spoke to on the street, they are not that impressed by Senator Obama, they say, because they feel that even though he's making the right noises now, from their perspective in terms of troop withdrawal and bringing peace to the region, they believe that it doesn't really matter who's in the White House, the American are here and that no one is really leaving, and so they don't put much stock into what he has to say.",
