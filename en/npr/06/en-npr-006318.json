        "There should be some sort of general time horizon, as they're phrasing it, for a withdrawal, and at that point, even the spokesman for the government, who later came out and sort of backtracked on what Senator Obama's plan was and whether the prime minister supported it, he told us that, in fact, the prime minister did want to see or would prefer that withdrawal occur around 2010, which would put us into the 16-month timeframe.",
        "But again, once this article came out in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the government quickly sent out a notice that was also forwarded to us that backtracked from that and said no, there was no timetable discussed, that this was a misunderstanding and a mistranslation, if you will, and so the prime minister has now backed off of listing a date for any kind of withdrawal, saying it would depend on the situation on the ground.",
