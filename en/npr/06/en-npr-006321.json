        "Virginia Burkett at the U.S.",
        "Geological Survey says Turner and his colleagues did a good job of showing that storms can push around a huge amount of sediment.",
        "But what they neglect to point out is that while sediment was being deposited in some marshes, over 200 square miles of coastal marsh and barrier islands were lost or converted to open water during Katrina and Rita.",
        "In fact, some of the places that got the most new sediment were directly next to barrier islands that were largely washed away by the storms, she says.",
        "So there's still a need for more sediment, and ultimately that all comes down the rivers.",
        "If hurricanes are a fact of life and, you know, they can rework sediments - but the premise that we do not need to allow the Mississippi River to deposit sediments naturally on the shelf is very short-sighted, in my opinion.",
        "Right now, much of that sediment is held in the Mississippi River channel by the network of levees.",
        "And when it reaches the Gulf, a good deal of it gets spewed into deep waters.",
        "So the river is not delivering as much as it used to to the coastline.",
        "Besides, Denise Reed at the University of New Orleans says coastal management these days isn't simply a matter of understanding the natural processes that maintain the wetlands.",
        "Scientists are trying to figure out how to repair decades of damage caused by activities such as channel cutting for oil and gas exploration.",
        "If we really want to rebuild the coast, then we have to do more than just get sediment on the top of existing marshes.",
        "We actually have to build land in open water.",
