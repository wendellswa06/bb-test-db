        "Now, the military says that the men hanged themselves, and they made nooses fashioned out of clothes and bed sheets.",
        "The military also says that the men left suicide notes.",
        "They're written in Arabic, but the Pentagon does not want to say what's in those notes because it's part of the ongoing investigation now, that's gonna follow these death.",
        "The men will be autopsied, and the State Department is looking into repatriating them back to their home countries.",

        "officials saying about this?",
        "Really, at this point - we did have President Bush's statement, yes - but really right now everything is coming from the Pentagon at this point, and they're saying that the suicides were planned and were coordinated, and it was not spontaneous.",
        "It was not a spontaneous action.",
        "They say that the men were all in the same security block.",
        "They described them all as dangerous members of terrorists organizations.",

        "If they did see something happening, they changed procedures so they could get in there much faster.",
        "The military now says that they will look at their procedures and most likely make changes again.",

        "Well, what's going happen, and sort of like the society is in general, where this kind of heavy hitters are going to get paid, but where you're going to see the cuts are going to be sort of in these middle class of ballplayers.",
        "A lot of guys are going to get released who are coming up on contracts that would pay them five, six million.",
        "They're going to be what they call non-tendered contracts.",

        "A few days before his fight with Manny Pacquiao, Oscar de La Hoya's statue was unveiled at the Staples Center here in Los Angeles.",

        "Oscar was there at the unveiling being honored and then a few days later, he jumped into the ring and you know what happened - he got hammered, unable to answer the bell for the ninth round.",
        "So here's the question, what is his legacy, because there's disagreement about that around here at News & Notes.",
        "How would you rank de La Hoya with other fighters in his weight class?",
        "He looks like that statue they unveiled.",
        "That's what he looked in the last fight.",
        "But Oscar was a, I'd say he was a great champion, but he was a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard in terms of what he did for the sport and for the lower divisions.",
        "And he was the golden boy.",
        "He paved the way for a lot of big-money fights, and I think that in sports now, particularly in this climate, you have to rank people in terms of commerce and finance and Oscar was the golden boy.",
        "He made it possible for a lot of fighters to get a lot of great paydays.",
        "You're absolutely right about that.",
        "In fact, he holds the record, $700 million total for 19 fights on HBO Pay Per View events, and even this fight pulled in 1.25 million subscribers which puts him right at the top.",
        "Deserving of a statue or not, his pocketbook is certainly going to go into the Hall of Fame.",
        "All right, let's talk about something else - guns and athletes.",
        "The Plaxico Burress story still going on.",
        "We all know by now that the New York Giants' receiver shot himself in the leg while partying at a Manhattan nightclub.",
        "So the first thing people ask was, reasonably, what was he doing with a gun at the club in the first place?",
        "But an interesting answer, Bill Rhoden, came this week from Miami Dolphins linebacker Joey Porter, who defended his boy Burress with this comment, \"\"until you've been in a situation where you've been robbed at gunpoint or you've had a gun waved in your face or you're been carjacked, you really don't know what it feels like,\"\" end quote.",
        "So Bill, has he a point?",
        "Well, yeah, he does.",
        "I mean, that's true.",
        "Until that happens to you, you don't know, and it's an unfortunate reality that allow the athletes are target because number one, they choose to continue to want to hangout and go places where they used to go.",
        "So, yeah, you're going to be targeted, and Burress place that - I might OK, I just think it was recklessness and it was careless.",
        "I mean, you got a gun that you don't know how to use clearly, you don't even know how to lock it.",
        "And you're carrying it in your waistband, and it accidentally goes off, you shoot yourself in the thigh and, he's just like you and I here talking about him blowing somebody else away.",
        "That's not about being confronted.",
        "That's about being reckless.",
        "We do hear that, as you say, that even if you're where you're supposed to be, that if you are where you're supposed to be, these kinds of things are not going to happen to you, so we'll have to see.",
        "It's a tragic situation, and it's costing in a lot of ways.",
