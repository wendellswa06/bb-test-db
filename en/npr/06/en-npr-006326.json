        "Well, sure.",
        "So this all happened in Staten Island on a hot summer day.",
        "Officer Daniel Pantaleo along with his partner alleged that Garner was selling loose cigarettes and tried to arrest him.",
        "Garner accused the officers of harassing him and threw up his hands so as not to be handcuffed.",
        "Pantaleo then grabs Garner around the neck, struggles to bring him down.",
        "By then, other officers arrive, and they get on top of Garner, too.",
        "Garner's in a prone position.",
        "He's gasping for air, and he keeps repeating, as you've said, I can't breathe.",
        "This was all caught on a video that went viral.",
        "And in New York City, people were outraged, and they took to the streets.",
        "So let's fast forward to today.",
        "Why did it take federal prosecutors five years to decide not to prosecute?",
        "Well, U.S.",
        "Attorney Richard Donoghue acknowledged that the decision should never have taken so long.",
        "He called it, quote, \"\"entirely inappropriate and unacceptable.\"\" He said it was partly because leadership at the Department of Justice kept changing hands.",
        "He said there were as many as five different attorneys general who had considered the case, including two Obama appointees - Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch.",
        "Ultimately he said Attorney General William Barr made the final decision.",
        "He also said it took a long time because it was a difficult decision.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "Certainly there was a desire by many people who worked on this case over many years to do everything we could to determine whether charges could be brought.",
        "I would say that obviously the fact that it was on video made this different from some other cases where we don't have that sort of compelling evidence up front.",
        "But I'm not going to gauge whether it was close or not close.",
        "I'm just going to say that we put a lot of time and effort into this.",
        "Yeah, but ultimately he said the evidence fell short.",
        "And why?",
        "Do we know why the evidence fell short?",
        "We just heard him there call the video compelling evidence.",
        "So what was missing?",
        "Well, he said proof that Pantaleo's use of a chokehold was willful, meaning that he intended to use it to harm Eric Garner, was what was missing.",
        "And Donoghue also said repeatedly that it was important to note that no one was choking Garner when he was gasping for air.",
        "What has been the reaction from the Garner family today?",
        "Well, they reacted with a lot of outrage and anger.",
        "They were insulted by the timing of the announcement - the day before the anniversary of Eric Garner's death.",
        "And they were also upset that five years later, no officers have been held accountable.",
        "Right now they all remain on the force, collecting salaries and benefits.",
        "And this is Gwen Carr, Garner's mother, speaking to reporters after her meeting with federal prosecutors."

        "Is this the end, or is it possible that other sorts of charges may be still in the works?",
        "Well, a Staten Island grand jury also declined to prosecute Officer Pantaleo criminally, so the only thing that's left is his NYPD disciplinary trial.",
        "That ended last month.",

        "So why you, and why now?",
        "I think what's telling about those same polls is about half the respondents say that they would like to see the president challenged because they'd like to see a primary, because they do believe that there needs to be a debate of ideas within Republicans.",
        "It's not taking place right now.",
        "Well, the party in your state voted yesterday to not even hold a Republican primary in 2020.",
        "So what do you do now?",
        "I think all of us should find it a little bit curious.",
        "I mean, you know, in the world of politics, if you can stack up a 90% win, you go with it, particularly if it's the first in the South primary, given the signals it'll send to subsequent states and subsequent primaries that'll take place that would follow South Carolina.",
        "But they elected not to do that.",

        "I think that we need to have a conversation and debate on what it means to be a Republican.",
        "Traditionally, the Republican Party stood for some level of financial conservatism.",
        "That seems to have been thrown out the window of late, as you see, got instance, with this latest debt deal, the president adding $2 trillion of additional debt to the national debt and a third of a trillion dollars in new spending over the next two years without even a debate.",
        "I think we need to have a conversation about where we're going on trade.",
        "I think we need to have a conversation with regard to institutions and political norms which the president has thrown out.",
        "But that has historically been the glue that has held together that balance of power that makes our system work, and I think we need to have a conversation on town.",
        "I think that some might argue that the way that those intra-party debates take place is exactly in the kinds of positions that you have had in down-ballot races.",
        "I mean, you lost the Republican primary to a candidate endorsed by President Trump, so I think some might argue, asked and answered.",
        "Well, there's a difference between a battle and a war, and I would say that as Republicans, in some cases, we're winning battles but losing wars.",
        "So what happened in that race after I lost the primary was that for the first time in about 50 years, the seat went Democrat.",
        "And the same story could be told in a host of other districts across this country, wherein suburban moms and young millennials and go down the list turned out in droves against the president or the president's messengers in Congress.",
        "That's why you saw the House flip as it did just this last election cycle.",
        "I think that we need to not only connect the immediate battle but to the larger battle's going forward, because if not, I think the Republican Party has profound problems ahead given the change in demographics and given the tone that they see coming out of the White House.",
        "Speaking of tone, I mean, Democrats have - many Democrats, including virtually all of the presidential contenders, have made the case that President Trump is unfit for any number of reasons, not least of which is tone and not least of which is that he is perpetually dishonest.",
        "For example, just this weekend, there was this issue of whether he personally distorted the weather maps to reconcile them with incorrect information that he had given earlier in the week and would not abandon for some reason.",
        "You know, unfortunately, it's been demonstrated that there have been times when you have been personally dishonest during your time in office.",
        "So if voters highly value personal honesty, why would you be the right choice for them?",

        "But there was a rumor going around that he once again had a sexual relationship and that the administration let him go.",
        "I think the question is, did I learn from it?",
        "Contrast it with the president has suggested in saying that there's nothing that he regrets.",
        "There's deep regret from my end, and I think what's equally telling is the people who knew me best, in the wake of that event, those very folks sent me to the United States Congress to represent them in Washington."
