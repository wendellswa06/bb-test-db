        "John, thanks.",

        "You know, like at Upper Big Branch mine and British Petroleum and everything is let's take care of the organization and the heck with the people.",
        "That's not right.",
        "John, thanks very much for the phone call.",
        "We appreciate you sharing your story.",
        "And Mindy Mitnick, there is an aspect of this - any official at Penn State has to, and I know that this sounds bad, but has to, as they hear these allegations, calculate in somebody is going to sue us for many millions of dollars, and that has to be part of their thinking, no?",
        "I think it is, but I've worked on those kinds of lawsuits both for the institution and for the child victimized.",
        "And my experience is that when institutions come forward and say this was a terrible thing that happened, we are implementing policies to make sure that nothing like this can ever happen again, the people who have been victimized feel very differently about the institution than when their concerns, when the harm that's been done of the child, is brushed aside or covered up.",
        "Or seemingly put in second place - second place to the future of the institution itself.",

        "And again, one of the consistent factors in these kinds of institutional stories is that someone other than the victim knew about it.",
        "Correct.",
        "And how do you develop a culture that encourages people to come forward?",
        "Well, one of the things that Mindy said is really important.",
        "Institutions need to be able to acknowledge that there are some instances of abuse taking place within their organization.",
        "They need to be able to recognize that, and they need to establish policies, hopefully first to prevent them from happening.",
        "But then how do they respond if something does happen?",
        "It needs to be an immediate response.",
        "It needs to be something where they conduct, they work with the authorities in conducting an investigation as opposed to trying to deal with it within their own confines of the organization.",
        "The authorities, an important point.",
        "Do people need to be trained to call the police?",
        "Training is absolutely critical.",
        "We need to train people when they're working in any kind of a field where abuses may take place.",
        "They need to understand how to recognize the signs and symptoms of victims.",
        "They need to recognize the signs and symptoms of all forms of maltreatment, and they need to understand what their responsibilities are as mandated reporters and how to report, and they need to understand that beyond the law, there's an ethical or moral obligation that they should adhere to in making those reports for protecting kids.",
        "Because what we know about children is that they are probably not going to come forward on their own, and the abuse is going to continue unless somebody recognizes that it's taking place.",
        "Yes, and in fact it's much easier for children to report when the perpetrator is a stranger to them or somebody who isn't important in their life and so much harder when it's somebody who is somebody they depend on, is somebody who has authority over them, is somebody who facilitates their participation in school activities, a religious organization.",
        "And so all of those are much more difficult for children to let others know about because there really is this sort of sense of who are they going to believe.",
        "Are they going to believe me or this person who has so much more power and authority than me?"
