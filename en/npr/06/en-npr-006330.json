        "I was only 16 at the time, and I was really scared for her, and I didn't know what to do, and I wasn't really aware of what I could have done.",
        "But now that I'm older, and I see this man from Penn State, what he did, I see that absolutely we should have gone forward, and I regret not saying anything.",
        "Katie, thanks very much for the call.",
        "And Amy Russell, there seems to have been a pattern in some institutions, and this has been known to happen in schools, we'll just let this person go, and let's not create a fuss here.",
        "As long as they're not here, they can't hurt another one of our students.",
        "Right, and unfortunately what that leads to is they'll move on to someplace else.",

        "They don't know what they've done in other organizations in which they've worked, and that frees them up to continue victimizing.",
        "And these kids who have said, you know, first of all she had a sexual relationship, it wasn't a relationship, it was sexual abuse with an adult.",
        "And the responsibility didn't fall on her teenage friends to come forward and tell anybody.",
        "The responsibility should have fallen to the colleagues working with this person.",
        "I would venture a guess to say that these colleagues that worked with this teacher probably had some suspicion or some concerns that were some inappropriate contacts or relationships between this teacher and some of the students.",
        "And what we know from research, what we know from practical exp, is when people know somebody else, when they work closely with them, they are less likely to report them.",
        "They don't want to get people in trouble.",
        "They feel like they need to be able to prove out the allegation.",
        "They don't want to ruin relationships.",
        "And that's just not the case.",
        "What we should be worried about is the children and the harm that this continuing - this person continuing to work with these children is doing.",
        "And that's why those policies are so critical to set in place.",
        "Oftentimes schools will have policies that say, you know, if you suspect abuse, go to the principal, and the principal will do an investigation, or they'll figure something out, and they'll make the report when in fact that shouldn't be the way the policies work.",
        "Each of us have an individual responsibility to report, and there was a mention earlier about the Boy Scouts.",
        "In fact, the Boy Scouts are one of the organizations who's done a great deal of work to turn around that public perception, to turn around some of the policies that were not helpful for kids.",
        "They've instituted a great deal of training.",
        "They've instituted no one-on-one interactions with kids.",
        "They have completely open programs, which doesn't allow secrets anymore, and they tell everybody who comes in contact with kids that youth protection begins with you.",
        "We have to institute those kinds of training programs and policies within organizations, and we need to back that up with ongoing training.",
        "We need to train people who are coming up through colleges in how to deal with kids, how to recognize signs and symptoms."

        "Well, one thing you have to remember, Neal, you know, we're coming up, it's amazing where time goes – January will be 10 years since the Boston Globe first reported the scandal, and it became a national eruption from that point.",
        "But the way things have changed so much, I mean it's been a staggering shift.",
        "But, you know, you were saying earlier about the need for policies, but - one thing the church has learned, I think, the last 10 years is that policies alone aren't enough.",
        "You know, you need enforcement mechanisms and you need to kind of make examples of people who don't report.",
        "And that was the biggest problem for many years, that people turned and look the other way, because, like the caller earlier said, they had concerns about their jobs, their livelihoods, especially when you're kind of wedded to the institution as opposed to it just being a job.",
        "And so it's been a long time of (unintelligible) learning, but you know, in a fairly quick space of time.",
        "And an institution where as you say people are wedded to it, the Catholic church is unique in that respect, I think.",
        "But there are still people lodged within that institution who face allegations that they did not do enough.",
        "Well, you have that, but I think that now you have it being handled within the criminal justice system in a way we didn't before, you know?",
        "Remember, for the first time last month, you have a bishop now indicted, the bishop of Kansas City, Missouri.",
        "He'll face trial next year.",
        "You have a former vicar for clergy, head of clergy personnel here in Philadelphia, because we had our own grand jury report about the archdiocese in sexual abuse this year, going to trial in March.",
        "And so I think that's a needed deterrent.",
        "I mean, even just earlier, you know, even just in terms of how the church handles its own processes, there was a story I had heard out of California where a priest who failed to - who knew that another priest was abusing, just last year, and failed to report it to his bishop or to the authorities, that priest was removed from ministry.",
        "That's usually to be a penalty reserved for those who have abused themselves."

        "I did everything in my power.",

        "So this caller who talks about the child had reported to her, the investigators - I'm not sure what happened in the case, but they should have talked to her to gather as much information from her as well, interviewed other children in the daycare center who may also are likely victims.",
