        "The report initiates an investigation.",
        "And we have learned.",

        "My organization is one in particular who has worked very hard to train other people on how to conduct appropriate investigations and forensic interviews when there are allegations.",
        "And there are, unfortunately, false allegations of abuse, but they are rare.",
        "And when we do complete investigations with good, well-trained interviewers and follow up those interviews to try to find corroborating evidence, we are weeding out those false allegations.",
        "When we work together as multidisciplinary teams to do a complete investigation to try to get to the truth of the matter, that's when we're doing our service.",
        "If we're not reporting, because people feel like they have to have proof before they go forward - quite frankly, teachers aren't trained as investigators.",
        "They're not trained in understanding the dynamics of victimization.",
        "Coaches aren't trained in understanding how they have to gather evidence.",
