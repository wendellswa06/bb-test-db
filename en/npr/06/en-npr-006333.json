        "But let's start with where you start in the book, where you talk about the importance of a decision that the majority leader Mitch McConnell made - Republican leader - made in February of 2016.",
        "What was the decision?",
        "I think this was one of the most consequential decisions in American history, really, as it turned out.",

        "I know.",

        "So one side pushes its issues through, or they use executive orders.",

        "So what's new here?",

        "And in the book, there's a discussion on the night that Scalia dies that Don McGahn, who actually plays guitar in a pretty good rock 'n' roll band - he's a good guitar player - was driving down to Ocean City for a weekend gig.",
