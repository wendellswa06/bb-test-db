        "Do you expect to see the whole field of moon research just totally blown up by this constraint that's been removed?",
        "It's kind of like the impact simulations themselves.",
        "There's this huge global mess of stuff.",
        "There's papers coming out, pretty rapidly.",
        "You can hardly keep track of progress in the field.",
        "I can just sort of state maybe three of the main ones, like what if Theia hit the Earth and didn't accrete with the Earth but bounced off and left the Earth as a big spinning mess.",
        "What if you had two equal-sized semi-Earths accreting, and then you make the moon that way?",
        "And that's a paper recently coming out by Robin Canup.",
        "And what if you had - this started with an already-spinning muffin and then just hit it with a small thing?",
        "And the problem is all of these can give you disks around the Earth that - from which the moon can form.",
        "And the hidden secret behind all this - I think what a lot of listeners probably don't appreciate or don't know, and a lot of scientists probably don't know either - is nobody's actually made the moon in any of these simulations.",
        "What people have made is a disk of material orbiting the Earth from which the moon would eventually be made, we think.",
        "Now, it's true that the moon's moving away from us, right?",
        "Yeah, it's moving at a fairly fast clip, kind of the same rate that continents creep around on the Earth.",
        "I mean, does that mean that someday we're going to lose our moon?",
        "We'll never lose it because it's being basically torqued out into Earth by the spin of the Earth.",
        "The moon raises tides on the Earth, as everybody knows, and those tides kind of get slung around by the Earth a little bit ahead of the moon and its orbit, because the moon orbits the Earth once a moon, the Earth spins every day, and so this tidal bulge keeps pulling on the moon and kind of ratcheting around outwards and outwards into outward spirals.",
        "And that drains the spin of the Earth.",
        "What's going to happen billions of years from now is Earth's going to slow down until it equals the spin rate of the moon's orbit, and then you'll have a double planet locked and frozen together until the end of time."

        "Yeah, the Earth's spinning down.",
        "And this actually goes back to George Darwin's original idea that the Earth could have been spinning really fast because being the son of Charles Darwin, he was familiar with the fossil record, and there were these puzzles when you looked at certain fossils that should have little layers accreted on the - you know, I think it was corals every day.",
        "You know, go deep back into the fossil record, and you start to see 400 layers accreted per year instead of 365.",
        "And so there was this evidence that there were more days per year, which indicates that the days were shorter.",
