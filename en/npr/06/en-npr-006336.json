        "Why didn't you just say you were guilty?",

        "Even being in prison for something I didn't do, in my heart, I was at peace.",
        "The hardest part for me throughout making that decision was convincing the people around me that I could not take this deal.",
        "Do I miss all the years that I lost?",
        "Yes, and there's no way I could get those back.",
        "So I try not to focus on the loss, I just tried to focus on the future and whatever I have left.",
        "I try to cherish every moment I have left.",
        "Mark, you have these two trials.",
        "You have the chance that Darryl turned down to say he was guilty to get out of prison.",
        "And then 10 years into him being in prison, DNA evidence seems to exonerate him, but he goes on to serve almost 10 more years.",
        "What was your feeling about the nature of the justice system or the nature of your representation of Darryl?",
        "Well, when I first found out from the lab that the DNA cleared Darryl, I felt like that was going to be the end of the case.",
        "I felt like there was not going to be any question about whether Darryl should be released.",
        "It just seemed so clear.",
        "And then as we got closer to that hearing and the DA said they were going to fight it, I was still hopeful that the judge would do the right thing.",
        "In fact, I think I told Darryl the judge probably had no choice but to let him out to give him a new trial.",
        "And so when the judge ruled against us in November of 1994, it was devastating.",
        "I was about as angry as a person could be.",
        "I remember when I left the courthouse that day, slamming my fist on a steel door and went from there and ran about 10 miles just to, sort of, cool down so I could figure out where to go.",
        "Darryl, how did you feel?",
        "I questioned my existence at that point and it wasn't until, actually I went back to prison.",
        "I was actually walking back in the prison gate.",
        "A friend of mine, who is younger than me said that he was happy that I was back.",
        "And at first it thought that was some kind of sick joke.",
        "And then he told me that his mother had passed and he was thinking about escaping or committing suicide or something.",
        "And for me that was my purpose for coming back because he said I was the only person that he could talk to.",
        "If all Darryl did was save that one life through this lost that would be great, but it's a whole lot more and there's and we could certainly talk about a lot of things that have come about as a result of Darryl's release.",
        "But to us it's a - there's a lot of divine intervention with all this.",

        "I mean, you just go on and on but what this film has been able to do, in Darryl's case, has been able to do is expose that.",
        "And Winston-Salem, yes, is a much better place today because the people in power are aware of what happened.",
        "There is still racism there.",
        "There's still racism within me.",
        "But the best thing we can do is to be aware of it so that it can go away.",
