        "Duff Badgley is the Green Party candidate for governor.",

        "But with the new top-two system, he's almost certain to be knocked out now, in August, effectively ending his campaign early.",
        "It will take from me the bully pulpit, which is a vital way for me to get out the word.",

        "In 2004, we had 49 partisan candidates in Washington state.",
        "This year, we have four.",
        "So many people who wanted to run felt like this was a race like you're running the Boston Marathon, and they're going to tell you halfway through that, sorry, because you're not in the top two, we're not going to let you go on and finish the race.",
        "Lindsley says if the new primary was meant to increase voter choice, well, then, it's backfired.",
        "For example, he said, there are parts of Seattle where races will likely be narrowed down to two Democrats.",
        "That menas on the November ballot, there will be just one party represented.",
        "But that's a good thing, says the man who helped to design the system.",
        "David Olson says in areas where one party is that strong, the new primary forces entrenched incumbents to face upstarts from their own party in the general election.",
        "Still, Olson does sympathize with the small parties' broader complaint.",
        "I'm the first to acknowledge: Third parties are going to be discriminated against by this system.",
        "But Olson says the only way to fix that discrimination would be a more radical change in the rules, something like proportional representation or maybe even a move toward a parliamentary system.",

        "I personally can't do that but some of the people here can tell by listening if it likely is or is not the same person.",
