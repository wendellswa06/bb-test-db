        "in terms of nuclear power?",
        "It's a rather reasonable goal, I must say.",
        "As you know, to 3rd January of 1912(ph), Russia as well as States have to have between 1,700 to 2,200 nuclear warheads.",
        "And...",
        "And where are they getting these from?",
        "Russia has a lot of problems because it has to dissolve - take from duty now heavy missiles, which are very powerful but at the same time very, very old and very dangerous.",

        "That's why our industry is in a hurry just to produce new missile (unintelligible) for our nuclear submarines.",
        "The problem is that, quoting Russian leadership, we still look at Russian-American relation and even more in Russian-Western relations through the perspective of mutual deterrence.",
        "Russian leadership is still sure that its value in the world is determined by number of nuclear warheads."

        "How do the Russian people feel about this, what the first deputy prime minister has been saying?",

There's no hoses and there's no lights, there's no - so I used my mini van and turn it into a fire engine, just got a whole bunch of storage boxes, plastic boxes and fill them with water - and bucket, just got burning back and forth between my brother's house and my house and dumping water on it and then leave -stopped one fire, anyway.",

        "People are going to have the right to bear arms.",
        "But we have to figure out a way to stop those arms from getting in people's hands that are going to hurt innocents.",
        "And so the president's well aware of that.",
        "He wants to respect the freedom that the NRA wants.",
        "But he also wants to figure out a way to ensure safety for innocent people.",
        "So I think every person at that table should be appropriately disappointed leaving the table.",
        "The president's good at that.",
        "And I think a deal will get cut that intersects those values for the country.",
        "One last, I think, pretty blunt question we've got in 40 seconds left - why is President Trump more critical of Alec Baldwin than he is of Vladimir Putin on this week when Putin shows an animated video of Russian missiles smacking Florida?"
