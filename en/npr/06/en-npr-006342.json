        "But the state and private donors stepped in, and Jackson says the project continued.",
        "The reason that they entered this project is that they wanted to give the Israelis a sense of pride and unity.",

        "You would design you would craft a particular tweet, a particular salient, emotional content, something that people would like to pass along, that looks kind of true but perhaps isn't.",
        "And then you could start to coordinate spreading that meme and sending it to your followers and so on.",
        "You know, it's really as simple as that.",
        "Since we don't have a very precise machine definition of what it means to be - for a meme to be truthy, it's really difficult to tell how to best do that.",
        "But the fact is that people are doing this.",
        "There's no doubt that both political parties or any political groups are actually using Twitter deliberately to spread misleading and deceiving information.",
        "And one other interesting part of this is that you mentioned at the beginning that once this starts to spread, it makes its way into the Google search engine, and that adds another layer to it.",
        "That adds a really interesting feedback loop because once it generates enough activity, and it's actually listed at the top of those search results, then people may actually click on that tweet and may start to re-tweet it themselves, and that generates more traffic, and it increases the ranking of that tweet on Google, and so you get a really nice positive feedback loop where from very humble beginnings, so to speak, you can launch a meme into the public consciousness and have it propagate.",
        "So it's really a little bit like studying flu epidemics, and one member of our team is one of the world's leading experts in how diseases actually spread from person to person, and the process in which these tweets spread from person to person may be modeled along the same lines.",
        "Is there anything illegal about doing that?",
        "No, I don't think so.",
        "I mean, it's really difficult to well, let me put it this way.",
        "I think there's laws on slander and so on that would stop you from posting things that are, you know, illegal or hate speech.",
        "But I think it's perfectly viable to come up with something that is truthy, you know, just truthy enough then to not be illegal and to make it popular enough to affect political outcomes."
