        "And so are you going to be watching for this, this election cycle?",
        "Yes, we're very much hoping to do that, and hopefully we can continue this effort past the elections because there will be more elections, and there will be more events where it will be necessary to monitor the truthiness of the memes that are circulating on Twitter.",
        "In fact, we're fully anticipating releasing our data and our software to the public so other people can actually build on top of what we've done.",
        "Well, we have a video up on our website, at sciencefriday.com, of this re-tweet that we started.",
        "And if you want to go look at it, you can go to, as I say, go to sciencefriday.com and watch it spread and watch the re-tweets happen and get sort of a demonstration of what you're talking about.",
        "And I understand you're going to be updating it for us as we go along.",
        "Yes, yes, because apparently that network is still evolving, and, you know, on our website we actually showed the amount of activity over time that a particular meme receives, and you can actually really see that there's a first wave where that tweet was actually launched, and we can see sort of the spike in activity with regards to that meme and then a second spike of activity that seems to correspond to the network developing additional branches, and so on.",
        "It's a really nice, it's a really nice animation.",
        "And how soon will you have other, other of these up there?",
        "If you find something suspicious, will you be posting things yourself as the weeks go on?",
        "Well, the website automatically updates.",
        "So whenever a meme achieves a certain level of activity, we catch that, and we update the website to include that meme.",
        "So it's constantly refreshing in real time, and you know, if anyone launches a truthy meme that gets enough traction, we'll be able to find it in our data.",
        "You know, this is always sort of a spy-versus-spy world.",
        "Do you think people are now looking already at your truthy ideas and saying, gee, how do we get around this thing?",
        "I bet they are.",
        "You know, that wouldn't surprise me.",
        "But at the same time, hopefully we've increased the cost of doing these things, just enough to make it a little less likely."

        "Well, I wouldn't say monetary cost, but you know, if right now it's really easy to set up, you know, 10 Twitter accounts and start spreading these memes and hoping they go viral, and they get a lot of traction.",
        "But it may very well be that in the future, when people actually catch those kind of patterns, like the dandelion that we're seeing with the meme that we created and that we launched deliberately, you know, once people notice that that's one of the features we're looking at, they may have to involve a lot more people in spreading these kind of memes.",
        "Is there any second generation or third generation to this?",
        "Are you thinking ahead or just trying to get this, this stage settled?",
        "Yes, well, we're first trying to get this stage settled.",
        "So we're definitely looking at all of the different features.",
        "Actually, users can go to the website right now and, for example, report whether they think a meme is particularly truthy.",
        "There's a whole bunch of other features, like the number of users per tweet, the growth of the meme and so on.",
        "And we're definitely looking to generate automated methods that would allow us to look at all of these different features and then provide some kind of an assessment to the truthiness of the meme.",
        "Well, if you'd like to participate, we'll be going all day, and for the next few days you can go to our website at sciencefriday.com, and you can tweet us @scifri, join our Twitter group and then re-tweet truthy@indiana and see how well that works.",
        "And it's all there on our page at sciencefriday.com.",
        "I want to thank you for taking time and for helping us out with this crowd-sourcing today.",
