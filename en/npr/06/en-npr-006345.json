        "All right.",
        "We need more of that.",
        "James, thanks very much for the call.",
        "And James, I think, speaks to a situation that we have spoken about - not just Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow or, for that matter, Bill O'Reilly or Glenn Beck.",
        "But this seems to be what we expect of cable television hosts these days.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "And I think he used the word propaganda, which is an interesting word.",
        "I mean, you know, if you skew your news always from one point of view and try to sell that point of view, it becomes propaganda if you also ignore the facts.",
        "I think what Olbermann would argue is that he had a point of view, but he presented the facts.",
        "And certainly, Rachel Maddow tries to do that.",
        "I think NBC - MSNBC is in a different position, though, from Fox News, because the NBC News division - which, you know, operates MSNBC - has a straight news outlet, which is, of course, on Channel 4, whatever the broadcast channel is.",
        "And they don't - they really chafed a little bit under the, you know, the harsh commentary that you'd hear coming out of Olbermann.",
        "And I think that put them in a different position because they don't want to be a propaganda channel.",
        "They want to fight against that.",
        "They want to be OK, we have an editorial point of view, but we're presenting real news, real facts, and we're not twisting the truth.",
        "And that's why you saw criticism of Keith Olbermann from, among others, Tom Brokaw.",
        "Well, exactly.",
        "Tom Brokaw criticized him because he was on the air, saying comments that he felt were unfair to Hillary Clinton during the campaign in 2008.",
        "He just said, that's just not fair - he openly said it on the air.",
        "And you can see that he was not comfortable with the idea that Keith was not just doing commentary, but he was literally anchoring their news that night - on several nights of the primary campaigns.",

        "That's right.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And it just seemed kind of strange, I guess, would be a good way of putting it, that he left as abruptly as he did.",
        "And when I - you know, it was pointed out even during that time that there were other members of the NBC and MSNBC's staff that have made contributions to other candidates, and nothing was said about it.",
        "So I think it could be that maybe, let's put it politely, Keith took umbrage at it.",
        "And I'll take any comments off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Dan(ph), thanks very much - Don, excuse me, thanks very much.",
        "Yeah, well, he certainly did take umbrage.",
        "He was unhappy.",
        "He conveyed that unhappiness.",
        "His response was hardly apologetic to management for the suspension.",
        "He said they didn't lay out the rules clearly.",
        "And, you know, it was a reflection of a growing, you know, dispute between him and management, which had been going on for some time.",
        "He had actually engaged new agents in September.",
        "And I think partly it was, you know, a long-range plan to see what, you know, his future was going to be there, and maybe he would find an exit strategy, and then he gets suspended in November.",
        "And it got very close to him being fired because he, at one point, threatened to go on Good Morning America to talk about the situation with MSNBC - a rival of the Today Show, NBC's show.",
        "And I know that management - Jeff Zucker, who is the CEO - would have fired him on the spot had he done that."

        "Here's a tweet we have from Joshua Schaffer(ph): Was it a coincidence that he left after Comcast acquired NBC Universal, the merger just approved by the FCC earlier last week?",
        "Coincidence is maybe not the right word.",
        "I think it wasn't overtly tied to that.",
        "But it was clear in everyone's mind that, you know, Keith had been, you know - obviously - rubbing the management of NBC the wrong way for some time.",
        "And the NBC News management - Phil Griffin at MSNBC, and Steve Capus at NBC News - were going to continue even after the Comcast merger.",
        "But would he have been protected the way he was?",
        "Would his, you know, sometimes, you know, questionable - not questionable, but aggressive behavior be tolerated?",
        "I think there was a question about whether that was going to happen.",

        "Let's get it settled.",
        "They contacted Comcast, let them know it was going to happen.",
        "The Comcast executives say, we had no operational control while this was going on - which is technically true, although they were definitely consulting and talking to NBC News at the time.",
        "I don't think it was politically motivated because I don't think Comcast wanted to be in the middle of, you know, a questionable activity like this, where they could be accused of making a political decision.",
        "They don't want that as they start to take over NBC.",
        "I think they're probably relieved that they won't have to deal with it down the road.",

        "It would take a lot for them to, at this point, fire Rachel Maddow.",
        "It certainly would, but it would be shocking if they fire Rachel Maddow.",
