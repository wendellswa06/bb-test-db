        "He has been a D.C.",
        "lobbyist for a long time.",
        "He was the ambassador to Germany under President Bush.",
        "But he won a kind of underwhelming victory in yesterday's primary, a 39 percent in a three-way race.",
        "Some conservatives, stronger conservatives, did much better than expected.",
        "The Democratic nominee will be Brad Ellsworth.",
        "He will be picked by the State Democratic Convention on May 15.",
        "The reason there is no Democratic primary is because Evan Bayh dropped out of the race later in the process than expected.",
        "And anything to read into the fact that the conservative party challengers did not take over Dan Coats in that race?",
        "Well, yes and no. I mean, Coats had the establishment.",
        "He had the money.",
        "He had clearly the backing of the NRSC, the National Republican Senatorial Committee in Washington, and the establishment did back him.",
        "But again, as I say, it was an underwhelming performance.",
        "But again and Indiana of course went for Barack Obama for the a Democrat for the first time since 1964 in a presidential race.",
        "So there is a Democratic tide in Indiana.",
        "The question is whether Dan Coats, at 66 years old, is up for taking back that seat for the Republicans.",
        "He says he is.",
        "Democrats are skeptical about that.",
        "Ohio, you mentioned Rob Portman.",
        "What about on the Democratic side?",
        "Well, there was a battle between two statewide elected officials.",
        "The lieutenant governor, Lee Fisher, defeated Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner.",
        "The race was closer than expected.",
        "Polls had Lee Fisher, who had tons of money, the endorsement of Governor Ted Strickland and the establishment behind him, but he only won by 10 points.",
        "Not a very tight race, but again - one, it shows that female candidates to this day are still raising far less money than male candidates; but two, that Fisher was thought of as a stronger candidate in November, if for no other reason he could raise more money.",
        "But Rob Portman has much more money than both Democrats.",
        "So this is a seat for George Voinovich, that George Voinovich is giving up after two terms.",
        "Republicans think they can hold it on with Rob Portman.",
        "And North Carolina, there was a cast of thousands in the Democratic primary, hoping to take on one-term Senator Burr.",
        "Richard Burr is the Republican.",
        "At least three Democrats were running on that one.",
        "Again, it was a female candidate, Elaine Marshall, who finished on top.",
        "She is a four-term secretary of state.",
        "The Democratic establishment in Washington was backing Cal Cunningham, an Iraq war veteran, but you need 40 percent of the vote to win the primary in North Carolina.",
        "Even though Marshall finished first, she didn't get the 40 percent.",
        "So she and Cal Cunningham will go to a June 22nd runoff.",
        "Good news for Richard Burr because that means six more weeks of Democrats fighting each other while Burr can, you know, stock up on his money."

        "Any emerging themes from those three, about voter turnout or about the issues that emerged as important?",

        "Those were the establishment candidates.",

        "All of them seem to have survived, whether for better or for worse, and so the voters didn't seem to be turning out the incumbents that some people thought.",
        "Although, one congressman in Indiana, Dan Burton, long-time veteran of Congress, first elected in 1982, he barely was re-nominated with, like, 30 percent of the vote.",
        "He only won by two percentage points over his nearest Republican rival.",

        "Kennedy defeated Hubert Humphrey - a big battle over Catholicism versus Protestantism in a state like West Virginia - one of the classic primary battles in presidential history.",
        "And Utah, Bob Bennett's in trouble?",
        "Big trouble.",
        "He's in big trouble.",
        "It's a strange look, it's one thing, Charlie Crist has disappointed many conservatives in Florida; John McCain has disappointed many conservatives in Arizona; and certain we know about Arlen Specter, what happened to him in Pennsylvania.",
        "But Bob Bennett is a conservative Republican, however, not conservative enough for some Republicans in Utah.",
        "He voted for the TARP bailout program.",
        "He did some across-the-aisle talking about health care.",
        "And right now, if he does not get 40 percent of the vote at Saturday's Republican state convention, not only will he not be able to he won't even be able to compete in the June 22 Utah Republican primary.",
        "It looks like Bob Bennett will be out of a job come this Saturday, because he will not get the 40 percent, which is pretty remarkable."
