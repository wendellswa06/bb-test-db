        "So Arlen Specter agrees with Pat Toomey and congratulations, Pat, (unintelligible) is that on your son is that there should be a flat tax.",
        "He is the only senator who has proposed a piece of legislation last year on it where multimillionaires, who would be given a $210,000 tax cut.",
        "But the 95 percent of working families, all the rest of the taxpayers, would have a $3,000 tax increase to pay for it.",
        "So philosophically, he still agrees with George Bush in trickle-down economics.",
        "I believe in a small-business tax cut of 15 percent.",
        "I believe in a middle-class tax like child credit care you know, doubling that.",
        "But I believe we have to close the tax loophole that Arlen Specter voted for for large corporations, where they get a tax credit if they invest in a foreign factory.",
        "So he and I just have philosophical differences of how to help working families.",
        "So it's not about Arlen Specter or Joe Sestak.",
        "It's what do you believe, and will you be a person of principle when you get down there, and don't change your position or your party in order to try to win an election.",
        "Will you be willing to lose your job over what you believe and what you ran on?",
        "Congressman, he's a Arlen Specter has been running - he was elected, first elected in 1980.",
        "So he's been around for such a long time.",
        "He has the endorsement of President Obama, Governor Ed Rendell, even though he was a Republican until April 28th, 2009.",
        "The question is, there's a new poll that has you within seven points of Arlen Specter.",
        "It was 21 points last month.",
        "What has, in your opinion, what has changed the dynamic of this race?",
        "As you know, most of the undecided most of the polls had shown there was about 50 percent undecided.",
        "For a 30-year incumbent Republican senator who switched parties because, in his words, his prospects were bleak in a Republican primary against Pat Toomey, they just had already made their verdict."

        "But I also believe this, that we have put out a Pennsylvania working families plan, which has called for small business tax cuts, which has actually called for a change in how we address education, why I went to education committee and moved $62 billion, with others, with no added cuts to the - no adding to the national debt into Pell grants and subsidized loans.",
