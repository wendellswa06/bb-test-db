        "So it's not just about the Americans with Disabilities Act.",
        "It's about improving the downtown environment.",
        "Exactly.",
        "Now, I know that you went ahead and did, as part of your research, sort of an examination with other people who are blind and asked them to draw up maps of how they navigated Denver.",
        "That's right.",
        "I did.",
        "And what did you find out?",
        "Well, they were pretty well strikingly similar, and that was in the article that came out in Wired magazine this month.",
        "But I think the first important piece of that is that folks without sight - whether they be congenitally blind or adventitiously blind - are capable of drawing a legible sketch map of their - environment.",
        "In this case, it was from the light rail station in Littleton, Colorado, to the Colorado Center for the Blind.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And there were similar markings on their maps.",
        "That's right.",
        "The primary emphasis on every map was the path.",
        "And it's well-established in the academic literature that what is the fundamental background for an individual's cognitive map, that is how they recall an urban environment where their are is grounded on the path that they take, and a path is path because it has an edge.",
        "So, you know, the sidewalk is an excellent example of a path, and that's how people without sight really can navigate through the built environment.",
        "Then along the path and within the path, you find different kinds of landmarks, and sighted people use landmarks like the Rocky Mountains or the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty or, you know, large things they can see off in a distance.",
        "And, obviously, that isn't possible for somebody without sight, so their landmarks are really imbedded in that path.",
        "And imbedded in that path were things like - I was interested to read in that article in Wired magazine - the burning bush.",
        "Right.",
        "Right.",
        "And oftentimes - and this happens in neighborhoods alike where people have - there are gardens overgrowing, the trees or bushes and, you know, it's not something that a person without sight would really anticipate come into contact with.",
        "I have a friend who's blind in Reno, and he does something called guerilla gardening where he goes out.",
        "He's blind, and he takes some shears, and when he crashes into these bushes..."

        "(SOUNDBITE OF LAUGHTER)",
        "...chops them up, you know, so he's doing his neighbors a favor, I reckon.",
        "Known as the burning bush because everybody ran into it one time or another, yeah.",
        "Uh-huh.",
        "Exactly.",
        "There was also the DNA pole.",
        "That's right.",
        "So ill-placed things that are - signs, for example.",
        "Poles that have signs that are conveying information to sighted people, whether it'd be the bus stop or when the bus comes or what buses come or stop, danger, don't enter, detour; many of those signs could be permanent even, and they are not - they're just right in the path that you're walking on the sidewalk, and it wasn't really thought out very clearly from the engineers where to place them.",
        "But I was fascinated more - as interesting as those are, I was fascinated that when you looked at the paths that the blind people took, and if there was a big, blank space where none of the blind people went, there you could a find problem that's not going to be just for blind people.",
        "It's going to be for everybody.",
        "Yeah.",
        "It's interesting and a little bit ironic that it took a blind person to figure out - to be able to see what's missing, what isn't there, you know?",
        "So, right.",
        "What find in the parking lots are these vague places because they don't have any edges or paths.",
        "So those aren't really good places, and they are not good for pedestrian in general.",
        "So if there's a blank place, it means nobody walks there because it's too difficult, or it's too confusing, or it's just, you know, a big problem.",
        "The street is too wide.",
        "It's huge.",
        "Oftentimes, you're not able to gather enough information from your immediate environment to be able to move from your orientation to your destination.",
        "So a path is really important.",
        "And oftentimes, you know, you can have a path through a park that's a social path, you know, that people just wear out the grass and there's a rut in the road, and so that's a path as well."

        "And it's something that's really important for us all to be able to maintain independent living and quality of life.",
        "When the Americans with Disabilities Act passed, a lot of urban planners and a lot of cities really thought of it as a huge headache.",
        "They had to retrofit things like the New York City subway to be, you know, accessible to people in wheelchairs.",
        "It's not going to be an easy to do.",
        "But as places now go ahead with projects like light rail, which is exploding all over the country, these kinds of designs can be incorporated from the beginning.",
        "Well, that's my hope.",
        "And I will say that when the Americans with Disabilities Act really came out in 1991, it was pretty easy to identify, you know, the physical things that needed to be changed to make it - built environment accessible for people in wheelchairs.",
        "And at that time, we didn't have the kind of technology that we have today that will enable people without sight to have access to information.",
        "So all of the signs that are ubiquitous, whether they'd be in airports or train stations and light rail stations - and you're absolutely right, Denver is exploding on the scene with the largest investment in light rail ever in American history.",
        "So it's important that we can pull those things together now and really embrace the technology that we have and put them into our light rail stations so that all people have access to information in a sort of multisensory modality.",
        "I also wonder how modern technology is going to affect this if a blind person, for example, carrying around a device that knows where he or she is.",
        "Can't that device say, oh, by the way, there's a red light.",

        "So if you're relying on a piece of technology to tell you that it's safe to cross a major intersection, that might not be as reliable as just following the flow of the traffic that blind people are already trained to do.",

        "And so, oftentimes, they're not taking into account the fact that people want the old-fashioned ability to feel the tactile buttons, right, the raised buttons on phones.",
