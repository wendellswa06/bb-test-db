        "You know, that's always been the myth and the argument that's been used against raising the minimum wage, and I absolutely don't buy it.",
        "You know, I think if you look at the productivity of American workers, it has been increasing.",
        "And the fact that the minimum wage has been unchanged since 1997 and you look at the proportion of the working poor that's growing in this country, people living below the poverty line, I think it's shameful for Congress to reject this, particularly since they've given themselves raises consistently over the last five to seven years.",

        "Only 20 percent of people who earn minimum wage actually support families.",
        "And according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 60 percent of those making minimum wage are under the age of 25 and are usually teen-agers working part-time jobs.",
        "What we need to understand is that productivity in this country is hurt when the government forces businesses, small businesses, to increase the minimum wage that isn't consistent with their productivity.",
        "What it does is it prices out the lower-skilled workers.",
        "If a business is forced to raise their minimum wage to 7.25, which is ultimately what Senator Kennedy wanted to do, but they're getting workers that only produce $4 worth of work, that is an economic loss for those businesses, and it's considered a tax on that."

        "And what statistics have also shown, the Small Business Administration showed that whenever--the slower wage growth among lower workers takes place when a minimum wage is increased.",
        "So there is a correlation between a diminishing in wage growth opportunities when the minimum wage is imposed by the government.",
        "George, isn't this part of the problem, what we heard, quite frankly, from Walter and Tara, the idea that all of these numbers you can play with and play with and play with till the cows come home, but the 20 percent that Tara talked about, the idea of these families with children, let alone just single people, are withering on the vine.",
        "And the fact is that these--you know, you can hear the regular poppycock stuff you just heard.",
        "The fact is that if senators can--have the nerve to increase their salary seven times, worth $28,000, I mean--but at the same time, not increase the minimum wage I think is absolutely horrendous, because what we're talking about is just liveable wages, and this is just another example of a double standard that Congress has.",
        "All right.",
        "Walter, this does not kill the idea of the minimum wage being raised, but it makes it much harder, obviously, again, with the timing.",

        "We note--we should note that many states, in fact, have a higher minimum wage requirement than does the federal government.",

        "I mean, even when you look at teen-agers, many teen-agers are helping to support the families.",

        "You know, even though 75 percent of all jobs are created by small businesses, which have employees less than 100, they are the most financially unstable.",
        "And what this does, when the government forces them to raise the minimum wage, it creates a burden on the business.",
