        "Last Friday in the Wall Street Journal, John Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations posed the question, what if Israel attacks Iran?",
        "Israel's military option against Iran's nuclear program is unattractive, he argued, but failing to act is even worse.",

        "Right.",
        "That's why I said I don't think this is a very attractive option.",
        "And it's too bad that we've wasted so much time on failed diplomatic efforts.",
        "I think we're doomed to failure from the outset because we have - as time has gone by, we have lost a range of options and that's why we're down now to the very unattractive consideration of use of force.",
        "Although I will say that the turmoil that we're seeing in Iran today brings closer the possibility that we're in a real pre-revolutionary moment in Iran and that that in turn could lead to what I think is the -truly the most desirable circumstance, which is the overthrow of the Islamic Revolution of 1979.",
        "We're not there by any stretch of the imagination, at least not yet.",
        "Going back to your scenarios, though, Iran has vowed that if it was attacked by Israel - well, first of all, wouldn't it assume that the United States had provided at least tacit permission for Israel to attack Iran?",
        "After all, Israeli aircraft would have to overfly Iraq or the Persian Gulf, both of which the air space is controlled by the United States.",

        "I wasn't surprised to see the police waiting for me when I walked out of Gwadar's tiny airport.",

        "It's the $64,000 question and it's probably most important for our success or failure in our fight in Russia, because in Russian political and cultural tradition it was not the case where people could see the connection between high living standards and political freedom.",
        "But now they keep asking a simple question.",
        "Why at the time, when country's treasury is filled with billions and billions of dollars from the oil and gas export, why at this time the living standards for majority of Russians are declining?",
        "And they are suspecting, yet they are not sure, but they are suspecting that it has something to do with the fact that there is very little, if any, of public control left in the country, which means that bureaucracy is fully in charge and the corruption is spreading."
