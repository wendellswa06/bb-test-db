        "Absolutely, and of course I was incredulous as well as suspicious.",
        "Fortunate for the fossil and the fossil-collector and for science, the specimen came out largely in a block, and so you could see the bones connected.",
        "It was very complete.",
        "But secondly, we didn't take anything for granted.",
        "We saved virtually everything that was stuck on that block, the sediment, fish bones, the clams as big as your palms stuck right to the dinosaur.",
        "That tells you the dinosaur was buried near a lake margin, and that's a real key to where it came from in that part of Asia.",
        "But was it still a juvenile?",
        "Was it a juvenile of one of the big ones?",
        "For that, we had to prove the age of the specimen, and there's a couple ways to do that.",
        "The first is to examine the skeleton grossly because this dinosaur, like you and I, have bones that fuse with growth and maturity, and many of those bones were fused.",
        "Enough were fused, as in the pelvic girdle and the vertebral column, that clearly this dinosaur was not going to get much more than about 10 or 15 percent bigger.",
        "But then we took one of the thigh bones and sectioned it, thin-sectioned it, because this has become now a cottage industry to figure out, almost like reading tree rings, pretty much how old the animal was, five to six years, and it was still growing, although we think toward the very end of its growth range.",
        "Now, we've done that with T.",
        "rex, and we've done it with all sorts of Tyrannosaurs, and so we have a really great comparative sample, and it fits right in where it should: a small animal, maturing at about six to seven, old by 10.",
        "T.",
        "rex, by comparison, matures at about 15 years, is getting old by 20.",
        "Sue, the one I pictured this dinosaur with in skull and forelimb, is 28 and by far the geriatric among the Tyrannosaurs.",

        "They say, well, okay Dr. Sereno, but you didn't see the jaw muscles on the fossil.",
        "That's true.",
        "But we have really good marks, sagittal crests and fossae, that show us the size of the jaw muscles.",
        "And off the scale for predators who have really, really strong jaws.",
        "So what the Tyrannosaur mold is, is to put this big head and muscled jaws on the end of running legs, really some of the fastest legs we have for predators.",
