        "Right.",
        "It's a great question.",
        "Why isn't this fossil just a Tyrannosaur parallel?",
        "Well, what we do is we look at all the features of the animal, and we see and score it in all Theropod dinosaurs.",
        "And that's the meat-eating dinosaurs, because we know it would fit somewhere in there.",
        "And, you know, this - ultimately be a certainly boring part of the research because it's so obvious.",

        "There's no other rational place we can put it.",
        "In other words, there's no other features in the animal if you - that would ally it with another group of dinosaurs that might have a short arm.",
        "And so there are a few other predators that do have short arms - they look quite different.",
        "We plotted the arm out and it smack plots right with the Tyrannosaurus.",
        "All the features there suggest Tyrannosaur relationships.",
        "I think we have, you know, a classic Tyrannosaur.",

        "There are feathered dinosaur beds where you get the skeleton of these small forms, including another primitive Tyrannosaur Dilon(ph)that actually preserved the carbonized remains of rudimentary branching feathers.",
        "That's why we reconstructed those on Raptorex the way we did in the flesh model.",

        "I have a tweet here from Gentfred(ph) who says, does this mean in 50 million years, humans might evolve to be several stories tall with short, stubbly arms?",
        "Well, see, this is actually the reasoning that led us, to some extent, astray.",
        "It's perfectly reasonable to think that what we see in development could just be tweaked and extended and we would look different because different parts of our body are evolving at different rates.",
        "Humans, for example, is born with a large head, our bodies catch up.",
        "Our legs are small - they catch up when we start walking in about two or three, they start growing faster.",
        "What if we just extend it then, we'd be really long legged pinheads.",

        "That's what's revolutionary about the specimen in terms of mechanics, evolution and so on.",
        "It was all put together at pint size.",
        "And then I think, rarely, can this actually occur in evolution, where you can take something that's 150 pounds and basically, bone for bone, ratio for ratio - allowing for some robustness to handle the weight, scale it up to five or six tons.",
        "But it happened in the case of Tyrannosaurs.",
        "The evidence is at hand.",
        "And as you say, it might have happened with the other big dinosaurs too?",
        "It might have, but I think we probably would have found more tell-tale signs, but I - we're always missing some small ones and so we're waiting to see what happens.",
