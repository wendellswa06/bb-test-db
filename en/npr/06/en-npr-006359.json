        "Unfortunately, this judge does have the shadow or cloud of being politically motivated with this ruling here.",
        "Because from a legal standpoint, even liberals, the Daily Kos, which is a very left-leaning blog site, had criticized the legal foundation of this ruling.",
        "They called it poorly reasoned and totally unhelpful.",
        "And many legal experts have concluded that this is a conclusionary(ph) ruling, which means that, yes, it may be convincing but there's not enough supporting evidence to really support her arguments here.",
        "She says that the president's -that they obviously violate the Fourth Amendment, that it's an indisputable violation of the First Amendment.",
        "But yet she provides no legal reasoning for why she comes to that conclusion.",
        "And the fact that she's a Carter administration appointee is - doesn't favor well for her position, and unfortunately it opens her up to an attack as far as whether this is legally motivated or not.",
        "She also pulled a very strange move during the Michigan affirmative action case.",
        "When a more conservative judge was assigned that Michigan affirmative action case, she petitioned to have him removed.",
        "That's extremely - that's highly irregular.",
        "So given the poorly legal reasoning that she gave for her decision, I think that that will go to the Sixth Circuit, which it will, and it will be overturned.",
        "All right.",
        "We'll let the scholars argue whether or not that was poorly legal reasoning.",
        "But one of the interesting things, Nat, is the idea that you always are going to be appointed by some president, whether it's Republican or Democrat.",
        "You can make that argument all the time.",
        "But one of the things that Joe and I were talking about off-mic before we got started is the idea that typically even if you see the political wrangling, you don't typically see folks take these judges to task politically.",
        "Publicly, publicly.",
        "Well, yeah.",

        "So it obviously was going to be viewed as a political judgment in the same way that the 2000 election was seen as a political decision by the court.",

        "And Attorney General Gonzales says that if that legislation is passed, then that would address some of the concerns raised by the judge, which indicates maybe this isn't a political decision.",

        "Well, of course.",

        "Is that the new reality of the way the global marketplace is working?",
        "Or is this giving opportunities and creating jobs for people in the community that the mom and pop stores couldn't do?",
        "However, Wal-Mart absolutely does not want to be associated with comments like this.",
        "And I just think that, given the historical context of these outside ethnic groups coming into the black community as merchants, and maybe taking away the opportunities from black-owned businesses to have these, is something that definitely is an emotional issue.",
