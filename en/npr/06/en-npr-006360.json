        "And you know, he - I think that some may feel as though that he may be more of an apologist or a sympathizer for the other side, and the United States, given the war on terror and the seriousness of what we're dealing with here, they don't really want someone that may be a little more sympathetic to the other side as opposed to America involved in this.",
        "And given his history with Jewish Americans, even though he's apologized, but we all know there's been a checkered past there, it's a little ironic that he wants to get involved in this situation to have Israeli soldiers released.",
        "I wonder if you can back up what you said about sympathy, being a sympathizer.",
        "That's a pretty strong accusation, to accuse somebody of being a sympathizer to the Taliban, to the other side, or to presumably to Osama bin Laden, so I wonder if you can back that up...",
        "His own words.",
        "You can look at his own words, where he came out and said that we need to - well, there's not a strong link to Osama bin Laden, We need more evidence.",
        "And, you know...",
        "Well, there were a lot of people that said that, Tara, including some Republicans who have made that suggestion.",
        "Not right after September 11th.",

        "But let me take it to Nat, and what you said.",
        "And that's a question of Jesse Jackson's clout.",
        "She talked about waning political clout.",
        "But one sees Jesse's clout waning perhaps more in the United States than on the worldwide stage, because we did see him, in fact, come out over the course of this week with the Syrian Ambassador in hopes of making this happen.",
        "What of the idea of whether or not Jesse Jackson, on the world stage, still has this kind of political clout?",
        "Well, I think you just - you said it just right, exactly right, Ed.",

        "I think a lot of people that don't go through a lot of pain end up seeking stuff that, you know, maybe they don't realize is joy and maybe they can never find it because they don't know what they're looking for exactly."
