        "Absolutely.",
        "And what lessons do you draw from it?",
        "Well, I think the main story that you can glean from this work is the idea of - science offers us these very simple explanations of what would work for the average person.",
        "So for the average person, optimism is good, or gratitude is good, or exercise is good, but what George Valiant's work is showing is that you can't understand strengths and resilience without context, and when you look in the context of people's lives, it depends on what time period.",
        "How is their identity developing when you're studying them?",
        "And then what happens when you're younger is very different than what happens when you're older.",
        "And what we know is, most of what we know about strengths and resilience and recovery from adversity comes from studying college students, which are very different than studying people over the course of 70 years.",
        "And as you look at the lessons of this, are they applicable across the board?",
        "Do these Harvard men born to what Tom Brokaw would label the greatest generation…?",
        "I think they're applicable in a number of ways.",
        "One is that we get really excited about counter-intuitive findings.",
        "So if I was to tell you that ignoring your kids will make you live longer, everyone will stop and pick up that article and email it to all their friends.",
        "But when you read an article from George Valiant that says relationships are important, extremely important.",
        "Yes, we know that, and our grandmother could have told us that, but when you think about how much time and energy this finite, incredible currency we have at our disposal we spend on other things that have nothing to do with relationships and will have no appreciable benefit on our life, either in the short term or in the long term, these studies remind you of why aren't I investing more time and energy into my relationships?",
        "I know this, but I'm not doing it.",
        "And so we can't be reminded enough about this.",

        "Yeah, I just want to say that there's another fascinating dimension to the study, which is to say that, you know, relationships are really hard.",
        "And you know, one of George's emphases in later years has been the difficulty of positive emotions, which of course the happiness scientists rightfully emphasize and have helped us, you know, see how they work, but it turns out it's extremely hard to be loved.",
        "It's hard even to receive a compliment.",
        "And so there's a much, you know, deeper story than just laying these things out, you know, on a chart.",
        "One of the things you write about is the person who should have been able most to draw these lessons was George Valiant, and well, he had some problems in his life, too.",

        "If something goes wrong next week, and he doesn't have domestic or congressional support, that's when the problems come.",
        "Yeah, I just wanted to comment on - Josh made a really good point at the end, before we went to break, which is, you know, this idea of happiness.",
        "We glop onto this simple, wastebasket term as it's equivalent to a fulfilling life.",
        "And what I think the lesson of Valiant's research is that much of what leads to a fulfilling life has almost nothing to do with happiness.",
        "And so what you're hearing in these stories over the course of 70 years, the idea of developing wisdom, finding meaning in life and finding a purpose in life and achieving things and developing a tolerance of pain and distress, what these things, these elements require is exposure to tension, to stress, to adversity and loss.",
        "And during those periods, if you were to study them at that time, their lives wouldn't look happy in the slightest, but their lives might be quite fulfilling because of that righteous indignation and difficulties that they went through.",
        "And I wanted to follow up with you, Josh, on the point about George Valiant himself, who well, he might have tried to apply these principles, but as you suggested, it's not easy.",
        "Yeah, I mean, knowing the path that you see in other people and actually doing it for yourself are two very different points, and I think George illustrates another really common phenomenon.",
        "He's an aspiring, brilliant guy who has achieved magnificent work in his life, and we have much to be grateful to him for."

        "That's interesting, and Josh Shenk - thank you very much for the call, Pete - and Josh Shenk, one of the things, again sort of counterintuitive, is that Dr. Valiant would point out that some of these, well in the short term, some of those negative emotions are, well, very useful and might be more useful in some respects than those positive emotions.",
        "Yeah, that's true, and you know, also - you know, one of the really good pieces of news from this study is the way that our lives change naturally over time.",
        "So George talks about the adaptations are defenses, and they're ranked from, you know, the lowest, the psychotic defenses, to the most mature, like humor and altruism.",
        "And you do see people naturally moving more and more towards these mature defenses as they grow older.",
        "So you know, someone in their 20s who might be labeled, you know, extremely difficult, antisocial, even mentally ill, might actually be on a path to maturity that's going to lead to beautiful things in his or her 30s or 40s or 50s.",
        "And I think looking at a whole life in this way is really helpful and really, really rare, in part because of the point that Todd makes, that a lot of our data, you know, comes from, you know, experiments done on college campuses.",
