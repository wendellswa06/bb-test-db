        "Well, we know that we see different personality traits in certain regions even of the United States.",
        "And it fits almost every stereotype that you can imagine, where on the East and West Coast, you tend to see a real high frequency of people that are mindful, open-minded, compassionate, at the same time, extremely neurotic, lots of anxiety and depressive symptoms.",
        "And talk fast.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And talk fast such as myself.",
        "And in the middle of the country, you have people that have these really tight-knit, you know, in-groups that they can connect with.",
        "They feel a sense of belonging, a sense of meaning, these really strong value systems that they connect to.",
        "And from that you can imagine blossoms very different sort of levels of happiness or we can say of different configurations of what leads to a fulfilling life, where you find lots of meaning in life and people that have strong ties to religion or their community.",
        "And when you're on the Coast and you have this openness and this curiosity, a lot of times it can lead to a lot of sort of fluid movement and sort of a lack of connective tissue to anything bigger than the self.",
        "And so, at any particular moment, you could see a very fulfilling life.",
        "But over the large scale trajectory of a person's life, there could be a lot of emptiness and loss.",

        "You know, I quote in the piece this standard saying, you know, if you ask someone in Denmark, how is it going?",

        "I started a recovery program - recovering from my family, a 12-step program that I'm incredibly thankful for.",
        "And it's actually giving me a lot of peace and serenity around the idea that I can't control everything and I can't bring happiness to everybody.",
        "And part of my happiness is actually letting go of life and letting it actually kind of unfold around me.",
        "That doesn't mean that I don't participate in my life.",
        "I definitely have an idea of where I want it to go.",
