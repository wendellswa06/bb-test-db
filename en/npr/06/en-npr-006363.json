        "He could be - he's every man, and he's every town.",

        "Exactly, but why are they waiting?",
        "Because they're worried that if they go too soon that - what Ray's talked about - because everyone's saving, that you know, they're going to leap into an empty pool.",
        "What they're waiting for is some clarity that says okay, now I know what the rules for investing for banks are.",
        "Now I see what the plan is.",
        "I think when that happens, and I wouldn't even begin to predict when, but when it does, there's a trillion dollars or more on the sideline that's going to say wow, the American economy is on sale, and I don't want to miss it.",
