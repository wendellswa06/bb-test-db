        "And, really, what I tried to do was look at the upsides and the downsides.",
        "But if you in any way looked at the upsides, for some people, you were somehow, you know, in the tank for globalization.",

        "Thank you, Juan.",
        "Ron Walters, let's start with the New Orleans mayoral race.",
        "What we saw last week was that Ray Nagin, the incumbent, won 38 percent incumbent won 38 percent of the vote, while his number one challenger, Mitch Landrieu, who is the lieutenant governor, the son of the former--the last white mayor of New Orleans, Moon Landrieu, and the brother of the Senator from Louisiana, Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu.",
        "He got 29 percent.",
        "A runoff is now set for May 20.",
        "What do you anticipate happening?",
        "Well, this is going to be very interesting, Juan, because race and turnout really are going to determine this race.",
        "I think--the problem, of course, is that the precincts are kind of structured in a way that whites in the less damaged part of the city voted places where they felt comfortable.",
        "Blacks are mostly displaced, had a tough time getting to the polls.",
        "Critics of this race say that it proves that the barriers that they tried to raise in the beginning were there and kept blacks from voting.",
        "If that is also the case by May 20, the day of the runoff, then, again, blacks are going to have a very difficult time voting.",
        "I think that Ray Nagin is going to get, again, most of the black vote.",
        "And this is going to be very even because I think in the final analysis it'll depend also on the programs for rebuilding New Orleans that they prefer...",
        "Well, let's hold off on that for just a second, Ron.",
        "Let me come back to you on the idea of who votes for Ray Nagin, who has made himself--I mean, it's very interesting: Ray Nagin was not initially viewed as a black candidate per se.",
        "He wasn't running as the black candidate, he was the corporate candidate and the candidate of the white business community in New Orleans first time around.",
        "This time around, he has recast himself as the black candidate, but Mitch Landrieu was able to get 20 percent of the black vote.",
        "So what does that mean?",
        "I think that Mitch Landrieu brings a fresh face, fresh ideas, and bold new leadership to this race.",
        "Also, keeping in mind, too, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Mayor Nagin was seen with President Bush often.",
        "Not only in New Orleans, but also here, in Washington D.C.",
        "And there were a lot of raised eyebrows out of New Orleans that said, well, wait a minute here.",
        "You know, a lot of people think that this is President Bush's fault, in terms of the lack of a federal response.",
        "But also, more importantly, what is a, \"\"black mayor\"\" of New Orleans, a Democrat, being seen hugging and kissing Mrs. Bush off--when they landed at the airport off of Air Force One and pledging to work with President Bush on these things.",
        "Now, one could make the argument that Mayor Nagin was just doing smart politics and obviously kissing the ring that was put before him."

        "She said that she found Secretary Jackson's comments very disappointing.",
        "When people say things like we only want the best people who don't do drugs or commit crimes, there's an implication that many of the people in public housing are, in fact, criminals who don't work.",

        "It's an unnecessary stereotype, an alarming stereotype to be voiced by the secretary of HUD.\"\" Robert Traynham?",
        "The only thing that I can say is that I would hope as the secretary of Housing and Urban Development he would do everything he possibly can to promote healthy housing, if that's a terminology, in New Orleans; that he will do everything that he possibly can to make sure that those victims return and have safe housing.",
