        "Now, it's been reported that a mission was planned and then pulled back, so the president could seek approval from Congress which didn't support an attack - important to remember that.",
        "So what was the driving factor there?",
        "Was it that the president really felt that the letter of the law required that he go to Congress?",
        "Did he feel he needed the political cover?",
        "Can you take us back to that?",

        "I mean, to put it into context, remember that he had famously declared this red line one year before when he said if I see them using chemical weapons, that will change the way I think about Syria.",
        "And for that entire year, you know, we had reports of minor use of chemical weapons, reported used, but never anything big.",
        "And then in August 2013, there was something big.",
        "And the Syrians used chemical weapons that killed more than a thousand people.",
        "And what the president said was that's what I meant, and he ordered the military to start preparing a response because he was concerned, as we all were, that failing to do something would essentially say you can use chemical weapons as much as you like.",
        "So he actually did order those military plans.",
        "They were all ready to go, and the president went to Congress, not because he thought he needed legal authority - thought he had that - but he needed legitimacy and support because his concern was - and this is relevant for where we are today - his concern was we can take out some airplanes and airstrips and so on.",
        "But what happens after that?",
        "What if they use it again or we have to do it again?",
        "And then we lose a plane and then we kill civilians?",

        "Assad was testing us, not just for himself, but the very principle of chemical weapons use.",
        "And if we said then - I feel the same way about this case now - if we said then, OK, you know, we didn't want you to use chemical weapons, but we're really not prepared to do anything about it, the message would be not only that was OK then, but it's OK next week.",

        "My concern is what could happen next?",
        "And I have to admit I, like many, are trying to figure out how this president who for six years was very strongly against any intervention in Syria said the red line was dumb, opposed Obama's use of force in 2013, warned about World War III if we intervened.",
        "Suddenly - and he only last week was saying we could live with Assad.",
        "And then suddenly after this incident is saying we can't tolerate this, ordering military strikes, completely out of character.",
        "So I'm worried that there's no consistency here, and there's no strategy.",
        "It was an emotional reaction or even one for political reasons that as guideline for the future - so if casualties alone lead us to intervene militarily, what if - and there are reports that this is already happening - what if Assad bombs the same areas next week?",
        "Do we then intervene again?",
        "And then again and again and again?",
        "And so I think the president does need to tell us was this narrowly to stop chemical weapons in which case I think it can be supported or are we jumping on a slippery slope and going to get involved in the war in Syria in which case I think there are real concerns.",
        "Well, we only have about a minute left, and so obviously we're only just scratching the surface here of all the relevant and important issues.",
        "So the question I would have for you is, perhaps, if the president doesn't feel he needs that because his party controls both houses of Congress as well as the White House, and he feels that that conveys all the legitimacy that he needs sort of going forward - I want to ask you about citizens.",
        "How do you want citizens to evaluate the next steps here?",
