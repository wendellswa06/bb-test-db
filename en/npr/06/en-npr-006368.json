        "So as you look over the research from Pew, does it seem like a real sea change in gender roles, or is it more subtle than that?",
        "Well, it's a sea change that's been occurring over the course of the past 30 years or so.",
        "It's a slow sea change.",
        "(Soundbite of laughter)",
        "It is a slow but very, very steady sea change, and it's as my colleague Stephanie Coontz, the historian, said, marriage has changed more in the past 30 years than it did in the prior 3,000 years I mean, yes, in the prior 3,000 years.",
        "by women's increased economic power; their increased education; the women's movement, which allowed women to campaign against the antidiscrimination laws, which brought up their income; women's ability to leave bad marriages.",
        "All of these changes that have occurred have, over time, greatly increased women's power not only outside the home but within the family.",
        "And from my perspective, this has largely been a boon to men and to the family because it's kind of compelled men to become much more involved as partners, much more involved in terms of the intimate aspect of the relationship, much more self-disclosing, which is a hugely important predictor of women's marital satisfaction, but also as parents.",
        "Men in the past three decades have tripled the amount of child care that they did just three decades ago and are much more identified as fathers.",
        "And this is largely because of women's increased power to navigate these changes and to negotiate for these changes, and they become self-reinforcing for men."

        "Well, it certainly explains why more women are college-educated and earning more, but why do you think they're more likely to marry men without as much education?",
        "Well, because the pool of men who have education are actually lower than they are for women.",
        "They don't have the same kind of pool it's not that women have become less picky.",
        "Women in general would rather college-educated women would rather marry a college-educated man.",
        "There just aren't as many of them around.",
        "And college-educated people in general are more likely to be married.",
        "They're more likely to be married after the age of 40.",
        "So for example, women college-educated women are still less likely to marry than women who have less education than do they, but by the age of 40, they're more likely to be married.",
        "And in the 10 years from 40 to 50, they're much more likely to get married within that time frame than are women who don't have a college education.",
        "And part of the reason is that college-educated women and women who marry later this is also true for men who are educated and marry later they're more mature.",
        "They often have more-egalitarian ideals about marriage, sharing housework, sharing childcare, and those we're finding that those principles are also very predictive of marital stability.",
        "Well, it's interesting you say that because a lot of the coverage surrounding this Pew study has been about how threatened men feel by this and how emasculated they are by having a woman out-earn them.",

        "So, for example, there was a cartoon in the New Yorker last year that had two women in conversation, and one woman says to the other, you know, I want a guy who will well up with emotion, not one who will actually cry.",
        "And for me, that really highlights the ambivalence that many women have about men's potentially being more vulnerable than they are, potentially having lower status than they are.",
        "I think there are many men who feel very confused about that.",
        "Now, I think that said, the majority of men certainly that I've talked to in my practice don't, you know, want to be partners with them.",
