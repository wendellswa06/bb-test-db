        "Dave, thanks for your call.",
        "Amy Dickinson, you want to take this one?",
        "Ms.�DICKINSON: Well, I don't know if I can tackle sort of what he's talking about, but it does occur to me that Dave's situation is analogous to many where the woman put, so to speak, put the husband through college.",
        "And then they both had to face the consequences of that, which is that the man was a trained, educated and highly paid professional, and the woman basically didn't have marketable skills.",
        "And so he is experiencing, obviously, the opposite of that.",
        "And I think it's a tremendous challenge, no question.",
        "You know, I just want to go back to something you'd said earlier, Amy, which I think is hugely important, and that is that it's we're looking at very different families.",
        "If we're looking at, let's say, a woman who's college-educated, she marries a guy who's either not college-educated or is a much lower earner than she is, and everybody's aware that that's the deal going in.",
        "That's a structurally very different family than a couple that gets married, and either the husband is the primary breadwinner or the sole breadwinner, and then he loses his job.",
        "That kind of thing, we know, is a fundamental assault on a man's identity, that men still - and this is the problem with where we are in this kind of sea change around gender identity - men still get an enormous amount of self-esteem, maybe the core amount of their self-esteem, around career, the capacity to earn.",
        "And so when a man loses his job, there's quite a bit of research that shows that they're far more vulnerable to depression, to anxiety, to becoming more aggressive.",
        "Their capacity to parent goes way down.",
        "So that's fundamentally, from a couples' perspective, a very, very different entity.",
        "Well, isn't this sort of getting to the question of how adaptable you are as a couple in general?",
        "I mean, if the problem in that scenario is that the rules changed midstream, my reaction is sort of what did you expect?",
        "If you're going to be married for 50 years in an ideal world, things are going to change.",
        "Well, thank you, and as a couples' therapist, I think that's really the key point.",
        "I mean, if you get married, and you have very rigid ideas of what a man is supposed to do or what a woman is supposed to do or how much your partner's going to marry I mean, how much your partner's going to earn or what you're entitled to get from your partner in terms of their earning, you're a little bit you're pretty vulnerable to a really big letdown.",
        "And I have to say, I have worked with couples where one partner was very, very many couples where one of the partners was very, very insensitive to the other's decreased earning capacity because of the economic downturn.",
        "And they felt, sort of, well, I got married thinking you were going to be this big, you know, bread-earner, and now you're not, and you know, I feel entitled to something different.",
        "And it's really a very, very problematic way to structure a marriage or a relationship.",
        "Coming up, we'll have more with Joshua Coleman and Amy Dickinson, and tell us your stories.",
        "If your relationship has an employment or earnings imbalance, how has that changed your marriage?",
        "We're taking your calls at 800-989-8255.",

        "A new study by the Pew Research Center finds that men are increasingly likely to marry women with more education and income than they have.",
        "That role reversal is changing dinner table conversation around the country.",
        "It's also changing who may have cooked the dinner.",
        "And we're talking with TALK OF THE NATION's regular guide to behavior, Ask Amy's Amy Dickinson; and clinical psychologist Joshua Coleman.",
        "And we want to hear from you.",

        "And you can join the conversation at our Web site.",
        "Go to npr.org and click on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "That was sort of a throwaway line about who was cooking the dinner, but Amy Dickinson, are you seeing a corresponding change in roles at home as there are gender roles changing at work?",
        "Ms.�DICKINSON: Yes, and of course this won't surprise, I don't think, the moms and dads out there, but mothers tend to think that they can comb their kids' hair, like the best, and when they go off to work and husband starts staying home, the mom tends to notice how poorly the dad combs the children's hair, and this is, you know, a huge problem.",
        "And so one of the things I urge people to do is to remember, women especially, who are expert, you know, if they've been at home with the kids, and their expert child-rearing, you know, machines, that not everybody does it the same and that my I have to laugh because my sister had a situation where her husband started getting the kids ready for school.",
        "She was going to work early.",
        "She would come home and see the kids when they came home from school, and it was, like, why does Annie(ph) have three ponytails today, and why is her shirt on inside-out?",
        "And really came to a point where she was, like, you know what, he does it differently.",
        "It doesn't mean it's bad.",
        "It's just different.",
        "It's, like, the dad way.",
        "Same thing.",
        "Women, you know, they're in this sudden reversal where they're at work, and they're coming home, and they realize their husbands really sort of don't know how to cook as well as they do, but they don't allow for the fact that it takes time to learn how to put a meal on the table.",
        "It is hard, and so this is, like, such a challenge for couples when they're facing this extreme change.",
        "Obviously, women who are educated and are earning their earning capacity is rising, you know, slowly as the men's maybe is diminishing a little bit.",
        "It's not so sudden as this sort of unemployment switch-a-roo, but it's very, very challenging.",
        "And it seems like there are two dynamics that are hard to parse from each other, but one is the sort of woman not wanting to give up control over the domestic sphere and, you know, worrying that her husband is doing it wrong just because he's doing it differently, but there's also the overcompensating.",
        "If you feel like your husband is threatened by you making more or being the breadwinner, then you don't ask him to unload the dishwasher because that will threaten him even further.",
        "Ms.�DICKINSON: Right, and I think I noticed that part of this study is that the women who earn more are also proportionally doing...",
        "More housework."

        "Ms.�DICKINSON: More housework, and it seems obvious to you and me, probably, that they are compensating for what they feel is they are probably overcompensating at home to try and make their husband feel good.",
        "Is that something you're seeing, Joshua Coleman?",
        "Mr.�COLEMAN: I see some of that.",
        "I certainly see what Amy's talking about in terms of what sociologists call kind of the gate-keeping phenomenon of women feeling like they're the experts about how the house should look and how the children should be raised.",
        "And I think it's particularly problematic around parenting.",
        "In middle-class homes, you know, in the past several decades, we've had this evolution of what has been variously described as intensive mothering, a culture of concerted cultivation where the idea that childhood is supposed to be a place where very, very carefully structured and managed.",
        "And so we now see that with educated mothers, they're actually doing more child care than did mothers in the 1960s who weren't even this is employed, educated mothers are doing more childcare than mothers did that weren't employed in the 1960s.",
        "So it's an important thing to highlight because it puts enormous pressure in the home.",
        "Most couples don't spend enough time together under any circumstances.",
        "There's been a sociologist Paul Amata(ph) showed that there's a 40 percent decline in how much time couples spend together in the past four decades.",
        "So at the same time that we've had this big we've had big economic downturns, we've had, at the same time, the evolution of the soul-mate ideal.",
        "So couples are supposed to get all this marital satisfaction, at the same time they have this enormous economic stress and worry, they have these, I think, absurd ideals around what children need, and men are actually doing much more than they've ever done.",
        "Men have actually doubled the amount of housework that they used to do.",
        "They tripled the amount of child care.",
        "So men are changing, and actually a forthcoming study that we're going to show in Council of Contemporary Families shows that actually working class men are now doing as much housework as are educated men.",
        "That's a very, very recent finding.",
        "It used to be that the less education you had, the less housework you did because you didn't have the idea that there was this egalitarian model, but that's actually changed also.",

        "Ms.�DICKINSON: Actually, Stacey, that's one, in my mind, very positive aspect of this.",
        "I know it's a challenging time for your family and other families, certainly in the Detroit area, but I urge people, when they've written to me about this, to think about how they can model a whole different way of being in a family for their kids, which I think is wonderful, and how great that your husband is embracing this.",
        "and I know it's hard to give up on all of those gate-keeping-type jobs you've done, but I think it's great for your son to see his dad really taking the lead at home in that way.",
        "I think that's wonderful.",
        "Mr.�COLEMAN: Well, not only that, but there's actually research to show that dads who do more housework, particularly dads who do housework with their kids, that those kids actually do better both socially and academically.",

        "And, you know, it's been one of those things that, you know, my identity was not tied to my career, whereas I felt my husband's identity was more tied to his career.",
        "And it's worked for us, but, you know, and we've been blessed that he has a good career, and the downturn in the economy has not affected it.",
        "But you know, we've been there at those times when, you know, both of us had careers, owned our own businesses, and I felt, for our family, the kids suffered for it.",
        "So I was very happy to make the decision to opt to go home and take care of the kids.",
        "Bridgette, thank you so much for your call.",
        "You talked, Joshua Coleman, about men identifying - their self-identification being caught up in their work, and Bridgette's example notwithstanding, of course you do hear that from women too, that when they do choose to stay home or economically need to be home, as their husband moves around, that their identity from work is also a loss.",
        "Mr.�COLEMAN: There's absolutely no question about that, and I hear many women in my practice complain about that.",
        "So I think we can't, as a culture, just say that, well, because men get so much of their identity from this that women should take the hit.",
        "I think each couple has to make a decision about that, and there are some couples that for whom the dad is actually much better-suited, temperamentally, to be home with the kids, and the mom to be the one who's going out and doing the earning.",
        "But it really requires the couple to both be very flexible about what they're both the best-suited for and what creates the most self-esteem.",
        "The problem comes when one of the people in the couple is much more rigid about what they're willing to and what they're not willing to do, and that's often when you see a conflict begin to occur.",
