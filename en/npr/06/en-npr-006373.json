        "Well, Gary Cohn is a free trader.",

        "And he was probably concerned about a trade war - retaliation from other countries, escalating tariffs and a complete breakdown of the global trading system.",
        "Now, this doesn't happen automatically if the Trump administration imposes those tariffs, but we've already seen threats of retaliation by the European Union.",
        "So if you're Gary Cohn, you must be thinking, why do this?",
        "What purpose do they serve?",
        "You know, the economy's doing well.",
        "Tax cuts were passed, companies about to bring back some of their profits from overseas.",
        "What's the point?",
        "OK.",
        "What is the point?",
        "Well, President Trump thinks if there is a trade war, America will win it.",
        "But most economists and analysts don't agree with that at all.",
        "They say a trade war would be damaging all around and really unpredictable.",
        "It would threaten a lot of different American jobs and companies.",
        "Now, you know that President Trump - he's been fighting back for a long time against what he says is unfair foreign competition.",
        "That's something he's been complaining about for at least 30 years.",
        "The - he's been saying the same thing about the loss of the steel industry and so forth.",
        "Yeah, about trade...",
        "...Which was a big story in the '80s, in a way.",
        "Right - about trade deficits, foreign companies dumping their products, American companies losing out to unfair competition.",
        "How are the markets reacting to the news of Gary Cohn's departure?",
        "Well right after the news came out, the Dow futures fell very sharply.",
        "It's still down.",
        "The stocks fell in Asia, and they're off a bit in Europe today, as well.",
        "Of course, he wasn't the guy making the decisions, but he was a symbol of a particular policy approach.",
        "Mara Liasson is still with us.",
        "And Mara, I can't help but note, this is the latest of many, many, many, many, many departures from the White House."

        "I'm not sure if that's the right number of manys, but in any case, a flurry of departures.",

        "Rob Porter, who was the staff secretary, left after he was accused by his two ex-wives of abuse.",

        "He said, first of all, he likes chaos; he likes conflict; he likes watching people who work for him fight it out.",
        "But he also sounded very sensitive about the fact that there has been so much more turnover in this White House than in previous ones.",

        "These people have not been replaced.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And using that phrase, believe me, which is often a tell when he's making a statement that people don't necessarily believe.",
        "Now, I got to ask about one other thing before I let you go, Mara Liasson, which certainly adds to the image of chaos.",
        "Last night, we learned that Stormy Daniels - stage name - her real name is Stephanie Clifford - is suing the president of the United States.",
        "What's that about?",
        "Well, in any other administration, this would be the No. 1 scandal.",
        "But Stormy Daniels, who is a porn actress, was paid $130,000 to not talk about an affair she had with Donald Trump.",
        "She sued the president yesterday.",
        "She alleged that her nondisclosure agreement before the 2016 election is null and void because Donald Trump failed to sign it.",
        "And she said she wanted to go public with the story of her affair.",
        "But she signed this agreement, paid $130,000, but Donald Trump never signed it.",
        "And now she's in court to try to make that agreement null and void."
