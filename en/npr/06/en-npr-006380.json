        "When the day slows down, so that it's below 10 hours of sun above the horizon, then growth very much slows, but that doesn't stop you from harvesting what you've already gotten in the ground.",
        "Let's talk about some of the ABCs for people getting their fall gardens ready.",
        "What should they do?",
        "Well, just to sort of put the garden to bed.",
        "I think one of the wonderful things you can do is first of all, clean up any debris, any weeds, get it really kind of good housekeeping pristine.",
        "And then put down a couple of inches of well-rotted manure or good compost, and just let the freezing and thawing - assuming you have some freezing in your climate..."

        "You can set up a worm bin in your home using a plastic storage container about 14 gallons or a little bit bigger, and you can make a nice home for the worms in there, and feed them two or three times a week, they'll eat, you know, a few pounds of kitchen waste.",
