        "You space those about six inches apart.",
        "You don't want too many, but some enough to let some air in there.",
        "Then you wet sections of newspaper and shred them - just tear them into strips no more than three-inch piece as usually.",
        "And fill that bin pretty full with strips of wet newspaper and then mix in a cup of compost and a cup of soil.",
        "These are, you know, approximate amounts.",
        "But those things give the worms some grip so they can digest their food.",
        "That's something that they need.",
        "And then you throw in a cup of corn meal.",
        "That's a starter food for your worms.",
        "Once you get it all mixed together in the bin, then you can add worms.",
        "And like I said, I started with about 200 that I got at the bait store.",
        "Something I should mention to when you're tearing up that newspaper, it's nice to wear rubber gloves while you're doing that or else your hands will be really black by the time you're finished.",
        "And how do you know when it - when the worms are ready for your garbage scraps?",
        "It doesn't take long.",
        "Just a couple of days and you can kind of monitor the conditions in the bin, which by the way should have a lid.",
        "Yeah, it makes sense.",
        "And you know, you can check if the - if there's a lot of condensation under the lid or on the sides of the bin, and if the worms are coming to the top or climbing up the sides, it may be too moist, then perhaps you want to crack the lid open for a day or so to let things dry out, or else mix in some more dry newspaper.",
        "And what should you not throw in there?",
        "What kind of food should you not throw?",
        "Anything?",
        "(Singing) ...you're my sweet heart."

        "OK, yeah.",
        "The worms, they seem do not like anything that has the potential to grow in terms of plant parts.",
        "So they don't eat seeds.",
        "That's good for us when we're talking about our gardens, but it's not something you want to put into your worm bin.",
        "They like coffee grounds, they like tea bags, and they will eat - you know, they don't mind the filters or the bags.",
        "Right.",
        "They like peelings, fruit peels, and if you've been, say, making apple pies, the peels from your apples - or if you're making apple sauce, all the parts that you're not going to use are good to go into the bin.",
        "Wow.",
        "Egg shells are fine, bits of bread, crusts maybe that your kids don't eat or if you have bread that unfortunately has gotten moldy before you were able to use it.",

        "And cooked vegetables...",
        "Gotcha.",
        "Are fine as long they're not really heavily salted, or very buttery, or greasy.",
        "They don't like onions or onion family plants.",
        "And they're not really good with things like citrus rinds.",
        "But other than that, they are pretty agreeable.",
        "Barbara, do you have a compost?",
        "Do you do this?",

        "That's what makes it all work.",

        "The main thing is to, you know, keep the bin closed when you're not, you know, getting involved with it, and also to kind of monitor the situation.",
        "Fruit flies and fungus gnats can become, you know, problems around a worm bin.",
        "And the main thing is to, you know, exclude them from their food sources.",
        "And if you need to, to put up a little trap using - putting a little bit of, you know, rotting fruit into a jar with some soapy liquid, and kind of capturing them.",
        "If you notice fly larvae or a pupa on the sides of the bin, scrape them off.",
        "And, you know, usually a bin that's well maintained, and you'll come to know if the worms are happy, if they're doing their thing, because you will see that they're active and you will not notice any off odors.",
        "But the other thing is too when you put food into the bin to bury it down into the bedding, and then cover it back over again.",
        "And that put where the worms will find it and it kind of keeps it from attracting other pests that maybe you don't' want living in that bin.",

        "I've got a rather elemental question, though.",
        "The city is doing a great job down here promoting recycling, and has provided some compost bins to residents.",

        "But you can also do tricks beyond the cold frame to make it go even further.",
        "One of the things we've experimented with is putting a cold frame inside an unheated greenhouse, so that gives you two layers of protection.",
        "Each layer makes you a zone and a half south, so inside the greenhouse here at New Jersey instead of Maine, and inside the cold frame you'd be in Georgia.",
        "And even easier way to do it is to put Reemay which is just a brand of floating row cover."
