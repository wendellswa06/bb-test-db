        "What was your hardest thing to learn to get it right?",
        "There was nothing to learn.",
        "I read a book.",
        "We had an old 55 half gallon or half a barrel, whiskey barrel.",
        "We filled it up with shredded leaves, and put the worms in there.",
        "And then we would use our kitchen scraps and we would start off, let's say 12:00, bury the scraps there.",
        "And next time, we would bury them at 2:00, 6:00, work all the way around in a circle, and by the time we got to the first 12:00, all those scraps had been eaten and the worms had moved on, and you just continually do that.",
        "And there was - it was easy.",
        "There's no work to it.",
        "You just bury it, cover it and let it go.",
        "And the worms will do all the work for you.",
        "Where did you keep your barrel?",
        "We kept it in the basement.",
        "It was too big to keep in the kitchen.",
        "You're doing it big time.",
        "Well, yeah.",
        "It was just - that's what we had available and we used a plastic bag that we tied a rope around it as a cover, because we didn't have a tight fitting cover, but that still presented no problems.",
        "And we just generated worm manure every few months and it was fabulous.",
        "Right, Jim, thanks for calling.",

        "I think it's a great idea to do worms inside.",
        "Barbara, how do you actually figure out what you're doing wrong out in your garden if you have this - let's say to have the cold frame or whatever, if things are not working out over the winter?",
        "Well...",
        "What's the biggest mistake...",
        "People make?",
        "That the amateur gardener, you know, is making when he tries to set up a cold frame.",

        "They don't realize how hot the sun is coming through the glass.",
        "Yeah, the whole point of a cold frame is that the earth takes in sunlight, and then radiates the heat back at night.",
        "You want to keep that light, that hotness, in there.",

        "So, we usually use a little notched stick to prop it open.",
        "If we're going out for the day, it's better to prop it open, and go away, and leave it on the cold side than the other way around.",
        "I noticed you didn't mention in your cold-frame using other cold-weather veggies, I would think of in the broccoli family, for example, you know, broccoli or cauliflower, things like that.",
        "You know, I haven't found that they do all that well in the winter time or kale.",
        "And those do well just as fall garden crops.",
        "I mean, we often have had kale almost up until Christmas time, and Brussels sprouts at Christmas time but they don't respond well to being inside a cold frame after that.",
        "The small crops, if you do lettuce, do it as a baby leaf lettuce where you cut and comb it, and then it regrows.",
        "Don't do the big heads.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Not free, but cheap.",

        "Well, Jerry, I would tell you that you want to put that bin as close to where you want to use the compost as you possibly can.",
        "And the other thing is to make it convenient to be able to take materials to put into it.",
        "And so access is important.",
        "Don't tuck it away and hide it, because then, you'll forget about it.",
        "Or you won't want to carry things to it and carry finished compost from it.",
        "You don't need to put it in the sun.",
        "In fact, if it's slightly shady spot, that'll help to keep it moist, to keep it from drying out too much.",
        "The bare earth is in the shade.",
        "OK.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I will go bare earth, because it's got an open bottom, I'm guessing.",
        "And you're going to improve that spot underneath where the bin is, and eventually you may want to move that bin some place else, and you'll have a great and rich place where you can plant something else."

        "It does not.",
        "OK.",
        "Does he need to stir it up a lot?",
        "It depends on how fast you want things to happen and what you're putting into it.",
        "But in general, if you mix in a sort of combination of dry things and wet things, some people would say green things or brown things, but if you combine those ingredients as you are adding them to the bin, there's not as much need for stirring.",
        "But if you notice that it's getting soggy or if you notice that it's smelly, you want to get a stick or something and poke around and arid that, and use a pitch fork and let some air in there, and that will help to put to work the decomposers that work with oxygen, and it'll smell better then.",

        "But you don't have to have any kind of a container.",
        "You can just pile stuff or even bury it, dig a pit then it put it down in the ground, too.",

        "Does it have to have a lot of nitrogen to heat up?",
        "Well, you know what you need is - you need two things.",
        "You need high nitrogen things and these are sort of the green moist things like grass clippings, and weeds, and kitchen wastes, and manure.",
        "And then you need the carbonaceous things, the high carbon things like straw, or little twigs, leaves, things like that.",
        "And it's the fire and the fuel, the green stuff like the grass clippings are the fire, and the brown stuff is the fuel.",
        "And it's the action between the two that makes it cook.",

        "We're talking about gardening this hour in Talk of the Nation: Science Friday from NPR News.",
