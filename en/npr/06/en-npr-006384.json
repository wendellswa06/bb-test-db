        "Well, I would have to go to my local library and check on that, but I have to say that, you know, sort of the classic guide to worm composting is called \"\"Worms Eat my Garbage\"\" by Mary Appelhof, and although it's not a children's book, it is really quite an excellent reference, and the standard that most people use when they are really serious about getting into worm composting, but it's a great project to do with your kids.",
