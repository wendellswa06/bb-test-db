        "Well, this is Shaun Harper's study, and he points out that on major college campuses across the country, black males make up less than 3 percent of undergraduate enrollments.",
        "Yet, when you look at their numbers or percentages on the revenue-generating sports teams of football and men's basketball, they make up well into 50 and 60 percent of those teams.",
        "So the idea is that they are really there to be part of the revenue-generating working class of athlete on campus and not necessarily there to be part of the educating class as most everyone else is.",
        "When you say any other demographic group - in fact, I think the numbers are something like, at those 65 schools, just barely more than half of the black male athletes graduate at all.",
        "Exactly.",
        "And what's really insidious about this is these athletes are supposedly promised at least one thing as remuneration for all their blood and sweat.",
        "And that is a college degree, which can be a transformative tool in our society when you talk about upward mobility.",
        "And that's really the troubling part about this.",
        "Well, this has been talked about so much, really, in recent years.",
        "Why hasn't it changed?",
        "Well, I think one of the reasons it hasn't changed is because there's really no economic pressure to change this.",
        "All of the incentive is really on winning and not losing on the field or on the court.",
        "Coaches are not necessarily incentivized to graduate players.",
        "You know, one last thing - which is worth keeping uppermost in our minds - are the staggering figures, the money that's involved.",
        "Just give us a quick reminder of what we're talking about here.",
        "Well, we're talking about a $10 billion contract that NCAA basketball signed with broadcasters several years ago to broadcast all these games that we're going to love to watch over the next three weeks and that the conference commissioners of the power five conferences in this country, those five guys make on average $2.8 million a year in salary.",
        "And then you look at the coaches and the multimillion dollar contracts they have to coach.",
        "And you look at the staffs.",
        "And then you look at the student fees that go along to support some of the athletic activities at colleges across the country.",
        "It's a whole lot of money.",
        "And at the very least, it seems that these black male college athletes, who produce most of this revenue, should get more from it or certainly get the guarantee of their college scholarship so that they have something when they get out of school.",

        "The counteroffensive against ISIS with coalition members on the ground and in the air is proceeding north, east and south of Mosul and are making significant gains.",
        "So the offensive is proceeding now towards the outskirts of Mosul on the east side, which is a significant progress rate.",
        "You talk about how they're closing in from the north, east and south, but when - you know, when you look at the maps of this, we're seeing that there's not a whole lot going on in the west.",
        "And that of course would be the way that presumably ISIS fighters could escape from Mosul and head into Syria.",
        "Why are they letting these fighters get away that way?",
        "Why are they not closing that corridor?",
        "Well, the majority of what exists outside of Mosul in the west is open desert.",
        "So on the one hand, it is a good planning assumption that if ISIS tries to withdraw by fleeing into the desert, that that withdrawal will be visible from the air...",
        "I see.",
        "...And it will be possible to strike.",
        "The exception of course is any significant movement of refugees fleeing into Syria from Mosul with whom ISIS could also mask its own escape.",
        "And it is a vulnerability in the operation that ISIS could withdraw.",
        "However, I do think it is also appropriate to recognize that reclaiming Mosul is the significant objective of the operation regardless of whether or not all ISIS members are contained there.",
        "We just heard in Alice Fordham's report from villagers near Mosul, and they talked about these tunnels between villages to smuggle ISIS fighters, to smuggle weapons.",
        "How much of a concern is that for Iraqi forces and their allies?",
        "Well, tunnels first and foremost are going to slow down the operation.",
        "As fighters are trying to retake villages and finding tunnel networks that also had to be cleared, it is literally a subterranean war that has to be fought on the ground, and that could cause various portions of the operation to proceed more slowly.",
        "If tunnels are not sufficiently cleared, it could also mean that counter-ISIS forces end up surrounded by ISIS forces..."

        "Right.",
        "If ISIS forces are rolled over too quickly and allowed to attack friendly forces from two directions, that of course means that clearing the tunnels is very important.",
        "ISIS has been launching counter attacks in recent days, most notably in the city of Kirkuk, which is not part of this offensive.",
        "Why would they take fighters away from Mosul?",
        "ISIS has fighters in place throughout Iraq and throughout Syria and honestly in other places in the region who clearly had been lying in wait for the Mosul counter-offensive to begin in order to participate in Mosul's strategic defense.",
        "So ISIS likely did not send fighters to Kirkuk.",
        "It had fighters there, and it deployed them in conjunction with the Mosul offensive.",
        "So we see that ISIS is very clearly trying to divert attention away from the Mosul operation, perhaps even in the case of Kurkuk, trying to draw Kurdish Peshmerga forces away from Mosul and back to the defense of Kirkuk.",

        "If you didn't know that he won six races last year on NASCAR's premier racing circuit, you'd think Greg Biffle was just a regular guy in his 30s.",

        "Richard's a veteran.",

        "There's a lot more things to adjust now, I think, than what we had back then.",

        "We were fascinated by anything that ran on gasoline, and that fascination was a family thing."
