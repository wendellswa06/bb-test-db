        "And he put out a statement today seeking to do just that in which he said - downplayed any sense of friction between the two and said they are, quote, \"\"committed to advancing our shared agenda together, and anyone who suggests otherwise is clearly not part of the conversation.",
        "What is also clear is that there is frustration, as the president laid bare very clearly last night.",
        "I think the fact that the Senate couldn't pass a health care bill is the point of that and that wanting Mitch McConnell to change the rules of the Senate.",
