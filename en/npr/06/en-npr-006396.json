        "Some women got nicotine in the patch, and some women got placebo.",
        "They saw no difference in the quit rate between the patch and the placebo.",
        "By the time they gave birth, women who got nicotine were no less likely to be smoking.",
        "But earlier in their pregnancies, these women were less likely to smoke.",
        "That suggests that even though they didn't quit, both mother and fetus had less exposure to the thousands of chemicals other than nicotine that are found in cigarette smoke.",
        "You'd think that would have to be a good thing.",
        "And Slotkin says it is - sort of.",
        "From the point of view of the mother, it is unequivocal.",
        "It's much better that she takes nicotine instead of all the other smoke products 'cause they're going to cause lung cancer and other things.",
        "But you know, in this particular case, we need to look at it from the point of view of the fetus.",
        "And from that perspective, he says, the advantages are less clear.",
        "Most of what's known about the effects of nicotine on a fetus has come from studies of animals.",
        "Slotkin himself has done a number of nicotine studies looking at rodents, monkeys and even birds.",
        "He says he's focused on nicotine because it's the reason people smoke, and because it would be almost impossible to figure out how every single chemical compound in cigarette smoke affects a fetus.",
        "The question that we can answer isn't whether all of those other compounds are important - they probably are - but to what extent the effects of nicotine, by itself, can account for what we see in the offspring of smokers.",
        "And the answer is, an awful lot of it.",
        "Slotkin is especially concerned about nicotine's effect on the developing brain.",
        "He says animal studies suggest that nicotine could be the reason that women who smoke are more likely to have children with problems including ADHD, and conduct or learning disorders.",
        "Brain development is a delicate process controlled by chemical signals that act a bit like a piano score.",
        "Ordinarily, the signals make sure that individual brain cells play the right note at the right time.",
        "But Slotkin says nicotine interferes with these chemical signals.",
        "It would be the equivalent of trying to play this piano piece, and some clown comes along with a chunk of 2-by-4 and slams a bunch of keys down and holds them down.",
        "Now, you can play those keys, but they don't get heard 'cause they are overwhelmed by this continuous signal that's pre-empting the natural signal.",
        "That's the way nicotine works on the developing brain.",
        "Slotkin says a fetal brain can repair the damage when signals are interrupted temporarily.",
        "That's why he thinks pregnant smokers who choose nicotine replacement are better off with gum or lozenges or sprays or inhalers.",
        "These may be safer because they allow nicotine levels to fall between doses.",
        "Slotkin says nicotine levels tend to remain high when moms smoke cigarettes or use a nicotine patch.",
        "Smoking, in a way, is unique because it's done continuously, and nicotine patch delivery is done continuously - every day; virtually around the clock, the whole time."

        "Coolness is this, you know, what I call the Holy Grail, and so few people actually achieve that.",
        "Cool is, of course, a word that is carefully defined in a lot of these essays as - you're right, it's absolutely critical to this distinction of who is in and who is out.",
