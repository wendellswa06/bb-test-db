        "I was, you know, captain of the football team, did date the cheerleader, thought I hung around with what was the cool crowd.",
        "But until I became a high school teacher myself and painfully saw who I actually was in high school, I realized then I think I was the loser.",
        "In what respect?",
        "What part of your younger self do you now find qualifies you for loserdom?",
        "I think just seeing the kids that everyone thought were the cool kids as I was teacher and looking at them and thinking those kids are who I was in high school and they, I don't think, are the cool kids.",
        "I think everyone else was looking up to the wrong people.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "And did you - were you guilty of flagrant abuse of you cooldom, your position at the top of the high school pyramid?",
        "No, no, I think we - I treated everyone really - I think everyone got along very well in my high school, as well as the high school I taught at.",
        "I just think that the people that got all the praise, I think, unfortunately were the wrong people.",
        "There were just amazing kids when I was a high school teacher that got no respect.",
        "They got no attention whatsoever.",
        "And it was then that made me a little bit depressed when I thought about all the people I didn't know when I was in high school.",
        "Hmm.",
        "John McNally, you weren't a basketball star by any stretch of the imagination, but you played and played on the high school baseball team as well and sort of had that, I guess, entree into that uppermost senior level of coolness in high school."
