        "That was the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.",
        "And that came in and said that drugs had to be proven safe: not effective, but safe, before they could be marketed.",
        "It wasn't until 1962, there was an amendment that came in and said that a drug had to prove itself effective before it could be sold on the market.",
        "All right, I'm going to ask you to put on your cap, your thinking cap, and come up, for me, what would you say, what would many people say, are the, is the single or the biggest FDA contributions to health to date?",
        "Well, I think we can feel a lot better about the food and drugs that eat now than we did in 1906.",
        "You know, they certainly made things a lot safer.",
        "Did they make them safe enough - that's where you can get into some argument or disagreement.",
        "You know, trying to figure out what's safe and what's not safe, especially when you're looking at drugs, becomes a political issue.",
        "So, I think in the broad brush look it we're doing a lot better than we were.",
        "If you take a finer point to it, we could probably be doing a lot better as well.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "And it has become a political issue, especially in recent years.",
        "I'm thinking of this case of, one of the women commissioners, or parse this out for me, who resigned over the abortion pill?",
        "Right.",
        "Yeah, that was, she was in the Office of Women's Health, within the FDA.",
        "And what happened was, there'd been a series of decisions made by, or not made by, the FDA that she objected to.",
        "And the biggest one, this was Susan Wood, the biggest issue that she objected to was there had been an application to sell the Morning, so-called Morning-After Pill - it's basically high-dose birth control - a petition to sell it over the counter.",
        "And the, actually there have, you said in the beginning there have been no permanent commissioners.",
        "There have, there just haven't been a whole of permanent, there's been more often than not, not a permanent commissioner.",
        "And what you're asking about now is the answer to that.",
        "It's this issue of selling over the counter birth control.",
        "The last commissioner promised that he would take it to, he'd make a decision on it.",
        "And then he became appointed - he was the acting commissioner, and he made that promise that he'd make a decision.",
        "He got appointed.",
        "When the day came for his decision, his decision was, it needed more study.",
        "The current guy, who's the acting commissioner, has just been nominated.",
        "This is Andrew von Eschenbach.",
        "He's been nominated to be the permanent commissioner.",
        "I don't think that the senators who are pushing this are going to buy that thing again, yes I will decide soon by a date certain, because, you know, he could also do that same thing.",
        "You know, by the date certain, say gee, I think we need to study it a little bit more.",
        "It's become a very contentious issue."

        "I think it's a political thing.",
        "Mark McClelland, who was Bush's, the president's initial commissioner, probably would've held onto the job for a long time, but he was moved over to run another agency that is somewhat political, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
        "And then, since then, the two commissioners who've been acting commissioners, you know, the issues for them have been this birth control issue.",
        "And also, the agency has been in, really in the public eye a lot more in the last five years than it ever has been because of issues like Vioxx, and because of issues like antidepressants in kids.",
        "Right.",
        "Um-hmm.",
        "There's a recent report that was put out by Democratic Representative Henry Waxman that finds that there's been a large drop over the past five years in warning letters sent out by the FDA to companies in violation of federal food and drug safety laws.",
        "This, to me, you know, sounds like the FDA is becoming a little bit lax in…",
        "A lot of people think that.",
        "A lot of people.",
        "Now this particular report was commissioned by a Democrat, but you should know that the Republicans as well are very suspicious of what's been going on at the FDA.",
        "They've done all sorts of studies themselves and had hearings.",
        "You've now got, along with Democratic Rep.",

        "They want to promote them and give them a little more power.",
        "That's interesting to see that its bipartisan support.",
        "Yeah, and when you get bipartisan in this particular Congress, you see some action.",
        "And I guess that's because everybody does view the FDA, and rightfully so, as their watchdog.",
        "Right?",
        "I mean, that's what they're there for.",
        "Yes.",
        "And this agency was absolutely the gold standard around the world.",
        "I mean it, dating back to the thalidomide problem in 1962 - it was a drug that was sold in Europe due to lax enforcement there.",
        "And in this country, before it went on the market, there was a woman at the FDA named Francis Kelsey, she took a look at the data.",
        "She said, this, I don't really like this drug.",
        "At great personal risk to herself, she fought the drug's approval, successfully."

        "That reputation has slipped a little bit in the last five years.",

        "I'd actually take a third option.",
        "What fascinates me is they have to walk the line between risk and benefit.",
        "And one person's, the risk that one person will take is very different than the risk another person will take.",
        "So you have a drug like Lotronex.",

        "Should it be marketed?",
        "Well, the FDA looked at it, and the data looked a little tough.",
        "They came out and they said no. but there was a tremendous public outcry after it was pulled off the market.",
        "It went back on the market in limited distribution, you know, the FDA wants to limit it, but it's hard.",
        "Look at Vioxx.",
        "If doctors had only prescribed it for the people for whom it was initially approved, which is people with arthritis, people who need to take a painkiller every day over time and may not be able to take the intestinal risks of some of the other painkillers, if it had only been used for them, the risk might have been worth it.",
        "But it was over-marketed by the company, it was over-prescribed by doctors, and you had a disaster.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Very good point, because I know lots of doctors who would love to give this to patients who have no other choice.",
        "Right.",
        "And these patients need it.",
        "And they, you know, and its, you're absolutely right.",
        "We have this whole situation now with drugs that there are -just so much of it is off-label, is it not?",
        "Yes, there's an enormous amount of off-label use, and the FDA has attempted to market certain drugs with limited distribution and been unsuccessful, or somewhat unsuccessful.",
        "You take the drug Accutane for severe acne.",
        "Not, you know, not the kind that, you know, teenagers go through and will get rid of, but, you know, severe pitting acne.",

        "Fine, don't sell it to pregnant women.",
        "Well they came up with a registration program - that didn't work.",
        "They came up with a new registration program which requires you can only get a one-month prescription, you've got to go back to your doctor, show two negative, you know, two pregnancy test that come out negative."
