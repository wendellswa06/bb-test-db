        "Yeah, across-the-board, but about half of them in defense.",

        "His books tend to be big and ambitious.",

        "In his masterpiece from 2005, \"\"Europe Central\"\" William Vollmann wrestled the 20th century into one huge, luminous novel that bristled with insight and dread.",
        "The book was astonishing for it's ability to ask and answer great moral questions about the rise of barbarity and what should've been an enlightened time.",
        "And that's why his new book is a disappointment.",
        "It's a collection of ghost stories, and yes there are talking skulls, rising vampires and statues that come to life.",
        "But the writing is flabby and self-indulgent.",
        "And unlike Vollmann's other work, it's infested with cliches.",

        "In the past, I've admired Vollmann's sharp, vigorous prose.",
        "Here though, is page after page of lazy, overwrought verbiage.",

        "That sentence is vintage Vollmann.",
        "It's lyrical and evocative but it tells a hard and ugly truth.",
        "So is the title \"\"Last Stories\"\" literally true?",
        "Beats me.",
        "While the first line insists - this is my final book - Vollmann is a tricky, playful writer and he might be pulling the reader's leg.",
