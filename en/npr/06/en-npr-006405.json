        "Well, last year was great with Mariano Rivera.",

        "And then I interviewed him again after the game when he was named the MVP of the All-Star Game, and he had tears in his eyes again.",
        "So I wouldn't call it funereal, I would call it powerful and I expect similar things tonight with the goodbye to Derek Jeter.",
        "Tim, I want to ask you about All-Star viewing.",
        "It used to be - 30, 40 years ago - that 30 million people would watch the All-Star Game on television.",
        "Five years ago, it was down to half that - under 15 million, last year, about 11 million.",
        "Why does the game keep losing audience?",
        "Well, I think people have a lot of other things to do these days, and I think that's unfortunate because to me, this is the best All-Star Game of any of the four major sports.",
        "And I can remember - I'm old enough to have watched those All-Star games years and years ago and it was an absolute highlight of the summer.",
        "But maybe because we have a million games on every night and half the people in the world seemingly have the baseball package, where you can watch nine games every night or whatever you like, this is just another game to some people, which is unfortunate because to me it's much more than another game.",
        "It's the All-Star Game.",
        "And it's still great, but people aren't watching like they used to.",
        "Is it undercut by the fact of interleague play - that this isn't the one game during the season when players from the National and American Leagues get to face each other?",
        "Unidentified Man #7: I love how it lets you update your status - like, with the most insignificant things you're doing in your life.",
        "Welcome back to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.",
        "I'm Guy Raz.",
        "Our book today is fiction, but it's very much about the true past and present of a Bulgarian.",
        "It's a collection of eight short stories by a young writer named Miroslav Penkov.",
        "The book is titled \"\"East of the West.\"\" In this story, \"\"Buying Lenin,\"\" the young narrator finds the perfect gift for his unreconstructed Stalinist grandfather.",
        "(Reading) I did not expect to stumble upon an auction for Lenin's corpse.",
        "You're bidding for the body of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.",
        "The body is in excellent condition and comes with a refrigerated coffin that works on both American and European current.",
        "The buy it now button indicated a price of $5 flat.",
        "This was a scam, of course, but what wasn't?",
        "I clicked buy it now, completed a transaction.",
        "Congratulations, communistdude1944, the confirmation read.",
        "You bought Lenin.",
        "That is Miroslav Penkov reading from one of the strange bittersweet and vaguely fantastical stories in his new collection \"\"East of the West: A Country in Stories.\"\" It's a book populated by lovers in different countries who swim across a river to meet teenaged hucksters, partisan fighters and bagpipe makers, all characters in a world Penkov had to leave behind when he came to the United States a decade ago.",
        "Miroslav Penkov joins me now from the studios of BNR Radio Bulgaria in Sofia.",
        "Miroslav, welcome to the program.",
        "Thank you so much for having me.",
        "And I should mention that you do live in the U.S.",
        "You teach at the University of North Texas, but you spend - wisely spend the summers outside of Texas in Bulgaria."

        "Yes, that's correct.",
        "Earlier in the introduction, we heard you read from the story.",
        "It's called \"\"Buying Lenin.\"\" A lot of it is about the back and forth arguments between the Stalinist grandfather and the grandson in America over capitalism.",
        "And of course, the grandson eventually goes to what could be just the, you know, the best example of capitalism, eBay, where he finds for sale the corpse of Lenin.",
        "I think the idea is in writing short stories, it's always easy to come up with one preposterous idea if you want to.",
        "And one day, I was walking down the street in Bulgaria and I was thinking, well, what is the most capitalist thing you can possibly do, and that's buying Lenin on eBay.",
        "So it's easy to come up with the ideas.",
        "Supplying the characters was difficult then.",
        "And I tried to imagine the two sides of the chain.",
        "You know, if you have on one hand an old man who's very much dedicated to the ideals of communism, to the lifestyle that communism provided, and then on the other hand, you have a character as the young Bulgarian now who is trying to find luck abroad and very much wants to differentiate himself from the past and forget it and deny it and destroy it basically.",
        "So those were the characters.",
        "So it starts with the idea, but then you have to supply the characters.",
        "In my mind, the story will not work if you don't have characters who are treated with dignity and respect and work as human beings.",
        "This book is about Bulgaria, but it's also about America in some ways and about your, I guess, about things that you probably experienced and maybe are reflected in the book.",
        "You only came to this country 10 years ago as an adult...",
        "That's right.",
        "...and yet, you wrote this book in English, which is not your native language.",
        "It's just - it's a language you just learned, really, in the past 10 years.",
        "Right.",
        "The whole idea of ever writing in English seemed silly to me.",
        "I didn't believe that was possible.",

        "I felt very restricted.",

        "My guest is Miroslav Penkov.",

        "And so I wanted to write about these people, but then I always wanted to understand a few things about myself, of which my biggest fear is that now that I live abroad, I will lose my Bulgaria.",

        "And I don't look at that story as a sad story or a depressing story because I believe that he finds liberation.",
