        "It was wonderful, it was like spring with 30 inches of snow.",
        "It exemplified a lot of what's wrong with Washington mentality both in the bipartisan and the partisan way because that bipartisan deal that Senator Baucus worked out with Senator Grassley was filled with earmarks and pork and stuff that had actually nothing to do with job creation stimulus.",
        "So, it wasn't so great, but it was bipartisan.",
        "And then Harry Reid heard from the left of his party that even that was unacceptable to them.",
        "It gave too much away to corporations.",
        "And so he pared it back to some things that were less business-friendly but had some business job creation elements in it.",

        "On political terms, it's disappointing because you had bad bipartisanship being replaced by bad partisanship.",

        "Well, David is exactly right.",
        "The bill that was put together really was K Street pork.",
        "And, in fact, one of the reasons there was a lot of pressure on Reid from Democrats to back away from it is an AP story that said well, the Democrats have agreed to this bill, which does a lot for lobbyists but not much for job creation.",
        "There was an extraordinary disconnect here, too, because Reid had decided to scuttle the bill, but the White House didn't seem to know this and actually endorsed the Grassley-Reid proposal.",
        "And it was a comedy of - it's not even a comedy of errors.",
        "It's a comedy that happens in Washington when you try to do bipartisanship and no one really means it.",

        "E.J., will Democrats go along with that, where are we going to go, where are we going to end up on that?",
        "Well, I think this bipartisan summit is important not for bipartisanship but to give some spine to probably 10, 11 Senate Democrats who are uneasy about the only strategy that will get a bill through, which is for both Houses to pass the Senate bill and both Houses to use reconciliation that's otherwise known as majority rule - a bill you can pass with 51 votes in the Senate - to get some amendments through.",
        "They don't have the votes for that right now in the Senate.",
        "And I think the hope of supporters of the bill who say we've got to do something, we can't put in all this work and come up with nothing, is that this meeting will either, a small chance, move some Republicans their way, much more likely will show that the Republicans really don't want to cooperate but make it easier for the people who are uneasy about the process to say, all right now we can go ahead and pass this bill.",
        "What does this bill end up being, then, David?",
        "What are we left with, do you think?",
        "Oh, I notice E.J.'s hoping the bipartisan meeting stirs up partisan solidarity and yeah, you know...",
        "That's a fair assessment."
