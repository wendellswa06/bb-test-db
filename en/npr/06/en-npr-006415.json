        "And that's the beneficial side of these things.",
        "However, it's not known exactly how effective they are compared to other FDA-approved treatments to quit smoking like the nicotine patch or nicotine gum.",
        "And there's strong evidence, says Eaton, that e-cigs are helpful only when smokers switch completely from tobacco products to e-cigs.",
        "Eaton says the clear concern raised by this report is that when teens and young adults use the e-cigarettes they're more likely to try regular tobacco cigarettes.",
        "E-cigarettes are addictive.",

        "O'Mara said the evidence shows that Zimmerman was nothing more than a helpful neighbor and a concerned citizen when he called police that night and reported Trayvon Martin as being suspicious.",
        "At one point he even said that Trayvon Martin himself was doing something that was unclear what was going on there, suggesting that Trayvon Martin for a four-minute period, might have been plotting and lying in wait for Zimmerman."

        "The main charge is second degree murder, which can carry a penalty up to life in prison.",
        "And then the other penalty, the lesser penalty is manslaughter.",
        "That can carry up to 30 years in prison.",
        "Zimmerman's lawyer has talked to the jury about that and said that they have an easy job here because all they have to do is assume that Zimmerman acted in self defense.",
        "He says, that's what the law says, that the prosecution has to show he didn't act in self defense.",
