        "And what about William Myers?",
        "Myers is a nominee to the 9th Circuit on the West Coast.",
        "And he began his career as an aide to Wyoming Senator Alan Simpson, who's a strong conservative.",
        "He has worked as a lobbyist for the mining and cattle industries, and as the lead lawyer for the Interior Department under the Bush administration.",

        "And it may be that Myers' and Saad's nominations are being blocked as much because of the courts that they would join as because of their views.",
        "The 9th Circuit is a sharply divided court ideologically, and every judge matters for tipping the balance of power there.",
        "And that's also true on the 6th Circuit.",
        "And there's also some history within in the 1st Circuit that I think affects why Saad's nomination has been blocked.",
        "The court had multiple vacancies for a long time, and there were two Clinton nominees who never got a vote on the Senate floor.",
        "And then President Bush has been able to already appoint four new judges to the 6th Circuit.",
        "And now there are six Democratically appointed judges and six Republican-appointed judges.",

        "And it's sort of, you know, this really heartbreaking example of somebody who was a runner, who clearly had a lot of talent in his youth and maybe made some bad decisions for whatever reasons, whatever factors in his life led to that path and who now, you know, obviously, has fallen far from the runner he says he once was.",
        "And, so you know, it is sort of this poignant moment where you're contrasting, like, Thomas, who is so successful and has just won this race and has his whole future ahead of him and this man who's, you know, quite a bit older and obviously has taken an unfortunate detour in his life.",
