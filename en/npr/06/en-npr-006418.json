        "That's right.",
        "That's not true necessarily for the entire Navajo nation, which is, you know, quite expansive and covers 27,000 square miles.",

        "But at the same time, I could see my future, and I could see what it is I wanted to do with my life.",
        "And I think what was the most heartbreaking for me was the fact that my mother told me that - this is after I graduated my first bachelor's - she cried for four months after I had left, and I never - she never revealed that to me after I left.",
        "So, you know, in a sense, I feel regret in the sense I was never - that I felt like I could never be there for my younger siblings, but I could - but in the sense that it's gratifying in the fact that I've went off and did these sort of things.",

        "But it's also the fact that you leave behind a community that you were raised at.",
        "I mean, on the reservation, you know, everybody know everybody.",
        "It's well-knit.",
