        "And just very quickly, are Baghdad residents obeying the order to stay inside -this curfew?",
        "Well, for the time being things seem quieter here in Baghdad.",
        "We drove around this morning in spite of the curfew and noticed that there were people walking on the streets but virtually no cars.",
        "Some restaurants were open but there weren't many customers.",
        "I mean, one interesting thing to note is that these police checkpoints we generally see outside the Green Zone where we live are not being manned by police.",
        "Instead, the army members are there.",
        "And we had reports yesterday of police defecting en masse and taking off their uniforms and either leaving their posts or joining Mahdi forces.",
        "And certainly that might be a reason why the police are not out today.",
        "This also is the weekend that Shiite militants were supposed to hand in their guns.",
        "That was demanded by Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki.",
        "He has just extended that deadline.",
        "Tell us about that.",
        "Well, basically they had 72 hours to turn over their guns, and that would've been up tonight.",
        "And it was actually this funnel point that we were all working towards.",
        "We figured that was when the big blow-up was going to come.",
        "And then Maliki announced this morning that he's going to extend that deadline until April 8th and has said he'll trade money for weapons."

        "I mean, he set a deadline and then he caved.",
        "And what we're hearing is that the Iraqi security forces in Basra are in disarray and members of the army, and as I said before, the police are defecting to the other side.",
        "And Maliki's got himself into a bit of a predicament here that's going to be very difficult to extract himself from.",
        "Also interestingly, yesterday he said he would fight this to the end.",
        "And now his office is murmuring about negotiations and talks.",

        "I mean, technically what he's taking on - and this is what the American line has been, too - is they're taking on rogue elements of that army, because technically there's a cease-fire between the Mahdi Army and the U.S.",
        "and Iraqi forces.",
        "So what they're saying here is that the fighting is just among these rogue elements who were trained in Iran and aren't listening to Moqtada al-Sadr.",

        "And we're hearing that Mahdi Army members - rogue or not, unclear - are building bunkers to fortify their positions inside the city.",

        "Zani's accompanists here include his own son and the surviving sons of key members from his original band.",
        "Their youthful energy is part of what makes this album such a thrill, but when Zani takes a solo, it's clear who the real master is.",
