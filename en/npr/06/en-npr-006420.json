        "Well, the article was about a musician.",
        "He was visiting Wesley's school at the time.",
        "Anyway, that quote was about wanting to be an artist.",
        "And a few years ago, a friend of Wesley's dug it up and sent it to him.",
        "It was kind of reassuring to see that I did have some intention with that, even at an early age.",

        "The primary thing we are doing is we are promoting national legislation, a National Environmental Justice Act of 2008, to provide a weapon, a way for communities to protect themselves.",
        "Right now, there are no protections in place.",
        "The Civil Rights Act will not work.",
        "The Presidential Executive order on Environmental Justice will not work in a legal framework.",
        "So we have put together legislation that would solve the problem and would provide a tool for local communities to protect themselves.",

        "We call it a carrot.",

        "Congresswoman Solis from California has introduced another bill, but it basically codifies the Presidential Executive Order which is more of a federal agency cooperation and also advisory panels.",
        "Our legislation would actually put teeth into the situation and there's been somewhat of a reluctance to then compete with the other, more popular bill.",
        "Well, Monique, let me go back to you.",

        "Your group is located in New Orleans and, of course, the ramifications of Hurricane Katrina are still being felt there.",
        "What are you seeing on the ground in New Orleans?",
        "Well, what's happening on the ground is a massive privatization that in particular affects African-Americans and poor people.",
        "It keeps us from returning to the places we call home.",
        "And really bright spots are people from our communities taking leadership and building community clinics, safely-back-home projects to get people home.",
        "But it's a real undertaking because we've got a system that doesn't protect our right to recover.",
        "No one in the U.S.",
        "has the right to recover after a disaster.",
        "And that's part of the problem.",
        "I mean, that's central to the problem, because our recovery has been turned into a promise, and an empty promise at that.",
        "And one of the things that we are fighting for, with Advocates for Environmental Human Rights, is making recovery a right.",
        "And I think the same goes for environmental justice is that legislation needs to really be focused on the ways in which the current system violates human rights and how it can be changed and transform so that people do have the right to health, the right to life, the right to racial equality and freedom from racial discrimination.",
        "Specifically, what are neighborhoods dealing with?",
        "I mean, we have been, as a show, down to New Orleans several times and saw the city flooded and saw the houses filled with mold and all that.",
        "And also saw things like people planting sunflowers to try to leach toxins out of the soil in the Ninth Ward.",
        "What's being done right now to try to improve the environmental health of communities like the Ninth Ward?",
        "Well, again, it's the communities themselves really taking leadership.",
        "In parts of the Ninth Ward, you have sustainable green building for restoring and repairing and rebuilding housing of residents who were flooded out because of a breech of the levies, not by Hurricane Katrina, it's because of the substandard levies.",
        "That's, you know, a real bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming situation that we have, where recovery is being perverted as, you know - privatization is being called recovery.",
        "But again, if you look at the Ninth Ward, there's the Holy Cross Neighborhood Association, the neighborhood group of folks who are going to be celebrating some new homes in the Ninth Ward that have been built with sustainable features and green building.",
        "Let's talk, Norris, a little bit about what some folks are calling green-collar jobs.",

        "That's the reason organizations such as ours exist.",

        "Do you see an opportunity?",
        "You talk about the community activism and people pulling together when they're not necessarily getting a lot of outside help in New Orleans.",
        "But do you see an opportunity for folks to enter some of these green jobs?",
        "And do you see people being recruited who are from New Orleans for these kinds of jobs?",
        "Well, there are certainly opportunities.",
        "In New Orleans, the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice for more than a decade have been training African-American Men and Women in green jobs, and also finding employment opportunities as part of the training program that they offer.",
        "And so the opportunities certainly do exist, but I think one of the things we need to take a look at is not just market-based solutions, but really looking at the ways in which we can ensure that environmental protection actually does support human rights.",
        "If we had a system that protected the human right to life health and racial equality, we - you know, the idea of green jobs would already be on the board and well supported.",
        "But the tension that we have is that on the one hand green jobs and sustainable building and sustainable energy and renewable energy is vying for space with the current system that is allowed for dirty, polluting facilities and oil refineries, coal-fired power plants and the like.",
        "And we think both - you know, efforts need to be made in both ways, both with the market-based solutions, but also legal solutions that changes the system.",
        "Give me an example of what a success story is for you.",
        "Something you've seen, Monique, or something that you know that another group has worked on.",
        "What does success in dealing with race and environmentalism mean to you?",
        "Well, success stories that we've had have involved embracing a community struggle to convince regulatory agencies around protecting the community from a polluting source.",
        "It's also meant to provide communities fighting for environmental justice with resources for controlling the development in their area and their neighborhood.",
