        "In recent months, there's been a growing pile of data suggesting that the recession is nearing an end and that, while the economy isn't growing yet, it's no longer shrinking the way it was.",
        "This morning's report confirms that.",
        "The Commerce Department said the economy shrank at an annual rate of 6.5 percent during the first three months of this year.",
        "But by the second quarter, the decline was much smaller.",
        "President Obama spoke about the report this afternoon.",
        "It told how close we were to the edge.",
        "But the GDP also revealed that in the last few months, the economy has done measurably better than we had thought - better than expected.",
        "The president said the economy still has a long way to go and unemployment is still a big problem.",
        "But the economy has improved, and he said that's due in no small part to the nearly $800 billion stimulus package he pushed through Congress.",
        "Economist Josh Bivens, of the Economic Policy Institute, agrees.",
        "He notes that federal spending rose nearly 11 percent during the second quarter, and state and local government spending went up, too.",
        "In fact, government spending was, by far, the strongest part of the report.",
        "Absent the Recovery Act, the stimulus package - we probably would've been looking at something like a minus four percent, which is in line with the three really bad quarters that preceded it.",
        "So, I think that was the difference between this being merely bad, instead of another disastrous quarter.",
        "Bivens says the economy is by no means out of the woods.",
        "He says it's not really clear whether this is a temporary rebound.",
        "One problem on the horizon is consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of economic activity.",
        "It fell by 1.2 percent during the second quarter, after rising the quarter before.",
        "Bivens says unemployment is high, so people are buying less and saving more.",
        "So to me, the prudent thing to do - the insurance against a really bad next two to three years - would be even more stimulus.",
        "But Alan Meltzer, professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon, doesn't think that would be such a good idea.",
        "Meltzer says the stimulus package did boost the economy, but not as much as it should have, because Congress spent the money unwisely.",
        "Meltzer has a different view of what happened to growth last quarter.",
        "He says the economy is simply finding its footing again, after the government's disastrous decision to let Lehman Brothers fail last September.",
        "There was a panic in the markets end of last year.",
        "The first quarter reflected that.",
        "We're now back to where we're picking up from where we might've been if they hadn't done such a terrible thing.",
        "But he is doubtful the economy will keep improving, given all the increased spending and the talk about higher taxes coming out of Washington right now.",
        "On Wall Street, the view is more optimistic.",
        "Stock prices finished the day higher, and they ended the month up again.",
        "Whatever the reason, many investors are convinced that the long, stubborn recession, that got underway more than a year and a half ago, is almost over.",
        "And this morning's reports seem to support that conclusion.",

        "And, David, what was different, if anything, about what the president had to say today compared to previous statements?",
        "Well, Steve, it's probably important to point out first that much of this was the same.",
        "I don't think you can leave this speech saying the president has dramatically altered his approach to Iraq.",
        "But the signals he sent were important.",
        "He spoke more than he ever has about the idea of bringing troops home, and as you heard, he said he will be able to do that and not undermine the ability to fight the insurgency.",
        "So the president sent that message, but also made clear, as he has been doing for days, that the decision when to bring troops home is his--not Democrats, not anyone else, but it's up to him and his military commanders.",
        "And we're about to talk, David, about the status of Iraqi forces who would take over from Americans under the president's plan.",
        "What is the president saying about how well-trained the Iraqis are now?",
        "Well, the president made a pretty forceful case that Iraqi forces are taking on more leadership in missions, they're taking control of bases and larger areas of the country.",
        "He even went after critics who have been saying that only one Iraqi battalion in the country is ready to operate on its own.",
        "He said that's not a measure of success, and that even some NATO battalions might not even meet the standard of being able to operate independently."

        "So with all that in mind, you know, the difficulty in stopping this team, are the Jayhawks the team to do it?",
        "Well, first of all, Alex, this is good GOP politics--specifically in parts of the West where many people believe the federal government's always had too much control.",
        "It's good politics because it plays to the administration's base, to industry.",
        "It's about timber jobs.",
        "And Mark Rey, the undersecretary of Agriculture in charge of the Forest Service, said yesterday again and again in announcing this that, you know, this is about ensuring decisions are developed around local conditions, local political consensus.",
        "Now whether all of this results in wholesale logging of last remaining roadless forests, that all depends now on the governors, the Forest Service and--even more importantly, Alex--the market.",
        "Rey said yesterday he thinks states will pretty much protect what was protected by the original rule.",
        "But, remember, even if the states petition one way or another, the Forest Service ultimately has the final say now in what should happen, and even if the Forest Service proposes a timber sale in a particular area, the industry still has to want to bid on it.",
        "That depends on whether they can make any money on it, and that depends on the global timber market.",
        "Well, what about Alaska, which has so much national forest?",
        "How are these new rules going to play out there?",
        "Well, about a quarter of the so-called roadless area, Alex--they're right here in Alaska, and much of that is in the Tongass National Forest, in the southeastern part of the state.",
        "And while it was said yesterday that this new rule would have no effect on the Tongass, that's simply because the Forest Service already exempted the Tongass from the roadless rule just before Christmas last year, so it wasn't protected.",
        "And since that exemption, the agency has been proposing new timber sales and the roads that go along with those sales in the Tongass.",
        "And that's been applauded by the timber industry here, which has been on its last legs for years, and has environmentalists, but also some native communities--fishermen, tourism operators, all kinds of folks--up in arms.",
        "But the more interesting thing, Alex, is that there hasn't been a whole lot of interest in the timber.",
        "And remember these sales and the road building they require are largely subsidized by federal tax dollars.",
        "So this question is not only environmental--Does the public want these forests roaded and logged?--but also economic--At what cost does the public want these forests roaded and logged?",

        "Shalit -and also to the rest of the world - to the Palestinians, there's a lot more in store for you unless you release our corporal.",
        "And to the rest of the world, look how patient we're being.",
        "And they also sent that message to Syria today, and people might be puzzled.",

        "Shalit.",
