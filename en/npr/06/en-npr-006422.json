        "So this was a tough one.",
        "How did you figure it out?",
        "So yes.",
        "So he's offering most of what they were already asking for - so the $5.7 billion for a steel barrier on the southern border and some other - some more money for inspections at the ports and also for more judges, more border agents - and all of that in exchange for extensions on the DACA recipients and for those who have temporary protected status - this three-year extension for both.",
        "And the idea that he was putting forward is that those three years would then be used to come up with a larger immigration proposal to deal with the issues that Washington has been trying to deal with for years now.",
        "But that was - so that is the offer from President Trump.",
        "And the DACA recipients, or the DREAMers, as they're known - they've been held as a bargaining chip before.",
        "So what's new, if anything, in what the president's offering today?",
        "It's not necessarily that anything is new here.",
        "Some of these - all of these have been floating around for a while.",
        "And there was a much bigger deal on the table before - long before these - before the shutdown of the government that would have had $25 billion in exchange for some DACA - for compromise on DACA.",
        "But this is basically just he's saying, this is what I will give you now to get the government back open.",
        "We will have a temporary extension of DACA.",
        "And hopefully, that will help ease it for - because there are hardliners on his side who do not want to see DACA recipients stay in the U.S., even for a temporary extension.",
        "Right.",
        "So - which raises the question of how this would play with the president's base.",
        "This is a risk for him.",
        "Right now, we already are seeing tweets from Ann Coulter saying that this is amnesty.",
        "People from the Heritage Foundation, which is conservative, are also saying this is amnesty and that this will encourage more people to come into the country illegally.",
        "So we can say that there will be some pushback from people on President Trump's side to this deal."

        "And what they have clearly said today again - early, even before the president outlined his speech - saying do not compromise on the wall.",
