        "So they want there to be some benefit from this?",
        "Exactly, yes, because the Palestinian are suffering a lot under occupation..."

        "That is a huge breakthrough, if, in fact, it's implemented, because it seems to suggest an agreement not to attack on Israeli soil.",
        "And if, in fact - if that is the understanding, it would be a huge breakthrough.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "So we have an opening that can be tested, that needs to be tested, but this is happening in an environment of escalation and violence and humanitarian crisis that could overcome any possible move forward."
