        "Every time it seems that there is an opening - this one, the window closed rather quickly, yet militants seem to be determined to make sure that doesn't happen, militants on both sides.",

        "Before we let you go, David Makovsky, you said you met today earlier with the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert.",
        "Did he mention the Israeli aircraft that buzzed the home of the Syrian president by the Mediterranean Sea earlier today and what he meant by that?",
        "No, he didn't.",
        "He didn't talk about it, but he said that there's some things that are going to be released soon that you'll hear.",
        "But I think, look, the key in this whole thing is understand that it's not the U.S.",
        "and Israel, you know, against Hamas.",
        "What we got here is a situation, you know, where - what we call a quartet.",
        "The U.S., the Europeans, the Russians, the U.N.",
        "have come together.",
        "It's the whole international community that has said to Hamas, you know, we've poured billions of dollars in this peace process over the last decade because it was predicated on the idea of co-existence.",
        "In comes Hamas, says it wants to destroy its neighbor, but don't give me a penny less than you gave the last guy.",
        "And that's just not acceptable and it won't acceptable either to have a partial ceasefire in my mind, because you know the Israelis won't accept, well, if, you know they don't kill you in Manhattan, they'll kill you in New Jersey.",
        "They're not going to go for that.",
        "They'll end up going after their people, because they have to protect their citizens.",
        "What we need to do is help codify a comprehensive ceasefire that all the factions stop shooting and start talking about ways to moving forward.",
        "All these partial moves are going to have holes as big as Swiss cheese and it's just not going to work and the violence is going to continue.",
        "Let's try to find a comprehensive ceasefire with Fatah and the Islamic Jihad, and define it, which hasn't been done.",
        "And then have real quiet.",
        "I feel these partial approaches are going to create such big loopholes that we won't be stopping the violence.",
        "And Shibley Telhami, let me finally ask you.",
        "We seem to be - this is obviously an important incident thus far.",
        "It is not yet all-out war, but that certainly seems a possibility, too.",
        "Well, I don't think so for the following reason.",
        "I think if you go into an all-out war, it's a strategic decision that has huge consequences.",
        "I don't think the events of the past couple weeks, bad as they were, warrant a huge strategic shift.",
        "And I think that, frankly, neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis have an option other than to pursue an opening.",
        "The Israelis are learning that unilateralism has its limits, and ultimately they're going to have to enter into some kind of an agreement with the Palestinians.",
        "I think that, sure, Hamas is going to have to recognize Israel.",
        "If they don't, there can be no deal.",
        "That is quite obvious.",
        "I think the only question is, how do you ever test them?",
        "Do you test them without giving them any leeway to be tested?",
        "Or do you put them under constant siege in which you have a risk of an escalation every single day?",
        "That's a big question.",
        "I think we haven't thought about the consequences of a tough measure.",
        "This is what we get, and sure, things can get out of hand in ways that neither side wants.",
        "Shibley Telhami, thanks very much."
