        "DON BERWICK: The amenities are nice, of course.",
        "But what really counts in patient-centered care is that the more patients and families and their loved ones participate in their own care, really play an active role in the care itself, the better the care gets.",
        "Outcomes gets better, costs fall and satisfaction increases.",
        "Of course, making a hospital truly patient-centered requires a big change on the part of the people providing that care.",

        "Winick says that one of the things that bothered him when the hospital moved to patient-centered care was eliminating set visiting hours.",
        "Among other things, that allowed patients' families unlimited access to the ICU.",
        "He was worried about what would happen when a patient's heart stopped and the resuscitation team rushed in.",
        "And having the family members standing there watching, I felt would traumatize the patient's families because they don't understand what's going on.",
        "But Winick says when that happens a staff member is always assigned to explain to the family what's happening.",
        "So it hasn't been a problem after all.",
        "Winick also says putting patients at the top of the pyramid has improved communication between members of the medical staff.",
        "It puts everybody in the mindset that I'm doing this for the patient.",
        "And the doctor doesn't mistreat a nurse out of anger because she's doing it or he's doing it, you know, asking a question for the patient's benefit.",
        "Berwick and other quality experts warn that being a patient-centered facility doesn't guarantee high-quality care.",
        "Patients still have to make sure the medical staff is following proper guidelines for care and getting good outcomes.",
        "But they say that keeping the patient and family highly involved in their care is one indicator of a good hospital."
