        "Well, a lot of people say that would be much more effective in actually preventing gun violence than even an assault weapons ban.",
        "Well, then you could make the case that the kid who got the guns in Sandy Hook got them from his mother, who had the guns legally.",
        "So I mean, we could argue this thing - oh John, are you still there?",
        "And that hardly seemed even possible before Sandy Hook, that you would even be looking at universal background checks.",

        "It just seems like, though, that, you know, it seems like Harry Reid was very willing to give Democrats like Mary Landrieu cover by not having the assault weapons ban, but whereas Michael Bloomberg doesn't seem as reticent.",
        "He seems like he's going to - look, he's going to challenge both Democrats and Republicans on the gun issue.",
        "Well, true, but he hasn't come out for an assault weapons ban, you know, as far as these ads go.",
        "And I think that Democratic like Landrieu, the more time this takes, and it looks like it could take time, especially if we're looking at a filibuster, the more time this takes and the more distance we have between these ads and any kind of vote, I think that might bode - might make it easier for Landrieu to be able to vote for the bill.",
        "And it's also interesting, these are targeted at senators because if there's going to be a bill, it's going to come out of the Democratically controlled United States Senate.",
        "Then there's the question of how it might fare in the House of Representatives."
