        "But might this message be a little bit more acceptable with another public face?",
        "Well, I say the ad, the common, the average viewer will look at the ad and first wouldn't even know who Mayor Bloomberg is except for the, you know, the Big Gulp controversy; his fingerprints are not all over the ad, you know, the content of it.",
        "It looks like a reasonable ad for a lot of voters in the state.",
        "So I think, you know, in the ad itself, you know, Bloomberg has a low profile, and I don't think many voters yet are connecting him to what they're seeing on TV.",

        "And that's one of the challenges facing Senator Hagan, is she, she won, as you know, in 2008.",
        "She outpolled President Obama, but the energy that President Obama's campaign brought to the state in 2008 helped swell the electorate, brought new people - burgeoned the electorate.",
        "2014 is likely to have a much smaller electorate, you know, much more base-level electorate.",
        "And so that clearly is a factor that she has to weigh politically.",

        "And let's be clear about some of these things.",
        "One is, is President Obama won the state in 2008 by 14,000 votes.",
        "Mitt Romney won the state in 2012 by 90,000 votes.",
        "And that's out of, you know, more than four million cast.",
        "So this is a very narrowly divided state.",
        "The legislative victory and the congressional district changeover has to do with the bump that Republicans got in 2010 in the midterm election plus redistricting that maximized the number of Republican districts.",

        "And as we look at this situation, we've had Senator Hagan say she has now come out in favor of same-sex marriage, as Ken reported earlier.",
        "She has said she will likely vote for universal background checks but needs to look at, of course, the actual language of any bill, would not likely support any assault weapons ban.",
        "It doesn't look like she's going to be asked to.",
        "But is this an element of her being held to account with her own base?",
        "There's a progressive element of the Democratic Party that's going to insist that she support these things.",
        "Right.",
        "And that's - that was my point earlier, is to how much does she look toward the old cultural conservative sentiment in North Carolina, how much the more modern North Carolina.",
        "Public Policy Polling, which is a Democratic Party-aligned poll, has the state as usual on these kind of issues narrowly divided.",
        "On the assault weapons ban, its latest poll had 50 percent in favor, and 41 percent opposed, which, you know, many issues come out in that kind of 50-40 range in the state and that - and, of course, those data come before the Bloomberg ads are aired and before much of the National Rifle Association pushback has arrived.",
        "So this is, you know, in many ways a swing state, a swing state on a lot of issues that it's narrowly divided between Democrats and Republicans.",
        "There's a large segment of independent unaffiliated voters who mostly vote Democratic and Republican but are - but many of them are persuadable.",
        "So this is a state in which a lot of issues come down to a choice between options that divide people.",
        "And it's interesting, these ads and - and as you suggest, the pushback, all timed for the congressional break, the Easter break.",
        "And so this is when the senators and congressmen are back in their home districts and presumably getting the brunt or whatever pressure these ads and this pushback may deliver.",
