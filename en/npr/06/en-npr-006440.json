        "And Pollitz says there's one area in particular that worries her.",
        "She says small business owners, like so many farmers who buy their insurance as individuals, are at risk of paying higher prices when they have pre-existing conditions like cancer or diabetes.",
        "She says a few states, including Massachusetts and New York, guarantee that everyone can get health insurance and pay similar prices for it, but Pollitz says most states don't have these rules.",
        "So, your protections in this market are much less compared to group plans, where federal law says, it's just not allowed to discriminate against people based on their health status.",
        "In this market, you always get discriminated against based on your health status.",
        "It's disconcerting, that's for sure, and we'd certainly like to find ways for them not to do that.",

        "He says he'd like to see his members pay less for healthcare.",

        "I must say, the NEWS AND NOTES program and its coverage of the illegal immigration issue has completely missed the point,\" he writes.",
        "Earl Ofari Hutchinson, and others on your show, have framed illegal immigration as a concern to black Americans, because illegals are competing with blacks for jobs and/or other resources.",
        "Although the resource issue is real, the illegal immigration issue is far more basic than that.",
        "The fact that people, whether they be Hispanic or not, have willingly and knowingly crossed America's borders illegally is the issue.",
        "Breaking the laws of this nation is not a civil rights issue or a human rights issue: It is a law enforcement issue.",
        "I think it insults the civil rights legacy to frame illegal immigration as a civil or human rights issue.",
        "And I feel it reasonable to believe that black Americans see this issue for what it really is.",

        "The day the deal was signed, Sherman described it as good, bad and ugly in a speech on the House floor, the ugly being the sunset provisions that lift restrictions on Iran's nuclear capacities starting 10 years into the agreement.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "In its 10th year, it's so ugly that we have to demand additional negotiations.",
        "And when we make that demand, we need to make that demand in the voice of a president in a future administration who is determined to say that Iran can never have an unlimited number of centrifuges; Iran can never be a few days from a nuclear weapon and that in order to prevent that, we have the legal right to put all options on the table.",
        "I asked Congressman Sherman what he thinks now that President Trump is saying many of those same things."

        "To have effective sanctions, you need a combination of pressure and persuasion, and he's done nothing to persuade the rest of the world as President Obama had that we do need to get tough again with Iran.",
        "So his approach is to try to sanction Iran.",
        "And instead of doing it for what Iran is doing in Syria, where they're killing hundreds of thousands of people, or Yemen, where they're responsible for tens of thousands of deaths, he's saying, let's tear up the Iran deal now when its problem is in 2026.",
        "But he is also raising this issue - these issues that you're talking about.",

        "Instead of picking arguments that would resonate in Europe and Asia, he's picking arguments that Europe and Asia are rejecting.",
