        "And they'll be all over the city, in Solomon Projects and CAU this festival.",
        "It's actually quite - it actually is pretty amazing, considering this is, you know, the first - our first, you know, crack at this.",
        "And it turns out, you know, our electrodes - some of the electrodes are not that very close to each other.",
        "Some of them were as far apart as a centimeter.",
        "In some patients, they were as close as four millimeters.",
        "But we know from other evidence that there's actually information in your cortex, in the surface of your brain, probably at about a millimeter to two.",
        "So it may be that if we can better electrode spacing, higher density, we could even improve on that particular - on the reconstructions that you heard.",
        "So if I said the word - the phrase, two words, SCIENCE FRIDAY and you tapped into the brain to see how the electrical stimulations occurred, you could then take, like, put them on a tape recorder, so to speak, play them back through your reconstruction, and we would know that that's what was heard.",
        "Well, you'd know to the level you could make these words out right now.",
        "We know statistically that we are 90 percent accurate in picking out what word was heard from, you know, from a choice of a couple words.",
        "But, you know, we are no better than what you just heard right now.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "But it is one step closer to being able to read what our thoughts are.",
        "Well, you know, it takes it - it does - it takes us up, if you will, the perceptual food chain.",
        "I mean, it's been known for many years that the brain areas that are active when you perceive things - let's say you look at an orange.",
        "If you now mentally visualize an orange, that same area responds.",
        "And similarly, in the motor system, if you move your right arm, and now you think about moving your right arm, the same areas are active.",
        "In fact, that's the principle that we use to try to grab signals when we're trying to create motor-assistive devices for people, for instance, with strokes or, you know, quadriplegic from some spinal cord injury.",
        "And we think the same thing holds in the auditory system.",
        "So if I say to you the word - if I say two words, SCIENCE FRIDAY, and now you imagine SCIENCE FRIDAY, we know from other evidence - not this electrical recording, but from other brain imaging techniques - that the same approximate area is activated.",
        "So the hope, of course, is that we can go to the next level, which is to go not just from reconstructing what you heard, but reconstructing exactly what you're thinking.",
        "That would be a tremendous advance, and that would really, for use in neurological patients, it would be just - it could really lead to assistive devices, implanted assistive devices for people who can't speak but know what they want to say, and their language and their thought is trapped inside their head.",
        "I guess the most famous of those would be Stephen Hawking.",
        "Well, he's a certainly, you know, a perfect example.",
        "But any patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease or patients who are, quote, \"\"locked-in\"\" from a stroke in their brain stem - or, for instance, an even bigger group of patients, people who have stroke.",
        "If you get stroke usually in the left side of your brain - most people's language is on the left side - you can get stroke where you can't understand what's being said to you.",
        "Or you can get a stroke where you can understand, but you can't output.",
        "And the patients who can't output, these are patients who are called Broca's aphasia.",
        "They can't speak.",
        "That would be a prime target because they - the word form is in there.",
        "Interestingly, the area that we get our best word reconstruction from is actually the area that if you damage it from some neurological problem, most commonly a stroke, you actually lose the ability to understand words.",
        "So there's a nice link there.",
        "In fact, that's - we kind of - that's what, in part, why we focused on there.",
        "We thought it would be an important spot to focus on."

        "So you chose patients from - who were in a hospital to study in that area?",
        "Well, they - we didn't choose them.",
        "We knew that would be a primary for our reconstruction algorithm.",
        "And the patients had the electrodes implanted not by us.",
        "They were - and we had no control over where they went.",
        "They were implanted for clinical reasons.",
        "These are patients who have what are called intractable or uncontrolled seizures.",
        "They don't respond very well to medications.",
        "And in a subgroup of that patient - patients, which is a large number of patients, if you can pinpoint the start of the electrical discharge for the epilepsy, the surgeon can surgically take it out and get, you know, really control rates in the 70 to 80 percent.",
        "So the patients are sitting in the hospital.",
        "The surgeon and the epilepsy doctor, the neurologist, pick where the electrodes are.",
        "And then the patients are sitting there for two, three, four, sometimes seven, eight days waiting to have a seizure.",
        "And if they feel like it, they participate in different experiments.",
        "And one of them - one of the types of experiments we've been working on is language representation.",
        "And, of course, these are electrodes, they're placed directly on the brain.",
        "They are directly on the surface of the brain.",
        "There is no intervening dura, skull, scalp.",
        "We can't do this right now in - with scalp recordings.",
        "The fidelity of the signal is just not good enough in several dimensions.",
        "A scalp electrode can probably pick up activity from three centimeters of brain tissue, and we really need it to be much finer to be able to make these kind of reconstructions.",
        "When you say we need to be much finer, what - physically, what technology, what kind of breakthrough here?",
        "Well, I think it's the higher density grids.",
        "I mean, there will be a couple things.",
        "You know, we're working on, you know, grids that are in 800 micron spacing, which is, you know, less than a millimeter.",
        "We'd be very happy if we could get two millimeter grids, though, because that would almost quadruple the amount of information.",
        "I mean, really, you know, the brain is an information processor.",
        "So the more information we can get out of it, the better we can do trying to make sense of what the brain is doing.",
        "One of the things we're doing at Berkeley, there's - we have a neural engineering and neural - and prosthetics program we just launched between Berkeley and UCSF.",
        "And our engineering colleagues are actually working on an implantable wireless device, which is what you would eventually need.",
        "Right now, you know, of course, the wires are coming out of the head and, you know, that wouldn't work.",
        "If you're going to have something that works in the same kind of concept, if you will, of like a pacemaker for heart disease or a cochlear implant for hearing, it has to be fully implantable, safe, wireless and externally chargeable.",
        "So when it comes to who comes, are there a lot of non-black folk who show up?",
        "And is their reaction in any way different from the African-American community members and visitors who come?",
        "Because we've put like 10 reporters on this and are asking everybody and..."

        "And this has taken it to the next level - because of unfortunate patients with epilepsy, of course, but their patients are great.",
        "And they understand this research is important, and they let us, you know, while they're waiting to be treated, they let us monitor their brain.",
