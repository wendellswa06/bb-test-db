        "Not a bad idea.",
        "Now, this goes back, I have read over the weekend, to the 1970s.",
        "Is that possible, this scheme by Mr. Madoff?",
        "Well, no one knows when it went offtrack.",
        "But what is clear is that what was required to keep it going was always more money coming in than going out.",
        "And one reason that investors were not alarmed was, every time they asked for money back, they got it really, really swiftly.",
        "And as far as the investors were concerned, they weren't getting a big return, but they were getting good returns in bad markets.",
        "Well, it was the consistency, oddly enough, that should've been one of the biggest red flags because it is impossible to have that kind of good consistent return in all markets.",
        "They thought it was so stable, and a lot of people for whom stability is important thought cannot be wrong because if it was a Ponzi scheme, he'd go for broke.",
        "Well, tell us about the SEC and their investigations.",
        "Has the agency just been undervalued and perhaps understaffed and not with enough talent over the last few years?",
        "What's been going on there?",

        "Well, we certainly always try to promote.",

        "It's a festival - it's a cultural festival that really focuses on cultural connections and cultural influences.",
        "So from the very beginning since 1988, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra has always participated - the Woodruff Arts Center.",
        "The Center for Puppetry Arts is doing a piece on \"\"Anansi the Spider.",
        "So we do the festival in different communities all around the city.",
        "And I think it certainly has opened up the door more and more to position the festival events at the Woodruff Arts Center and other places and spaces where all the different communities feel welcome and feel like it's an important event to not just come themselves but bring their children and their families because it's an educational event.",
        "You learn so much.",
        "The festival is designed to really challenge people in terms of what they think, what they think about themselves and the things that they're experiencing, but then how they see themselves and the responsibility that they take on in their place and space in the world.",

        "But there is another side to this that is more positive, which is Syria has a future as a congeries of sectarian and ethnic groups united by commerce along the Mediterranean, much like early-20th-century Beirut, Smyrna or Alexandria.",
