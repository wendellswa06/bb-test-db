        "Yes...",
        "No natural borders.",
        "Yeah, and it's not even existing from, what, 1920s till after the Second World War.",
        "Yes, Poland is lucky, in a way, now, because geography is also about natural resources.",
        "And Poland has significant amounts of shale gas underneath the ground that could make it a mini-energy power in the 21st century that can give it real leverage in terms of its relationship between both Russia and Germany.",
        "Poland also is - it's now a member of NATO.",

        "It's always changing.",
        "We can talk later about how technology is changing it, but new energy discoveries are also changing it in the same way.",
        "I would say that Poland is the emerging pivot state of Europe, because if the Russians are able to reclaim - in a practical sense - Ukraine, which they seem to be on the way to doing, there's going to be a quiet battle over Poland between the EU and NATO, and Russia on the other hand.",
        "Well, I'm sure Poland is used to that by now."

        "But the - as you look at the future of that part of Europe, indeed, Robert Kaplan, you say middle Europe, this idea that existed - well, sort of an ephemeral idea, but nevertheless - we need to make it less-than-ephemeral.",
        "We need to put it into practice.",
        "Yes.",
        "I start the book in my first chapter about the term Central Europe, or Mitteleuropa, which was rediscovered or re-energized, I would say, by intellectuals in the latter part of the Cold War, around the mid-1980s.",
        "In other words, the Cold War threw up two geographical concepts: Western Europe and Eastern Europe, with Germany divided in the middle, with all of that to the east being these gray, boring, repressed satellite states.",
        "And what the intellectuals brought up is, no, much of what is occupied by the Soviet Union was a vibrant, romantic, liberal cafe culture redolent of good wines and great thinkers like Freud and great artists like Klimt, and we have to regain this sense of Central Europe between East and West.",
        "And as I take people through the whole book and all the formidable challenges that geography presents to us, I can only end the book by coming back to that concept of Central Europe because it's the term of creating these liberal, humanist spaces that has to be the ultimate goal of American foreign policy, because policy has to have a purpose.",
        "It cannot just be self-interest of the nation.",
        "For a nation to have an identity, it requires an idealistic purpose of some sort.",
        "And I boil it down - after going all around the world from Europe to Mexico - as saying that it's the drive to expand Central Europe across Eurasia.",
        "We're talking with Robert Kaplan about his new book, \"\"The Revenge of Geography.\"\" More to your calls in a moment.",

        "Why does President Vladimir Putin covet buffer zones in Eastern Europe and the Caucuses, just as the czars and commissars did before him?",
        "In \"\"The Revenge of Geography,\"\" Robert Kaplan argues that the most important fact about Russia is that it's a flat plain that extends from Europe to the Far East, with few natural borders anywhere.",
        "That creates what he describes as a landscape of anarchy, in which every group is permanently insecure."

        "I think England has been particularly blessed with being surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea.",
        "It's never needed a standing army, and, in fact, an invading army hasn't succeeded in even putting one foot on English soil for hundreds and hundreds of years.",
        "I think since 1066.",
        "But anyway, go ahead.",
        "Yes.",

        "They divide it.",
        "So they make it even more and more vulnerable.",
        "Back to England: Yes, England, because it's an island, had geographical protection, which aided the development of an open parliamentary system over hundreds of years.",
        "There was one writer - I think it was Alexander Hamilton, I'm not sure.",
        "But it is quoted in my book as saying that if England were a land power rather than a sea power, if England were a continental nation like Germany rather than an island nation like it is, England, rather than become democratic, probably throughout the medieval and early modern era, would have fallen under the despotism of one man.",
        "John Keegan, the late military historian who just died recently, wrote that it's not an accident that democracy developed as vibrantly as it did both in England and in the United States, because the United States is a virtual island with the Atlantic and the Pacific on either side, with the Canadian Arctic to the north, and is threatened only by the prospect of Mexican demography to the south."

        "One of the - one of the writers whose ideas I develop in the book is William Hardy McNeill, the great University of Chicago historian, whose basic theory of world history is not of civilizations fighting, but of civilizations interacting and flowing into each other through the migration that you speak of, Neal.",

        "What I try to do - for instance, in my section on Iran - is to look beyond borders and say that while Iran's actual borders may be arbitrary, the fact of a Persian people living on the Iranian Plateau has been a permanent feature of history since antiquity and gives a country like Iran a legitimacy and stability that many other countries in the Middle East and in sub-Saharan Africa lack.",
