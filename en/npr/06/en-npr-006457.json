        "That is absolutely fascinating, and what that shows is geopolitics.",

        "Geopolitics is the battle of - is the struggle for space and power and how often nations that are next to each other can be enemies while a nation far away can be a friend balancing against the enemy.",
        "The British and the Russians were in a struggle in the Crimea over the future of Turkey, over the future of - of the weakening of the Ottoman Empire.",
        "Britain was afraid of Russia - again, this is an old story - about Russia extending its influence into Eastern and Central Europe across Anatolia.",
        "That was one of the many reasons behind the Crimean War.",
        "And so Britain, as the caller said, sold Alaska to the United States.",
        "And I can say that Alaska has been a great strategic instrument for the United States military, because when you look at a map closely, we see Alaska is far to the north, but it's also far to the west, with the Aleutian Islands stretching just over the international dateline.",
        "It's a great jumping-off point for monitoring the Pacific, was a great jumping-off point - this is often forgotten - for Lend-Lease to Russia during World War II.",
        "Lend-Lease was not just about arming Britain.",
        "It was about arming the Soviets against the Nazis.",

        "Rivers that run east and west unite a country.",
        "Why is that so?",
        "Well, it's so in Russia's case because Russia extends over half the longitudes in the world.",
        "So it is desperately in need of something that unites European Russia and Far Eastern Russia.",
        "The rivers might have served that purpose had they run east and west, but because they don't, they infernally divide the country.",
        "For instance, the Yenisei, which I believe divides Western Siberia from the area east of the Urals, can be three miles wide at some points.",
        "So imagine what an impediment that was in earlier ages of technology.",
        "You have the Lena dividing Eastern Siberia from the Russian Far East.",
        "Then you have all the mountain ranges in the Russian Far East.",
        "I believe there are seven of them that make it infernally difficult for Moscow to project its power.",
        "And Russia's real problem is that Russia has only 141 or 144 million people.",
        "Russia's population for this half the longitudes of the Earth is less than the population of Bangladesh.",
        "And let me ask you about a concept you introduce in this book, the idea that many people - takes them aback for just a second, the idea that geography is changing.",
        "Wait a minute.",
        "There isn't any more or less land unless the sea rises much more rapidly than we think it is.",
        "Geography, you say, is changing on the basis of technology and urbanization and, of course, climate change.",
        "Yes.",
        "There's a whole chapter in the book called \"\"The Crisis of Room,\"\" where I talk about how - and this was a concept first developed by Yale Professor Paul Bracken in 1999, where Professor Bracken said that the very finite size of the Earth is an instrument of instability, because as the population grows, as megacities get bigger and bigger, as missile ranges overlap, as the media can travel the speed of light, almost, the fact that the Earth can no longer - cannot expand, but stays the same size means a more claustrophobic planet, so that technology, rather than race geography, simply makes it more precious.",

        "Hi.",
        "I was wondering about Konigsberg.",
        "There were talks 10 years ago that Germany might buy back Konigsberg from Russia because I guess Konigsberg had been part of the German people there, the tribes there since the 1200s.",
        "I believe you're referring to East Prussia, which is to the north of Poland, I believe - I don't have a map in front of me - to the west of Lithuania."

        "But it can't use them against the native Estonians and Latvians because these ethnic Russians actually would rather live in the Baltics than in Russia itself because in the Baltics, as members of the EU, despite all the problems with the EU, the standard of living is higher and the quality of life is better than in Russia itself.",
