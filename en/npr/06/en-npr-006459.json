        "(SOUNDBITE OF STS9'S \"\"GOLDEN GATE\"\")",
        "Now, we turn to our regular roundtable.",
        "Joining us today from our New York bureau, Robert George.",
        "He's an editorial writer at the New York Post.",
        "Callie Crossley is a social and cultural commentator on the television show Beat the Press, seen in the Boston area.",

        "He joins us via phone today.",
        "All right folks, let's take a look at the idea, Callie Crossley, of that mayoral race.",
        "Ray Nagin, the incumbent, received 38 percent of the vote--Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu, 29 percent.",
        "We are now going to see a run-off.",
        "No surprise there.",
        "Both of these men were believed to be the frontrunners.",
        "Now the interesting point comes as to whether or not we're going to see true racial breakdown, because the majority of the people running who received the majority of the rest of the vote are white, and we'll see if they filter over to Landrieu.",
        "It will be very interesting to see, and let's not also forget that Landrieu has had a base of black political support.",
        "His family is well known in the state, and they have enjoyed that for some time.",
        "So I think for some people, that's going to present a quandary if they're at all conflicted.",
        "And I think that Mayor Ray Nagin is still overcoming that comments that he made.",
        "And he himself said that in his acceptance speech, that listen, I know I made some crazy comments, and I know that's affected--that's going to affect how people support me, particularly those in the so-called white community.",
        "So I think it's going to be very interesting.",
        "I would not be surprised if it's split along lines, but I've got to say, I'm even surprised that Ray Nagin got as much black support as he got, give some of the comments that we had heard from African-Americans about how unhappy they were with him.",
        "Here's the interesting point, Robert George.",
        "To a great degree, so much made about the primary, it will be interesting to see what the turnout will be now that you have two combatants.",
        "Yeah, exactly.",
        "I mean, I think an argument could be made that quite often, run-offs--the vote often decreases.",
        "This may be one of the rare times where the vote either stays the same or could even increase, because now you're got two solid candidates everybody can focus on.",
        "What the interesting irony, obviously, is that you know, four years ago, Nagin was perceived as the reform candidate and got a lot of white votes because he was sort of running against the entrenched machine.",
        "And now, from the preliminary analysis, I guess like the Washington Post and some other papers have done, Landrieu is the one that has sort of the mixed electorate.",
        "He has black vote plus the white vote, and he's, at this point I would guess, is probably the frontrunner going into the run-off.",
        "Jeff, here's the reality.",
        "It doesn't really matter who wins.",
        "Whoever wins this election faces a tremendous uphill battle, and will find himself in a quandary no matter which way he turns.",
        "Oh, they will, but I think there are two key issues here, especially when you talk about the potential for New Orleans in the post-Katrina aftermath.",
        "There's been a mad rush to power, and people are seeing the potential to cash in on the redevelopment in what I'm calling, Newest Orleans.",
        "There are growing incentives to build there, whether that's a blazingly fast wireless Internet system, cheap real estate with incentives for developers, or even federal support and tax relief for corporations who are willing to pioneer the rebuilding of the poor city."

        "The big number, too, is that now, Newest Orleans becomes a central power center for the future, and whoever sits in the mayor's seat is going to wield a whole new level of power.",

        "The numbers tell us that perhaps an election was premature with only 76 polling locations down from 262, and six out of 10 residents displaced out of the city.",
        "I don't know if there's going to be a challenge.",
        "I think there probably will be a challenge if Nagin loses, but who knows?",
        "It looks like maybe Nagin's comments about chocolate city maybe energized some blacks to catapult him into the run-off.",

        "But one of the things that people don't really want to talk about there are these whispers--Army Corps of Engineers and the like, you better hope that you don't see the kind of storm we saw before, because the levees still remain a huge problem that New Orleans has to face.",

        "It was increasingly marginalized in the Bush administration.",
        "I think now there's a huge consensus that says the market doesn't always know best.",
        "You need to have regulation, and hopefully, that new mantra will mean that you will attract higher quality people to regulatory agencies.",
        "Within the transition White House, there's a sigh of relief that this has all happened before inauguration, but a bit of suspect news for President-elect Obama is that the person he wants to be the next SEC chairman, Mary Schapiro, has indeed been looking into this.",
        "Explain this for us.",
        "Well, Mary Schapiro, you know, from my point of view, was rather a conventional choice.",
        "I think that you really need to go very far in the direction of people who believe strongly in regulation and investor protection.",
        "But at the same time, it is very depressing to me to come across people who are constantly saying, oh, they're going to suppress innovation.",
        "That does not seem to me to be today's problem."
