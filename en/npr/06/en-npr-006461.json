        "We're splitting it up, in a great firefighter team spirit.",
        "We here at the fire station are making the turkey and the ham and the mashed potatoes, and then we have some of our loved ones coming in who are going to be bringing some of the side dishes and salads and breads and of course the desserts.",
        "Yeah.",
        "You know, someone on our staff who spoke to you earlier told me that you've got a kind of an unusual background, or it sounds unusual to me for a firefighter.",
        "What did you used to do?",
        "Well, I used to be an investment banker, after I graduated from college, and from there left and I joined the Navy Seals.",
        "I was a Navy Seal officer for almost six years, then re-entered the finance world as a personal financial advisor.",
        "And you know, it just really wasn't doing what I wanted to do with my life in that I didn't feel like I was giving back to the community, it didn't have the type of hands-on, day-to-day work that I really was craving.",
        "And it was a big culture change and a big change for the family going from kind of the world of high finance to the world of fire fighting.",
        "So it's been a long and adventurous road, but we're really happy we made the switch.",
        "So, what are you especially thankful for today, Phil Black?",
        "Well, I'm particularly thankful for my family, particularly my wife, who's been supportive through all these career changes, and I feel like I finally hit the groove where I'm doing something that I feel good about every day.",
        "I feel like I'm giving back to the community and serving others, and the finances and other things, we hope will work out down the road.",
        "You know, a healthy, happy, vibrant family is what we're really all about, and luckily the fire house and the whole fire service community really looks after the family, particularly with these holiday-type things, where we have to be working, but the family feels like they're part of it, as well.",
        "You know, I've read a lot in the last few years about the popularity of something I had never imagined at an earlier age - deep-frying turkeys.",
        "People actually do this.",
        "Do firefighters have a position on deep-frying turkeys?",
        "Well, the big thing on deep-frying turkeys, Alex, is people really need to be aware of the directions.",
        "They explicitly state not to put the deep fryer on any wood surface, and unfortunately we find people who are just very busy, and there's a lot of things going on.",
        "They get distracted, and they wind up placing the big deep-fryer on the middle of their deck in the backyard, which is made of wood, and it turns out that the deep-fryer starts going, and it kicks off some oils, and it turns out that those hot oils can heat that wood up pretty quickly and start to get out of hand."

        "So whatever happens here, it will have a big impact on one of the biggest players in aviation.",
        "OK.",
        "Same type of plane in each case, crashed shortly after takeoff, but of course, plane crashes tend to be so complicated there could be many differences we don't know.",

        "I guess just the basics here - is this budget proposal likely to be anything like what Congress enacts into law?",
        "No.",
        "These budget proposals are always political documents.",
        "They lay out the president's vision and his priorities - in this case, increases in defense spending and cuts in foreign aid, domestic programs, environmental protection, new strict rules for anti-poverty programs.",
        "And the cliche, of course, is they are dead on arrival when they come to Capitol Hill.",
        "Even when the President's party controls Congress, the budgets rarely get reenacted as written.",

        "In that funding deal, he didn't get wall money.",
        "He just got $1.3 billion for 55 miles of barriers.",
        "And ironically, this request arrives on Capitol Hill the same week that the Senate will vote on the president's emergency declaration to allow him to build the wall with funds that Congress did not appropriate - looks like there'll be enough Republicans to join Democrats to defeat that, although they don't have enough votes to override his veto.",
        "But it's a signature issue for him.",
        "It's important to his base.",
        "And because it's become his No. 1 priority and almost a symbol of his presidency, Democrats have made stopping it the symbol of their opposition to him.",
        "Well, how concerned is the administration about a bigger picture question - the deficit?",
        "Not very much, although there are some across-the-board cuts in this budget - 5 percent for domestic programs.",
        "But remember, the president ran during the campaign on not just getting rid of the deficit, but getting rid of the entire national debt.",
        "But now, neither side cares very much about the deficit.",
        "The president put these 5 percent cuts into his budget to show that he is doing something about spending, but Democrats and Republicans both don't care much anymore about the deficit.",
        "I guess when you say it's a political document, that's a part that certainly is.",
        "You can put in a wish list of massive cuts to government spending in full confidence that neither Democrats nor Republicans in Congress really want that, and they're not likely to do that.",
        "That's right.",
