        "(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)",
        "We know right now that there are ISIS fighters scattered still around Syria and Iraq, and that ISIS itself is growing in other parts of the world.",
        "The ISIS threat will remain, but one reason that the president has committed to keeping an American presence in Iraq and a small part of an observer force in Syria is against the possibility that there would be a real resurgence of ISIS.",

        "Well, it's intense as of last night.",
        "Videos from the area show these flashes of artillery pounding this small area, as you said.",
        "You can kind of look out across it from the front line.",
        "As you can see, if you look through binoculars, there's a black flag for ISIS raised on what's left of one of the few buildings.",
        "But the SDF - that's the U.S.-backed forces fighting ISIS - say that there's this complex network of tunnels and caves where ISIS fighters and their families are hiding out.",
        "Well, now, we mentioned that this offensive was delayed deliberately so that civilians could be allowed to flee the area before this bombardment began.",
        "I suppose they now feel that the civilians have all left.",
        "Have they?",
        "Well, we don't believe so entirely.",
        "It's very hard to say exactly how many people are still inside.",
        "But one major concern is that there are families of ISIS fighters and also hostages.",
        "In particular, we've been following the case of this man, Bashirul Shikder.",
        "He's an American father who lives in Florida.",
        "And about four years ago, his wife kidnapped their two children - one of them was just an infant less than a year old - and brought them to Syria to join ISIS.",
        "But his wife was recently killed.",
        "So now he has these two children - and actually, they now have a half-sister in Syria somewhere - and he's desperately looking for them.",
        "We went to Iraq with him, where he went to lobby U.S.",
        "officials, you know, tried to go across the border into Syria.",

        "You know, it's every parent's nightmare.",
        "He feels like he finally knows where they are, but he is also being told that the family who's holding them doesn't want to get out, doesn't want to let them go.",
        "So he's now watching this offensive in just utter terror, believing that his children are under the bombs.",
        "And a brutal situation that reminds us that in these kinds of civil conflicts and conflicts involving extremist groups, it's hard to draw a distinction between who's a civilian and who's a fighter, particularly if you have someone like this family you describe that - they arguably are civilians, except they want to stay, they want to fight, which means the children will stay and fight.",
        "Right.",
        "And a lot of people are also terrified of leaving.",
        "And, you know, it's hard to say how - they just don't know what will happen next.",
        "It's hard to say how long this situation is going to continue for.",
        "Some officials - you know, the Kurdish - the U.S.-backed people say, you know, this could take just a few days.",
        "Others say it could take a couple of weeks to get into this area.",
        "And in the meantime, these people are being heavily bombarded.",
        "It really is also a lesson that, you know, you can't bomb an ideology into oblivion.",
        "Even some of the people that have left this area say they continue to support ISIS.",
        "Some of the women that have spoken to reporters in the area say they remain defiant and are going to raise their children in the belief of the group.",
        "So just because this offensive is ongoing doesn't mean that, you know, ISIS as a group is over.",

        "You know Farai, very quickly, right after the Depression in the 1930s, the American government stepped in, the presidency as well as the Congress and said never again.",

        "Senator Obama is departing soon on a trip abroad that will include a fact-finding mission to Iraq and Afghanistan.",

        "Before he's talked to General Petraeus.",
        "Before he's seen the progress in Iraq.",
        "And before he has set foot in Afghanistan for the first time.",
        "In my experience, fact-finding missions usually work best the other way around.",
        "First, you assess the facts on the ground then you present a new strategy.",
        "Mary, on the Sunday morning talk shows which us political geeks often watch, a lot of the Senator's surrogates and supporters were saying well he's not a flip-flopper on issues like, you know, religion.",
        "He just is informing himself with the changing time.",
        "So does Senator McCain have a point?",
        "Well how can he make a statement before he's, you know, seen what's going on?",
        "Well, McCain does have a good point.",
        "I thought that was a good come-back on the part of the McCain campaign.",
        "But I think the most interesting thing that happened on the Iraq question is the L.A.",
        "Times I read that Obama's website took down the language which said that the surge was not working, which had been there for months and months.",
        "It's been there since the beginning.",
        "And took it down and put up some other mealy-mouthed language, because the surge obviously did, quote, work, if you mean by work that the violence is down and if you don't think about all those refugees who fled and the people who got killed and so on.",
        "So that McCain seems to have been right about that.",
        "Also, it might have been better for Obama to wait until he went, but he had already missed - made a misstep when early on, a week before, he made it sound like he was changing his mind and his supporters jumped all over him.",
        "So he was now trying to make a preemptive strike by saying what he plans to do before he goes, but in logical terms it doesn't make that much sense."
