        "After decades of hearing the same big promises from the public education establishment and seeing the same poor results, it is surely time to shake off old ways and to demand new reforms.",
        "Absolutely.",
        "There is no question about it.",
        "Interesting enough, Farai, very quickly, John McCain got a very warm response from the NAACP today in Cincinnati.",
        "That's number one, but also number two, speaking on the issue of education, that is a major wedge issue within the African-American community because there are some out there in the community that absolutely want school choice.",
        "There are others that do not for various reasons.",
        "And so what John McCain is trying to do is say, see, I am one of you, I want to be your education proponent.",

        "Just a smidge from you, Mary.",

        "Smidge.",
        "It's the right issue and McCain has done himself a lot of good by showing up and by making that speech, and there's a lot of buzz in the community that hey, maybe this guy McCain is worth taking a second look.",
        "OK.",
        "On that note, thank you both so much.",

        "So if something was to happen or if you didn't like the goods that you bought, you have other protections in place.",
        "Something else to look out for, the season is running rampant with what is called fishing scams.",
        "And this really means a couple of things.",
        "Number one, just do not click links in an e-mail.",
        "I know you've seen this e-mail, Farai.",
        "You know, they come out and they say, hey, click here for a special discount at what seems to be a respected outlet.",
        "And you click that link and you'll land on the Web site and it looks totally legit.",
        "They've copied it from corner to corner of the screen, but it, in fact, is a sight that's capturing any personal identifiable information that you may place into the site.",

        "For example, I ran some groups for students who were having trouble with their relationships with other students.",
        "We had some students who were involved in sort of battering-type situations with other students in a romantic relationship, and so we set up dating violence workshops, for example.",
        "And that wouldn't have been in the job description originally, but it was something that we saw a need for in the community.",

        "I think there were some limits that had to be drawn with regard to respecting a parent's right to parent.",
        "There were times when I certainly would have wanted to step in and try to behave in a more parental fashion with a student, somebody who I saw had needs.",
        "But there were certain lines that you had to draw because you wanted the student to continue to respect their parent as well as respect you.",
        "Once, though, you went out really searching for a student in a pretty rough area.",
        "Did you consider that something that was just a part of your every day job?",
        "It probably wasn't part of my everyday job, but it was certainly something that I felt compelled to do when I know the student had been cut loose by his family and was threatened by gang, and we felt the need to try to track him down before he was seriously injured.",
        "Did you find him?",
        "No, we didn't.",

        "But he, as you said, like, he really stepped it up and kind of tried to guide me through those really awkward teenage times, and, you know, just, you know, ask me about my day.",

        "How did you extend yourself?",
        "I think most of the things that I did for the individual students was things that I felt that any caring adult would do.",
        "There were children that didn't have money to buy clothes for graduation, or for the prom, or sometimes even for food.",
        "And you can't listen to that kind of need and not - I could not listen to that type of need and not do something about it.",
        "I have invited quite a few kids that have stayed with me for a month, or a day, or whatever their need was.",
        "Well, that had to put, first of all, a financial burden on you, a safety burden on you, and was it even against the rules for your job - for you to just have kids in your home?",
        "Well, I don't think directly that it was, but you're absolutely right when you think about the safety issue of inviting people that you don't know that well to come into your home.",
        "But I just saw them as children.",
        "And I think, you know, I think I learned this lesson from my mother.",
        "She was one that always opened her doors to people in need, and so it wasn't really scary for me to do this.",
        "I did it with an open heart, and none of the kids that I have invited into my home proved detrimental to me."
