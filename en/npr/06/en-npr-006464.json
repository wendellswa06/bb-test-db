        "What kinds of successes have you seen?",
        "What kinds of people are you in touch with today that you were able to help along the way?",
        "One of the students that was in the group - she went to the university, and she's now a social worker.",
        "I was working at a middle school and she was a social worker assigned to that school.",
        "I was quite proud of her.",
        "And then the other student that was working for ABC - I was just thrilled.",
        "I was telling everybody about her.",
        "One of my babies, I would tell them.",
        "That must make you feel great.",
        "And, Quincy, now you are working, teaching audio and video to people who might have some of the same need for contact that you did, how do you reach out to the younger people that you're mentoring today?",
        "Well, I mean, I just had - be more of a friend to them.",
        "You know, a lot of people, when you're growing up, they try to, you know, come and kind of enforce their way of doing things on you.",
        "And they're like, you know, you're the child, and I'm an adult, and, you know, you do it my way.",
        "But I find that, like, when you come to someone with the position of I know a little bit more than you about this, and I just want to help you accomplish what you want to do and just use me as a tool for you getting where you need to go, then they are more likely to cooperate with you than to, you know, try to resist, you know, your help.",
        "So I just, you know, I try to find out what they want to do, what they like, and just relate to them on that level.",
        "I think definitely because the thing is a lot of adults that I kind of grew up around - because my parents are kind of from the Midwest, and all my grandparents are, like, from the South, they have this kind of idea that if you show that you've made mistakes in the past, then you lose respect.",
        "And I think that's not true.",
        "I think when you can show a kid that you're only human, too, I've gone through the same things that you're going through, and I came out of it, and I'm doing something different, and I'm, you know, successful.",
        "You know, it just shows them - it doesn't diminish their respect.",
        "It shows them that they can do that exact same thing and it gives them hope.",
        "Kelly, you've worked both on the kind of hand-to-hand level with students and then also from the top-down, really looking at how systems work.",
        "There's always going to be great people like the three of you, but then there's a question of what systems need to be in place?",
        "And what have you learned about that?",
        "What systems need to be in place or how do the systems that exist need to improve to really serve students who are at risk?",
        "Well, I think one of the important things we need to think about is what Quincy was getting at, which is that what adults can provide for young people is a sense of historical perspective.",
        "And then we can also provide structures or venues for them to express themselves, and for them to have dialogue with each other.",
        "We need to give young people the tools, and then basically get out of the way.",
        "You know, they need facts.",
        "They need to hear a broad range of perspectives, and then they need a safe place to explore their own perspectives.",
        "And I think that schools and after-school programs and other youth-based organizations can help students by providing those safe places, and then also encouraging students to dialogue with each other."

        "I think there's a lot of isolation, and what Quincy was getting at was that when he is able to talk about his experience as a young person to other young people, they can relate to that.",
        "And that helps break down the isolation and the barriers between people.",
        "What about the isolation for people who are trying to help?",
        "I mean, it's going to be a huge, emotional burden and everyone's got their own life and their own families, their own friends.",
        "Did you ever find yourself feeling very vulnerable because of the work that you were doing emotionally?",
        "When I first started counseling, I was 22 years old, 23 years old, and I found that I was overidentifying with my students.",
        "Their problems were bringing up problems for me that were sort of connected to my issues as a young person.",
        "And I became emotionally distraught, paralyzed, unable to continue to offer the support that I wanted to offer.",
        "So it was very important for me to get help working through my emotional issues so that I could continue to serve.",
        "And I think it's important for all people who did this kind of work to kind of get their house in order, so that they are able to be productive.",
        "Ida, who did you turn to when you found yourself overwhelmed?",
        "I don't know if I ever did find myself overwhelmed because, you know, I am probably older than the other two guests that you have here.",
        "I -when I started at the high school, the kids referred to me as Mom.",
        "And I went from mom to grandma.",
        "And so my experience is that if you're able to share your life and that means communicating, not only offering what you have, but being able to communicate with younger people, share your life with them, then they're more easily accepting of what you're saying or what advice you're giving.",
        "I just want to ask Quincy.",
        "What about you?",
        "Where do you turn when you need a break?",
        "Through video games.",

        "We just play video games, go to see movies, and that's, for me, that's, like, my time to relax.",
        "But the thing is, like, the kids - because they never really stress me out mostly because the ones who are in their mentoring just seem - I've been lucky enough to mentor some really cool kids who just have really great attitudes and never really give me any problems, so…",

        "What was its intended purpose?",
        "Well, it's a good question, since hardly any other country has a debt ceiling.",
        "But the Constitution gives Congress the sole power to authorize borrowing against the credit of the United States.",
        "And throughout the - basically the first century plus, individual projects were each financed separately.",
        "So Congress had to pass borrowing authority to build the Panama Canal, for instance, or to fight the Spanish-American War.",
        "So the debt limit was introduced in World War I as a way to give the Treasury and the brand-new Federal Reserve more flexibility in issuing war bonds.",
        "Two thirds of that war was paid for by borrowing.",
