        "I want to underline what you just said because this is what you wrote as well - no evidence of cooperation between Russia and the Trump campaign.",
        "No evidence of that at this time even though they have evidence of these phone calls and other kinds of contacts.",
        "Right.",
        "And trying to figure out exactly what those calls were about, you know, is part of what's being looked at now.",
        "Now, you know, people in Trump's orbit are obviously doing business.",

        "He had done work for Ukraine.",
        "He had done work in Russia.",
        "So oftentimes those sorts of dealings put you in incidental contact or even unwitting contact with intelligence agents.",
        "Well, let's talk that through because this raises some concerns that people have expressed about your reporting.",
        "The first is that there's nothing new here because people already knew that Paul Manafort had worked in Ukraine and that he had certain kinds of dealings with Russians.",
        "Is there anything new here?",
        "Well, I think what's new here is both the extent of the calls, that are, you know, that this was a repeated extensive contact.",
        "And it wasn't just Manafort.",
        "There were other people in the campaign world and also in his sort of - in Trump world as they call it, you know, in Donald Trump's orbit at the time - and that these were extensive and were happening right at the same time that these Russian hacks were going on and that Trump was making comments like that about Russia.",
        "And I think that speaks to why intelligence agencies in the United States were so concerned about this in the run-up to the election.",
        "When you say multiple people in Trump world, you mentioned Paul Manafort who was the campaign chairman.",
        "We know that Michael Flynn had relationships of various kinds with Russians, the national security advisor who just resigned.",
        "People had previously mentioned Carter Page who was described as a Trump advisor, although they later denied he was the Trump advisor.",
        "Is there anybody else?",
        "I mean, we've identified previously to this that Roger Stone, a veteran Republican operative...",
        "Friend of Trump.",
        "...Yeah - was also being looked at in this broad counterintelligence investigation.",
        "We've only identified in this story Paul Manafort in terms of his intercepts.",
        "But, you know, our understanding is that there were several people in his orbit that were intercepted in these calls.",
        "What did Manafort say when you got in touch with him about this?",
        "I mean, look, he has denied repeatedly doing anything untoward.",
        "And he has said that all of his contacts were above board.",
        "And he gave an interview to one of my colleagues in which he said, you know, these guys don't wear badges that say I'm a Russian intelligence operative."

        "In other words, actually take a tape measure and measure the distance of where the television will be to where you'll be watching it from and any angles that you may be watching the television from.",
        "And take those measurements and the tape measure with you to the store because all of the televisions don't look the same and some have - some you can't even notice what's on the screen when you start getting into a 45 or more degree angle."

        "There's also people studying the ice caves, which are on Mount Erebus, and they're formed when the hot, volcanic gases from Erebus move through the ice on top of the volcano and carve out these beautiful caverns with some gorgeous crystals, ice crystals in them.",
