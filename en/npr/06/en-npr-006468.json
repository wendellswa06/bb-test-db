        "And he told me he was actually hit by the car.",
        "I saw the car come by, take the body of my camera off my phone and hit me and then plowed into the protesters and ran over protesters, smashed into the bottom - smashed into two cars at the base of the hill, reverse it and then ran over people again coming backwards.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF PERSONAL FILE)",
        "There were a lot of songs that I wrote when I first started out in my musical career that I never recorded for one reason or another, either I didn't feel good about them, or I felt - or maybe the record company didn't feel like they were up to par or something.",
        "But some of those songs must have had something, because I still remember them.",

        "And so, we were reporting for the entire time we were in Antarctica doing daily dispatches posted to a website, and we said, well, we would love to continue doing the reporting during happy camper training, and so we brought our gear along.",

        "Oh definitely.",

        "So it might have crusted over a bit.",

        "It's a lot wetter, and so the plume, the gas that's coming out of the volcano, becomes thicker and obscure the lava lakes.",

        "And you never know what's going to be inside when you get in.",
        "There could be an eight-foot-wide drill running down the middle of the aircraft or four vehicles or a whole row of seats.",
        "And you get in there, and you're kind of whisked up into the air, and it's usually a five-hour trip, and it's kind of disorienting because there's only about, you know, one or two little portholes that you can peek through to see this beautiful environment unfolding underneath you.",
        "And when you land, you land on the sea ice outside of McMurdo Station and step out, and all of sudden you've gone from summer in New Zealand to summer in Antarctica, which is a very different thing.",
        "There's no smells at all.",
        "You get hit with this dry kind of chilly wind when you're out on the runway, maybe 15 degrees Fahrenheit, maybe colder out there.",
        "And you realize that the thing you need most is sunscreen and sunglasses because it's usually this bright sun that's just beaming at you.",
        "It's also - you describe McMurdo as big, sprawling, what looks like a mining colony.",
        "Yeah, it's - when you get there you realize just how much research is going on down there during the summer months.",
        "The thing that I will never forget is this beeping sound of these loaders, whenever they're backing up, of course, they're making a beeping sound just like any truck in the United States.",

        "So basically I've got an instrument up at the crater rim, and it measures the infrared radiation that's basically heat that's coming off the lake.",
        "But since the heat is passing through the gases, some of it gets absorbed, and by looking at the spectrum of energy that's remaining and modeling what's been absorbed, we can figure out what gases are found and in what quantities.",
        "And why is it so important for you to study Mount Erebus?",
        "It is one of the few active volcanoes on the Earth, is it not?",
        "Yeah, it's one of only three with long-lived active lava lake, which basically represents a window into (unintelligible) system.",

        "We do, we've got 24 hours of daylight.",
