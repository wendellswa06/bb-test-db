        "Well, it's good to have everything up and running.",
        "There are a bunch of different projects going on.",
        "So as long as we're getting in good data that we can process, then that's an achievement for us.",
        "At the moment, we're working on trying to get some instruments running over the winter, which would be a really big achievement.",
        "We'd get - instead of just one month of data, we've been getting 12 months.",
        "So you think it could stay by itself and run in the dark, the six months of darkness there and that cold?",
        "So the idea was, you know, everything would be automated.",
        "We would have a wireless link that sends everything back to McMurdo, and we'll be able to operate the instruments remotely.",
        "(unintelligible) have to be up here.",
        "Well, I know it's difficult for you talk to talk to us, but I want to wish you good luck and - with your research, and thank you for taking the time to be with us, and happy new year to you.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Same to you.",

        "Kayla Iacovino, could you tell us where she was speaking from?",
        "Was it a phone booth?",
        "Where do you have a phone booth at the bottom of a mountain in Antarctica?",
        "Well, it's - we do have a landline up there.",
        "I believe there's one that's connected through that adjacent New Zealand base there.",
        "And there might be also a landline that goes back to McMurdo.",
        "So - or it's possible, of course, that she was doing what I was doing last year, which was using the satellite phone, although that's not as reliable of a connection.",
        "Yeah.",
        "We're very lucky to get it.",
        "Chris Linder is author of \"\"Science on Ice: Four Polar Expeditions.\"\" You only talked about one expedition to Antarctica, but you had other polar expeditions.",
        "And I was very intrigued by your Greenland experience, and you're talking about these huge ice-melt lakes that exist in Greenland.",
        "Yeah.",
        "That is probably my second-favorite place on Earth, after the Cape Crozier penguin colony down in Antarctica, because it's just such a unique environment.",
        "You've got meltwater that's forming on the Greenland ice sheet and collecting into these depressions on the ice to form these turquoise-blue jewels, basically, is what they look like from the air, from the helicopter.",
        "And the researchers there are interested in what happens to that water in these lakes when it suddenly disappears.",
        "What they're noticing from the satellite record is that one day there will be a lake there four kilometers long, you know, containing millions of gallons of water, and the next day, it would be totally gone."

        "And so they were putting instruments around the lakes to try to determine when that water disappears, you know, through cracks in the bottom, just like pulling the plug in a bathtub.",
        "What does it do to the ice?",
        "Wow.",
        "So all that is going down below the ice and lubricating the ice, possibly, and letting it - the glaciers slide?",
        "Yeah, that's what they found out.",
        "By using these precision - very precise GPS recorders placed around the lake, they could tell exactly how that ice sheet was responding.",
        "And just like grease on a railroad track, it makes that ice sheet slip a little bit faster when that lake actually drains and goes through a thousand meters of ice all the way to the bottom.",

        "Yeah.",
        "And really - I mean, even working - you know, I miss the people, as well.",
        "Working there in a group, we were 12 of us for a month in a remote hut, where you didn't really see anyone else except for maybe the occasional helicopter pilot if they came in for a coffee or something."

        "And I was located in three different remote camps along the Beardmore Glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains.",
        "This was exciting for me, not only with the type of science we were doing and seeing how science is conducted out in the field, but the Beardmore Glacier was also very historically important because this was the route that Scott took in his quest to be the first to reach the South Pole, actually, 100 years ago.",
        "Yeah.",
