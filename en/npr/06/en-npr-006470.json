        "But there's a lot of astronomy research going on there, too, in Antarctica, isn't there?",

        "I think even in that neutrino experiment that we're talking about, weren't they - wasn't it going through the Earth and coming out in Antarctica someplace?",
        "Right.",

        "And that is one - yeah.",
        "And that is one of the most coveted trips, is it not, to the South Pole?",
        "Because very few scientists, even though they may spend decades there, ever get to the South Pole.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And I haven't been there myself, but I'd love to go.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Kayla, do they talk about that a lot?",
        "Oh, definitely.",
        "That's one - a couple of the hotspots if you're in McMurdo, it's going to Erebus, and everywhere else, it's going to the South Pole.",
        "It's like - actually, count myself among the very lucky to have been there all those years ago.",
        "And I remember scientists being very jealous of me because...",
        "Did you make it to the pole?",

        "That is already gone.",
        "There's a brand-spanking new one near.",
        "But it is a place.",

        "And after we left, I'd seen this news reports that a Norwegian party had come down, kind of unannounced, and they were going to take some four-wheelers down to the South Pole without permission from anybody.",
        "Their ship - a storm brewed up, came out of the south with a terrific windstorm, sank their ship, I think killed two of them onboard, and a couple of more had to be rescued and brought back to New Zealand by the U.S.",

        "So even though, you know, our ability to handle the environment has gotten a lot better, it still is not a place to be toyed with.",
        "And that's why you have so much respect for those polar explorers of 100 years ago.",
        "They had hardly any of the modern clothing and technology that we have.",

        "I was wondering what ever became of it.",
        "Chris, any idea what happened?",
        "I think - from what I heard, they got close and then had to pull - had to abort at the last minute because they had run out of time.",
        "But that was a big deal because no one had ever broken through into that lake before."

        "And a lot of - drill goes very slowly.",
        "The ice is very tough, and you run out of time, right?",
        "Because you're not staying out there in the middle of the darkness.",
        "Yeah, at the end of the end of the season, you got to go.",
        "Weren't there some contamination issues as well?",
        "Yeah, that was - I think was a huge concern because there's all these chemical lubricants that are used to keep the drill from freezing, and once you tap into a previously untapped environment, it's going to be forever changed.",
        "It'll never be the exact same as when - before you drilled into it.",
        "With all that sunlight down there, remember it's - I'm asking this over 30 years ago to people - why don't you have, you know, solar energy, that kind of stuff to tap into generation there?",

        "You'd, you know, pee your pants before you got outside.",
        "So what we do is the United States Antarctic Program issues they very own pee bottles, which is basically a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle, and you learned very quickly how to hover above your sleeping bag - men and women - how to hover above your sleeping bag and pee into a bottle in your tent at night.",
