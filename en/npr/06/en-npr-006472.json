        "There's a model now that says that this ocean is carbonated like Perrier inside that moon, and the carbonation, actually the bubbles in that seawater would actually help the water rise to near the surface and get through cracks in the ice and actually help fill the chambers right next to the icy surface, where these geysers actually erupt.",
