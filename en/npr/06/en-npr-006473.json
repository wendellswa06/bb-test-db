        "So what this group did, is they - back on Earth - they simulated the chemical composition of Titan, all these the methane and nitrogen - and then instead of sort of using ultraviolet light from the sun, they used radio waves to try to spark a reaction.",
        "And when they did this - and they didn't need water, and they didn't need lightning like in some other classic experiments - they produced nucleotide bases, which make up DNA and RNA, and they also found amino acids.",
        "And what they're thinking - they dont know - is that these large compounds that have not been identified on Titan, may be these amino acids and these nucleotide bases.",
        "They now have to go back with another spacecraft that can really that's what they want to do, go back and really identify and see for sure.",
        "But what's really neat is that this is saying perhaps that life - not just at Titan, maybe life throughout the solar system - really began up in the air, up in the sky, even on Earth.",
        "Maybe we didn't need liquid pools of water on the ground.",
        "Maybe the first reaction that gave compounds that supported life, was in the atmosphere, not on the ground in water.",

        "There wouldn't be Titan is frozen.",
        "If there is any water, it would have frozen.",

        "So no, there wouldn't be much water, and it would be all frozen out.",
        "So this shows you that you don't need to have water to create those building blocks of life.",
        "That's right.",
        "That's what this seems to say.",

        "But, yeah, you know, the Nirvana thing, getting back to that, was - I mean, the effect that Kurt Cobain and Nirvana had when they debuted with \"\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\"\" on the channel - becoming, whether he liked it or not, very much the voice of a generation, changed the way that young people listen to music and opened the door in a way that hadn't been done, you know, I think since the 1960s, because of the fact that it became about not having to wear a uniform, not having to be a certain way, not having to be good looking..."
