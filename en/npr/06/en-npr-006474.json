        "We were able to locate the source of the hive by temperature readings through the wall.",
        "Once we established about where the nest was, which is about 40 feet off the ground, he drilled holes through the brick and was able to insert a camera.",
        "Then we just started slowly removing the outside brick wall, brick by brick, and we started removing the hive by hand.",
