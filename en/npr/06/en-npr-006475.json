        "Well, what's your sense of how many of the--what proportion of the employees are still close by?",
        "From what I understand, and I don't have the exact numbers, I do know that the majority of our employees have been in touch with us.",
        "Now whether they're still on the Gulf Coast or actually relocated to another area and just kind of waiting this out, I'm not sure what those exact numbers are.",
        "But I will tell you that I've been down to the distribution center for the past week and a half, and I've seen a large number of employees that have come through.",
        "So my guess would be that a majority of our employees are back on the Gulf Coast.",
        "Mike, how long have you been with the Beau Rivage?",
        "I actually started at the Beau Rivage six and a half years ago when we opened our doors in February of 1999.",
        "Are you going to stick it out for the long haul?",
        "Oh, yeah, there's no doubt about it.",
        "The coast is my home and I do work for a great company, at MGM.",
        "They've made a commitment to rebuild here on the Gulf Coast, and I want to be part of that.",
        "And how about your home?",
        "Our home, actually, like so many others, we had a lot of flooding in our area.",
        "Unfortunately, we were above sea level and were not required to have flood insurance.",
        "But we lost pretty much everything inside the house, all of our appliances, all of our furniture, we lost a good bit of clothes and, you know, unfortunately, a lot of my son's toys.",
        "So how long do you think it's going to take you to get back to where you were?",
        "Well, as far as the house, we'll rebuild that fairly quickly.",
        "We're hoping to be in by Christmas with some help from some local contractors and some friends who know the building business.",
        "Hopefully, they'll be able to assist us as we rebuild.",
        "Our biggest thing right now is just to make sure we can get in touch with our insurance company to get down here and provide us with the cash in order to rebuild."

        "They found that the ice is melting faster than they've ever seen, especially at the point where the bedrock ends and the ice shelf floats.",
        "They believe the cause is warm water circulating beneath the ice shelf.",
        "The melting was most pronounced from 2002 to 2009, and Khazander says the more it melts, the more ice is exposed to warm water.",
        "It becomes a runaway process, which makes it unstable.",
        "Where's the warmer water coming from?",
        "The team points to global warming that's heating up the oceans.",
        "And there's been a spate of research lately showing that Antarctic ice is melting faster than previously thought and raising global sea levels.",
        "Khazander says the melting process appears to be irreversible.",
        "Polar scientists fear that at some point the shelves will collapse, and Antarctica's glaciers will flow into the sea.",
        "As to whether and when that might happen..."

        "And within that disk, stuff coalesces to form the planets.",
        "You know, you form little boulders and house-sized bodies, and finally planets.",
        "And in the inner solar system, there's just a lot of material.",
        "And it would seem that Mars ought to be five to 10 times heavier than it really is.",
        "And in this one model that two teams have proposed, they believe for various reasons, that there's a gap in the disk near where Mars formed.",
        "And I can explain why there might be a gap in a minute, but it just turns out that basically Mars would get pushed to a certain point, and then it would reach this gap, and it just there's nothing there.",
        "So it just can't pack on more material.",
        "And one reason why there might be a gap is that there's reason to believe that Jupiter might have come barreling in - to the inner solar system - and then been tugged back by its big neighbor, Saturn."

        "You know, they're setting up a strategy to portray Tamerlan as the dominant figure in the family and the mastermind of these attacks, who sort of sucked his younger brother along into this jihad.",

        "The inspectors general say we'll never know exactly what Tamerlan's wife and ex-girlfriend might have told the FBI, if the FBI had interviewed them before the bombings.",
        "The main recommendation of these watchdogs is that the feds need to do a lot better job of sharing information with state and local police, which the FBI says it's now working to do.",
