        "Depending on the state, it can take an average of three months or three years to process a foreclosure.",
        "As NPR's Yuki Noguchi reports, the disparity in how fast states complete foreclosures is becoming even more pronounced.",
        "The fate of thousands of troubled homeowners in Central Florida rests in the hands of Lee Haworth.",
        "Haworth is foreclosure administrative judge for the 12th Circuit in Florida.",
        "We were hit pretty hard.",
        "Well, it's great to be here.",
        "To really earn a living wage and get on a career path that's going to sustain a family really requires at least some amount of postsecondary training.",
        "We see for young people that don't have that - it's very hard to get a higher-level wage job.",
        "And for young people that haven't earned their high school diploma, particularly in New York City where we are, it's almost impossible to get any kind of job because many employers now that have very entry-level jobs that typically would have been available for a young person are now able to put on kind of new requirements, because it's really an employer's market.",
        "And so for an entry-level retail job they'll tell you you need a high diploma and two years of experience for the position.",
        "But there is no real place to kind of cut your teeth in the workforce like there used to be in the past.",
        "And how much does that impact long-term prospects?"

        "I mean, we know - if you think about what your first job was, no matter how related as to what you are doing now, you learned some really important life lessons in that job.",
        "And so we know that work is a really important developmental milestone for young people and what we see here is that there's really a generation of young people who aren't having the opportunity to kind of earn that developmental milestone.",
        "So they're not learning those important life lessons early on and what the research shows us is that the longer you delay your attachment to the workforce, the harder it's going to be later on to kind of be unemployed or have more sporadic employment.",
        "And so we know it is important for 16-, 17-, 18-, 19-year-olds to get wor,k and what we see at our Bronx Youth Center, is now those 17-year-olds who couldn't get a job four years ago are now 21 and still haven't got a job, and are coming to us, and have missed four years of work experience that really would've propelled them into a higher future earnings opportunity in the future, the opportunity to have experience for their resume, the opportunity to build relationships with supervisors who are going to give them recommendations - all of those things are really critical for young people as they grow up and kind of lay out they want their career path to be.",
        "Is there a difference, Roberto Angulo, for those who have a college degree in hand?",
        "I agree with Courtney.",
        "Anecdotally, we're seeing students who are taking jobs that may not require the education they received in college.",
        "Jobs in retail and food service - those - you might not even need a high school degree - but these are the jobs available and we're seeing a lot of students taking these jobs just to earn money and - and so, like, Courtney said, to acquire those work skills.",
        "Yeah, and that's where the two populations are really related.",
        "Those are the jobs that typically would've gone to high school students and that's really I think the difference that we've seen as a result of this recession is this kind of compression of young people out of the labor market, because people are taking jobs that maybe they previously wouldn't have taken because they have a higher credential.",
        "At the same time, I would add to that, that even people who had been out in the - in industry and have years of experience who are unemployed are taking these jobs as well.",
        "So what we're seeing I think is - is - is high school students, college students and grads competing with also people who are already in industry who are - who are also being forced to take these jobs",
