        "She says if this review process had existed before the two controversial experiments were done, both would have been approved.",
        "But there would have been a lot more upfront discussion about the tricky issues they raised.",
        "Nell Greenfieldboyce, NPR News.",

        "And so the great thing about being actor is - you know, in most films - I mean, character-driven films, that is - and theater and television, you need older people, as well.",
        "So, I mean, as the years have gone on, I started as, you know, in my 20's, studying for the theater, going to the Actors Studio, working with serious people like Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman and people who really took acting to a different level in this country.",
