        "Yep, it sure is.",
        "It's - is the Korean analogy the apt analogy?",
        "To the extent that, I think, a long-term stabilization presence in the country is good, I don't think we need nearly the number of troops that we've maintained in Korea since the end of the conflict there.",
        "I think today we - with our ability to count on air power and so forth to protect Iraqi integrity, we don't need a huge ground presence, but I think a continued military and diplomatic commitment to Iraq is certainly appropriate.",
        "In the case of South Korea, there was an imminent threat.",
        "Well, there's never been a peace agreement signed.",
        "North Korea was a - what's the threat for Iraq?",
        "Well, I think, if you were talking to Iraqis, you'd be - they would tell you very, very frankly that it's Iran.",
        "Iraqis are deeply suspicious, both Sunni and Shia, of Iranian intensions.",
        "It's partially a nationalistic thing, partially a Persian-Arabic problem, but there is a deep wall of suspicion about Iranian intentions for the country itself."

        "Yeah, I can't cite the exact figure, but it's a lot smaller than it was during the Cold War, but it's certainly still a reasonable amount of American presence there.",

        "It was a long time before an economic - a democratic South Korea emerged.",
        "Well, that's another good reason, I think, for keeping our hands in the Iraqi situation.",
        "It took - I think the fact that we had a large presence and a substantial presence helped them to get through some very difficult times, a couple of military coups, some fairly autocratic regimes and so forth.",
