        "These days, it's much more likely that the authority they'll turn to is the wedding industry, which is also the person who's selling them the stuff with which to do it.",
        "So inevitably I think there's an escalation of production values and emphasis on the wedding itself and the wedding planning process.",
        "It's not even the production values.",
        "Sometimes, traditions are created that are totally bogus.",
        "Well, I think - in my book, \"\"One Perfect Day,\"\" I write about something called - that I called the traditionalesque, which is things that sort of feel a bit traditional but aren't really traditional at all.",
        "I mean the classic case of this is the diamond engagement ring, which was more or less invented by the De Beers company in the earlier part of the 20th century with their brilliant slogan: A diamond is forever.",
        "You know, diamonds haven't been given for eternity as symbols of enduring love, but they were invented as a symbol of love.",

        "As these - I mean, who is really in control, you know, of these - we know that many, many couples get married in much smaller, more modern ceremonies where, of course, they're in control, but when you fall into the grips of the industry, you really do?",
        "Well, I think the issue of control is a very interesting one because the industry couldn't be a successful as it is if it didn't play into the hopes and the dreams of - the real hopes and real dreams of people.",
        "I think that there's an intersection of an industry's marketing and economic interests, and a true desire on the part of American couples to get married in a way that feels significant or feels weighty.",
        "You know, weddings don't have the significance that they used to have.",
        "It used to be when you - was the occasion in which you became you an adult, was the occasion in which you left home, it was the occasion on which you started living with your spouse for the first time.",
        "It doesn't have any of those meanings for many people any longer.",
        "And so I think in a way, the wedding itself has become bigger as the transition that it signifies has in some sense has become smaller.",
        "And, Amy Dickinson, of course, there's an element of keeping up with the Jones'.",
        "If the Smiths had a fabulous wedding last summer, well the Jones' must do even better this summer.",
        "You know, while Rebecca was talking, I just had an epiphany.",
        "You know, I think some of it starts with the birthday party when you turn five, and instead of having five kids over you have this whole event with 20 children and it lasted a whole day.",
        "I think we're celebrating moments, as Rebecca says, that as they sort of decrease in significance in modern life, we're celebrating them more because some of these weddings remind me of sort of debutante events or Sweet 16 parties.",
        "They have this atmosphere of, you know, celebration and femaleness and, you know, Rebecca talks in her book about some of the - any bride should read this book because you see how manipulated you are by this industry, which creates this, oh, you have to have a garter and the garter will come with a pillow.",
