        "Good afternoon.",
        "About - I've been married for almost two years.",
        "Me and my wife - her wedding dress came up in two parts, a corset top and then the main flowing train it's got for the bottom.",
        "Well, she waited a year after we were married, went on a photo shoot, because she used to be a model, did the photo shoot and then just for shoots and giggles, oh, pardon my frank…",
        "All right.",
        "Let's try that again.",
        "She went through and did the photo shoot.",
        "And then through a (inaudible) through, she took part of the bottom off and did, like, a little flame job with an actual - not a blow torch but like a little butane lighter-type thing at the end of train and the start of what she would call, the ball and chain.",
        "And she kept the corset part as - to go on for the rest of the photo shoot.",
        "Sounds interesting.",
        "I'd like to see that.",
        "All right.",
        "That would be interesting, Karl.",

        "Oh, I was just calling to tell you, I was actually trying to get in about the first half ago, but we actually did some interesting (unintelligible) stuff going on with the dress on the - a little bit after the wedding.",
        "After the wedding, it has become a tradition with my friends where we all go out to some dirty, little dive bar, the - probably the worst one that we can find in the town of the wedding.",
        "So we find this little bar, it's only actually - it ends up being about 10 feet from the hotel.",
        "We went out to the bar.",
        "My wife only actually wanted to be there for just a short while.",
        "We ended up being there for about two hours or so having a good time.",
        "We get back to the hotel room afterwards, and you know, going to get her, you know, out of her dress, which she, you know, been sweating like crazy in all day.",
        "Get in there and there's actually about two inches of black ring, just gunk, you know, attached to the bottom of the dress all the way around it, which luckily, you know, they were able to get cleaned out of there, and the dress is now preserved and beautiful.",
        "But we were amazed when we got back to the hotel room.",
        "Yeah.",
        "I suspect you may have run into a few stains, Mark Eric?",
        "Actually, no. They got absolutely everything out of it.",
        "The dress is beautiful, gorgeous now, completely preserved.",
        "And there's nothing wrong with it.",
        "But that night, man, we didn't think there was any way we were going to get that thing cleaned.",
        "All right.",
        "Thanks very much for the call, Steve.",
        "Thank you, sir.",
        "And dry cleaning, I suspect, is important in your business, Mark Eric.",
        "It's been crazy.",
        "This past week, I've had two e-mails from some national cleaning organization wanting to hook up with the dresses, so…",
        "See if you could recommend them, maybe a little testimonial.",
        "One of the - if I have a second, one of the funniest stories from last week, we did the bride in the swamp, which I see is featured on your website right now."

        "Beth, that's a really fair question.",
        "I think, by and large, that you'll find that force protection is a real concern for General Odierno and whoever succeeds him in the job.",
        "I'm not quite as concerned about force protection for American troops, but this is going to be a difficult time for the Iraqi military and their security forces simply because they are on their own.",
        "They're standing up, and we can only hope that they're - they - that we prepared them well enough to do the job in the future.",
        "Yes, sir.",
        "Hopefully, they can really learn a lot from the remaining soldiers.",
        "And hopefully - unfortunately, there's not a - no osmosis is possible.",
        "But I'm just concerned, then, that they're going to be taking on the role of protecting, basically, or, you know, being the same as the 50,000 troops that are there and kind of acting as their protectors.",
        "And that was my question, sir."
