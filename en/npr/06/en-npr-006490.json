        "And, you know, if we plan on staying over there in, you know, the Middle East and Afghanistan, are we going to be needing to create our own military money like they did back then?",
        "And are we going to end up dividing the Afghan country into, you know, separate states that either want military presence from America, and that of, you know, the extremist Muslim community that just does not want us there to begin with?",
        "There's a lot different questions in there, Colonel Anderson, but his grandfather served in Korea.",
        "Is his grandson going to be serving in Afghanistan or Iraq?",
        "Well, I think there's always a possibility that - I think it's more probable that we might see - we might rethink this thing to a point where we have a longer-term presence.",
        "But that doesn't necessarily mean a combat presence, nor does it mean, you know, an occupation.",
        "We're past the occupation stage.",
        "I think we're into a situation where American presence really is going to be a lot more low-key.",

        "Colonel, considering all these sectarian issues that we have in Iraq - you have the Turkmen, the Sunni, the Shia, and a small, you know, subgroups from that, Kurds and so forth - and then Turkey and other countries in region, which, obviously, have their opinions, how is the government in the future going to deal with this?",
        "And are we not going to simply train another leader like we did Saddam to sort of, you know, have an iron fist and rule with an iron fist?",
        "And is that the only option, to have almost, like, a warlord dictator in Iraq?",
        "Because, obviously, we can't - we have an election, and the people can't, you know, seem to get a cohesive government together.",
        "And I'm just curious if that's going to be the end goal, is that we're going to instill another sort of leader who is really kind of brutal.",
        "Daniel, you could say a lot of things about U.S.",
        "involvement with Saddam Hussein, but that we trained him is not accurate.",
        "But I think he is asking: Are we going to have - getting back to the South Korea analogy - another Syngman Rhee?",
        "Well, let's hope not.",
        "But we won't rule out the possibility, but that's part of the argument that I make for having a longer term American presence.",
        "I think a lot of the political and economic and diplomatic pressure we put on to, you know, to push Korea into a democratic situation was as a result of our heavy involvement there.",
        "And I think that's a good argument for maintaining some kind of a presence there.",

        "Well, yeah, back in 2002, I did a study for the Marine Corps, when President Bush first - or second President Bush started to announce policy of preemption.",
