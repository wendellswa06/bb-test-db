        "The air marshal did what--I guess there were two of them--did what they have to do under, you know, circumstances that forced the issue.",
        "I wish there was a better answer, but I can't think of what it would be.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Now you were at Northwest, I guess, before 9/11?",
        "I was at Northwest from 1989 until 1995.",
        "So, yes, before 9/11.",
        "And obviously, things have changed a great deal since then, most decisively with the air marshals program considerably expanded since those days.",
        "There were air marshals prior to 9/11, but they were very few in number and they flew basically international flights only.",
        "And that was sort of almost a vestigial, you know, remnant of a policy that was created when there were a lot of airline hijackings to Cuba back in the '60s and '70s.",
        "Sure.",
        "It's a follow-up of the `take me to Cuba' scenario.",
        "And obviously, another thing that's changed since then, since 9/11, obviously, the air marshal program has expanded considerably, but also new security measures have gone into effect; reinforced cockpit doors, for example.",
        "Yes.",
        "And with that, do you think the air marshal program is still as important today as it was before all those changes went into place?"

        "The question regarding federal air marshals and the program is with the reinforced cockpit doors, I don't believe that the scenario followed on 9/11 would work today.",
        "Also, I don't believe the passengers would allow it to happen.",
        "That being said, I would question whether the money we spend on air marshals could be better spent on other programs, for example, intelligence.",
        "You know, my thought would be let's do everything we can to identify these folks before they get to the airplane.",
        "In the few seconds that an air marshal would have to respond to a bomb threat--and we're talking generically and not specifically about what happened yesterday...",
        "Sure.",

        "One switch you'd press to activate the device, and the second would be that you can release a switch, and the air marshal or police officer has no idea how that device is wired.",
        "So under some circumstances, shooting the person would be the correct choice.",
        "Under others, it would be the wrong choice, and there's no easy answer.",
        "In other words, there could be a so-called dead man switch, where if they're shot, they release something, and that triggers the bomb.",
        "Yes.",
