        "Appreciate it.",
        "And, Douglas Laird, I did want to ask you--obviously, again, this situation, we're not exactly sure everything that has happened on that plane, but it is a fine line between someone who is acting erratically and somebody who is acting as a threat to the aircraft.",
        "Yes.",
        "And in today's world, as the previous caller mentioned, you can suffer from such actions.",
        "There have been cases even just before 9/11, where people have acted erratically on airplanes and were literally killed by the other passengers.",
        "It's unfortunate that those things happen, but again, I wish I had an easy answer.",
        "There are none.",
        "No.",
        "It's a difficult situation, and obviously--are air marshals, to your knowledge, trained to intervene when somebody is, you know, drunk or berating the flight attendants?",
        "That's another difficult call that they're--and they've been criticized for this, sometimes by not taking action with a drunk, obnoxious passenger.",
        "Their role is to protect the integrity of the flight and not necessarily to deal with rude and obnoxious people.",
        "And as the previous caller said, there can be decoys in that you would have a person, you know, act up so that air marshals that identify themselves so that the other team members, the terrorists, could act appropriately.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And, Andrew Thomas, thank you for taking the time to be with us.",
        "Hey, thanks for having me.",
        "Merry Christmas.",
        "Those are really tough calls, and I'm impressed by the training that the federal air marshals receive, and as previously stated, we shouldn't second-guess what happened.",
        "I think they made a difficult decision that had to be made.",
        "Douglas Laird, stay with us.",
        "We're going to take a short break.",
        "And when we come back, we'll continue our discussion about air marshals and how they're trained to handle threatening behavior from passengers.",
        "Did they make the right call yesterday?",

        "Can you fill us in on what we know now about the incident?",
        "Well, Neal, we don't know too many details beyond what was reported and, indeed, was revealed on live television yesterday.",
        "The Federal Air Marshal Service says that the two men who are the air marshals--they said both are men, have been interviewed.",
        "They both joined the Air Marshal Service in 2002; one from the Border Patrol and one from the US Customs--a US Customs officer.",
        "One of them spoke Spanish.",
        "I know that was a question that many people raised.",
        "Given that this flight had originated from Colombia, there were many--one would think, some Spanish-speaking passengers on board.",
        "But the investigation has been turned over to the local police in Miami-Dade County in Florida, not the FBI, because as they just revealed yesterday, the FBI is really only in charge of investigating a crime aboard an aircraft, and they believe that this crime--this man was shot in the jetway, which is technically on the airport property.",
        "Another factor is, they didn't find any nexus to terrorism.",
        "No explosives were found in this man's bag.",
        "What do we know about this man?",
        "We know that he is 44 years old.",
        "He's a US citizen.",
        "There have been reports that he originally from Costa Rica.",
        "He married a woman who was a US citizen.",
        "And he came in yesterday to Miami originally from Quito, on a connecting flight, so he only had stopped in Miami to make his connecting flight back to Orlando.",
        "He lived near Orlando.",
        "And I talked to, you know, a few neighbors of his, who said that, you know, he was a very nice man, very gentle neighbor, so they didn't think the couple had any children, but they had lived there for some time, you know, typical suburban home, and he was, you know, a very quiet man.",
        "You know, he was friendly with his neighbors.",
        "They didn't see any past history of violent behavior, so this all came as a shock to everybody, and including some family members."

        "There were reports yesterday of mental illness on his part.",

        "The Federal Air Marshal Service hasn't confirmed that yet.",
        "We hope to get an update today from the police in Miami, as they investigate this, but several witnesses did say that they saw, as you guys have discussed, his wife--the passenger's wife saying that he was on medication, you know, and that has been a very--that will be a key part of the investigation, I believe, is looking into the training of air marshals, how much training do they receive in dealing with somebody who may have mental problems and how is that different from how they would handle a situation where somebody, you know, has more violent intentions?",
        "So I think that's a big question.",

        "Maryanne calling from Miami.",
        "Hi there.",
        "Yeah, just two quick questions.",
        "One is did anyone else, aside from the US marshals, hear that he had a bomb, and number two is are TASERs an option?",
        "And I'll take my answer off the air.",
        "Thank you.",
        "Thanks, Maryanne.",
        "This is Sara here.",
        "You know, the TASER question has been brought up several times by many people in the aviation industry I talked to today.",
        "TASERs are--they're a--looks like a gun.",
        "A TASER is made by one company, TASER International in Arizona.",
        "It's plastic.",
        "It delivers an electric shock that is meant to disable somebody immediately for a short period of time.",
        "Many police departments across the country have adopted them.",
        "And there was a big debate about whether pilots should carry guns or whether they should carry TASERs.",
        "The Federal Air Marshal Service from the beginning has always believed that they need the use of deadly force, so I don't think that that has ever been something that they have considered.",
        "But, you know, it's interesting that, you know, people are wondering this.",
        "I should say, though, you know, one thing about TASERs is there are a number of lawsuits against this company for wrongful death because people have died due to the use of this weapon.",
        "And including some in Miami, as it happens.",
        "Douglas Laird--we're going to get to Maryanne's other question in a moment, but, Douglas Laird, the TASER issue--is that something that you've looked into?",
        "Yes.",
        "And what people don't understand about the TASER is that it--they don't affect everybody the same way.",
        "I have seen videos where they've been used in a correctional situation, fired at an individual, and the person keeps on coming.",
        "You know, it doesn't stop them in their tracks like people are led to believe.",
        "So I think the federal air marshals are probably correct in saying that they will use a firearm.",
        "The other issue about TASERs and firearms, of course, if it were used on an airplane in the air, bullets have the possibility of punching a hole through the skin of the aircraft, possibly causing a decompression or possibly hitting another passenger.",

        "Ye...",
        "...the real fear there isn't the decompressioned aircraft, because the bullet hole is relatively small, probably not large enough to do an explosive decompression.",
        "The real issue with a firearm is firing from the back of the plane toward the front and hitting critical avionics or hydraulic lines.",
        "OK.",
        "You were about to say something, Sara.",
        "I'm sorry.",
        "Oh, yes.",
        "One thing I think Doug and I actually have talked about is, it was fascinating to hear a number of years ago right after 9/11, that Boeing actually testified that if you did shoot a gun through the skin of an aircraft, it wouldn't necessarily have a major effect on the cabin pressure system or it wouldn't bring down the aircraft, which I thought was kind of surprising.",
        "One would assume that that would be really catastrophic, but that was, I guess, from--based on experience what Boeing had said.",
        "And the other part of Maryanne's question, did anyone other than the air marshals overhear the man saying, `I have a bomb'?",
        "I haven't talked to anybody, Neal, any passengers who said that they did hear that, so I think that's going to be a critical part of the investigation, and one interesting thing I thought today was, in just talking to members of Congress who, you know, love to support their air marshals and are really big fans of the program, really being quiet and cautious today in their statements and saying, `We don't know all the facts yet.",
        "We're not--before we call for any major overhauls or training changes to the air marshal program, we really kind of want to know all the facts,' and I think that's a big one.",
        "And the situation then, by extension in the jetway, were there witnesses there to hear the challenge to--whatever the challenge was and whatever--see whatever his response was?",
        "I'm not sure of that either.",
        "I think that all the passengers were removed from the aircraft at the rear of the plane, and that's the reason why.",
        "Obviously, they had this crime scene there.",
        "I don't think--I would be surprised if anybody--any passengers saw it, none that I've talked to.",
        "It's quite possible that some flight crew members, possibly the pilots might have seen it, but I don't know exactly at what stage this plane was in preparation for takeoff.",
        "The door was obviously open, but I don't know if the cockpit door was open.",
        "Once the cockpit door is closed, they are not supposed to open that door.",
        "Generally, when it's open, there's almost always workers in there, somebody--for one thing, to, you know, arrange the wheelchairs and whatnot to help people get off the plane.",
