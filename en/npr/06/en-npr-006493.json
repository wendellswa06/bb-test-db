        "Yes.",
        "Hi.",
        "My question relates to the training regarding--being able to identify mental illness.",
        "If this person was suffering from a mental illness, a well-trained or just a carefully trained eye to catch on clues, would be able to identify ac--you know, identify that situation.",
        "I've worked in the mental health field, and sometimes police officers would demonize people with mental illness or criminalize them.",
        "And I'm just curious to hear some comments about--or what steps are possibly being taken toward educating, you know, certainly marshals, as well as, you know, other law enforcement agents in terms of being able to identify it, so that individuals who suffer from mental illness, if that is truly the case here...",
        "And we don't know that to be the case, but, Sara Goo, I know you've covered air marshal training.",
        "Is this one of the issues that they discuss?",
        "Well, Neal, I visited their facility in Atlantic City, New Jersey, where they do a number of role-playing scenarios, and they don't just do scenarios involving somebody trying to hijack a plane.",
        "They actually play this out on an aircraft that they have, and I've sat on board it, and it's kind of like role-play.",
        "One of the air marshals, you know, puts an apron on and walks down the aisles and plays the role of the flight attendant, and other air marshals play the role of passengers.",
        "I saw one skit, if you will, where there was a drunk passenger who was getting increasingly violent, and the air marshals had to role-play how they would react in that kind of situation.",
        "What made it so bad?",
        "From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.",
        "I'm Melissa Block.",
        "I've never seen them specifically do a role-play situation where somebody who--just appears to be mentally unstable, but when I talked to the air marshals' public affairs spokesperson today, he said that, you know, a lot of these things are similar.",
        "You have somebody who's not all mentally there, whether they're intoxicated, they're not thinking as clearly as a normal person would, so sometimes, their behavior is very similar.",
        "You know, that's one way you could say of dodging my question as to whether they do really do train specifically on, you know, mental illness, as the caller brought up, but they do do a lot of scenarios that don't just focus on shooting, but really restraining passengers and, as you mentioned earlier, when and when not to jump up and identify themselves and when to allow the flight crew to deal with the passenger and handle it on their own.",
        "And we should point out, I think this is the first time that air marshals have discharged their weapons in an incident in and around an aircraft since 9/11, so obviously they exercise restraint.",
        "Yes.",
        "All right.",
        "Kobe, thanks very much for the call."

        "Well, there was extensive reporting that came out after 9/11 that said in order to ramp up the number of air marshals flying in the skies from the pre-9/11 numbers, which was less than three dozen, to the new environment that had been created because of the attacks, that a lot of the training that was very stringent and very professional for the air marshals, in fact, had to be scaled way back.",
        "And the belief is that you have many people that normally would not have been able to get into the air marshal program before 9/11, in fact, had become air marshals because of the political imperative to get the program up and running.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Yet it's been a few years since then; presumably if there were bad apples, they've been weeded out.",
        "That would be the hope.",
        "The concern, though, is that there is a lot of turnover in the agency.",
        "It was one time sold as a very glamorous position.",
        "There's a lot of money paid to air marshals.",
        "Unfortunately, there's been a lot of health issues that have arisen for air marshals who've been up in the skies 50, 60 hours a week, and there's been a lot of turnover in the program.",
        "And it--we're at a situation right now where many of the screeners that are, in fact, gonna be moved away from the checkpoints on December 22nd because of the lack of a focus now on items like knives and scissors, these people may now become available in the air marshal program as well.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "These small, sharp objects, the policy has recently changed to allow things like nail files and scissors.",
        "Sure.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Yeah.",
        "And you've written extensively about air rage on airplanes, obviously.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Describe that for us, and obviously this can be a touchy situation to describe, you know--trying to figure out what is a disturbed person, what is air rage and somebody who threatens the safety of the aircraft.",
        "Yeah.",
        "Air rage has been a problem that's been with us well before 9/11.",
        "I was able to document in my book of the same name about 10,000 cases of stuff taking place in the year leading up to 9/11.",
        "In fact, there were 30 cockpit intrusions took place before 9/11 by disruptive or deranged or passengers committing air rage, we'd call it.",
        "The problem went away for a while after 9/11 because people were much more cognizant of the way they behaved on airplanes.",
        "Security was a big issue.",
        "But now that we've got more people flying than ever before, we're starting to see this stuff come back four years after 9/11, and we see customer--there's a direct relationship between the amount of customer complaints that passengers make to the Department of Transportation and the number of air rage incidents we see, and these are becoming, as I said, more frequent, more intense many times.",
        "And the problem that we're facing is twofold.",
        "First is that air marshals have a very clear, definitive purpose--at least they're supposed to--in their training, and that is an anti-terrorism function.",
        "And secondly, flight attendants have still been woefully trained to be able to do risk assessment and security training within the air cabin, and that creates a very difficult gray area for both flight attendants and air marshals in terms of how to handle incidents like yesterday."
