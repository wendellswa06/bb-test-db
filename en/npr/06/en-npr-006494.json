        "Well, on a base level, they will get the conventional law enforcement training, but to consider where an incident might occur, 30,000 feet above the land and on a very crowded airplane, there are a number of different ways that they receive specialized training.",
        "One, of course, is in firearms usage and how to utilize that option for using your firearm, certain hand techniques and hold techniques that allow you to apprehend somebody without having to use a weapon.",
        "There are intimidation tactics and techniques where they're able to read people and how people are acting and how they may react.",
        "There are commands that are provided and the ability to read a response from a person who's provided commands.",
        "These are all specialized techniques which take into consideration how an incident may occur when you're 30,000 feet above the ground.",
        "'Cause obviously in an airplane, one of the last things you want to do is use a firearm.",
        "No, that's right, and that's why the air marshals are trained extensively on options for apprehending and quelling a disturbance that go far beyond the usage of the weapon.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "To your knowledge, do air marshals' weapons use standard bullets or special soft-nosed bullets that might not penetrate to hit either other passengers or critical parts of the plane or punch a hole in the plane?",
        "That's exactly what air marshals use as far as bullets and rounds.",
        "They're the type of bullets and rounds that would not penetrate the fuselage of the plane so as not to trigger a hole in the plane which could compromise the ability of the plane to travel on safely.",
        "Take us back, if you would, to the so-called shoe bomber case that you were so closely involved in.",
        "And I wonder, what did we learn from that that helps us provide better security today?",
        "Well, the first thought I had was of Christina Jones and Hermis Moutardier, the two flight attendants who apprehended Richard Reid.",
        "The fuse leading into his shoe that would have detonated the bomb was six inches long and had burned down approximately three inches.",
        "So if Christina and Hermis didn't act quickly, act on what they know, and apprehend Richard Reid, that would have put that plane down and 188 people would have died.",
        "That's the first reaction I had when I thought of this quick-thinking scenario and situation which played out yesterday.",
        "Things we've learned?",
        "One of the things we learned which was extremely important is that despite all of the different precautions that are put in place, despite the fact that Richard Reid had gone through many different safety measures and procedures, he got that bomb on the plane because, very simply put, they devised a bomb that had no metallic components and, at that time, we had no way of detecting any of the components that made up the bomb that was in his shoe.",
        "Since then we've all learned how to tie our shoes much more quickly than we used to.",
        "...That's really the thing.",
        "I mean, this ban is going be a disruption to a lot of companies, and I think they're still trying to figure out where it's going."

        "Well, that's one of the unfortunate realities after the Richard Reid matter is that we're all taking our footwear off a lot more frequently.",
        "However, I'm sure, as you know, there are devices now in airports which allow one to walk through and get a blast of air which detects certain components which would be part of a bomb so that people don't have to take their footwear off.",
        "But frankly, you know, in the United States, what we really need to do is we need to create a systematic approach to this whereby the checking mechanism would check on the chemical components that could be used in an explosive device rather than checking for metallic-type components, which is extremely labor intensive.",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "Was there an air marshal on the flight that Mr. Reid was on?",
        "No.",
        "And I wonder, obviously the exact number of air marshals hired and of--used since then is classified, but on the basis of what you know, what--are you satisfied in terms of what you've seen in terms of this program's acceleration?",
        "Yes.",
        "If you consider that there were 33 air marshals just prior to September 11th, and now--although it's not for public consumption, but an approximation is thousands of air marshals are now employed and receiving all the specialized training--you know, I think we can be confident that the majority of our planes and the message that are being sent to would-be terrorists that these planes are very, very secure with professionals who are trained in a manner to avert danger on our planes.",
        "Let's get another caller on the line.",
        "This is Larry, and Larry's calling us from Miami.",
        "Yes.",
        "I just wanted to say that I'm really distressed that so many callers are saying that they think the air marshals did the right thing.",
        "This poor dead man did not have a bomb or a gun or a knife or even a box cutter.",
        "He was just acting strange, and now they've killed him.",
        "He was not on an airplane in flight, not even on an airplane on the ground, and I think that people who don't see that there is at least a question to be asked about this have somehow lost their moral compass.",
        "Gerald Leone, again we're not quite sure of all of the facts in this case.",
        "Obviously there will be an investigation, and clearly something did go wrong.",
        "Who's wrong, who did wrong, that remains to be determined.",
        "Sure.",
        "I mean, this is an extremely unfortunate, tragic incident.",
        "Say that right up front.",
        "But when a law enforcement officer acts in the manner that this law enforcement officer did, there's always an assessment over what they did, why and how, and in this circumstance the fact of the matter was what was known to that law enforcement officer at the time was he had an agitated individual who said he had a bomb who was carrying a bag which could have had a bomb within it, was asked to place the bag down on more than one occasion, ignored the requests of the air marshal and was headed towards a plane full of people.",
        "Under those circumstances, that air marshal had seconds to make a decision and his decision was to pull his weapon and use it.",
        "Well, that's been my problem with this is there's the culture of the gun is gonna solve things."
