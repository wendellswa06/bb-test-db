        "This is despite a resume that includes leading the San Francisco 49ers to within one play of a Super Bowl title.",
        "But he was also the first player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and systemic racism.",
        "Kaepernick says that is why NFL teams have colluded to keep him off their rosters.",
        "And now an arbitrator says there is enough evidence to move forward with a full hearing of Kaepernick's case.",

        "He's a legal analyst for Sports Illustrated and joins us by Skype.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Thank you for having me.",
        "So what evidence does Kaepernick have that these team owners actually colluded against him to make sure he wouldn't get signed by any of them?",
        "Well, we don't know what specific evidence he has because there's a protective order that bars his attorneys and also him from revealing what specific information he might have.",
        "But we do know there's something because we know that the arbitrator, Stephen Burbank, has rejected the NFL's request for summary judgment.",
        "So that means that there is a genuine issue of material fact.",
        "What the arbitrator is saying is he's looked at the evidence, at least preliminarily, and there's enough there to actually move forward with the case, that this should be heard.",
        "And what does Kaepernick have to prove?",
        "What evidence does he need to present to show that there was actually collusion among all these teams?",
        "He has to have clear and convincing evidence that at least two teams or the league and at least one team conspired to deny him of a collectively bargained right.",
        "In this case, that right is the right to sign with the team.",
        "So he would have to really establish with some kind of evidence.",
        "Maybe it's a witness statement.",
        "Maybe it's a text.",
        "Maybe it's an email.",
        "Maybe it's a recording - something.",

        "All right, so just to explain - this is an arbitration.",
        "I just want you to lay out what happens now.",
        "Is this going to unfold like a trial?",
        "It will unfold like a trial, but technically, because it's arbitration, it isn't a trial per se.",
        "There is no jury.",

        "He'll just be wearing a suit."

        "He's the decider.",

        "OK.",
        "So how are retailers able to track me, a consumer, when I'm in a store?",
        "Well, one of the ways they might do that is using your mobile phone.",
        "So what a lot of people may not realize is that, in order for your phone to make a connection on the Internet, it's constantly sending out a unique number that's embedded in that phone, called the MAC address, to say, hey, any Wi-Fis out there?",
        "I'm number, say, 124 - though the numbers are a little longer and more complicated.",

        "And by using these constant probe requests by the phone looking for Wi-Fis, you could actually track where that phone has been, how often that phone comes there, down to a few feet.",
        "Which is much finer than, say, the GPS location that your phone might be giving.",
        "So how is this helpful to companies, and to what extent are companies doing this?",
        "Well, you know, I'm not an expert about marketing, but one could easily understand that knowing where customers might move throughout the store is very helpful for designing the store and putting the kinds of products the store might want to sell in particular pathways of the customer.",
        "You could also imagine a future in which they might use your location to deliver just-in-time ads.",
        "I'm not saying that any of the stores are doing that, but we could easily see how that could be done.",
        "When this is done, to the extent that it's done, is the customer notified?",
        "And in your view, should the customer be notified that this store tracks your whereabouts on the premises?",
        "Well, that's one of the most interesting aspects - is that this can be done actively by the store without the consumer ever knowing.",
        "And why might you care?",
        "Well, it could be the case that knowing where you are in a point in time or knowing where your phone has been in a point in time can be an issue.",
        "You could imagine future lawsuits in divorce proceedings.",
        "Wants to know, oh, were you with MAC address number blah, blah, blah, for example.",
        "In the jewelry department.",
        "(Laughing) Right.",
        "Were you in the jewelry department someone else?",
        "And so these kinds of unforeseen consequences that can cause real harms to consumers, without consumers knowing that that tracking is happening, is something that one should be a little concerned about.",

        "You know, flick a switch on my smart phone?",
        "Right.",

        "And a lot of times, what I do is look at how the design of the system fits in with policy or consumer expectations.",
        "And this is a really good issue - is suppose I did know it was happening, but I didn't want to be party to it.",
        "What do I do then?",
        "A lot of times, you can put it in airplane mode - the phone - which would turn off the Wi-Fi.",
        "But if you turn on the Wi-Fi after that, then the Wi-Fi stays on.",
        "And so that can be a little confusing.",
        "There are some apps that allow you to change the MAC address that address that's sent out in the probes, so that you could sort of masquerade as someone else, if you wanted to.",
        "And is there anything that I could see on the settings of my smart phone that would tell me whether or not I'm being tracked?"
