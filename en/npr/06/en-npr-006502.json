        "Bush.",
        "Early in his career, Comey prosecuted terrorism and mob cases, but came to wider public attention for standing up to the Bush White House in a fight over warrantless wiretapping.",
        "NPR's Justice correspondent Carrie Johnson broke the news about Comey's selection yesterday and she's here this morning to talk about that choice.",
        "Welcome.",
        "Thanks, Renee.",
        "What prompted the White House to offer the job to Jim Comey?",
        "I mean he's a Republican.",
        "He is a Republican, but he has a deep understanding of the law.",
        "And name any high office in federal law enforcement, odds are Jim Comey's had it over the years.",
        "He was the number two in the Bush Justice Department.",
        "He was the top federal prosecutor in New York.",
        "And earlier in his career, he helped pioneer an effort in Virginia to take guns off the street.",
        "He has fans across the political spectrum, Renee, except potentially for people in Dick Cheney's orbit, former Vice President Dick Cheney.",
        "Remember that Jim Comey, when he was in the Justice Department, appointed a special prosecutor to look into the leak of the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame; that search ultimately lead to the prosecution of Scooter Libby, one of Dick Cheney's top aides at the time."

        "And Carrie, though, the president looked long and hard for someone to replace the current FBI director - again, Robert Mueller, he's leaving in several months.",
        "Tell us a little about the leading candidate for the job who didn't get it.",
        "Renee, there was an extensive search and it came down to two people, Jim Comey and Lisa Monaco.",
        "Lisa Monaco is also a long-time career prosecutor.",
        "She now works in the White House as the president's Homeland Security advisor.",

        "Lisa Monaco also served as chief of staff to Bob Mueller, so she has deep ties to the FBI and is well-known there.",
        "Remember, Renee, it was so hard to replace Bob Mueller a couple of years ago when his tenure term ended that the Senate actually passed special one-time only legislation to extend his term for two years, but his time to leave is coming up soon.",
        "And as I just mentioned, James Comey was at the center of one of the more dramatic episodes of the Bush administration.",
        "Tell us that story.",
        "This all happened back in 2004.",
        "John Ashcroft, the attorney general at the time, was very ill in the hospital.",
        "And right around the time that this happened, Jim Comey, his deputy, was put in charge of the Justice Department and something came to Jim Comey's attention.",
        "There was a surveillance program that was about to expire and Jim Comey and others in the Justice Department had concerns about its legality.",
        "Here's what Comey said about that in some riveting Senate testimony about the incident.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF HEARING)",
        "I was very upset.",
        "I was angry.",
        "I thought I had just witnessed an effort to take advantage of a very sick man who did not have the powers of the attorney general because they had been transferred to me.",
        "I thought he had conducted himself, and I said to the attorney general, in a way that demonstrated a strength I had never seen before, but still I thought it was improper.",
        "Renee, what Jim Comey was talking about there was the Bush White House had sent envoys to John Ashcroft's hospital room to try to get him to overrule Comey's decision on this wiretapping issue.",
        "And Comey raced to the hospital with an FBI detail trailing him.",
        "He is six foot eight and his long legs raced up the stairs to the hospital; he intervened and Ashcroft sided with Comey.",
        "After the fact, there were some threats to resign en masse at the Justice Department, including Jim Comey.",
        "Ultimately, the Bush White House backed off.",
        "And just briefly, what happens next with this?",
        "OK.",
        "So Jim Comey still is undergoing parts of the background check process.",
        "The White House has yet to make a formal announcement, though we expect that within a few days.",
        "Then Renee, the confirmation hearing.",
        "A couple of things likely to come up: Jim Comey's work as a general counsel for a big Connecticut hedge fund and some of the more contentious issues in the Bush Justice Department, including torture.",
        "Carrie, thanks very much."

        "There are a lot of contributing factors: improvements in health and longevity, the decline of the pension, the rise of the 401(k) and the volatility of the markets.",

        "You could see a huge stream of water as each truck drove up and then sprayed the reactor and then moved away to let the next truck in.",
        "And there was a lot of steam - it was quite dramatic - but clearly the building was very hot.",

        "There's just the cable.",

        "And of course the rods are full of radioactive material, so a fire would be very bad.",
        "Although, I must say, experts I've talked to, they're a little puzzled.",
        "Because if these pools have dried up, why haven't there been serious fires already and a lot more radiation, like the worst-case scenarios?",
        "I mean, it could be that the buildings and the concrete are absorbing the heat or the pools aren't really dry.",
        "And then not all these pools are the same.",
        "The way this works is that after five or six years a rod is taken out of the reactor and retired to the pool.",
        "At first it's hot and then it gets cool.",
        "So each pool has its own mix of really hot rods and and so to speak - and not so hot ones.",
        "That could be why they've have so much trouble with one of the reactors - number four.",
        "It was shut down for maintenance last November.",
        "And when they do that, they move all the rods from the reactor over to the pool, so that would mean a lot of very hot fuel rods in that pool.",

        "That was a year ago.",
        "Those numbers may be different, but still that's a lot - a huge potential source of radiation.",
        "So what are they saying about radiation levels around the plant, around the country?",
        "It's pretty much the same.",
        "An American plane flew over the site and there's a lot of radiation there.",
        "Beyond the site, there are a few spots where there are elevated levels of radiation, but Japanese authorities are saying none of those hot spots really poses an immediate risk to civilian populations.",
