        "Well, Paula Hannaford-Agor says a study a couple years ago, found that in a period of just over a decade, only 90 verdicts were challenged on the basis of juror digital disobedience.",
        "But, she says, those are only the reported cases or the instances that were admitted to.",

        "It was actually the foreperson of the jury who got on the Internet, despite the judge's instructions not to do that.",
        "And he found information which he felt, if the jury found the defendant guilty of the charge, he was facing a minimum of 10 years of state prison.",
