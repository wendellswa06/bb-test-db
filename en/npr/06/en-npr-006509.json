        "Smith says the new guidelines should actually make life simpler for doctors and patients because most don't have to worry about starting a statin if their cholesterol reaches a certain point or about getting it down, through drugs, to a specific number target.",
        "But others think the new guidelines are more complicated.",
        "DR. STEVEN ATLAS: Much more complex.",
        "That's Dr. Steven Atlas, a primary care doctor in Boston, who actually thinks new cholesterol guidelines are overdue.",
        "To move from treating the number to preventing heart attacks is a real big jump.",

        "We've told the same thing to family doctors.",
        "And he worries the new calculator may overestimate a patient's risk.",
        "When I tried it out on myself, it said I should be on a statin even though my cholesterol numbers are optimal, I exercise and eat a heart-healthy diet, and my high blood pressure is under control.",
        "I asked Nissen what he'd say about that.",
        "If you came to see me, Dick, with those numbers and that history and just a little mild hypertension on treatment, there's not much of a chance I would treat you with a statin.",
        "But that's sort of the point.",
        "The risk calculator is supposed to get me and my doctor to talk about it and decide if I should get a test, such as one called a CRP that might reveal some underlying reason for concern."
