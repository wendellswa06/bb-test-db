        "Well, actually one of the Saudis who appeared in this al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula video in January of this year, Muhammad al-Oufi, he came back from Guantanamo, went through one of these rehabilitation programs and then ran off to Yemen with these other guys.",
        "And one of the things that the government did straight away, was they went to go visit his family, a very senior member of the royal family went and said, I can't believe that your son, your brother or your husband ran off and left you here all alone, you know.",

        "Other countries like Yemen, you know, we have incredible difficulty doing these things because they don't have the financial resources.",
        "But the other things that help the Saudis do this are things like the religious legitimacy and the authority of the state and the power of the state to do this.",
        "So, in a society where the state provides everything for you, it could be a very painful experience when the state turns off the tap and takes some of those things away.",
