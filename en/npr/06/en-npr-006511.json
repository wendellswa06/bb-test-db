        "We will probably see passage of a Domestic Partnership Benefits and Obligation Act.",

        "I think of being able to go up on stage with all of my fellow, openly gay and lesbian elected officials across the country, and there were very few of us at that time.",
        "And seeing so many people who were speaking out and being visible was just very inspiring.",
        "What's keeping you from the march this year?",
        "Well, I would say, mostly, the activities we have on the calendar here at home.",
        "But I do think that the march has created national attention and will serve an important purpose as we look back upon it.",
        "One of your colleagues in the House of Representatives, Congressman Barney Frank, who is also openly gay, told NPR this week that he didn't think the march is such a good use of time for gay rights supporters.",

        "So what we have here is a pit tag reader.",
        "Just turned it on.",
        "You know, it just detects whether there's a pit tag under the skin of the frog.",
        "And then, if there is, it reads it and gives us a number and that's an individual identification code for that particular frog.",
        "The team has been inserting tiny magnetic tags, each about the size of a grain of rice, beneath the skin of these frogs for more than a decade.",
        "It doesn't harm the frogs.",
        "So we have some frogs that we've caught that we know are at least 13, 14 years old, might be older.",
        "It's pretty amazing.",
        "Along with their frog scanning, the team is monitoring the temperature and depth of the ponds like this one.",
        "They want to find out when they're drying up during the course of the summer and what that means for the frogs.",
        "Last year, we had, you know, a good number of ponds where the ponds dried up before the tadpoles had metamorphosed and so they didn't survive there.",
        "Ryan worries that with less snowpack and hotter summers, more egg sacks and tadpoles will be stranded out of water.",
        "That could ultimately decimate the population, unless they can move into deeper alpine lakes that are more resilient to the warming climate.",
        "The problem there is that many of those lakes have been stocked with trout for recreational fishing and the trout find the cascades frog delicious.",
        "(SOUNDBITE OF FOOTSTEPS)",
        "We move on to sample several more ponds.",
        "We're seeing lots of frogs but still haven't heard the alleged chuckling call.",

        "We hunker down in the heather by a snow-lined pond.",
        "The frogs are all around us but they're silent, just staring at us like we're unwelcome party crashers.",
        "One on the rock, one in the grass, the two that are right under us.",
        "And there's another one that's under the bank over there."
