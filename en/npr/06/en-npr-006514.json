        "Since then a core team has trained yearly and held practice drills every six months to stay sharp, ready for whatever disease comes their way.",
        "But almost immediately, Emory learned it would care for a second patient.",
        "So its specially trained team was too small, says chief nursing officer Nancy Feistritzer.",
        "We also needed to expand that team because we ended up with two patients simultaneously.",
        "Critical care nurses volunteered, but they weren't part of that core group who'd long practiced for this day.",
        "The expanded team had to train and quickly.",
        "With a team now in place, attention turned to treatment.",
        "Varkey says they focused on supportive care, the basics, like IV fluids and preventing infections.",
        "The true cure for Ebola virus is keeping a patient alive enough for them to develop the antibodies that will cause them to actually get over the infection.",
        "More aggressive treatment should be used if needed, too, says Dr. Bruce Ribner.",
        "He heads Emory's Ebola team and spoke at a press conference yesterday."

        "The general dogma in our industry in July was that, if patients got so ill that they required dialysis or ventilator support, there was no purpose in doing those interventions because they would invariably die.",
        "Emory has had universal success in curing its Ebola patients, and Varkey says they have learned other lessons.",
        "Increasing space might be helpful.",
        "Having a hand-sanitizer dispenser available that wouldn't require us to actually touch it with a gloved hand, those are sort of some simple examples that we have tried to transition from patient to patient.",
        "Nurses who'd been on eight-hour shifts preferred 12-hour rotations.",
        "The team also learned patients, grappling with both a scary illness and isolation, needed emotional support.",
        "And from top administration to waste management crews, pharmacists to technicians, every department played a role.",
        "Chief nursing officer Nancy Feistritzer says they always assessed what they did.",
        "We have tried to harvest any learnings in an organized way.",
        "So, for example, every morning this team meets to discuss what worked well, what might be refined and then we took those learnings and actually put them into operation.",

        "That is part of it because you have to have your movie screened before the end of the year for at least a week in order to be considered for awards.",
