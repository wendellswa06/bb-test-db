        "Mr. O'LEARY: Because I don't know what the definition of performance is.",
        "If it means evaluating teachers based on their students' test scores, O'Leary says that's not fair.",
        "Last year, for example, almost half of the faculty at Cardozo was let go because 10th graders did so poorly on standardized tests.",
        "Some teachers who were dismissed didn't even teach 10th grade.",
        "O'Leary says the tenure versus more pay question is a little trickier for good teachers because it's so enticing.",
        "Mr.",
        "O'LEARY: I have enough confidence in myself that I could say, OK, you can judge me on what I do for a year.",
        "And if I do what I'm supposed to do for a year, then pay me a lot of money.",
        "But I'm looking at that through 64-year-old eyes and 40 years of teaching experience.",
        "O'Leary says teachers should think twice about giving up their tenure rights for more money."
