        "And then when I got out into the world and started seeing how my music was affecting people and meeting people who were directly faced with those problems, like for example playing in a prison, I'd go in there and sing an angry song about how messed up the prison system is.",

        "That's a huge increase over the last few decades.",
        "It's a huge change in American life, and it can be a huge financial and emotional challenge for the people living in those households - people we are learning from in a series we call \"\"Family Matters.\"\" Last week, our MORNING EDITION colleague David Greene introduced us to three families we're following over these weeks - eight weeks in total.",
