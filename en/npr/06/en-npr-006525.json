        "And they'd kind of be looking at me like, couldn't they have sent, you know, Jessica Simpson here or something to entertain us, you know?",

        "And the simplest things, like eating an orange, they just really stuck out to me.",
        "And so I wrote all these new songs about simple things like that.",
        "So there's this idea that you have this sort of near-death experience, and almost all the songs you write are actually happy and joyful out of it.",
        "Yeah, because every day in the hospital, I'd go over to the window, and I'd pull back the curtain to see if the sun was shining.",
        "And if it was, I'd get this feeling like, yes, I'm going to be better today.",
        "I'm still here.",
