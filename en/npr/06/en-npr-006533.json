        "That might have led us in a certain point to turn a blind eye to some of the less attractive parts of the Syrian opposition movement.",
        "At the same time, I do believe that the Bashar al-Assad's regime should be brought before the International Criminal Court.",
        "I don't think there's any question that the documented abuses which we've seen coming out in multiple international agencies - at the United Nations Human Rights Council, international NGOs - they have all made extremely clear that what the Assad regime has done at least meets the standards by which the Criminal Court should take it on and investigate it.",
