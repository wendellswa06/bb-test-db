        "I don't see why they shouldn't allow him in it.",
        "Of course, it's just exactly like Robinson was saying that, you know, he needs to understand that this is about - you know, the caucus is about African-American issues, and if he needs, you know, if he needs to broaden it in order to, you know, also apply it to the rest of his constituency, then fine.",
