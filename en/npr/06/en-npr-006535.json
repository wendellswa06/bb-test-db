        "Kashmir is a Himalayan territory that's split between India and Pakistan, and up until now, people who live on the Indian-administered side of Kashmir have had a degree of autonomy.",
        "That changed today.",
        "So to explain, we go to NPR's Lauren Frayer in Mumbai.",
        "And, Lauren, let's just start with how the government took this action and why.",
        "The government today repealed Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.",
        "That article gave the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir special autonomy that other states don't have.",
        "Why - you've got to go back to 1947.",
        "India and Pakistan were founded.",
        "They immediately started fighting over Kashmir.",
        "Kashmiris only agreed to join India if they could have that autonomy, and that's the special status that we're talking about today.",
        "Jammu and Kashmir remains India's only Muslim-majority state.",
        "Fast-forward 70-plus years, there's been an insurgency.",
        "India and Pakistan have fought several wars over Kashmir.",
        "And Prime Minister Narendra Modi campaigned for reelection on a promise to bring the state of Jammu and Kashmir into the fold, integrated better into the rest of India.",
        "And the government said today, enough - we're putting Jammu and Kashmir directly under central government rule.",
        "Now, this is deeply unpopular with Kashmiris themselves, as well as with some of India's neighbors.",
        "What do the people who live in Kashmir want?",
        "It's right now really hard to know because their phones and Internet service have been cut by the government.",
        "There's been a massive troop buildup in Kashmir in recent days.",
        "Tens of thousands of Indian troops have been deployed there.",
        "Tourists have been evacuated.",
        "Kashmiri politicians have been put under house arrest and now arrest in police custody.",

        "HR 810 would permit federal funds to be used for research on stem cell lines derived from embryos that were created in vitro for fertility treatments.",
        "Such human embryos are said to be eligible for destructive research, since they're doomed to die anyway.",
        "By this logic, one could deem prisoners on death row eligible organ donors, since they too are going to die anyway.",
        "Proponents of the bill claim it offers real hope for those suffering from debilitating diseases because, they say, these cells are uniquely pluripotent; that is, capable of differentiating into virtually all cell types in the human body.",
        "This hope so far has proven illusory."

        "Despite 25 years of animal research on embryonic stem cells, the dramatic predictions made by its proponents have not been realized.",

        "Contrast this with the results of adult stem cell research.",
        "Currently, treatments for 72 diseases are being carried out with human patients, and these treatments have not required the destruction of any human embryos.",
        "Many of my colleagues who supported HR 810 inexplicably voted against funding for alternate sources of pluripotent cells, processes which would not require the destruction of human embryos.",
        "Would I like to support embryonic stem cell research without a question of ethics because it might assist my brother?",
        "Surely.",
        "But can we divorce all of that from the ethical norm that we must present here?",
        "Certainly, we cannot.",
        "Because another thing my brother taught me is that true scientific progress entails evaluating not only what we can do, but what we should do.",
        "Even if embryonic stem cell research should someday prove effective, the destruction of one class of human beings for the benefit of another class of human beings raises the most telling ethical considerations.",
        "Human life should never be considered a means to an end.",
        "The size or age of development of that human life should not be the determining factor, and we must never fall prey to the ethical failures exemplified by the Tuskegee experiments, where nearly 400 subjects, most of them poor black sharecroppers, were left to die from the ravages of syphilis in the name of science.",
        "It is crucial for us as a nation to stand firm for an ethos that innocent human life should be protected as an end in itself.",

        "That's how compact her poems are, how full her language is.",
        "Kay Ryan, are you ready for the job?",
        "Yep.",
        "And what is the job?",

        "Sure.",
        "First of all, it comes from the thing we say to other people when they've done a lot of stupid things, and now they're getting their comeuppance.",
        "We say, well, your chickens are coming home to roost, and I have no doubt that when I wrote this, I was chastening myself, and I was telling myself this, but unfortunately, this poem was sitting on the desk of an editor in New York at the time of 9/11, and it suddenly took on this terrible added significance, and I had to withdraw it because it seemed cruelly appropriate.",
        "I'll read it to you.",
        "The chickens are circling and blotting out the day.",
        "The sun is bright, but the chickens are in the way.",
        "Yes, the sky is dark with chickens, dense with them.",
        "They turn and then they turn again.",
        "These are the chickens you let loose one at a time and small—various breeds.",
        "Now they have come home to roost—all the same kind at the same speed.",
        "Now right after 9/11, that sounded, you know, the blue sky in here, the clear sky, sounded just like the beauty of that day, and those chickens sounded much too much like airplanes."

        "Well, I've always been extremely enamored of cartoons and cartooning, in which you have essentially just the outline, and I think if you leave something empty but charged in some way, not overly elaborated, you can have a surprising number of things come out of people when they read it.",
        "That's what I'm hoping, anyhow, and I mean, the truth is it just is my constitution to do things that way.",

        "You have to do it about 100 pounds of wool-gathering for an ounce of really good language.",
        "So it's very inefficient, and it takes an awful lot of time, but to get back to teaching remedial English, I like the relationship with students.",

        "This comes after the airline scrubbed 500 flights yesterday.",
