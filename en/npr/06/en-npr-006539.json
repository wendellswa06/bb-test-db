        "Correct.",

        "I actually saw the Emancipation Proclamation is probably - I would say about 20 years ago or so, that they opened it up.",
        "But I hadn't really studied Lincoln and it's one of those things.",
        "I was in my 20s, and now that I'm in my 40s and I'm thinking about, again, the weight of the world that man's shoulders and everything - how important it was for him to go forth and emancipate the slaves.",
