        "SANJAYAN (Nature Conservancy): Most Americans sort of go through this sort of Pavlovian response when it comes to Thanksgiving.",
        "That's why it may be hard to sell them on serving foods that aren't local or native.",
        "Not everyone is ready to do what Sanjayan will do at his home in Missoula, Montana - skip the turkey and go for elk and venison instead.",
        "But if the idea of carving a deer at your table is a bit much, there are other ways to be green.",
        "To reduce waste, resist the temptation of holiday-themed paper plates.",
        "Use dishwasher-friendly plates instead, says Dale Bryk of the Natural Resources Defense Council, and don't waste water by rinsing every last bit of cranberry sauce off.",
        "Even though your mother may have told you, like mine did, you got to wash all the plates before you put them in the dishwasher, that really is not necessary anymore.",
        "We have much better dishwashers than we did back in the '70s.",
        "Bryk says some of the most important choices you can make have to do with where you spend the holiday and how you get there.",
        "If you have to drive, one really important thing that people can do is make sure that they inflate their tires properly.",
        "That leads to better mileage.",
        "And there's actually more oil to save in our tires than exists in the whole entire Alaskan wildlife refuge, so it has a huge environmental benefit in addition to saving your money in your pocketbook.",
        "Can you just describe, looking back at President-elect Ahmadinejad's life in and around 1979, the time of the Iranian revolution, where was he and what was he doing?",
        "He was at a very good university where he earned a PhD in civil engineering.",
        "Clearly he was a student during and immediately after the Iranian revolution, and of course, the students were extremely active during that period of time."

        "And it was students, of course, who took over the embassy...",
        "That's correct.",
        "...in 1979.",
        "And Ahmadinejad was an officer in one of the student organizations at that time.",
        "He was a very strong supporter, or a fervent supporter of the revolution.",
        "His credentials on that side are very, very clear.",
        "But the people who actually organized and carried out the takeover of the US Embassy are unanimous in saying that he had no role in planning or executing that.",
        "They're also unanimous in saying that because of his position as an officer in a student organization, it would be not the least bit surprising that he would be in and out of the embassy, that he would be there being visible, although curiously enough, none of them remember seeing him there.",
        "But obviously some of the hostages do.",
        "What role have people who took part in the hostage-taking played in Iranian life in the years since 1979, 1980, '81?",
        "People who were involved in the embassy, a number of them were killed in the Iran-Iraq War.",
        "They fought; in many cases, went to the front.",
        "Others went back to school, and some of them became politicians.",
        "Some of them have remained very conservative, but a number of them--a surprising number of them--have, in fact, now emerged as supporters of President Khatami and the reform movement, and many of them actually have been sent to jail for taking positions that the regime didn't like.",
        "Has their background as hostage-takers been something that they've needed to hide or something that is, in fact, a credential that you would play up?",
        "It is obviously a credential, but it is the kind of credential that is going to attract more attention in the West than it is in Iran.",
        "In Iran, there's a sense that that was an episode out of the past.",
        "Most Iranians scarcely even think about or remember the hostage crisis, and that is a terrible mistake, because in fact, it is one of the defining moments of the revolution, and it is the defining moment with regard to the outside world, who remembers only mobs of people standing out and waving their fists night after night after night outside the American embassy, shouting, `Death to America.",
        "And it continues to haunt everybody who was involved with US-Iran relations.",
        "Gary Sick, former staff member at the National Security Council, thanks very much.",
        "OK."

        "Colonel Elspeth Ritchie, who works for the Army Surgeon General, was asked by reporters if there was a link between combat and the increased suicide rate.",
        "What we have found is not a direct relationship so far between deployment, combat and suicide.",
        "However, we do know that frequent deployments put a real strain on relationships especially on marriages.",
        "And the Army researchers say that it is a failed relationship - often the result of extensive time overseas - that can spur suicides.",
        "Again, Colonel Ritchie.",
        "Most suicides in our Army population are impulsive acts.",
        "Very often a young soldier gets a Dear John or Dear Jane e-mail and then takes his weapon and shoots himself.",
        "That strain is particularly hard on younger soldiers.",
        "The Army found that the typical suicide is a white male, between 21 and 30 years old, with a rank of private or specialist serving in the infantry.",
        "And Colonel Ritchie says Army officials fear that even longer deployments could make the situation worse.",
        "In April, the Army increased the combat deployment time to 15 months in Iraq or Afghanistan, before then it was 12 months.",
        "We are seeing a lot of strained or failed relationships and our typical both attempt and completion is after the breakup of a relationship.",
        "Of the 99 suicides in 2006, 27 took place in Iraq and three were in Afghanistan.",
        "And Army officials say that year there were 948 attempted suicides both overseas and at home.",
        "This is only the second year that the Army has looked at attempted suicides, attempts that were serious enough to result in a trip to the hospital.",
        "And what is the army doing to reverse this trend?",
        "Hiring more mental health counselors, teaching soldiers in the field to look for the warning signs of posttraumatic stress and other mental disorders and providing more help to families.",
        "Colonel Dennis Dingle, another Army officer who've talked about the reports' results, says additional time off for soldiers is necessary.",
        "Now, that soldiers are serving 15-month tours, the Army has just increased their break period from 15 days to 18 days."
