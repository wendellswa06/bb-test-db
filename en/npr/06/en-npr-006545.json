        "Republicans were united on three common issues, and one of them was reforming Congress.",
        "That applause came from Democrats, who, like David Obey, of Wisconsin charged the measure is a joke.",
        "The public wants us to pass significant House reform.",
        "Instead, this legislation before us, in my humble view, constitutes consumer fraud masquerading as lobby reform.",
        "But the biggest obstacle standing in the bill's way was an intramural dispute.",
        "Republican members of the appropriations committee, who write Congress's spending bills, opposed part of the measure curtailing so-called earmarks.",
        "They're the provisions that members often insert in secret to put projects in their districts.",
        "Conservatives, like Jeff Flake, of Arizona, insisted the secret earmarks be stopped, saying they're being abused by members of the appropriations committee, like Cunningham.",
        "When you have one of your members in jail starting a term, others being investigated, but you still take a position that we don't need to reform this, that's just what's unbelievable.",
        "But appropriations committee members argued they were being unfairly singled out.",
        "They pointed out that earmarks occur on lots of legislation, not just spending bills.",
        "When GOP committee members threatened to vote no, the bill was pulled from the floor.",
        "But after an hour-long meeting with House speaker Dennis Hastert, the appropriators were back on board.",
        "Committee Chairman Jerry Lewis of California, said Hastert promised that when the House measure is combined with the Senate's version, the final product will limit earmarks on all bills.",
        "That, said Lewis, was what he needed to hear.",
        "It's not very often that the speaker spends that much time with appropriations members.",
        "We don't put ourselves in this position very often.",
        "It was important for me to have the Speaker know that our members were serious about this issue, and he was very responsive.",
        "Later in the program, the car that drives itself, but first, being outed.",
        "And we're going to begin with a phone call.",
        "Blake(ph) is calling us from St. Louis."

        "Hi.",
        "Assuming the House measure is approved next week, members of both chambers will sit down to try to work out a final bill.",
        "As they get closer to the November election, Republican leaders of the House and Senate know that public opinion of Congress is in freefall, and that cleaning up corruption is one of voters' biggest concerns.",

        "So Eric Wilson has embraced his inner gloom, and he wishes more of us might do the same.",
        "He worries that today's cornucopia of antidepressants might make sweet sorrow a thing of the past.",
        "I want to be clear that in my book I'm not romanticizing clinical depression - obviously that's a very serious condition that should be treated in any way.",
        "However, I do have a sense that in our culture now, even mild to moderate sadness is being treated rather quickly with antidepressants.",
        "And I think that that could lead, ultimately, to a society in which melancholy is seen as merely a sickness that needs to be treated with a pill, something like a headache or the flu."

        "I mean, there may be a lot of people who suffer from maybe mild to moderate depression who feel that those pills are what keep them going.",
        "It may not be severe, clinically accurate depression, but they are suffering, and they are getting help.",
        "Well, I think each person, obviously, has to find his or her own way to relate to the world.",

        "One of your ideas is that it's through sadness that joy becomes joyful.",

        "Yes.",
        "The best example I can think of is the life of the early 19th century British poet John Keats.",
        "Keats believed that we can only experience the beauty of something, say a flower, when we know it's going to die, when we sense how fragile it is.",
        "So when we experience the beauty of something, we also feel sadness, sorrow at the - a world's passing.",
        "So for Keats there's this very interesting relationship among sorrow, death, beauty, and the joy that comes from beholding beautiful things in the Earth.",
        "This why we often cry when we feel very happy or laugh when we feel very sad.",
        "It's that mixture, that fullness of being, that ultimately I would say make us human.",

        "Am I romanticizing states that are so painful that they can lead to suicide, that they can lead to madness?",
        "And ultimately, I conclude that maybe this is just part of the tragic nature of existence, that sometimes there's a great price to be paid for great works, for beauty, for truth.",
        "And we can look at the lives of Dylan Thomas, Virginia Woolf, Hart Crane and others and lament the fact that they suffered so, but yet, at the same time, we're buoyed, we're overjoyed by the works they left behind.",

        "Now at Brown Chapel, where Obama spoke, you have lots of young people, college students, people who were there who are elected officials, so it was a much more integrated crowd.",
        "And Senator Obama used the occasion to tie himself to the history of the civil rights movement and speak about how though some may question whether he's authentically black because his father was from Africa, he feels that he is in fact deeply tied, wouldn't exist without what happened here in Selma in 1965.",
