        "The spat goes to the core of the leaders' very different ideologies.",
        "Chavez is moving ahead with his plan to implement what he calls 21st century socialism and won new power from his Congress to rule by decree.",
        "Calderon is a free market fan.",

        "And Juan, we'll start with you.",
        "Tell us more about Chavez's new powers and his moves lately to nationalize more businesses.",
        "Well, the decree powers give Chavez 18 months to pass laws by decree.",
        "That means that the National Assembly does not need to vote on any of the laws.",
        "That's unusual to a lot of people because, you know, the National Assembly is completely in Chavez's hands.",
        "All 167 members are allied with the president.",
        "But the president wants to move fast and this will allow him to do it.",
        "It appears that most of the 40 to 60 laws that are expected to be passed will be in the economic sphere.",
        "The government talks in very general terms about what they want to do.",
        "They say that they want to transform the state to make it more efficient, to permit public participation in decision making, and they want to invest more in science and technology.",
        "But perhaps what's garnering the most headlines is the relationship with foreign firms, and they want to create a framework to govern nationalizations.",
        "The nationalizations have aroused great interest because Chavez says the government will take control of telecommunications and utilities in the next few weeks, and there's a lot of American investment in those companies."

        "Well, it's actually very common.",

        "Those kids weren't given the choice of being the bodies on whom social change was created, and I think the same thing is happening now in high schools and even earlier.",
        "One of the consequences of the fact that we as a culture are much more aware of the existence of gay people is that these things have moved from college or even older to high school and I'm sure middle school and even elementary school as kids become more aware of their own sexuality and as they become more aware of other people's sexuality.",
