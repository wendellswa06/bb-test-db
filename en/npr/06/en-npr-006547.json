        "And again going back to the Tyler Clementi example and what Blake was talking to us about earlier today, these can have terrible consequences.",
        "Mr.",
        "D'AUGELLI: Oh, I think Blake's example is really an incredible almost paradigm of what can happen when somebody's identity is essentially taken away.",
        "Young gay people carefully orchestrate the way they disclose their sexuality to friends and family.",
        "They may spend even years trying to understand how their friends will react, how their mothers and fathers and siblings and so on will react and in a sense create a safety net for themselves, which may be somewhat fragile, or it may not.",
        "In this situation, we have someone who is thrown into what might be considered a spider's net, actually, that's not even of his own making.",
        "And the dangers that are there are somewhat unpredictable, to some degree.",
        "Nothing good may necessarily happen except later on, as Blake's case demonstrates, that some resilience can come from this and tremendous growth, and the dealing with one's sexuality can certainly be accelerated.",
        "But the reality of it is we all want the control of our own lives.",
        "And young people - and we know younger and younger people are coming out and dealing with their sexuality - certainly are in a much more fragile situation in terms of having that control taken away from them.",
        "And in speaking with Larry Gross, he was telling us that indeed, this is happening more frequently because, well, gays, lesbians, transgendered, are more a part of our lives.",
        "Is this happening more frequently, do you think?",
        "Mr.",
        "D'AUGELLI: Oh, absolutely, and it is happening, as Larry said, at an earlier age.",
        "We find people on average feel that they're different in some ways at about age eight and then start to label themselves as not heterosexual, you know, at age 14, 15, 16.",
        "Now, they don't tell anybody else, if they choose to tell, until about 16.",
        "But not everybody even tells at 16.",
        "Those are the rare people who are out in high school.",
        "So, you know, Blake's being out or being outed was quite unusual in a certain statistical sense.",
        "Well, that was seven years ago, so maybe that was a little bit different then.",
        "Larry Gross, when we come back from a short break, we're also going to be talking about circumstances when people feel justified to out somebody.",
        "Indeed, in Blake's case, the person who did it maliciously apologized to him later, and indeed, that may be the situation.",
        "But nevertheless, there are some people, particularly within the gay community, who in some circumstances argue this is an important thing to do.",
        "So stay with us.",
        "We'll talk about that, as well.",
        "Larry Gross, the author of \"\"Contested Closets: The Politics and Ethics of Outing\"\"; also with us is Tony D'Augelli - is the professor of human development and associate dean of undergraduate programs and outreach at Penn State University.",

        "Sometimes it's malicious, sometimes political, sometimes even inadvertent, and thanks to those of you who have shared your stories with us thus far.",

        "And Larry Gross, we were mentioning just before the break, there are some gay activists who say if you're in the closet and actively working to promote anti-gay agenda, you deserve to be outed.",
        "That's correct.",
        "The history of this actually goes back to the very beginning of the gay movement, which was at the start of the 19th century, particularly in Germany.",
        "And the phrase that was used there, when they said they would not out, was that they wouldn't take the path over corpses.",
        "And since that time, I've spent the last 20 years as a kind of successful artist, I guess, but it radically changed my life and my view of a lot of things.",
        "But in fact, there's been a tension and a pressure, as long as there's been a gay movement, that people who are public figures, and let me underscore that.",
        "The political outing that has cropped up from time to time has always focused on public figures.",
        "There has never been a political argument for outing, say, high school students or college freshmen, or gym teachers or anyone else who is, literally, a private citizen."

        "But the argument has been made that public figures have an obligation to come out, and this really takes two forms.",
        "One form, and the most obvious one, and I think the one you're referring to, is hypocrites.",
        "And I think there's been wide agreement among gay activists and I think in the community and certainly in the media that people whose public lives are visibly and actively anti-gay but whose private lives are secretly gay, should be exposed as we expose all kinds of hypocrisy.",
        "I think, in general, there's a view that one's private life is not necessarily protected when it is at odds with one's public posturing or one's public pronouncements.",
        "So exposing the secret sexual activity of people who are publicly anti-gay I think has been relatively non-controversial.",
        "Lately, it's happened particularly in the case of ministers, of anti-gay clergy.",
        "Most recently Bishop Eddie Long in Atlanta has been accused of secret homosexuality, along with his public homophobia.",
        "Before that, Ted Haggard in Colorado, and there have been lots of others or members of Congress, other politicians, whose public lives and whose private lives are in contradiction.",
        "So that's one kind.",
        "The second kind that is a lot more controversial is the question of what you might call community obligation.",
        "And that is to say that if you are gay, you are a member of a community, which certainly not everybody accepts; but as a member of that community, you have an obligation to the community, and being public, as a role model if you like, to demonstrate that people can be openly gay in all walks of life, including people who everyone looks up to, they have an obligation to come out.",
        "That is the more controversial part of the outing debate.",
        "And Larry Gross, important to recognize that in communities like a university or a college, the idea of who's a public figure and who is not can be, well, questionable.",
        "Absolutely, and at the University of Southern California, where I am right now, every year on National Coming Out Day, which is today, the student newspaper, the Daily Trojan, publishes what they call the out list.",
        "And this is a list of faculty, of members of the administration, of students, of others, who want it to be known that they're out so that students see that there are lots of gay people around them.",
        "There are many other schools, many other universities and certainly high schools, where that kind of list would be unthinkable."

        "Tony D'Augelli, does that happen at Penn State?",
        "Mr.",
        "D'AUGELLI: Well, we have an online list of faculty, staff, who are part of what we call an LGBT network of support, so that anyone can go on the Web and look through various departments of the university and find faculty or staff that are willing to sit and chat with the student, or anyone really, who'd like to stop by.",

        "And one of the images got picked up by a national dance magazine, and in that, the model talks about how nervous she was, but had felt much better because the photographer was gay.",
        "And it was my mother who called me and read it and joked with me, that it wasn't good enough to come to her, but I had to come out nationally in a men's magazine.",
        "And from that time, we were able to talk and to joke about, you know, all the stress that it had caused earlier in our relationship.",
        "And yeah, so, inadvertently, I got outed nationally by a model, and it helped my family tremendously.",
        "And inadvertent, her motives were not malicious at all.",

        "And from then, my relationship deteriorated within a month or so.",
        "It wasn't - I wasn't fired for being gay, but I was fired eventually for various performance-related things, which were kind of trumped up because previously, I'd been pretty successful and promoted.",
        "And you attribute this strictly to somebody who was willing to do this so that they could compete better in the corporate ladder?",
        "Yes, I was kind of in the sales and marketing thing, where quotas and things are kind of important.",

        "So I guess it turned out for the best, but it's a terribly cruel thing to do.",
        "Terribly cruel.",
