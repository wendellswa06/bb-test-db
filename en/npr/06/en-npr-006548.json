        "D'AUGELLI: I think so in most situations.",
        "You know, you have two examples here of a situation where someone is outed, and there's a quite positive consequence within the family, and we know how critical family support is for these issues.",
        "On the other hand, we have somebody who's outed in the world of work for malicious reasons and that has a profound impact on his life in ways that are really hard to know in certain ways but clearly at this point seem very positive.",
        "So it's the unpredictability of what will happen to you when people find out that's the difficult part.",
        "And it's essentially, you know, loss of friends, we found, in a number of studies is a very, very powerful variable predicting the degree of which mental health is compromised in young gay people.",
        "And losing friends happens in lots of ways, and losing family, as well.",
        "And there's a cascading effect.",
        "Just because one member of your family knows and says he or she won't tell doesn't mean that's true or that others won't find out, and as in the case of the second man, people in the industry will find out.",
        "So it's a spreading effect of unknown in particular and possibly fear.",
        "And Larry Gross, I guess in the '80s, it may have depended upon where he was as to whether he would have been able to sue for discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.",
        "That's true, but that hasn't changed.",
        "There are still many states in this country where there is no protection at all.",
        "There has been something called the employment non-discrimination act stalled in Congress for many years.",
        "And there are many states in this country, and you could probably figure out, or your listeners can, which ones they are, where there is absolutely no recourse.",
        "Senator DeMint from South Carolina, I believe...",
        "Mm-hmm.",
        "...recently said that he believes that homosexuals should not be allowed to teach.",
        "This is a throwback to Senator Briggs in California, who attempted to have that view that homosexuality precluded - you know, you couldn't be a teacher if you are homosexual, passed in a referendum in California.",

        "But it's very discouraging to see Senator DeMint reviving the notion that gay teachers should be fired in the 21st century, although it's a different state.",
        "So there is still no legal protection against discrimination on jobs, housing, public accommodations and so forth in many states in this country.",

        "While it pretty has always gone well for me, I know I could be outed to others I would rather not find out right now.",

        "Unlike your topic today, I'm very active in promoting GLBT rights as a presumed ally.",

        "I wanted to get back a bit to what Larry mentioned before, the issue of community obligation.",
        "I think there's a tendency among certainly younger gay community folks to feel that one needs to be out under almost any conditions.",
        "And if one is not, you know, you're sort of betraying the tribe.",
        "And, you know, my view of all that is that one needs to be extremely careful with these sorts of statements and to realize that you can't really live somebody else's life.",
        "The only reason - the only way you can do that is if you're willing to go with the person and follow the person and stay with the person where all the person - people in a person's life can react.",
        "But, oftentimes, counseling professionals have sort of a view that being out is good.",
        "Well, generally, it is, but you can't impose that on every single case by any means.",
        "In fact, it's quite dangerous.",
        "So, you know, you need to simply be sure that the safety net is there.",
        "And that's on a personal level as well as if you're working with people in a more professional way.",
