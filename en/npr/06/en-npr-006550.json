        "Let's get Lourdes Garcia-Navarro in on the conversation now.",
        "As Chavez has been trying to position himself as the heir to Fidel Castro, in Mexico you've got President Felipe Calderon, a conservative free market champion, and recently, there were words between the two leaders.",
        "Lourdes, can you tell us a little more about that flap?",
        "Yeah.",
        "Things were bound to head in this direction.",
        "You couldn't have two men who are more ideologically different.",
        "Still, Calderon began his term, it has to be said, by saying that he wanted rapprochement with Caracas after years of frosty relations.",
        "You have to remember, former President Vicente Fox and Chavez at one point withdrew their respective ambassadors from each other's countries.",
        "So this isn't a new tension.",
        "But on Calderon's recent trip to Europe to drum up investment for Mexico, he said that Mexico is a safer place to invest than Venezuela, for example, because Mexico is not going to nationalize industries.",
        "And while that did set off a firestorm in Caracas - Chavez said that Mexican policies are what are sending people north and why Mexico is so poor, etc. - it will be interesting to see how this proceeds.",
        "The United States would certainly like to see more robust repudiation of Chavez coming from within Latin America and I think it remains to be seen whether Calderon will do the U.S.'s bidding on this.",
        "Now, Calderon himself has been making a lot of news.",
        "He was just inaugurated in December after a bitter election battle.",
        "What he has been doing?",
        "How has he been trying to assert his authority?",
        "Well, Calderon immediately tried to assert his authority by tackling the drug gangs.",
        "This is a really big issue here.",
        "He's taking a page out of Columbia's book by using extraditions to the U.S.",
        "He's using the military to move into areas with the local and state authorities have been either ineffective, cowed or corrupt.",
        "This is a man, as you said, who came to power after a bitterly contested election and a very slim margin of victory.",
        "So fighting drug crime, which soared under his predecessor, is something that he's doing to try and stamp his authority immediately.",
        "There is a big section of the Mexican electorate that is still unhappy with Calderon.",
        "And they were out protesting again this week, protesting the high price of corn and their food staple, tortillas.",
        "How serious a challenge is this to President Calderon?",
        "It's quite a serious challenge.",
        "You've got to understand that Mexicans eat up to two pounds of tortillas a day.",
        "When workers take a break at lunch they go to the tortillaria and buy half a kilo or a pound for their mid-day meal.",
        "It's a staple.",
        "So when prices go up, it really affects people.",
        "Fifty percent of Mexicans live on less than $4 a day.",
        "Spending 75 cents for two pounds of tortillas, which is where prices stand right now, is a lot of money.",
        "I went to talk to people waiting in line at a tortilla shop yesterday and they were all blaming the government.",
        "It's the easiest target.",
        "And the left, which lost the presidential elections, has been using this issue to great advantage, saying it shows Calderon's callousness and indifference to the working classes.",
        "The union staged a march in Mexico City this week.",
        "They say this wouldn't have happened if Mexico wasn't importing about a quarter of its corn from the United States.",
        "They blame the North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, for destroying the Mexican countryside.",
        "Under NAFTA, it has to be said, Mexico shed about thirty percent of its farm jobs.",
        "So it's highlighted a lot of issues here that people feel very strongly about, and it is really causing some problems with Calderon and his opposition is flexing its muscles over this issue.",
        "NPR's Lourdes Garcia Navarro and Juan Forero.",
        "Thank you both.",
        "Thanks."

        "Voting was extended in a few locations due to problems with some voting equipment.",
        "Ted Widener of Lincoln, Nebraska, writes, \"\"After the 1980 election results, hadn't news outlets committed to keeping predictions quiet until the polls closed?",
        "I understand NPR is not the only source of this information, but do you have to be part of the problem?",
        "On other election issues, lots of you wrote in to point out that the election results nationwide went against Karl Rove's forecast.",
        "In an interview with our colleague Robert Siegel, Rove said that the polling he was looking at and the math he was doing indicated that Republicans would keep both houses of Congress.",
        "This comment comes from Scott Orizu(ph) of Bakersfield, California.",
        "He writes, \"\"Rove bragged about having the math and access to secret opinion polls that neither Robert nor the Democrats had.",
        "Polls, crystal balls or consulting Republican numerologists never replace getting out in the real world.",
        "My wife teaches her third-graders to always check their math.",
        "Karl Rove should get out of those white walls and speak to the people, who are more than just poll numbers.",
        "A story we did about the helium shortage, and yes, there is apparently a helium shortage in the United States, irked a few listeners.",
        "Both Melissa and I got to experience a little helium inhalation during the course of a story, and Theresa Walton of Marshalltown, Iowa, was not amused.",
        "She writes, \"\"Stop.",
        "No one should inhale helium, even though it makes your voice sound funny.",
        "It can cause lung damage.",
        "Please, tell the listeners that inhaling helium is dangerous.",
        "Finally, response to my conversation with voiceover artists Scott Sanders and Dennis Steele.",
        "They both do negative political ads on TV and radio, and as you may have heard, we had them read some nursery rhymes for us."
