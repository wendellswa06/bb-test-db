        "There were angry letters, late night jokes on Jay Leno, and, in the end, the guy lost his job.",
        "The core of the issue seemed to be that it was wrong for a company to charge different prices for the exact same good, but as economist Richard Thaler(ph) points out, this wasn't the first time that an industry decided to charge different amounts for the exact same thing.",
        "The airlines are probably the most sophisticated at adopting lots of different ways of charging different people very different prices for identical services.",
        "And consumers have gotten used to it.",
        "So why do consumers accept discriminatory pricing from airlines, but not beverage companies?",
        "Why are they mad about paying $3 for a gallon of gas, when they pay at least that amount for a cup of coffee?",
        "If you want answers to these questions, it's wise to consult someone practiced in consumer psychology.",
        "Someone like THALER from the University of Chicago, who patiently explains one of the central tenets of the discipline: how a consumer feels about paying a certain price has relatively little to do with the actual value of that good to the customer.",
        "It's not so much what you're getting for it, it's whether I think I got a good deal.",
        "And that's the emotional part and the other part isn't so important.",
        "Let me repeat that because it's not entirely rational.",
        "Thaler is saying that the actual value of a good is often less important to consumers than the way the transaction to procure that good went down.",
        "Consider this example from consumer psychologist, Donald Lichtenstein, of the University of Colorado.",
        "A wife comes home with a punch bowl, and she's all excited.",

        "The husband is looking at the absolute value of the good.",

        "what they usually pay for the product, how much competitors are charging.",
        "But when prices become unusually high, like gas prices are now, consumers begin to look for, what Lichtenstein calls, attributions.",
        "When people see this big price difference we're paying over what we paid in the past, it naturally sends them into making attributions.",
        "Why is this the way it is?",
        "And, as Lichtenstein points out, in the current situation, the explanation that's getting the most air time isn't something liable to cool public anger.",
        "The politicians are saying, you know, we're going to look into price gouging, price gouging, price gouging.",
        "It's a very affect-ladened term, price gouging.",
        "And so they have their ready-made attribution right now.",
        "It's not fair.",
        "In fact, according to Lichtenstein, research shows consumers usually favor explanations that blame others.",
