        "Hi.",
        "Can you start by explaining what this family ties category means for asylum claims?",
        "We often hear about people seeking asylum because of their religious beliefs or political affiliation or race.",
        "What is this category of family ties?",
        "Yes.",
        "So basically, when you apply for asylum, you need to show that the persecution - so the harm that you suffer - was on account of one of the protected grounds.",
        "And one of these protected grounds is particular social group, and family has been recognized as a particular social group over the years - has been since 1985.",
        "And the federal court of appeals had recognized that.",
        "And that is just one of the elements.",
        "Everyone has a family.",
        "You need to show that the harm was on account of that family membership.",
        "So this family group status had been a protected category for more than 30 years.",
        "On Monday, the attorney general announced that it would no longer be.",
        "And then Tuesday, the day after - just yesterday - you were in immigration court, representing a client who planned to make an asylum claim based on family ties.",
        "First, tell me about that case.",
        "And then what actually happened when you were in court yesterday?",
        "So I cannot talk specifically about the case because this is still ongoing...",
        "I understand.",
        "But one of our legal arguments is that my client suffered persecution on account of her relationship with one of her family members.",
        "It was the gang wanted to harm her because of her relationship with some of her members of her family.",
        "And we lost yesterday.",
        "We don't know the exact reasons.",
        "But based on the line of questionings that the judge was asking my client, it seems that he is pretty much seeing that family as a particular social group has changed per the attorney general decision on Monday, which is very problematic because it's ignoring years of years of precedent recognizing family as a particular social group.",
        "Let me ask you.",
        "A lot of people suffer all kinds of harm for all kinds of reasons, and asylum has always been limited to certain groups.",
        "Not everybody who is suffering death threats will be granted asylum."

        "Why do you think it's so important that one of those groups include family status?",
        "So that's a good question.",
        "This is international treaty, right?",
        "For human rights purposes, someone who is suffering persecution based on their race or their religion, that's just such a human right that these people should be protected.",
        "But then people who are homosexuals or transgender or people who have testified in court, they're not protected in many, many, many countries around the world.",
        "So with this particular social group definition, we can include small groups of people.",
        "And that's why family has been recognized under the law for many years because people suffers in many places because of their family membership.",
        "When you heard about this policy change on Monday, knowing that you had a case in court on Tuesday where you were going to try to make an argument of family membership, what went through your head?",
        "It's just, like, bad luck.",
        "It's just - every day, something can happen with this administration.",
        "Every day, we come to the office, and we find that another decision was made or that there's another new policy that the president is trying to do in another country to try to affect asylum-seekers.",
        "So it's just - if this hearing would have been two days ago, the outcome might have been different.",
        "And this is just - when we are talking about someone's life, it's devastating.",
        "Andrea Lino is a staff attorney at the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in Seattle.",
        "Thank you for speaking with us today.",
        "Thank you, Ari.",
        "Yeah, there's been a whole series of polls, but the bottom line is he's risen maybe two or three points, because he doesn't necessarily have the ability to make himself appear popular, but he can shift the subject of discussion, and when it's on security and terror, it does help Republicans."

        "I still think it's a Democrat year.",
        "They still have, overall, an advantage, but if you look at some individual Senate races, I'm struck by some buoyancy in the Republican Party in weird place like New Jersey and even Maryland - pretty strong Republican candidates.",
        "And in other states where they should - you think they'd be losing, in Ohio, Missouri, they're pretty much dead even.",
        "So it's still a Democratic year, but not as bad as it was for the Republicans two weeks ago.",
        "I think it wasn't too long ago in that chair you told me that the president was radioactive - was your word - out on the trail.",
        "Is that still the case?",
        "That's true in blue America and that's why I still the Democrats will take the House, because it's in races in Connecticut, New York state.",
        "In those sorts of states, in the House races, which are a little less national, then I think Republicans will be suffering.",
        "E.J.",
        "Dionne, it does seem that some people are now not as sure as they might have been a few weeks ago about Democrats taking the House, as David Brooks just said.",
        "What do you think?",
        "Well, I actually agree with David that it is fundamentally a Democratic year still, but I think the Republicans are a lot better off - or at least better off - today than they were a month ago.",
        "A month ago, they were looking at absolute catastrophe, so we're speaking relatively here.",
        "There were more voters saying that they're concerned about terror in relative terms to Iraq.",
        "Iraq has gone up, but terror has gone up more.",
        "So that's good for the Republicans, and attitudes toward the economy are somewhat better than they were a month ago.",
        "In the New York Times poll, the New York Times/CBS poll, a few months back, people were saying by four to one that the economy was getting worse.",
        "Now it's only two to one.",
        "Now that's still bad for Republicans, but the ground is a little softer.",
        "Is it something as basic - you know, I was driving to work this morning.",
        "Gas prices at my local gas station, $2.55 a gallon.",
        "A couple week ago it was over $3.",
        "I mean, it's something as basic as that.",
        "Yeah, we analyze macroeconomic indicators and GDP and all this stuff.",
        "People see gas at $2 a gallon - that's good.",
        "You know, they respond to their own lives.",
        "Who knew that $2.60 or $2.80 gas would help a party in power, but it does.",
        "I was speaking this week to a very smart Republican pollster called David Winston, and he said a few months ago, we'd give out good economic numbers, and then people would drive in the gas station and say what are you talking about?",
        "And so I think actually, you've got an oil state president who is rooting for gas prices coming down because I do think that is having a material effect, although the Democrats still in most of these polls have a 10 or 15 point lead in the race for the House.",
        "Okay, E.J.",
