        "Yeah.",
        "Well, I wanted to do this just for myself at first, just to release some pathos.",
        "And little did I know it would start - it would morph into this.",
        "It's evolved - now it's part of my whole demeanor.",
        "Now, when slaves left the South and found freedom out West, how did they navigate in that world?",

        "It is.",

        "Oh.",
        "You're not going to give me just a little sample are you?",
        "And the Democrats I talked to say they really don't want a shutdown.",
        "Some say they're worried that shutting down the government would just come off really terribly in places like North Dakota, Indiana and Missouri where Democrats are fighting very hard to hold onto Senate seats.",
        "And so they are trying to come up with some way that they can appear very strong on this immigration issue without actually having to get to the point of a shutdown.",
        "Seems like a pretty fine line there.",
        "(Laughter) Yeah."

        "Are Republicans open to this idea of a short spending bill?",
        "The majority of them are refusing to say, and that's in part because this is a negotiating tactic.",
        "It wouldn't be very helpful for them if they wanted to get this longer-term spending bill to just throw up their hands and say, sure, we'll do it for a shorter amount of time.",
        "But you know, there are still options out there, and they - you know, they don't want a shutdown.",
        "Nobody wants a shutdown.",
        "Those of us who are not in Washington - I wonder if you could just sort of describe what it's been like on Capitol Hill today.",

        "OK.",
        "So the deputies to the leaders in the House and the Senate, both Democrats and Republicans, met today trying to reach an agreement on immigration.",

        "He also blamed Trump just two days ago.",

        "(SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE)",
        "What I want to see is an outcome, and an outcome involves the signature of the president of the United States.",
        "And Democrats would agree with him there.",
        "They say that this is all because the president is not trustworthy, and they don't know what kind of deal they could strike with other people here in the Capitol that the president will accept.",
        "And they point to that meeting - that profanity-laden meeting last week where...",
        "Right.",
        "...He shot down an agreement as evidence that the president won't exactly sign anything like he said he would.",
        "Right.",
        "So what next?",
        "I mean, is this shutdown threat more serious than it was this morning?",
        "It certainly is.",
        "We are roughly eight hours away from a shutdown, and that is very, very close.",
        "And the Senate will have to vote at some point.",
        "They have this short-term spending bill available that they could be voting on, but they haven't done it yet.",
        "The other thing that we should keep an eye on, though, is that the House reversed course and decided to tell their members to stay in town.",
        "That gives them an option that if a short-term is what they need to do, they could have a vote, and they could theoretically bring everybody back and vote at the very last minute.",
        "Something I'm sure we will continue to talk about.",
        "(Laughter)."

        "But don't you wonder why your eyes - as you're feeling the walls with your hands, that there are some animals that are able to see in the dark and that they only come out at night?",

        "First of all, how do we see?",
        "What happens in our eyes?",
        "Well, I think the basic function of the eyes, that there's a lens in front of it that images whatever's on the outside onto the back of the eye.",
        "And basically, lining the back of the eye is a very thin tissue, which is called the retina.",
        "And in that retina there are cells that convert light into electrical signals that are then sent on through the optic nerve to the brain where we process that.",
        "And what's different about nocturnal animals?",
        "Why can they see better than we can?"

        "Right.",
        "What we found now is there are some very striking change in the nuclear architecture of some of the cells that are residing within the retina.",
        "I think to understand that a bit better, we need to take a kind of a step back again.",
        "And they found that in this particular type of nuclei, the rod photoreceptor cells, the chromatin structure that I've just described -with heterochromatin in the outside and the euchromatin on the inside -it's completely turned upside down.",
        "The euchromatin is suddenly on the outside, and the heterochromatin is on the inside.",
        "I found that a lot of homesteaders and white ranchers really were brave.",
        "They were brave.",
        "And no one really talks about that heroism.",
        "I sing about that in the next series of songs that I'm writing for the - the saga's three parts.",
        "And I sing about that because it was an act called the Fugitive Slave Act which Congress passed which stated if you as a white landowner, or rancher, harbored a runaway slave, you could not only be put into jail but your property could be taken and auctioned off.",
        "So it was pretty brave for them to take these free slaves in.",
        "So there was a lot of open arms for them out there.",
        "Were you surprised at all at anything that you learned about the role of African Americans in conquering the Western frontier?",
        "The main thing where I was surprised was how it was smothered in history books, you know, for so long.",
        "It really was.",
        "It was conscious effort in mainstream America at the time to really not depict the story of these people.",
        "And I'm - and I'm trying to figure out why, and I can't get any clear answers, so obviously I'm - it's up to my own devices to come up with it, which is why I've written this story.",
        "And I feel that there needs to be something in history that we can look at other than just picking cotton and being porters and mammies.",
        "Because I feel that the children now, Generation X, needs to see that there was a noble part that we played in the conquering of this country.",
        "Now this album has been called a song cycle.",

        "Sure.",
