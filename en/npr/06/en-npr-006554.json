        "Rightly so, you know, because technically you have to be efficient to play your instrument and your craft.",
        "The country fold, the Americana fold, the folk, the root music, you have to be proficient in storytelling and bringing to the table what you are as a person and what you've lived through.",

        "By the time Lanza got to high school, whether he was learning in school or at home in isolation, administrators had one narrow academic goal - keep moving forward.",
