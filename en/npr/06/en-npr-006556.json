        "The U.S., you know, had a huge list of sanctions on Libya, as did the U.N., by the way.",
        "And the Bush Administration started lifting those sanctions, the ones on the oil sector, a couple of years ago to allow some business to resume.",
        "Today's announcement is a culmination of this approach.",
        "And the administration says it has notified Congress and, after a waiting period, will open an Embassy in Tripoli.",

        "You could just say what you are, a Nazi.",
        "You know, Uber is experimenting with the transportation of people and goods - and some very kitschy transportation too; I mean, they did Valentine's Day roses and this weird, get-a-kitten-for-an-hour kind of thing.",
        "And it could be that they really expand their wings, their fleet, you know - not to mix metaphors - in the transportation of people and goods.",
        "It could be that they go in another direction.",
        "They are backed by Google Ventures.",
        "They just made a huge partnership with AT&T so they're clearly looking for partnerships and integration and penetration.",
        "And also, Google is about moon shots right?",
        "So it's possible that they move beyond transportation itself into other kinds of goods and services.",
        "Now, besides Uber's business model, I'm really curious to see if Plouffe comes up with his own product line or startup.",
        "You know, he is a political operative who loves technology, and he used the Internet to win the 2008 campaign for Obama.",
        "And frankly, right now, there's a bunch of tech startups that are making Get Out The Vote apps and marketing to candidates in both parties.",
        "So we might see Plouffe do his stint at Uber, milk all the amazing Silicon Valley contacts and bounce to his own startup.",

        "Abraham Lincoln is not just America's greatest president.",
        "To many, his very face is an emblem of America: honest, homespun, strong and sad, haunted, brooding - and humorous.",
        "So where does some famous Yale Law School professor get off writing a novel in which President Lincoln is accused of subverting the U.S.",
        "Constitution?",
        "The Great Emancipator imprisoned critics, invoked martial law, suspend the writ of habeus corpus, and throttled the press to win the Civil War - you got a problem with that?",
        "That professor is Stephen Carter of the Yale Law School, author of the best-selling novels \"\"The Emperor of Ocean Park\"\" and \"\"Palace Council.\"\" His new novel is \"\"The Impeachment of Abraham Lincoln,\"\" and Professor Carter joins us from Yale.",
        "Thanks so much for being with us.",

        "I think Lincoln was our greatest president; I have no question about that.",
        "But at the same time, there were a lot of things that Lincoln did during his presidency in order to win the Civil War, that could be called into question.",
        "And so my idea was to write a courtroom drama that was crafted around that possibility.",
        "The path I sketch in my fiction is one possible path history might have taken.",
        "The center of your narrative is a young woman named Abigail Canner.",
        "An Oberlin graduate, she wants to be a lawyer; she comes to the nation's capital.",
        "Maybe I left out, until now, that she's African-American.",
        "How unusual would that storyline be in this period of time we're talking about - after the Civil War?",
        "It's a remarkable story.",
        "Here's Abigail; she's 21 years old when the story begins - this young, black woman who grew up in Washington; and she does want to be a lawyer.",
        "At that time, there are no female lawyers in the United States - not one.",
        "And there are maybe five or six lawyers who are black.",
        "But she conceives this idea of wanting to be a lawyer, wanting to be involved in great events.",
        "And in developing Abigail's character, part of what I had in mind is appealing to that part in all of us, when we're young, that's ambitious and fresh and innocent and excited, and thinks the world's a just and fair place.",
        "And of course, she goes out into that world and finds it's much more complex and dangerous than she imagined.",
        "Let's make this clear, too - in your storyline, the president's accusers were not the mossback conservatives of the time, but certainly considered themselves the most progressive.",
        "One of the things that we often forget about Lincoln is that he was not popular within his own party.",
        "The Republican Party of that day was the center of anti-slavery activism, and was led by highly educated men who'd fought slavery all their lives.",
        "And they saw Lincoln as this unlettered Westerner.",
        "He had no formal education.",
        "He told funny stories.",
        "He had a funny accent."

        "The case for impeachment against President Lincoln, that his critics make - I think will strike a lot of readers as pretty convincing.",
        "Could you, Professor, review it for us?",
        "Well, let me first make clear that I, myself, don't think that Lincoln should have been impeached, but if you look at the things Lincoln actually did; his administration shuttered opposition newspapers, locked up editors, court-martialed reporters at the front who wrote unfavorable stories, suspended habeas corpus, ignored court orders, declared martial law.",
        "And for Lincoln, all of this was justified by his belief that it was necessary to win the war.",
        "And that's the question, that in my novel, that the Senate has to confront.",
        "Did Lincoln have a justification for the various things he attempted to do that he said were necessary in order to win the war?",

        "You know, and I think to Americans, even people around the world, Abraham Lincoln will never be just another character.",
        "I mean, whole books have been made of jokes that he's alleged to have told people and little remarks attributed to him.",
        "Was it intimidating to write dialogue for Abraham Lincoln?",
        "Not only was it intimidating to write dialogue for Lincoln, it was enormously difficult.",
        "And I think one of the reasons that he ends up being only in about five scenes in the whole novel is precisely that I didn't want to stray too far from the record and bring the whole legion of Lincoln aficionados down on my head.",

        "I want to talk about that CPAC meeting that you mentioned earlier because interesting, they're snubbing Chris Christie, but they invited Donald Trump to speak there.",

        "In fact, he said business ties have been slow to resume, even though the U.S.",
        "eased those sanctions a couple of years ago.",
        "He said this was taken because the international community made these clear demands on Libya, and they had to do with terrorism, and that Libya responded and came into line.",
        "And by the way, a counter-terrorism expert at the State Department said that Libya has been cooperating with the U.S.",
        "in the region to go after al-Qaida-affiliated groups.",
        "So they've said that they've had a lot of cooperation with Libya on this."

        "His son, whom he's apparently grooming to take over, has been a key player.",
