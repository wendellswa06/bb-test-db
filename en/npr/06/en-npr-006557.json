        "He made some comments this week that seemed to conflict with earlier statements he's made about immigration.",
        "Well, it's not so much the comments he's made this week, it's the new book he called \"\"The Immigration Wars.\"\" And that basically is - it sounds like a little much of a flip-flop.",
        "It's not clear what he's saying exactly.",
        "In the past, unlike Mitt Romney, unlike many of the Republicans who were running for president in 2012, he said that a path to citizenship ultimately is the way, is the preferred way for the 11 million people who are here illegally in the country.",

        "After there is a recognition that if people come here illegally they have to pay a fine or do community service, make sure they don't commit any serious crimes, and over a period of time they can have legalized status that allows them to live a life of dignity but not necessarily a path to citizenship.",
        "So you think it's a kind of subtle change, you're saying?",
        "Well, it is a complete change given the fact that what he said so many times over and over about the path to citizenship.",
        "He says in his book, he says a grant of citizenship is an undeserving reward for conduct we cannot afford to encourage.",
        "And while that is not as drastic as Mitt Romney's self-deportation, it still seems to be that he's moving more and more towards I guess maybe what the Republican Party seems to stand for on immigration.",

        "Where he has to talk about other things, I tried to use the cadences that so far as I can tell, were accurate.",
        "And I did that two ways.",
        "One, was by reading accounts that other people had written over the years of their own conversations with Lincoln; the other is by reading very heavily in Lincoln's correspondence and of course his speeches to try to get the rhythm right even when I was inventing words.",
        "Professor Carter, may I ask, have you read or seen \"\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter?",

        "And apart from that, the opposition has been meeting.",
        "And first of all, they threatened to boycott tomorrow's poll, then they challenged the government and said the government had to cancel the elections last weekend that was for state governors and representatives.",
