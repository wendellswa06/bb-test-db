        "No, I didn't.",
        "OK, but anyway, shortly after he was born his family reversed the two names.",
        "And then of course Ike later married Tina Turner, and a lot of things changed after that.",

        "We spoke last week that Chris Christie is not invited to the CPAC conference, which is conservatives meeting, you know, where they meet in Washington every year.",
        "And one of the problems with Christie is that he embraced Barack Obama prior - you know, right in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.",
        "He called for the $60 billion in federal funds to repair the damage, which was horrific, which really hurt the state.",
        "And of course he also bought into the Obama Medicaid provisions, which some other Republican governors have done, even though he's an opponent of Obamacare.",

        "what planet Donald Trump is from.",
        "But he said some crazy things about birtherism, and yet there's - Donald Trump seems to be this self-promoter that just won't go away.",
        "The thought of Chris Christie, the most popular governor of the country, being shunned and Donald Trump being invited is just pretty remarkable.",
        "But that's part of the infighting that's going on in the Republican Party in the wake of their presidential defeat.",
        "Well, let's talk about another New Jersey politician.",
        "This is Democrat, Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, in the news not for a particularly good reason.",
        "Well, ultimately - I mean, he is in trouble but not for the reason, perhaps, that the Daily Caller decided.",
        "The Daily Caller is a conservative website who announced last - several months ago, I think right before the election, that he frequented prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.",
        "And some prostitutes came forward and said yes, Senator Menendez paid them money to have sex with them.",
        "And as it turned out, at least one of the three said that the whole thing is a setup, it's not real.",
        "They were convinced, they were urged to make up these stories.",
        "But so Menendez says this is absolutely not a story at all.",
        "We haven't talked about that much on TALK OF THE NATION.",
        "But there is still an ethics scandal or at least an ethics inquiry into Menendez, that he's - he paid - you know, he did things for a political donor that may have helped him make money.",
        "So Menendez is not out of the woods yet, but the prostitution story seems to be discredited.",
        "And just really briefly before the break, my favorite story of the week: former South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford asking his wife Jenny for help on his campaign - ex-wife...",
        "His ex-wife.",
        "And she said no."
